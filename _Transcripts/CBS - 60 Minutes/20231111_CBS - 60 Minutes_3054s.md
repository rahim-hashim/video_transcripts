**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [November 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo)
*  One of the reasons violence in Iraq has subsided so dramatically was a significant battle that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. forces won in Sadr City just five months ago. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=19.6s)]
*  Sadr City, part of Baghdad, is home to two million Shia and turf of the fiercely anti-American [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=23.44s)]
*  cleric Maqtada al-Sadr. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=30.16s)]
*  For years, insurgents in Iraq have been stymieing U.S. troops with homemade low-tech weapons [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=32.72s)]
*  like car bombs and improvised roadside explosives. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  But in the Battle of Sadr City, as we learned in a high-level debriefing with the U.S. commander [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=43.44s)]
*  the Americans overpowered the Shiite militias with high-tech, the most advanced, sophisticated, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=49.36s)]
*  whiz-bang hardware and software on earth, electronics, lasers, high-resolution cameras [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=56.08s)]
*  that can literally cut through the fog of war. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=63.24s)]
*  When we were in Iraq to interview the new commanding general, Ray Odierno, we went with [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=68.0s)]
*  he surveyed the former battlefield through neighborhoods now pacified and into a market [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=73.48s)]
*  returning to life. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=79.72s)]
*  At his side was the brigade commander who led the battle here, Colonel John Hort. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=81.72s)]
*  This was some of the heaviest fighting that we had experienced during our two months in [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=86.84s)]
*  Sadr City. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  Standing there or any place in Sadr City could not have been done just five months ago. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  This was off limits to Americans. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=98.56s)]
*  For years the fiery cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and his Shiite militia control the streets. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=101.2s)]
*  Last March they began using the neighborhood as a launching pad to lob rockets into the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=108.84s)]
*  nearby Green Zone, the seat of the Iraqi government and site of the U.S. Embassy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=114.0s)]
*  Not just one or two, but we're talking 20 to 30 rocket attacks coming out of Sadr City. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=119.0s)]
*  Colonel Hort gave General Odierno his first briefing on the battle and we were invited [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=125.0s)]
*  to sit in. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=130.24s)]
*  It's rare that reporters can videotape sessions like this one. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=131.72s)]
*  We were asked to turn our cameras off only once and were allowed to broadcast only a [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=135.96s)]
*  few slides that were later declassified for us like this one. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  And you can kind of see kind of some of the locations they were coming out of throughout [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  all of Sadr City against the Green Zone. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=149.4s)]
*  The U.S. military had wanted to mount an attack, but Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki balked [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  for a year because the militias are Shiites like him and that made a decision to fight [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=159.12s)]
*  them politically risky. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=164.68s)]
*  But you waited for him. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=166.28s)]
*  It was his decision. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=168.28s)]
*  His decision to give you the go ahead. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=169.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=172.72s)]
*  I think what he finally realized were that the militias that had safe havens in Sadr [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=173.72s)]
*  City were really trying to destabilize the government of Iraq and he realized that it [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=178.76s)]
*  would add instability to his own government. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=184.68s)]
*  Once Maliki gave the go ahead, a U.S. striker battalion went in, but they confronted a steady [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=187.68s)]
*  stream of militia reinforcements. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=193.84s)]
*  Every day it was 20, 30, 40 new guys that were coming down to fight. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=196.24s)]
*  So Hort and his men had to do something to keep them out. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=200.84s)]
*  They decided to build a wall, a barrier straight across Sadr City. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=204.84s)]
*  It would also create a buffer zone wide enough to prevent the militia rockets from reaching [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=210.72s)]
*  the Green Zone. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=215.52s)]
*  To build the wall, Colonel Hort's trolley company began putting up massive T-shaped [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=217.1s)]
*  concrete slabs. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=222.29999999999998s)]
*  Fighting erupted almost immediately as sniper fire came in from every direction. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=225.06s)]
*  Trolley company retaliated with massive tank fire. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=233.1s)]
*  We fired 800 tank rounds in this fight. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=237.44s)]
*  We haven't fired that many tank rounds since the start of the war. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=239.54s)]
*  Colonel Hort said the building of the so-called T-wall became a magnet for every bad guy in [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=242.74s)]
*  Sadr City. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=247.98000000000002s)]
*  This was one of the most intense engagements in the entire war. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=249.62s)]
*  Yet even as the battle raged, the wall went up. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=253.62s)]
*  It was literally concrete barrier by concrete barrier. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=257.24s)]
*  We just wasn't going out there putting up some barriers. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=261.3s)]
*  It was a fight every inch of the way. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=265.12s)]
*  Put them up under fire. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=267.12s)]
*  Guys would climb the ladders to unhook the crane chains from the wall, unarmed while [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=268.5s)]
*  people are firing at them. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=273.4s)]
*  So it was high measure. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=275.0s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Brian Eifler's team laid down cover fire while some soldiers, wide [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=276.6s)]
*  open and exposed, unhooked the chains from the crane. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=282.54s)]
*  On days when the shooting was particularly fierce, they were able to put up only eight [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=286.92s)]
*  slabs. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=291.44s)]
*  Every type of weapon system the enemy had, they tried to use against us up at the wall. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=292.88s)]
*  It was step by step by step and fighting literally every hour of the day. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=296.84s)]
*  They called in sniper teams from the elite Navy SEALs and air support, F-18 fighter jets [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=301.88s)]
*  and Apache helicopters that protected the flanks. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  But here's what really made the difference. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  An arsenal of advanced high-flying technology, UAVs, unmanned aerial vehicles with highly [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=315.32s)]
*  improved camera systems so sensitive they can see the enemy even at night through clouds [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=322.66s)]
*  and gun smoke from high up. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=329.1s)]
*  They can spot someone smoking or a weapon on someone's side. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=331.54s)]
*  And they have sensors so advanced they can hear enemy radio transmissions and pinpoint [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=335.72s)]
*  their location. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=341.48s)]
*  In 2003, we didn't have all the systems that are now available. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=342.82000000000005s)]
*  We had some, but we didn't have all the UAVs. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=348.16s)]
*  In the battle for Sadr City, they used two different UAVs. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=351.66s)]
*  One was the shadow drone, depicted here on one of Colonel Hort's slides. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  Twenty or thirty seconds after a militia team fired a rocket, the shadow locked on them, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=361.06s)]
*  shadowed them, watched them move and set up for their next shot. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=368.26000000000005s)]
*  Then an armed UAV, the Predator, was activated. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=373.3s)]
*  These are actual pictures of the battle on the streets of Sadr City. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=377.04s)]
*  As you can see, a group of militia fighters rushed to a car that had just been hit by [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=381.46000000000004s)]
*  a U.S. Hellfire missile. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=386.1s)]
*  They remove a mortar tube from the trunk and load it into a second car, which they drive [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=388.74s)]
*  through the streets to an open field. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=394.32s)]
*  At that point, the Predator locks its sight onto the vehicle and fires off another missile. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=397.70000000000005s)]
*  According to the Army, this killed two fighters inside the car and destroyed the mortar tube. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=404.5s)]
*  Or by remote control. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=411.4s)]
*  This is how Charlie Company hunted down the militia rocket teams and whittled down their numbers. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  They went from twenty to thirty man groups down to five, four, and in some cases only [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=419.52s)]
*  one or two. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=425.52s)]
*  The Predator and the Shadow were just phenomenal in their ability to see the enemy, particularly [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=426.52s)]
*  after he shot a rocket. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=433.28s)]
*  We have learned from other sources that Colonel Hort's ground troops were supported by a secret [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=435.21999999999997s)]
*  special ops unit called Task Force 17. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=440.44s)]
*  Using their own Predators, along with Iraqi undercover operatives and eavesdropping, it [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=445.04s)]
*  was able to take out some of the militia leaders who were based north of the wall, hiding among [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  the civilian population. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=456.2s)]
*  With the help of the drones and their high-powered cameras, Army commanders were able to see [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=458.76s)]
*  or map the entire theater of operations and figure out the enemy's tactics and patterns [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=464.79999999999995s)]
*  with so-called persistent surveillance. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=470.88s)]
*  In some cases we would wait four, six, even ten hours to do the engagement because we [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=474.28s)]
*  didn't want to kill the guy. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=480.91999999999996s)]
*  We wanted to go after the whole group, the company chain of command as you want to call [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=483.4s)]
*  it that, where they would actually pick up the rail, drive in their vehicle, go to another [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=488.35999999999996s)]
*  location and do an after-action review on what they did. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=492.36s)]
*  In other words, after a long skirmish, all the individual militia rocket teams would [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=496.2s)]
*  rendezvous in a large group with their leaders. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=501.24s)]
*  In this video, you can see how Colonel Hort's men would be tracking as the militia fighters [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=505.12s)]
*  went to a set location for a battle assessment and their new assignments. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=510.04s)]
*  So once they got to that site, that's when we would do the engagement. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=515.92s)]
*  So that took six, eight, ten hours to wait and that's what Predator allowed us to do. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=519.16s)]
*  It truly preyed on the enemy. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=522.8399999999999s)]
*  Can I ask a bit, we had no idea. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=525.8399999999999s)]
*  How far away? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=529.24s)]
*  Predator's about, flies about 10,000 feet. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=530.24s)]
*  Yes sir. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=533.0s)]
*  It's a UAV. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=534.0s)]
*  And no noise. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=535.0s)]
*  It's so high up they can't hear. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=536.0s)]
*  Sometimes they can but it's pretty hard. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=539.56s)]
*  It's very difficult. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=541.36s)]
*  Can't hear anything. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=542.36s)]
*  This was the first time UAVs were used this way at the brigade level, allowing soldiers [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=543.48s)]
*  on the ground to manage and synchronize the information themselves. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=548.84s)]
*  They call it find, fix and finish. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=553.36s)]
*  All of this was pushed down to the brigade commander and used in this fight. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=557.36s)]
*  We primarily focused north against the rocket teams. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=561.8000000000001s)]
*  Colonel Hort and his men were able to watch in real time as the enemy planted over 300 [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=565.9200000000001s)]
*  armor-piercing roadside bombs or IEDs. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=572.4200000000001s)]
*  And so they made the decision early in the battle to use tanks and Bradleys fortified [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=576.36s)]
*  with thick reactive tiles. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=581.3199999999999s)]
*  They were so effective, said Colonel Hort, that even while they actually struck 120 IEDs, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=583.72s)]
*  the crews were all protected. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=590.38s)]
*  It went from literally 60 attacks down to three or four attacks. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=592.68s)]
*  And that was because... [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm telling you, a day, a week or... [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=598.4399999999999s)]
*  60 attacks a day. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=600.4399999999999s)]
*  So the Battle of Sadr City was won with a combination of high-tech and no-tech, lasers [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=601.7s)]
*  and electronic eyes in the sky and cement. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=607.88s)]
*  Over the course of the fighting that lasted eight weeks, the number of U.S. troops grew [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=613.0600000000001s)]
*  from 700 to 2,000 up against roughly 4,000. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=617.7s)]
*  An estimated 700 of the militia fighters were killed. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=623.0200000000001s)]
*  Six Americans died. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=626.7s)]
*  After the end in May, Colonel Hort says as many as 40 of the militia leaders fled and [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=629.86s)]
*  a ceasefire was negotiated. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=635.86s)]
*  You know, it was my opinion at the brigade level that the ceasefire was declared because [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=637.66s)]
*  they really didn't have a whole lot left to throw at us. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=643.1s)]
*  By the end of the battle, the T-wall was finally finished. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=646.52s)]
*  It's 4,000 meters, so close to two miles in terms of where the wall started and finished. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=650.58s)]
*  That's just the exact width of Sadr City. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=655.54s)]
*  It seals off about a quarter of Sadr City, and it's been beautified, with local artists [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=658.02s)]
*  painting murals of peaceful, happy scenes that have to be approved by the U.S. Army. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=663.9399999999999s)]
*  To get from one side of the wall to the other, the locals have to go through entry points. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=670.12s)]
*  Checkpoints, they have to be checked to go back and forth? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=675.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=678.34s)]
*  But it's easy. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=679.34s)]
*  It's usually just showing of an ID, but it is a checkpoint. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=680.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=683.54s)]
*  And that's to limit the freedom of movement of the insurgents, for the most part. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=684.54s)]
*  Merchants and traders are back in business here. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=692.8199999999999s)]
*  This is a wholesale market in Sadr City, where trucks deliver fresh produce from the countryside [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=696.06s)]
*  every day now. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=701.5s)]
*  The militias used to shake down the vendors. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=703.3s)]
*  That's over. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=706.5799999999999s)]
*  But still, the local businessmen are not happy about the wall. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=707.68s)]
*  Tell me about the T-wall. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=711.26s)]
*  They feel that they're cut off from the other side, which is affecting their businesses. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=713.46s)]
*  And you can tell them. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=724.86s)]
*  I think when we're able to get more security forces over time, we will take the T-walls [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=725.86s)]
*  down. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=730.26s)]
*  Yet, local citizens are providing intelligence, solid tips that have led to the capture of [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=731.26s)]
*  weapons caches, IED caches. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=737.1800000000001s)]
*  But General Odierno says the situation is fragile. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=740.42s)]
*  You eliminate the safe haven, and now we can start to build. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=743.62s)]
*  But it takes time. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=748.18s)]
*  I mean, that's the issue. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=749.18s)]
*  It just takes time. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=750.18s)]
*  Many of the fighters who survived, the general told us, fled to Iran and Syria to try and [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=751.9s)]
*  regenerate. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=757.62s)]
*  The idea, he says, is to create a neighborhood that doesn't want them back. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=759.04s)]
*  If the United States can win in Afghanistan, it'll be thanks to the privates and corporals [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=771.42s)]
*  who are now being asked to turn around an eight-year war with a brand new strategy. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=781.24s)]
*  We saw how tough it is when we spent three weeks with the 2nd Battalion of the 8th Marine [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=786.6999999999999s)]
*  Regiment, part of the 21,000 reinforcements ordered over the last several months by President [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=791.9399999999999s)]
*  Obama. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=797.6999999999999s)]
*  The new plan sounds simple. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=798.98s)]
*  Separate the enemy from the people, then convince the Afghans to support their government. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=801.6600000000001s)]
*  But it requires more forces, more time, and more risk. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=806.7800000000001s)]
*  While the president is wrestling with whether to send up to 40,000 more troops, we joined [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=811.12s)]
*  with the battalion's Company G, Golf Company, which was taking the highest casualties in [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=816.3000000000001s)]
*  the Taliban homeland. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=821.94s)]
*  In September, the men of Golf Company assembled for roll call in their combat outpost. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=824.3s)]
*  Lance Corporal Jonathan F. Stroud. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=833.74s)]

*  This was the role of the dead. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=848.42s)]
*  Lance Corporal Dennis J. Burl. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=850.98s)]
*  Lance Corporal Javier Overa. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=856.34s)]
*  The Company's 200 Marines paused for a battlefield memorial for the seven they call brothers, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=859.4200000000001s)]
*  killed in action. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=865.7s)]
*  This was Golf Company in July, pushing into part of Afghanistan never occupied by U.S. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=871.54s)]
*  troops. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=876.94s)]
*  They were ambushed repeatedly by the Taliban, the enemy that carries the name of the fundamentalist [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=877.94s)]
*  Islamic government overthrown by the U.S. invasion after 9-11. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=882.9000000000001s)]

*  Taliban is a catchall for a collection of tribes and warlords. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=890.74s)]
*  Some are religious extremists, some are drug traffickers, and in Golf's area, many are [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=895.0400000000001s)]
*  locals fighting for money. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=900.34s)]

*  It's a strange twist of history that Golf Company's area used to be called Little America. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=908.18s)]
*  In the 1950s, a massive U.S. foreign aid project dug the canals that now feed half of the world's [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=915.02s)]
*  heroin poppies and shoulder-high marijuana, both prime sources of Taliban cash. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=922.18s)]
*  Ask them if they heard the rocket shot from out here earlier. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=928.38s)]
*  Golf Company covers just a few square miles. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=932.12s)]
*  The job is to push the Taliban out and stay in place. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=935.32s)]
*  Second Lieutenant Dan O'Hara from Chicago is a platoon leader. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=940.52s)]
*  Do they know that we've been shot at from this compound before? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=944.12s)]
*  It's his first combat tour. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=947.6s)]
*  Two of his Marines have been killed. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=949.64s)]
*  You know, I wonder how you know the enemy from the citizens around here. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=952.12s)]
*  For the most part, you don't until they start shooting at you. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=957.8000000000001s)]
*  And even then, their tactic is hit and run. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=962.2s)]
*  They'll shoot, and then before you get the chance to close on them, they'll run away [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=965.08s)]
*  and kind of just plunge back into the population. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=968.36s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Christian Cabaniss leads the battalion. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=971.12s)]
*  These people have suffered for too long. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=974.44s)]

*  All U.S. forces in Afghanistan are now being told to protect civilians, even if the enemy [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=985.6s)]
*  gets away. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=990.84s)]
*  Over the last eight years, Afghans have been outraged by civilian deaths, and it's a big [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=992.48s)]
*  reason the U.S. is not winning. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=997.64s)]
*  Killing a thousand Taliban is great, but if I kill two civilians in the process, it's [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1000.24s)]
*  a loss. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1005.8000000000001s)]

*  What do you mean by that? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1028.0s)]
*  As I told the Marines before we deployed, it's about a three-second decision, especially [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1029.0s)]

*  Next to or should I? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1036.2s)]
*  What is going to be the effect of my action? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1038.2s)]
*  Is it going to move the Afghan closer to the government or further away? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1041.18s)]
*  After two months, Gulf Company reported zero civilians killed, a success, but at the cost [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1044.68s)]
*  of its seven Marines. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1051.6000000000001s)]
*  What's the biggest threat to your Marines? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1053.64s)]
*  The biggest threat would be the improvised explosive devices, for sure. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1055.76s)]
*  IEDs. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1060.52s)]
*  The search for explosives and IEDs dominates the patrols. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1061.72s)]
*  They hunt for the buried plywood that breaks under a boot and closes the circuit on a 40-pound [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1066.16s)]
*  bomb made of fertilizer. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1072.0s)]
*  The enemy pays villagers to plant them at $10 each. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1073.96s)]
*  I got a hit right at the end of this thing. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1077.68s)]
*  There's a hit at the end of the thing. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1079.68s)]
*  Stay away from that crater. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1082.52s)]
*  IEDs often push the Marines off the roads and into the fields flooded with sewage. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1084.92s)]
*  With 60 pounds of armor and weapons, it's exhausting, and it is possible to be so bone [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1091.44s)]
*  tired that the temptation to step on the next solid ground trumps even the fear of death. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1097.76s)]
*  We should be good pushing up through here until we get near that IED site. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1103.8s)]
*  On August 31st, Dan O'Hara and Lance Corporal Jonathan Kiceno from Orlando planned a mission [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1108.7199999999998s)]
*  to clear an IED. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1115.1799999999998s)]
*  It would be a day that O'Hara would not return with all of his Marines. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1117.3799999999999s)]
*  On the patrol, they destroyed the IED, but coming back, Lance Corporal David Hall from [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1122.76s)]
*  Lorraine, Ohio triggered another. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1128.48s)]
*  A medevac helicopter carried his body away, and the Taliban opened fire. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1131.32s)]
*  The next day, O'Hara gathered Hall's squad. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1152.96s)]
*  When a Marine is killed, there is worry and doubt, which a platoon leader should end quickly. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1155.92s)]
*  His death isn't the fault of anybody who's sitting here. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1162.12s)]
*  If it belongs to anybody, it would belong to me, because I was the one out there who [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1165.28s)]
*  was in charge making the decisions. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1169.08s)]
*  So just understand, we're doing the right things. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1170.92s)]
*  We're doing good work. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1173.64s)]
*  We're making a difference here. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1174.64s)]
*  You know, we're here fighting for the people of Afghanistan. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1175.64s)]
*  We're here ultimately fighting for our country, which is what we all signed up to do. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1177.96s)]
*  After Hall's death, Lance Corporal Kicino told us what many Marines are saying about [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1183.2s)]
*  restraint. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1187.64s)]
*  They understand the strategy, follow their orders, and yet... [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1188.96s)]
*  It sucks. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1193.4s)]
*  I don't know another word to say it. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1194.4s)]
*  It sucks because all you want to do is get them for revenge, to say the least. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1195.68s)]
*  Because the Marines have been lost? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1201.3200000000002s)]
*  Sure, definitely. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1202.64s)]
*  I mean, how many times have we been shot at? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1203.64s)]
*  How many times do we know a direction, a distance, a compound, a vicinity where these guys are [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1206.2800000000002s)]
*  coming at, and then, you know, conventional war, that's it, you know, that whole compound [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1210.84s)]
*  will go, you know, but we can't drop ordinance on them because of civilian casualties. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1214.96s)]
*  But you said it was frustrating. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1219.04s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1220.8799999999999s)]
*  It's frustrating. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1221.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't know if anybody really understands the amount of stress that the guys are already [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1222.8799999999999s)]
*  starting to feel because of that, you know, simply just having the hands tied behind your [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1227.76s)]
*  back, if you will. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1232.72s)]
*  Right now, the president is considering a request to expand the counterinsurgency strategy. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1234.52s)]
*  It's become controversial in Washington, and a decision is likely in a few weeks. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1240.32s)]
*  In late August, before the controversy, we asked America's top commander in southern [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1246.0s)]
*  Afghanistan, Brigadier General John Nicholson, how the current strategy is supposed to work. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1251.04s)]
*  Clearly, at the front end, you're involved in heavy security operations. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1258.04s)]
*  In this case, while we build up the Afghan security forces until they are at a level [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1261.76s)]
*  of capability where they can take over the majority of the fighting, we are going to [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1266.68s)]
*  be in a front-line combat role. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1272.4s)]
*  But over time, we become more focused on aspects of this, such as the economic development, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1274.0800000000002s)]
*  education, and helping the government provide basic services to the people. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1279.64s)]
*  How long does it take to fight a counterinsurgency like this? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1284.4s)]
*  Well, if you look back in history, a successful counterinsurgency usually lasts at least 14 [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1288.2s)]
*  years. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1293.0800000000002s)]
*  You are talking about building a country. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1294.08s)]
*  It would take generations to do that. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1296.6399999999999s)]
*  The first thing I say is it's doable. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1300.6399999999999s)]
*  The second thing I come back to is it's important. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1302.6399999999999s)]
*  Why is it important? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1305.52s)]
*  This place was the sanctuary for al-Qaeda, from which they launch attacks against our [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1306.56s)]
*  country. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1311.0s)]
*  Secondly, the people here want this. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1312.56s)]
*  They want a better way of life. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1315.46s)]
*  Yes, it's difficult, and yes, it's challenging. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1317.1599999999999s)]
*  It's challenging because 70 percent of Afghans are illiterate and 80 percent have no electricity. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1320.04s)]
*  One Marine said, it's like fighting in the Bible. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1326.8s)]
*  In Gulf Company's area, skepticism is worn into the faces that confront the Company commander, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1330.68s)]
*  Captain Matt Martin. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1336.56s)]
*  The U.S. sees the new strategy as a fresh start. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1338.34s)]
*  Afghans see it as the start of the ninth year that the Taliban haven't been defeated. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1341.84s)]
*  If the men in your village are working with the Taliban, all I can tell you is to tell [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1346.92s)]
*  them to stop now. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1351.52s)]
*  Every Wednesday, Captain Martin holds a village council called Ashura. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1353.28s)]
*  This is what his Marines died for, the chance to win the people. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1357.74s)]
*  The government is interested in putting a clinic here in Koshate. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1361.72s)]
*  Martin offers government aid projects, but it's a tough sell. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1365.6s)]
*  They want to talk about security. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1370.74s)]
*  This man said, don't say we're giving refuge to the Taliban. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1372.92s)]
*  When you leave, they'll attack us. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1377.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm not powerful enough to resist the Taliban. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1379.0s)]
*  You're not accepting my point of view. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1382.1200000000001s)]
*  We become victims between you and the Taliban. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1384.5600000000002s)]
*  This man worried that the U.S. force is too small. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1388.4s)]
*  You can't hide the sun with two fingers, he said. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1391.64s)]
*  The Taliban are everywhere. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1394.5s)]
*  The next week, Gulf Company was inviting a man named Yunus to the meeting. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1396.96s)]
*  He pulled out a letter that the Taliban had nailed to the mosque, threatening anyone who [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1401.4s)]
*  met with the Americans. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1406.64s)]
*  But the letter didn't keep him from the meeting, and Gulf Company counted that as a win. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1408.72s)]
*  Yunus said, when we're assured of our security, we'll cooperate with the Afghan army. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1414.44s)]
*  On one of our last days with Gulf, we saw how cooperation can save the lives of Marines. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1421.46s)]
*  Using new and secret technology, the Marines destroyed an IED from long range while it [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1428.16s)]
*  was still being planted in the road. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1434.0800000000002s)]
*  We went with Captain Zach Lehman on a patrol to investigate the site. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1436.96s)]
*  But at the same time, a quarter mile away, a different patrol led by Lance Corporal Kicino [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1441.3200000000002s)]
*  was stopped by a terrified villager. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1447.2s)]
*  Tell him to calm down. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1449.6000000000001s)]
*  The man said the Taliban was setting an ambush for Captain Lehman's patrol, headed to the [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1451.44s)]
*  IED strike. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1456.48s)]
*  He won't show his face. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1458.12s)]
*  He risked his life to tip the Marines. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1459.8799999999999s)]
*  He believes the Taliban are in the corn, set up in ambush positions. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1462.12s)]
*  Kicino reported to base that Lehman's patrol was to be ambushed. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1466.4799999999998s)]
*  What do you see here? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1470.9199999999998s)]
*  We had three individuals in place in the IED here. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1471.9599999999998s)]
*  It's a 40-pound jug of homemade explosive. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1474.52s)]
*  At that moment, word of the planned ambush reached Lehman. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1477.9199999999998s)]
*  Lehman's Marines slipped into the cover of the corn for the patrol home, a small U.S. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1482.2399999999998s)]

*  This is a start. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1496.4399999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1497.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's a down payment. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1498.4399999999998s)]
*  And it's a down payment we have not made to date. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1502.04s)]
*  And that is to put in the level of security forces necessary to begin to execute the strategy [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1505.0s)]
*  that we've laid out for ourselves. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1510.08s)]

*  In this instance, did the trigger man make a mistake or were you guys just lucky? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1965.22s)]
*  We were lucky. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1969.22s)]
*  The trigger man made a mistake. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1970.22s)]
*  And we were lucky. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1971.22s)]
*  We were lucky he made a mistake. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1972.22s)]
*  Lucky because it's usually the second bomb that causes the most casualties. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1974.22s)]
*  After the first explosion, men like Sergeant Cabrera go to investigate, and that's when [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1979.22s)]
*  insurgents often set off the second bomb. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1983.52s)]
*  Something with your name on it. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1986.22s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1988.22s)]
*  Meant to maim or kill you. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1989.22s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1991.22s)]
*  Roadside bombs are also meant to prove to Afghans the United States, with its superior [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1992.22s)]
*  military still cannot protect its own troops or them. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=1998.22s)]
*  How much do you think it costs to make an IED in Afghanistan? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2002.22s)]
*  I would say maybe $10. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2005.22s)]
*  $10? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2007.22s)]
*  You could lose your life over $10. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2008.22s)]
*  One soldier we talked to had been hit by IEDs on the same road within a half kilometer three times. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2012.22s)]
*  The enemy is relentless in the way he employs these. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2022.22s)]
*  And so you can't stop. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2027.22s)]
*  Ours is a fight of constant, consistent pressure where we have to be relentless just as that enemy is. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2029.22s)]
*  This is not a fast fight. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2037.22s)]
*  It's warfare at a snail's pace. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2039.22s)]
*  We stop so often we average just two miles an hour. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2041.22s)]
*  Captain Foster thought there might be a bomb hidden in this field. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2045.22s)]
*  The local farmers seemed friendly enough, but a bomb wire was found on their land. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2048.2200000000003s)]
*  It's still sitting here all along the school on the east side of the road. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2054.22s)]
*  We're pulling security on the east side of the road. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2058.22s)]
*  You're watching their back now. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2061.22s)]
*  Roger. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2062.22s)]
*  One of the vehicles dug for explosives but couldn't find any. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2063.22s)]
*  With darkness falling, it was up to Sergeant Cabrera again. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2067.22s)]
*  So he put on his 80-pound bomb suit and took what soldiers call the long, lonely walk. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2071.22s)]
*  The road appeared safe, but to be sure, he set off two explosive charges. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2078.22s)]
*  Turns out there wasn't a bomb connected to the command wire. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2086.22s)]
*  The convoy presumed the road was clear enough to move on when another bomb exploded behind us. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2090.22s)]
*  Looks like we got out of there in time. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2097.22s)]
*  Just before midnight, we made it safely to an old farmhouse-turned-military outpost. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2101.22s)]
*  While his men slept, we talked with Captain Foster about a difficult 17-hour day. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2106.22s)]
*  So did you accomplish your mission today? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2112.22s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2114.22s)]
*  So after mortars, IEDs, this was a good day? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2115.22s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2117.22s)]
*  Everybody came home safe. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2118.22s)]
*  You seemed a bit somber or just exhausted? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2120.22s)]
*  No, it's at the end of the day, knowing that all my soldiers are safe. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2124.22s)]
*  That's when I sit down in a quiet time and thank God for watching over them. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2129.22s)]
*  Yeah, Roger, that hasn't set down. Pull forward. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2136.22s)]
*  Hours later, near the end of their mission, Captain Foster's men were attacked again. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2139.22s)]
*  All righty. We're being given help. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2145.22s)]
*  Around that bend in the road, the smoke in the distance meant that a massive bomb had exploded under the lead vehicle just two miles from the base. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2148.22s)]
*  The vehicle appeared to be total. All three men on board were injured. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2156.22s)]
*  Within minutes, soldiers climbed bridges on both sides of the road looking for the bomber. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2161.22s)]
*  They went looking for the trigger man. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2166.22s)]
*  But your expectation is that someone had to be eyeballing this convoy in order for it to go off? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2168.22s)]
*  Yes, sir. That's the initial expectation. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2174.22s)]
*  Several men and a child in a car nearby were questioned and released. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2177.22s)]
*  In our two days on the road, the bomb squad encountered five bombs. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2182.22s)]
*  Three soldiers were injured, two others shaken up. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2186.22s)]
*  One U.S. vehicle was damaged, another wrecked. Not a single bomber was captured or killed. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2189.22s)]
*  You've been brief on the mission we went on. Was it successful? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2195.22s)]
*  Overall, yes. It was successful in that that force was able to find IEDs. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2200.22s)]
*  Did they find the IEDs or the IEDs find them? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2207.22s)]
*  Some of both. Some were found and rendered safe. I think we destroyed them, at least one of them. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2210.22s)]
*  Others we found the hard way. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2216.22s)]
*  For the American people who see those scenes of the explosions, vehicles being damaged, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2218.22s)]
*  you say America just got his butt kicked that day. You say what? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2225.22s)]
*  Not at all. A vehicle getting blown up, doing what it was designed to do to absorb that blast, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2229.22s)]
*  is not us getting our butts kicked. It's us removing that threat. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2236.22s)]
*  Do you ever think this is a fight you can't win? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2240.22s)]
*  They go out, they place a bomb, you remove it, the next day they put out another bomb. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2243.22s)]
*  Right. I try not to think about it too much because it doesn't really help anybody. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2248.22s)]
*  What do you think? Is this a fight you can win? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2254.22s)]
*  I guess winning to me is going home. Really. After our deployment is done, it's going home. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2256.22s)]
*  Going home alive. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2263.22s)]
*  That's how you measure success in Afghanistan. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2264.22s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2266.22s)]
*  With the Pentagon relying so heavily on the National Guard and Reserve to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2273.22s)]
*  650,000 have been called for active duty since 9-11. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2284.22s)]
*  The least you'd expect is that after they serve, they get their old civilian jobs back. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2288.22s)]
*  There's a law called USERA that says their employers have to take them back at the same pay. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2294.22s)]
*  But what we have found is that despite the law, thousands of Guard and Reservists come home [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2301.22s)]
*  to find themselves demoted or penalized or out of a job completely. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2306.22s)]
*  Army Reservist Joanne Merritt is a nurse who works with wounded soldiers. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2312.22s)]
*  I need to get you to see Dr. Cohen. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2317.22s)]
*  When she got back to her regular job in 2006 after a two-year deployment, she was told... [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2319.22s)]
*  Well, your job is no more. You were gone too long, and we had to give that to somebody else. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2327.22s)]
*  So your job is no more. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2332.22s)]
*  Wait. They told you that despite this law, that the job you had, you couldn't have anymore. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2334.22s)]
*  Yes. Yes. It really hurt. It hurt because I just wasn't expecting this. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2341.22s)]
*  Considering who her employer is, why would she expect it? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2347.22s)]
*  Merritt works at, of all places, the VA Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2351.22s)]
*  Not only a government agency, but one that works with soldiers, the Veterans Administration. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2357.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2362.22s)]
*  Did not understand this law? Didn't understand the letter of the law? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2363.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2367.22s)]
*  And I said, you know what? I'm not going to accept this. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2368.22s)]
*  Merritt filed a complaint against the VA, and within a couple of weeks got her old job back, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2371.22s)]
*  plus the back pay and leave that she was entitled to, which the VA had also denied her. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2377.22s)]
*  Do you have any sympathy for them, though? You were gone two years. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2383.22s)]
*  I've been in the military for 25 years now. At that point, it was 23. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2389.22s)]
*  The president writes an order, gives an order. I follow it. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2394.22s)]
*  What excludes the VA? No, ma'am, I do not have any sympathy. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2401.22s)]
*  I feel that the laws are there for reasons. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2406.22s)]
*  According to the Pentagon, over 10% of the guardsmen and reservists report having problems when they return to work. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2409.22s)]
*  Tens of thousands have filed complaints or lawsuits against their employers. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2416.22s)]
*  Assistant Secretary of Defense Thomas Hall is the top man at the Pentagon [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2422.22s)]
*  overseeing the reserves and National Guard. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2428.22s)]
*  Do you know we have found cases where reservists and guardsmen who work for the Department of Defense [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2431.22s)]
*  have come back and had a problem? Their job isn't there or they've been demoted. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2437.22s)]
*  In the Pentagon, you're aware of this? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2442.22s)]
*  I am. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2445.22s)]
*  So how do you explain that? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2446.22s)]
*  Well, we want the government to be the model employer. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2447.22s)]
*  But if the government isn't the model employer, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2451.22s)]
*  What I'm saying is that the federal government's entire leadership has committed that they will be. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2454.22s)]
*  Do we need to do better? Yes. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2462.22s)]
*  The federal government is one of the largest employers of guardsmen and reservists. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2464.22s)]
*  But they also work at over 100,000 private companies. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2469.22s)]
*  And lawsuits under USERA have been filed against some of the largest, like Wal-Mart, American Airlines, UPS. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2473.22s)]
*  It's in that private sector where we discovered that a rebellion is brewing. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2482.22s)]
*  Private employers cannot supplement, cannot support the full cost of defending this nation on our balance books. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2487.22s)]
*  Dave Miller is vice president of Conway Freight, a national trucking firm. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2495.22s)]
*  After 9-11, he saw it as a patriotic duty to back his guard and reserve employees 1,000 percent. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2500.22s)]
*  How are you today? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2508.22s)]
*  How are you today? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2509.22s)]
*  Good. How are you doing, my friend? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2510.22s)]
*  Doing well. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2511.22s)]
*  But now his patience is wearing thin. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2512.22s)]
*  Not only are the deployments long, his drivers, mechanics, and others are being called up for a second and third tour of duty. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2514.22s)]
*  Often on such short notice, it's hard to find a replacement. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2522.22s)]
*  I would say we typically get about three weeks notice. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2526.22s)]
*  That doesn't sound like any time at all. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2529.22s)]
*  Well, not when you have to run an ad, get people in, interview, decide whether you're going to hire them or not. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2534.22s)]
*  Do you always know how long the deployment's going to be? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2541.22s)]
*  We never know how long the deployment is. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2545.22s)]
*  You never know. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2547.22s)]
*  With over 50 of his workers deployed right now, Miller says the company is spending about $4,000 apiece to train their replacements, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2548.22s)]
*  and as much as $100,000 if a worker has to be relocated from another state. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2556.22s)]
*  So it's a big expense for you. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2562.22s)]
*  Oh, sure it is. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2564.22s)]
*  Take the case of one of his drivers, Jeff Vineyard. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2565.22s)]
*  In 2005, Vineyard was sent to Iraq for a year as a member of the Indiana National Guard. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2569.22s)]
*  And what kind of supplies were you driving into Iraq? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2575.22s)]
*  Jet fuel. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2580.22s)]
*  Oh, jet fuel. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2581.22s)]
*  While Jeff was away, Conway did more than the law required by continuing his family's health coverage [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2582.22s)]
*  and making up the $10,000 difference between his Conway salary and his lower military wages. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2589.22s)]
*  What if you worked for a company that didn't have Conway's attitude? [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2596.22s)]
*  I wouldn't be able to be in the Guard or the Reserves because I wouldn't be able to take care of my family. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2600.22s)]
*  In all, Conway spends at least half a million dollars a year to support its reservists and guardsmen. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2605.22s)]
*  But it's not just the financial burden on employers. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2611.22s)]
*  Consider what happened in the city of Sherwood, Oregon. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2615.22s)]
*  Its 20-person police department was left without its boss when police chief Bill Middleton, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2619.22s)]
*  an Army reservist, was called up twice in the last six years. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2624.22s)]
*  This is Baghdad, right? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2629.22s)]
*  That's the city of Baghdad as we're getting ready to land. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2630.22s)]
*  Middleton's first tour of duty was a year. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2633.22s)]
*  His second, as an interrogator and investigator in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, was even longer. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2636.22s)]
*  18 months total. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2642.22s)]
*  So now you've been away a year in 2002. Now it's 18 months. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2644.22s)]
*  Correct. It seemed like everything was working fine in the city. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2649.22s)]
*  No sense that you were leaving them in the lurch, that they... [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2652.22s)]
*  I never thought that, no. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2655.22s)]
*  But the city manager told us things were not working fine, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2657.22s)]
*  that the police department was suffering without a chief from morale problems and rival factions. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2662.22s)]
*  So he hired someone new and tried to persuade Middleton to sign this contract, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2668.22s)]
*  demoting him to deputy chief. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2674.22s)]
*  Well, he had said it was because I was in the military [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2677.22s)]
*  and that he wanted somebody there who was there all the time. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2679.22s)]
*  But can you understand that? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2682.22s)]
*  No. I mean, I've given that city 12 years. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2684.22s)]
*  But you had gone a total of two and a half years. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2688.22s)]
*  Correct. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2692.22s)]
*  He felt he had the law on his side, so he refused to sign the contract. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2693.22s)]
*  And when he returned home, he still had the title, police chief, at the same pay. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2698.22s)]
*  But he was forced to report to the new director of public safety, who had moved into the chief's office. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2703.22s)]
*  And now you are his number two. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2711.22s)]
*  Correct. And he's going to give me guidance on how to run the police department that I had run for 12 years. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2714.22s)]
*  Do you think the lack of support for this war has anything to do with it? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2719.22s)]
*  Sherwood's very supportive of the war, as long as it doesn't affect their city and how it runs. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2724.22s)]
*  It's very easy to say, I support the troops, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2730.22s)]
*  but it's very hard to be without one of those troops for a long period of time. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2733.22s)]
*  And there's a lot of guys over there sacrificing an awful lot. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2737.22s)]
*  And they really need to feel like they're being supported and they have their job when they come back. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2741.22s)]
*  Martin has filed a lawsuit claiming his rights under the USERA law to the same job with the same status were violated. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2746.22s)]
*  He's seeking a million dollars in damages. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2754.22s)]
*  What do you think that the employers are really most worried about? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2757.22s)]
*  About us having to go again, because that was one of the things I was asked. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2764.22s)]
*  What are your chances of you leaving again? And they said, I'm still in the military. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2768.22s)]
*  Chances are pretty good. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2772.22s)]
*  And we're at war. Chances are great that I will have to leave again. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2774.22s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2778.22s)]
*  Nurse Joanne Merritt is now on her second tour, and so is Jeff Vineyard, the Conway driver. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2780.22s)]
*  He's back in Iraq after less than three years at home in between. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2786.22s)]
*  Employers, both public and private, seem to accept the arrangement at first. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2791.22s)]
*  They wanted to support the troops. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2797.22s)]
*  But now at the repeated deployments, the realization that this isn't going to stop, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2799.22s)]
*  some companies are trying to avoid reservists altogether. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2804.22s)]
*  Ted Daywalt, president of vetjobs.com that helps military people find jobs, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2808.22s)]
*  says he knows companies that simply refuse to hire them. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2814.22s)]
*  I had one senior VP of HR tell me that if I had three candidates for a senior position in the company, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2819.22s)]
*  and one of them mentioned they're in the garden reserve, he would only have two candidates left. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2826.22s)]
*  And I said, you know, that's illegal. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2830.22s)]
*  His response was, I can always find a reason why not to hire somebody. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2832.22s)]
*  And how much is that happening now? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2836.22s)]
*  I think it's happening a lot. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2839.22s)]
*  You can't prove it. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2841.22s)]
*  You can prove it to a point. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2842.22s)]
*  There were surveys done that showed that upwards of 70 percent of the employers [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2844.22s)]
*  won't hire a person who's active in the garden reserve. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2849.22s)]
*  Dave Miller of Conway says he wants to continue hiring them. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2852.22s)]
*  He likes their discipline and willingness to work long hours. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2856.22s)]
*  But he and other executives are agitating for compensation. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2860.22s)]
*  If the military is going to take our people 30 percent of the time, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2865.22s)]
*  let them pay 30 percent of the health care costs. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2868.22s)]
*  Now, does the government give you any help, any tax breaks or anything like that? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2871.22s)]
*  Leslie, the answer to that is absolutely no. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2876.22s)]
*  Nothing? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2879.22s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2880.22s)]
*  We have gone and petitioned Congress to in fact provide tax incentives [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2881.22s)]
*  for companies to do the right thing for these citizen soldiers. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2885.22s)]
*  And what's the response? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2889.22s)]
*  They're still discussing it. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2890.22s)]
*  A tax break to help very small businesses became law in June. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2892.22s)]
*  But Miller says the cost to all companies will go up since the Pentagon has [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2897.22s)]
*  announced a new policy of calling up the National Garden Reserves on a regular [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2902.22s)]
*  basis every five years, even after the current wars are over. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2907.22s)]
*  In using the garden, the reservists this way, in other words, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2912.22s)]
*  for regular deployments, the charge is that you're just doing it to save money. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2915.22s)]
*  And you're doing it on the back of these employers. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2923.22s)]
*  I think it's the most appropriate use of America's forces. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2926.22s)]
*  We have 2.6 million people under arms, 1.4 million are in the active duty, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2929.22s)]
*  1.2 are in the guard and reserve, 45% of the military. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2934.22s)]
*  And what we do is we save money actually by that because a guardsman or [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2938.22s)]
*  reservist doesn't cost as much. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2941.22s)]
*  So I think it's an appropriate use of the total force. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2943.22s)]
*  If the Department of Defense is going to rely more heavily on reserve and [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2947.22s)]
*  guard, they should take into consideration all they're doing is shifting costs at [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2950.22s)]
*  that point in time. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2955.22s)]
*  And there are those of us that probably won't accept that shifting graciously, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2956.22s)]
*  at least silently. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2960.22s)]
*  We won't accept it silently. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2962.22s)]
*  He and his fellow businessmen will have a hard time getting government help in [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2964.22s)]
*  this era of big deficits. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2968.22s)]
*  The Pentagon is making other concessions, though. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2971.22s)]
*  They're reducing the length of each deployment to just one year, and call-up [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2974.22s)]
*  notices are going out anywhere from six to 20 months in advance. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2978.22s)]
*  Good to see you. How are the troops doing? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2983.22s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2985.22s)]
*  Secretary Hall, who recently visited reservists on duty in Kuwait, says he [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2986.22s)]
*  hears what the companies are saying. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2990.22s)]
*  But his priority is the troops and their job security. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2993.22s)]
*  He expects the USERA law to be enforced, which is why he made this astonishing [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=2997.22s)]
*  offer. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=3002.22s)]
*  Let me make this commitment right on the air if I could just for a moment. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=3004.22s)]
*  If there's any guardsman or reservist or family member that has a problem, call [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=3007.22s)]
*  my office. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=3012.22s)]
*  Call me personally. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=3013.22s)]
*  I will personally ensure. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=3014.22s)]
*  What's your number? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=3015.22s)]
*  My number is 703-697-6631. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W2DNr3FOo&t=3016.22s)]
