# Rare Earth Elements, Deep Sea Mining and Ultra Deep Mining | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [March 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0)
*  What do cars, precision-guided missiles, and the television you're watching right now have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=0.0s)]
*  in common? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=18.64s)]
*  They all depend on something called rare earth elements, unusual metals that are sprinkled [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=19.96s)]
*  inside almost every piece of high tech you can think of. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Most people have never heard of them, but we have become so reliant on rare earths that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=29.9s)]
*  a few years ago an intense global power struggle broke out over their free flow. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=34.78s)]
*  The reason is that one country has a virtual monopoly, roughly 90 percent of the mining, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=40.82s)]
*  refining, and processing of rare earths, China. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=46.82s)]
*  And in 2010 it used that power to disrupt the world's supply. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=50.980000000000004s)]
*  It's especially troubling because it was the United States that started the rare earth [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=56.06s)]
*  revolution in the first place. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=60.46s)]
*  It all began here at this mine in Mountain Pass, California, an hour west of Las Vegas, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=65.14s)]
*  when geologists first identified rare earth elements deep in the Mojave Desert. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=71.46000000000001s)]
*  They were considered geological oddities until the 60s, when it was discovered that one of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=76.98s)]
*  these elements, europium, enhanced the color red in TV sets, and soon the rare earth industry [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=82.97999999999999s)]
*  was born. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=90.41999999999999s)]
*  CBS presents this program in color. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=91.41999999999999s)]
*  Rare earth chemistry is fascinating. There's so many more things that we could be doing [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=95.74s)]
*  with rare earths. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=100.02s)]
*  Constantine Karianopoulos, chairman of Mali Corp., which has owned and operated the Mountain [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=101.61999999999999s)]
*  Pass mine for six decades, took us to the heart of the operation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=106.78s)]
*  Is this considered a big mine? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=111.82s)]
*  In terms of rare earth standards, yes. It's one of the biggest in the world. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=114.3s)]
*  Are we actually walking on rare earth elements right now? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=118.61999999999999s)]
*  We're physically on the ore body. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=123.13999999999999s)]
*  We are right on it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=124.97999999999999s)]
*  It starts at the top of the mine, then comes down, and we're walking on it, and it goes [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=126.46s)]
*  in that direction. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=132.5s)]
*  So what are rare earth elements? If you ever took high school chemistry, you learn that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=135.66s)]
*  they're clumped together at the end of the periodic table, atomic numbers 57 through [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=140.66s)]
*  71, and they have difficult to pronounce Greek or Scandinavian names. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=146.22s)]
*  Lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, praseodymium, samarium, terbium. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=152.22s)]
*  Some of them are phosphorescent. Erbium amplifies light and is used in fiber optic cables. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=156.94s)]
*  Gadolinium has magnetic properties and is used in MRI machines and x-rays. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=164.42s)]
*  As for neodymium, you may be carrying some of it in your pocket. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=170.74s)]
*  Next time your phone vibrates, think of us, because the vibration motor is a small motor [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=175.06s)]
*  that contains a tiny neodymium magnet in it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=180.57999999999998s)]
*  Karyanopoulos showed us around a new model home to illustrate that rare earths are making [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=184.34s)]
*  our appliances energy efficient, like state-of-the-art refrigerators, touch screen thermostats, energy [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=189.46s)]
*  efficient light bulbs, the air conditioning systems. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=197.70000000000002s)]
*  They're also in our cars in the form of catalytic converters, sensors, and hybrid car batteries. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=201.86s)]
*  Hybrids in particular use a lot more because they contain electric motors that would not [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  function without rare earths. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=214.78s)]
*  Aprius has roughly 25 pounds of rare earths. And they're hidden in plain sight in our everyday [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=216.46s)]
*  lives, in our computers and gadgets. Even the lights and cameras we use to film this [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=222.98s)]
*  story are chock full of rare earths. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=229.38s)]
*  What I'm getting from you is that modern life depends on these elements. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=232.29999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=238.26s)]
*  Despite their name, rare earths are not rare. Small amounts can be found in your backyard. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=239.98s)]
*  They're trapped in what looks like ordinary rock. But there are only a few places on earth [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=248.42s)]
*  with concentrations high enough to mine. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=253.89999999999998s)]
*  Rare earths normally are found in very, very low concentrations. This is probably running [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=257.5s)]
*  something in the 25 percent grade, which is remarkable. To anyone who has ever worked [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=262.53999999999996s)]
*  with rare earths, this is a thing of beauty. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=269.02s)]
*  But getting the rare earths out of that rock is nasty business, requiring toxic acids and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=271.06s)]
*  lots of water. In fact, the mine was shut down by the state of California in 1998 after [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=277.74s)]
*  radioactive water seeped into the surrounding Mojave Desert from an underground pipe. The [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=284.14s)]
*  mine lay dormant for a decade, giving China an opportunity. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=290.38s)]
*  The Chinese made a very conscious decision to enter that industry. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=294.98s)]
*  Dan McGrurty was special assistant to President George H.W. Bush and today advises the U.S. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=299.70000000000005s)]
*  government on critical materials. When the Molycorp mine closed, he says China was already [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=306.74s)]
*  well on its way to becoming the king of rare earths. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=312.5s)]
*  There's a point at which the lines cross. The United States production declines, Chinese [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=316.5s)]
*  production is ramping up. Those lines cross somewhere around 1986. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=320.14000000000004s)]
*  So how did they pull it off? What were the factors that allowed them to basically take [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=324.06s)]
*  this away from us? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=329.06s)]
*  Well, the advantage of lower labor costs would be a place to start. Also, environmentally, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=330.26s)]
*  very, almost no environmental constraints around mining, safety considerations for the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=335.94s)]
*  miners doing the mining, in huge contrast to the United States. So that translates directly [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=341.5s)]
*  into lower pricing. And lower pricing can push other people out of the market. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=346.14s)]
*  And that's basically what happened. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=349.94s)]
*  It's basically what happened. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=351.41999999999996s)]
*  The Chinese also had orders from the top. In a little-noticed speech in 1992, Deng [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=352.94s)]
*  Chaoping signaled China's intention to corner the market. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=359.1s)]
*  What exactly did he say? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=363.18s)]
*  The Middle East has oil, China has rare earths. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=365.3s)]
*  He actually said that, Deng Chaoping. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=368.86s)]
*  I think it's fair to say at that point people in the rest of the world would have been saying, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=370.86s)]
*  what is he talking about? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=374.86s)]
*  Just went right over our heads. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=376.02s)]
*  I think so. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=377.02s)]
*  Did we just not foresee what they foresaw? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=377.98s)]
*  It's extraordinary if they actually foresaw all the uses. Our designers and developers [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=381.98s)]
*  advanced the miniaturized applications for laptops and cell phones, while the Chinese [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=387.26s)]
*  were going after the metals and materials out of which these things are actually built. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=393.18s)]
*  How did they get the know-how? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=396.90000000000003s)]
*  An enormous amount of investment. It's kind of like the Chinese moonshot, the moon program. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=398.78000000000003s)]
*  China poured billions into the industry, ignoring the consequences. We obtained this video from [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=403.98s)]
*  a freelance cameraman showing the area near Baotou, China's rare earth capital, where [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=410.18s)]
*  the air, land and water are so saturated with chemical toxins, the Chinese have had to relocate [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=416.5s)]
*  entire villages. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=423.3s)]
*  This is one of the few places where rare earths are turned into metals, which are then alloyed [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=425.56s)]
*  or blended into things like permanent magnets. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=430.9s)]
*  These are magnets that once you magnetize them, they stay that way. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=434.46000000000004s)]
*  David Richardson, president of the U.S. Magnetic Materials Association, says the most important [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=438.3s)]
*  use of rare earths is in magnets. Only a small amount can produce magnets able to lift a [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=443.94s)]
*  thousand times their weight. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=450.42s)]
*  This is a cell phone. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=452.42s)]
*  He showed us how miniaturized rare earth magnets can be. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=453.74s)]
*  So I'm going to take it apart layer by layer, and we're going to get to the point where [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=457.18s)]
*  we can actually see the magnets, the rare earth magnets that are inside them. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=461.1s)]
*  Oh, let me see this. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=464.74s)]
*  Magnetic. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=466.22s)]
*  There's three little magnets in there. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=467.22s)]
*  Oh, one, two, three. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=469.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=472.14000000000004s)]
*  And if you put the paper clip on there, you can see how it sticks. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=473.14000000000004s)]
*  And this little tiny thing is the speaker. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=475.82000000000005s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=478.34000000000003s)]
*  This is how devices have gotten small, very powerful. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=479.34000000000003s)]
*  Because the magnets are so powerful, you don't have to use much of it. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=483.54s)]
*  The U.S. developed this technology, but China bought most of it right out from under us. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=487.26000000000005s)]
*  For instance, in 1995, China bought the biggest American rare earth magnet company, Magniquinch, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=493.66s)]
*  which was based in Indiana. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=500.70000000000005s)]
*  When they bought the factory, they now had the patents, they now had the equipment, and [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=502.78000000000003s)]
*  they actually had some of the Magniquinch employees in the United States go to China [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=507.26000000000005s)]
*  and teach the people how to make the products. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=511.62s)]
*  Did we not understand the strategic importance of keeping that industry here? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=514.58s)]
*  We didn't get it. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=519.7s)]
*  Fortunately, the technology was transferred to China before that technology was appreciated. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=520.74s)]
*  And now we're seeing so many, for instance, defense systems that are dependent on it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=526.5s)]
*  Does that make us dependent on China for our defense systems? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=532.82s)]
*  We are very dependent on China. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=536.58s)]
*  We are dependent on China for our weaponry. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=538.0600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=541.74s)]
*  A prime example of that is the new F-35 fighter jet, the most technologically advanced weapon [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=542.78s)]

*  Each one contains nearly half a ton of rare earths. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=555.22s)]
*  Former White House official Dan McGrority says that's just for starters. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=559.3s)]
*  The guidance systems on weapons systems and Tomahawk cruise missile, any of the smart [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=563.5s)]

*  Anything that we consider worth building today and going forward that would not have a rare [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=575.26s)]
*  earth component in it. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=580.46s)]
*  Because of this, because of the monopoly on rare earths, does China threaten our national [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=581.82s)]
*  security? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=586.74s)]
*  Unchecked, yes. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=587.74s)]
*  What finally woke up the U.S. government was an incident at sea in 2010. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=592.02s)]
*  A Chinese fishing trawler rammed a Japanese coast guard ship in a territorial dispute. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=597.46s)]
*  The Japanese seized the boat's captain, and two weeks later, China stopped shipping rare [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=608.8199999999999s)]
*  earths to Japan. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=614.26s)]
*  The Chinese cut them off, and for 30 to 40 days, the rare earths did not float in Japan. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=616.06s)]
*  It was a real shot across the bow to the Japanese that this is something that you have to be [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=620.86s)]
*  worried with. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=626.1800000000001s)]
*  It was a wake-up call. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=628.26s)]
*  Finally, 20 years after Deng Xiaoping's speech, rare earths were on the U.S. radar screen. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=629.98s)]
*  This case involves something called rare earth materials. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=636.62s)]
*  President Obama announced a formal complaint to the World Trade Organization against China [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=640.38s)]
*  for creating shortages for foreign buyers, and last August, the WTO ruled against Beijing. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=645.62s)]
*  No one in the Obama administration would talk to us on camera about rare earths and our [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=653.18s)]
*  dependence on China, including the Department of Energy, the Pentagon, or the U.S. trade [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=658.1s)]
*  representative. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=663.9s)]
*  Even the private sector didn't want to discuss the problem. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=665.42s)]
*  We tried to get interviews with heads of companies that use the magnets and other products coming [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=669.0600000000001s)]
*  out of China, and they would not talk to us. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=675.6s)]
*  Is there fear in high-tech companies that if they say something negative, maybe China [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=678.36s)]
*  won't sell them what they need? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=686.0s)]
*  I think that there is grave concern in these companies, but perhaps not a willingness to [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=687.88s)]
*  talk about that on the street corner. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=693.08s)]
*  So what is the U.S. doing to restore the industry here? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=696.6s)]
*  Out in California, Mali Corp. was allowed to reopen after it developed new technology [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=701.0s)]
*  that protects the environment. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=706.44s)]
*  But even when it's at full capacity, the mine will only produce a fraction of the world [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=708.88s)]
*  supply of rare earths. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=714.0s)]
*  The Pentagon has begun stockpiling rare earths, and industry is researching new technologies [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=716.84s)]
*  that would replace them. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=723.1600000000001s)]
*  Do you get any help from the U.S. government? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=724.64s)]
*  They want to have a rare earth industry here. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=727.6s)]
*  Encouragement. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=730.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=731.7199999999999s)]
*  That's it. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=732.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=733.7199999999999s)]
*  The government is not offering incentives like tax breaks or subsidies that would lure [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=734.7199999999999s)]
*  businesses into the market. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=740.4s)]
*  What needs to change to bring more of the industry back to the United States? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=742.76s)]
*  Well, first of all, we need to take a long-term view. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=747.56s)]
*  It took 20 years to lose the dominant position, at least 20 years, and it's probably going [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=750.2199999999999s)]
*  to take us 10, 15 years if we execute for some of these supply chains to start coming back. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=756.6s)]
*  But trouble is once again looming for the U.S. rare earth industry. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=764.6800000000001s)]
*  Since restarting operations two years ago, Mali Corp.'s Mountain Pass mine has yet to [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=768.9200000000001s)]
*  turn a profit and is so deeply in debt that just last week its own auditor warned it may [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=774.2s)]
*  not be able to stay in business. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=780.3000000000001s)]
*  Picture a lump of rock about the size of a potato now packed with some of the most [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=786.6s)]
*  valuable metals on earth, like nickel, cobalt, and other minerals known as rare earth elements. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=799.88s)]
*  There are trillions of these nodules. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=807.48s)]
*  That's what they're called, just waiting to be picked up. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=809.72s)]
*  The problem is they're on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=813.76s)]
*  The nodules were discovered more than a century ago. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=817.92s)]
*  Now new technology has triggered a fierce competition to go get them. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=821.28s)]
*  These metals are critical for modern life, cell phones, electric cars, and supercomputers. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=826.6s)]
*  19 countries, including China and Russia, have already jumped into the deep. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=833.08s)]
*  But the one country on the sidelines? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=838.4s)]
*  The United States. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=840.6s)]
*  More on that in a moment, but first we wanted to take a look at this new frontier. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=842.76s)]
*  Our adventure began at three in the morning. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=851.56s)]
*  Loading up our tugboat, we pulled out of San Diego. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=854.52s)]
*  The harbor lights sank quickly behind us. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=858.08s)]
*  Ten hours later, we were cutting through the chop of the Pacific with nothing to see but [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=862.68s)]
*  the tossing ocean. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=867.56s)]
*  So it wasn't hard to spot the Maersk launcher. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=869.4399999999999s)]
*  A 300-foot mining research vessel that we'd come to join. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=872.56s)]
*  All we had to do was get on board. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=877.68s)]
*  While the launcher dangled a rope ladder above us, the tugboat backed in. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=881.3199999999999s)]
*  With swells over 10 feet, timing was everything. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=887.68s)]
*  At the top of the wave, we took a leap of faith and landed in the new world of deep [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=891.78s)]
*  sea mining. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=901.9599999999999s)]
*  We were traveling with Gerard Baron, the CEO of Canadian company Deep Green Metals. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=904.8399999999999s)]

*  They'd been at sea for five weeks on a test run, mapping the seafloor and fishing for [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=913.92s)]
*  nodules. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=919.52s)]
*  This was the sunken treasure we had come to see. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=920.88s)]
*  What makes them so valuable? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=924.76s)]
*  What is in that? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=926.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, that is an electric vehicle battery in a rock. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=927.24s)]
*  It looks like a lump of charcoal. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=931.96s)]

*  The amazing thing is it's filled with nickel and cobalt and copper and manganese, and that's [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=938.24s)]
*  everything we need to build a battery. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=945.0400000000001s)]
*  All right, start coming up. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=947.24s)]
*  To get the nodules, the crew hoists a three-ton rig called a box core over the side. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=949.52s)]
*  Plunging into the ocean, it begins its three-mile descent to the seafloor. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=957.24s)]
*  Hours later, it neared the bottom. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=962.96s)]
*  It felt like watching a new lunar landing. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=965.88s)]
*  And there they were, giant fields of nodules covering an alien landscape, millions of years [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=972.4s)]
*  old. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=979.08s)]
*  The nodules grow by absorbing metals from the seawater, expanding slowly around a core [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=980.08s)]
*  of shell, bone or rock. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=985.5600000000001s)]
*  The potential is staggering. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=988.2800000000001s)]
*  Estimates of their worth run from eight to more than $16 trillion. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=990.9200000000001s)]
*  They are primarily found in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, or CCZ, about two million square miles [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=996.88s)]
*  of ocean between Hawaii and Mexico. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1004.36s)]
*  On this research trip, Deep Green scooped up over 100 helpings of the seafloor, each [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1008.24s)]

*  In 30 years as a geologist, Warwick Miller told us he'd never seen anything like it. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1020.72s)]
*  Great day to be a geologist. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1027.08s)]
*  He said it was a great day to be a geologist. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1028.8s)]
*  What did you mean? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1030.88s)]
*  Ah, we were standing by the box core. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1031.88s)]
*  I remember holding my hand up. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1034.04s)]
*  It was covered in mud. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1035.04s)]
*  It's nice that I get to touch them. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1036.68s)]
*  It's better than looking at them in a glass case, for example. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1038.8s)]
*  They're in all sizes, all different sizes like this? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1041.8s)]
*  There's different types. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1044.72s)]
*  The type you're holding there would be a type three nodule, which is larger and it's got [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1046.36s)]
*  a characteristic sort of cauliflower texture to it. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1050.96s)]
*  Miller told us each nodule has the same proportion of metals. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1055.1599999999999s)]
*  After they're weighed and measured, they're stored in a refrigerated container. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1059.8799999999999s)]
*  They will be further analyzed on shore to help Deep Green figure out where to mine [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1064.6s)]

*  I mean, it's the most amazing coincidence that I've ever encountered. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1119.8s)]
*  Mother Nature made these nodules. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1125.1599999999999s)]

*  So you call yourself an environmentalist. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1132.56s)]

*  Well, you know, I don't call myself a miner, but we are collecting nodules off the ocean [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1138.56s)]

*  Well, we call it harvesting. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1147.56s)]
*  Harvesting nodules from the ocean floor. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1150.24s)]
*  Unlike on land, there's no drilling or digging. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1153.16s)]
*  Instead, enormous deep sea robots will do the heavy lifting. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1156.56s)]
*  To see one of the most advanced, we traveled to Antwerp, Belgium. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1161.48s)]
*  In a country better known for beer and chocolate, we met Patania. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1166.52s)]
*  It's a caterpillar. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1171.04s)]
*  It's a caterpillar track. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1172.04s)]
*  So we said, what is the fastest caterpillar on Earth? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1173.56s)]
*  And it's called the Patania ruralis. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1176.36s)]
*  Chris Van Nea, the managing director of Global Sea Mineral Resources, or GSR, told us Patania [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1178.76s)]

*  How many nodules are down there? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1204.72s)]
*  It is estimated that there is more nickel, more cobalt, and more manganese than on the [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1206.52s)]
*  rest of the planet. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1211.2s)]
*  In 2017, GSR was the first to put a robot on the sea floor. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1213.04s)]
*  Last summer, expectations were high for Patania's second plunge into the Pacific. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1219.52s)]
*  A specially built frame swung the 35-ton machine over the edge of the ship, a fiber optic umbilical [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1224.96s)]

*  A very big setback. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1245.9599999999998s)]
*  You have said that the deep sea has no mercy. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1246.9599999999998s)]
*  Is this what you mean? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1250.6s)]
*  That's exactly what we mean. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1251.6s)]
*  It has no mercy. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1252.6s)]
*  It has to be 1000% perfect or it won't work. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1253.6s)]
*  GSR hopes to take Patania back to the Clarion-Clipperton zone soon. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1257.6s)]
*  When mining begins, Van Nea told us, the nodules will be pumped to the surface to a waiting [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1263.48s)]

*  This rare albino octopus, nicknamed Casper, a species only discovered three years ago. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1290.76s)]
*  When we go out and collect a sample on the sea floor, we collect hundreds of new species. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1297.72s)]
*  Things that you've never seen before. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1302.88s)]
*  Sure, oh yeah, yeah. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1304.96s)]
*  Craig Smith is an oceanographer at the University of Hawaii. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1306.56s)]
*  He told us he was surprised at how much life could survive three miles deep. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1310.84s)]
*  His expeditions to the CCZ have turned up fantastical creatures like this squid worm [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1316.8799999999999s)]
*  or a fluorescent sea cucumber dubbed a gummy squirrel. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1323.72s)]
*  There are other deep sea originals too. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1328.32s)]
*  A foot long shrimp, a ping pong tree sponge and a galloping sea urchin. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1330.9599999999998s)]
*  Mining companies say that the CCZ is only about 1% of the ocean. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1338.6799999999998s)]
*  The ocean is so vast that it could absorb the activity in that small portion of the ocean. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1345.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's a little bit like saying the Amazon rainforest is only 8% of the global [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1351.08s)]
*  land area. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1355.8s)]
*  So we can wipe it out and it doesn't matter. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1356.8s)]
*  Won't deep sea mining actually be less invasive, have less of an impact than mining on land? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1359.24s)]
*  I would say no. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1367.52s)]
*  Mining is mining. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1368.92s)]
*  I think it's similar to strip mining on land and it'll take a really long time for things to recover. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1369.92s)]
*  Smith is working with the United Nations Seabed Authority, which set aside nine protected [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1377.96s)]
*  areas that will be off limits to miners. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1383.88s)]
*  And Chris Van Nea has invited independent scientists to monitor GSR's work. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1387.28s)]
*  If you find that the environmental impact is severe, would this stop the project? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1393.52s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1400.48s)]
*  I don't think we're not into this project to come up with a means to produce metals [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1401.48s)]
*  worse than what is being done today. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1406.28s)]
*  We're in it because we believe it can be done better. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1408.48s)]
*  So far 19 different countries have licenses in the Clarion-Clipperton zone. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1411.6399999999999s)]
*  China has more than anyone else. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1417.24s)]
*  Russia and Japan have also jumped in. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1419.56s)]
*  So has France, Germany, Korea, even Cuba and Tonga have stakes. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1422.48s)]
*  Who's missing? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1428.28s)]
*  The United States. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1429.56s)]
*  It's not for lack of trying. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1431.8s)]
*  The UN's Law of the Sea covers deep sea mining and in 1994, President Bill Clinton signed [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1433.8s)]
*  the treaty. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1440.9199999999998s)]
*  But it was dead on arrival in the Senate, despite repeated attempts to ratify it, including [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1441.9199999999998s)]
*  this past July. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1448.4199999999998s)]
*  Is that doing us harm? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1449.6799999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1451.68s)]
*  We don't have a seat at that table. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1452.68s)]
*  Jonathan White is a retired rear admiral who now runs a nonprofit to protect oceans. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1453.92s)]
*  He told us that being outside the treaty means the U.S. has no say in how this new gold rush [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1460.72s)]
*  is being run. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1467.64s)]
*  It's a law and if we're not going to be part of that lawful system, doesn't it make us [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1469.48s)]

*  If you're in the military, a weapon system, the guidance of our weapons, x-ray machines, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1493.76s)]
*  microwaves, they all rely on elements that are hard to come by. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1498.84s)]
*  So China controls most of these elements from terrestrial sources? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1502.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1506.84s)]
*  And now they're going after the lion's share of the seabed sources? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1507.84s)]
*  They certainly are. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1511.72s)]
*  Does that concern you? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1513.44s)]
*  It absolutely concerns me. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1515.06s)]
*  It concerns me with relation to our national security going forward. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1516.88s)]
*  We need to be in this game. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1521.92s)]
*  My problem is with sovereignty. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1523.84s)]
*  So we called the 22 senators opposed to the treaty, all Republicans, to ask why. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1526.32s)]
*  None would appear on camera. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1533.08s)]
*  Those who wrote us said that ceding any control to the United Nations was a deal breaker. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1535.28s)]
*  But Rear Admiral White worries if the U.S. doesn't ratify the law of the sea, it will [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1542.1399999999999s)]
*  soon be too late. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1547.48s)]
*  And if we don't, what does that mean for us? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1549.6s)]
*  I think it means that again, we become more isolated, especially in terms of a growing [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1553.92s)]
*  global economy. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=1559.0s)]

*  Ambassador John Negroponte told us the Heritage Foundation is standing in the way. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2119.02s)]
*  What Heritage is saying is we don't even want to give them a chance. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2124.78s)]
*  We know the answer already. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2129.02s)]
*  I think that's sort of hypothetical thinking. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2132.7s)]
*  The pragmatic approach would be to say, okay, let us have access and see what happens. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2136.18s)]
*  We could end up being even more dependent than we are today on China for access to these [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2141.42s)]
*  minerals. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2150.06s)]
*  If they end up being the largest producer and we're not producing at all, that might [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2152.3s)]
*  place us in a difficult economic position. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2158.04s)]
*  But national security fears of China's growing prowess in the deep are about more than mining. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2163.0s)]
*  In March, a letter signed by 346 former political, national security and military leaders warned [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2169.56s)]
*  that China was taking advantage of America's absence from the treaty to pursue overall [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2178.06s)]
*  naval supremacy. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2183.68s)]
*  Over the last decade, and I've done the math, China has built 20% more warships by tonnage [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2185.68s)]
*  than the United States Navy has. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2192.2s)]
*  They built 160 warships, where the U.S. Navy built 66. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2194.24s)]
*  It is a truly massive expansion in naval power. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2198.7599999999998s)]
*  Thomas Shugart is a former U.S. Navy submarine warfare officer and a senior fellow at the [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2202.3599999999997s)]

*  It has fired water cannons at its neighbors, caused collisions, even flashed a military-grade [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2226.96s)]
*  laser at ships. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2236.96s)]
*  Steven Groves at the Heritage Foundation says that's why the treaty is meaningless. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2239.0s)]
*  It's China who is a party to the treaty who doesn't obey the rules of the road. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2244.1200000000003s)]
*  They're the ones getting into near collisions with U.S. vessels in the South China Sea. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2249.6400000000003s)]
*  The United States respects and adheres to international law. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2255.88s)]
*  It is the Chinese who are the scofflaws here. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2260.2400000000002s)]
*  And the idea that the U.S. joining the treaty would somehow change that Chinese behavior [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2264.04s)]
*  has no basis in reality. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2269.12s)]
*  Every time the U.S. points at them and says you're violating the law, they very quickly [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2271.6s)]
*  turn back and say, well, you're not in the signatory, so what do you have to say about [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2275.36s)]
*  it? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2278.64s)]
*  We are in a messaging contest and an effort to win hearts and minds all over the world [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2279.64s)]
*  against what is clearly our greatest strategic competitor. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2284.32s)]
*  Former submarine captain Thomas Shugart told us being outside the treaty undercuts American [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2287.8s)]

*  the Chinese military. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2305.08s)]
*  The technology that these companies use to mine the seabed, do they also have a military [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2306.96s)]

*  Absolutely. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2314.2s)]
*  If you're going to find submarines in the ocean, you need to know what the bottom looks [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2315.2s)]

*  You need to know what the salinity is. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2320.36s)]
*  If China is using civilian vessels to sort of on the slide do those surveys, then that [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2322.18s)]
*  could improve their ability to find U.S. and allied submarines over time as they better [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2328.18s)]
*  understand that undersea environment. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2332.8199999999997s)]

*  We decided to call the senators who torpedoed the treaty in 2012 to see if anything had [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2341.18s)]
*  changed. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2346.54s)]
*  We found their opposition as strong as ever. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2347.74s)]
*  With the U.S. Senate locked in stalemate, China is forging ahead. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2351.62s)]
*  Over the years at 60 Minutes, we have been in more than a few tunnels. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2367.22s)]
*  We explored Mexican drug lord El Chapo's subterranean escape routes, burrowed through [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2371.52s)]
*  a Roman villa buried by Mount Vesuvius, and traveled the depths of the New York City subway. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2376.62s)]
*  But nothing prepared us for a place called Moab Katsong, a South African gold mine that [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2382.8599999999997s)]
*  extends nearly two miles beneath the surface. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2388.46s)]
*  In their pursuit of gold, South Africans have dug the deepest holes on earth. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2392.3399999999997s)]
*  The country was the world's top gold producer for decades. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2397.58s)]
*  Now the gold is running out. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2401.74s)]
*  Just as these ultra-deep mines have attracted a new breed of miner on a very different quest, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2404.18s)]
*  we went along for the adventure. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2410.54s)]
*  In the early morning light, tall mine shafts loom over the Val River basin two hours southwest [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2414.14s)]
*  of Johannesburg. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2420.2999999999997s)]
*  This once was a booming gold field. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2422.02s)]
*  Now most mines lie abandoned. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2424.3999999999996s)]
*  But Moab Katsong is bustling. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2427.3399999999997s)]
*  Long before the sun rises, thousands of miners start lining up for the triple deck elevator [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2431.06s)]
*  called the cage. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2436.68s)]
*  It's jammed, but more always push on. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2440.42s)]
*  And early one morning, so did we. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2444.06s)]
*  It's really snug in here. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2447.2999999999997s)]
*  We are packed in as tight as sardines. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2448.84s)]
*  The electric bell's signal, we're ready. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2451.66s)]
*  When the cage drops, slowly at first, then picks up speed fast, we plunge 450 stories [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2455.84s)]
*  straight down. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2464.32s)]
*  It's the longest elevator ride on earth. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2465.88s)]
*  The cage rattles and whistles as we descend. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2472.52s)]
*  The air gets more humid the deeper we go. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2475.42s)]
*  Our lifeline to the surface is a machine called the manwinder. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2479.76s)]
*  Massive coils of steel rope two inches thick that attach to the cage and unspool faster [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2484.56s)]
*  and faster. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2490.96s)]
*  We dropped two miles in a couple of minutes and emerged in an underground city. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2493.24s)]
*  This is like Grand Central Station in Russia. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2499.68s)]
*  To get to the gold, miners must walk miles through a vast maze of dimly lit tunnels. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2503.54s)]
*  Sometimes you're lucky and can catch a ride, but mostly you just walk. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2512.36s)]
*  For Leroy Lee, it's in the blood. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2520.6s)]

*  It's my kids, my wife, my parents, my mother, my sister. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2531.32s)]
*  The gold in these ultra deep mines is found in narrow veins laced through the rock. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2537.04s)]
*  Some are no wider than a pencil. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2543.2s)]
*  It's cramped at the rock face and we crouch alongside the miners as they work hunched [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2545.62s)]
*  over in the dark. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2551.44s)]
*  The noise from the drills is deafening. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2553.92s)]
*  Massive air conditioners cool the tunnels, but it can still reach 120 degrees down here. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2558.48s)]
*  At the end of the shift, we had to rush not to miss the elevator back up. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2565.92s)]
*  It doesn't wait for anyone. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2571.88s)]
*  And here's where all that breaking rock pays off. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2576.52s)]
*  The smelter. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2579.52s)]
*  The ore is smashed and pulverized in a grinder before being fed into a furnace. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2581.0s)]
*  Manga Kasango, who runs the operation, told us we were the first TV crew to film the weekly [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2587.44s)]
*  ritual they call the pour. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2594.12s)]
*  We all had to wear these special pajamas with no pockets so we couldn't steal anything. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2597.56s)]
*  The heat was intense as the furnace reached almost 2,000 degrees. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2604.16s)]
*  The gold turned to liquid and poured down into the molds. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2609.88s)]
*  When I saw it the first time, I was like, wow, that's something that keeps me going [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2615.4s)]
*  on that. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2619.96s)]
*  When you hear people who have never seen gold or touched it, I feel like I'm more privileged. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2620.96s)]
*  These bars will be refined again to 99.99% purity before they're sold for coins and jewelry. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2630.52s)]
*  The mine used to process about 60 tons of gold a year. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2640.64s)]
*  Now it's just a quarter of that. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2644.96s)]
*  Still, the day we watched the pour, there was a pretty good haul. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2647.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2652.64s)]
*  This is quite heavy. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2657.7999999999997s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2659.52s)]
*  How much is this? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2661.16s)]
*  11 million rand. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2662.16s)]

*  Yes, definitely. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2671.72s)]
*  That sounds like a good day. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2672.72s)]

*  It's one thing to come here for the gold, but now this harsh environment has attracted [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2678.44s)]
*  others, scientists hunting for what they call extreme life. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2684.12s)]

*  Right. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2695.48s)]
*  An international team led by Princeton geoscientist Tullis Anstadt and Belgian biologist Gaetan [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2696.48s)]
*  Bourgogne are pioneers in the search for life buried in the rock where no one thought it [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2703.52s)]
*  could survive. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2709.8s)]
*  Bourgogne says his colleagues thought he was crazy when he took a sabbatical to try to [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2711.36s)]
*  prove there was life deep underground. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2716.76s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2719.48s)]
*  They said, you're going to go to South Africa for a year. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2720.48s)]
*  You're going to look for something that does not exist there. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2723.44s)]
*  They've lost count of the number of trips to the bottom of the mines searching for life [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2726.04s)]
*  hidden in the ancient water seeping through the rock. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2730.84s)]
*  This is a completely different world down there. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2734.8s)]
*  There are different rules. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2736.7200000000003s)]
*  How so? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2738.36s)]
*  The temperature is different. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2739.36s)]
*  The pressure is different. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2740.36s)]
*  I mean, it's a tough world down there for life. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2741.36s)]
*  The next day, we went along with them to the deepest level of the mine. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2744.4s)]
*  For them, it was just another day at the office. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2749.0200000000004s)]
*  For us, it was an eye-opener. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2752.0400000000004s)]
*  This feels like that movie, Journey to the Center of the Earth. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2755.2000000000003s)]
*  With just the light from our headlamps, we waded through a tunnel that had been flooded [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2759.96s)]
*  with cold water to cool it down. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2764.92s)]
*  Then, we grabbed a chairlift cut through a channel of rock, except this one went down. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2767.7200000000003s)]
*  This is like the best Disney ride ever. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2774.88s)]
*  Picture five of New York's World Trade Centers stacked on top of each other. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2778.56s)]
*  That's how deep in the earth we are. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2783.84s)]
*  We're stopped for a second. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2786.8s)]
*  I hope it's a second. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2790.48s)]
*  Do we have to get off? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2793.48s)]
*  No. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2796.48s)]
*  When the chairlift stopped suddenly, we had to hike down the last 50 yards to the bottom. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2797.48s)]
*  Then, at the end of an abandoned tunnel, our scientists found something amazing. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2804.96s)]
*  I've been looking for 20 years for a salty water deposit like this that we never found [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2810.7200000000003s)]
*  until now. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2816.2s)]
*  White patches on the wall turned out to be salt. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2817.68s)]
*  Is that edible? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2820.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2821.96s)]
*  Please try it. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2822.96s)]
*  You just try it? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2823.96s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2824.96s)]
*  It's salty. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2825.96s)]
*  This is ancient salt? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2826.96s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2829.8399999999997s)]
*  It has to be. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2830.8399999999997s)]
*  It's very, very salty. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2831.8399999999997s)]
*  And the source? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2834.3599999999997s)]
*  This dripping salt water. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2835.7599999999998s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2837.9199999999996s)]
*  It tells me this water is extremely old because in these rock formations, they were formed [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2838.9199999999996s)]
*  three billion years ago. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2843.72s)]
*  So there weren't salt deposits back then. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2844.72s)]
*  They believe this water could be all that's left of an ancient ocean. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2847.3999999999996s)]
*  And where there's water, there can be life. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2852.64s)]
*  We could be looking at something which has never seen the life that has evolved on the [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2855.64s)]
*  surface of the planet. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2859.52s)]
*  All from this cave two miles down in South Africa? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2860.9199999999996s)]
*  All from gold mines in South Africa. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2864.3199999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2867.2799999999997s)]
*  In 2011, they found what no one thought possible. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2868.68s)]
*  These tiny worms living in a pocket of water 5,000 years old. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2873.04s)]
*  What you're seeing is magnified. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2878.6s)]
*  These worms are no bigger than a human hair. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2880.88s)]
*  It was a species never before seen. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2883.86s)]
*  It survives without sunlight, deep in the hot underworld. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2886.96s)]
*  So they called it Mephisto or the devil. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2891.14s)]
*  That's where my worms live. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2894.96s)]
*  They eat bacteria. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2895.96s)]
*  The first worm you found was in something like that. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2896.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2900.16s)]
*  With an endoscope camera, they were the first to film this deep inside the Earth's crust. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2901.16s)]
*  This is the devil worm's home. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2907.48s)]
*  Before this, no one thought animal life could exist this deep. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2910.24s)]
*  You made a big discovery. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2914.68s)]
*  For me it is big because for me personally, I had to fight quite a lot of people to be [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2915.96s)]
*  able to do this. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2921.24s)]
*  On a personal level, that was the biggest victory for me. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2922.48s)]
*  In the total grand scheme of things, it's just a worm. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2926.12s)]
*  It's just a worm. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2929.3999999999996s)]
*  They were surprised to find other living creatures too. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2931.6s)]
*  So many, they called them a zoo, a crustacean, about 1 64th of an inch, an arthropod, a flat [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2936.4s)]
*  worm, and single cell bacteria. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2945.32s)]
*  It set off a storm of speculation about where else extreme life might exist, perhaps even [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2948.36s)]
*  on Mars. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2955.28s)]
*  NASA helped fund their research. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2956.76s)]
*  If there is life here in the deep, then you should definitely dig on Mars because if life [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2959.4s)]
*  was ever there, you will find some life form, I believe very strongly, still on Mars. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2963.7200000000003s)]
*  So the Martians we meet in the future could be these single cell organisms you're talking [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2970.08s)]
*  about? [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2978.32s)]
*  Yes indeed. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2979.32s)]
*  I think that would be the most likely. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2980.32s)]
*  But be prepared to be surprised, I would say. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2982.08s)]
*  South Africa's gold mines are now so deep, they might as well be on another planet. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2987.28s)]
*  I'm not sure that we really want to send human beings much deeper. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2992.84s)]
*  Bernard Swanepoel started his career underground and ended it as the CEO of Harmony Gold, which [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=2996.92s)]
*  now owns Moab Katsong. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3003.84s)]
*  If you are in a successful mining team, it must be like a successful sports team. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3006.52s)]
*  I mean, mining is one of those activities where at the end of every shift, you know [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3011.88s)]
*  whether you won or lost. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3015.36s)]
*  Gold was the lifeblood of South Africa. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3018.52s)]
*  The way it's dug out has changed little since Apartheid, when underpaid black miners often [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3021.1200000000003s)]
*  worked in mortal danger. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3026.88s)]
*  At its worst, more than 800 workers a year died in mining accidents. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3029.2000000000003s)]
*  No coincidence, the struggle that led to Apartheid's defeat started underground. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3034.76s)]
*  Gold and gold mining seem to be in the DNA of South Africa. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3042.2s)]
*  South African gold mining especially has always been at the center of all political and other [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3048.2s)]
*  activities in our country. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3053.92s)]
*  I mean, how bad Apartheid history is intertwined with gold mining. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3055.2s)]
*  I mean, a lot of the legislation to dispossess black people of land was in order to create [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3059.92s)]
*  cheap labor for South African gold mines. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3066.56s)]
*  You grew up in a small mining town during the era of Apartheid. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3068.84s)]
*  What are your strongest memories? [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3074.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, ultimately, I'm a privileged person that because I was white and I was male, those [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3076.96s)]
*  were the two requirements at the time to become a mining engineer. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3084.92s)]
*  So are you the new face of South African mining? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3088.92s)]
*  I would say yes. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3094.2400000000002s)]
*  We are the new generation in the mining. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3095.2400000000002s)]
*  Just a dozen years after Apartheid ended, engineer Manga Kisango started managing the [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3098.84s)]
*  smelter. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3104.28s)]
*  He told us he chose to move here from the Congo to work in the mines. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3105.48s)]
*  Has that wound in South Africa been healed? [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3111.1600000000003s)]
*  Not 100% healed, but there is some healing happening. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3115.44s)]
*  There is some healing, yes, because we have different people working in the mines and [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3119.08s)]
*  the mindset has been changing. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3125.32s)]
*  Now, safety is paramount. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3128.6000000000004s)]
*  You will find women underground and blacks are senior managers. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3132.7200000000003s)]
*  Once some of the lowest paid laborers are now among the highest. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3137.1200000000003s)]
*  But this generation of gold miners know they may be the last. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3142.2400000000002s)]
*  Of the 11 gold mines that once flourished around here, only three still operate. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3146.44s)]
*  The mines are now so deep it's becoming too expensive to get the gold out. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3154.6s)]
*  The story of the ultra deep mines is nearing its final chapter. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3159.84s)]
*  To dig the riches from such astounding depths took grit and brute force. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3168.24s)]
*  Now South Africa's resolve must be deployed to solving the next challenge. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3174.88s)]
*  What to do when the gold runs out? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkaip7lJei0&t=3180.2799999999997s)]
