# Leader Jeffries; Work to Own; St. Mary's | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [May 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8)
*  This Congress will likely be the least productive since the Civil War. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=0.0s)]
*  The Republican majority is having trouble controlling its MAGA wing. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=12.0s)]
*  And few have seen the dysfunction, like Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=16.84s)]
*  HAKEEM JEFFRIES, Democratic Minority Leader, Congress of the United States of America [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=21.48s)]
*  And even though we're in the minority, we effectively have been governing as if we were [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=22.48s)]
*  in the majority, because we continue to provide a majority of the votes necessary to get things [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=28.799999999999997s)]
*  done. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=35.16s)]
*  Those are just the facts. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=36.16s)]
*  You're a part of a movement. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=37.16s)]
*  This man is a heavyweight in the world of private equity, an industry famous for its [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=39.76s)]
*  ruthlessness. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=44.4s)]
*  Yet he's emerged as the leading evangelist for the concept of employee ownership. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=45.4s)]
*  His idea? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=50.56s)]
*  Take the same incentives that have long helped the C-suite get rich and apply them to the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=51.64s)]
*  folks working factories, flatbeds and farms. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=56.72s)]
*  Even our newest colleagues are going to get a meaningful payout of $20,000. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=60.36s)]
*  So, are you math geniuses? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=64.12s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=70.72s)]
*  How did these high school students prove an ancient mathematical equation that was thought [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=72.86s)]
*  to be impossible for 2,000 years? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=77.42s)]
*  We start with just a regular right triangle, where the angle in the corner is 90 degrees. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=80.53999999999999s)]
*  Then we start creating similar but smaller right triangles, and then it continues for [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=86.0s)]
*  infinity. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=91.52s)]
*  Am I going a little too? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=92.52s)]
*  You've been beyond me since the beginning. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=93.52s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=99.52s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=100.8s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=102.16s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=103.6s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=104.84s)]
*  I'm Nora O'Donnell. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=106.12s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=107.52s)]
*  Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=109.2s)]
*  The United States Congress is not particularly popular these days, and look no further than [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=116.0s)]
*  the current session to understand why. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=125.88s)]
*  It will likely be the least productive Congress since the Civil War. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=128.7s)]
*  One lawmaker who's figured out a way to get a few things done is Congressman Hakeem Jeffreys. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=133.76s)]
*  He replaced Nancy Pelosi as the leader of the Democrats in the House over a year ago, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=139.82s)]
*  and the 53-year-old has built a reputation as a consensus builder in his own caucus and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=145.28s)]
*  as a tough but respectful opponent of the Republican Party. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=151.2s)]
*  Minority leader Jeffreys could potentially become the first Black Speaker of the House, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=155.8s)]
*  though to hear him tell it, the Democrats are already in charge. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=160.6s)]
*  Even though we're in the minority, we effectively have been governing as if we were in the majority [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=165.96s)]
*  because we continue to provide a majority of the votes necessary to get things done. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  Those are just the facts. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  The fact is, Republicans in the House are a majority in name only. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  With just two votes to spare, infighting has crippled their conference. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=186.16s)]
*  Even some Republican members are at their wits' end. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  The Lord Jesus himself could not manage this conference. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=194.88s)]
*  It's a difficult situation on the other side of the aisle because many of my Republican [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=198.67999999999998s)]
*  colleagues are more interested in creating chaos, dysfunction, and extremism. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  For what purpose? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=210.72s)]
*  That's a good question that has to be asked of them. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=212.48s)]
*  We were sent by the American people to get things done, to solve problems. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=216.16s)]
*  At the end of the day, some people don't have that view of the job. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  Nine months after getting the job of speaker, Republican Kevin McCarthy of California got [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=228.16s)]
*  dumped by the far right wing of his party. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=234.11999999999998s)]
*  Following three weeks of paralysis, Mike Johnson of Louisiana took his place. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=237.2s)]
*  I want to thank you all for the trust that you have instilled in me. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=242.83999999999997s)]
*  After he worked with Democrats to pass the foreign aid bill that included $61 billion [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  for Ukraine, Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who opposed it, said she will [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=253.04s)]
*  follow through with the threat to oust him. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=259.03999999999996s)]
*  Jeffries told us he works to find common ground with the other side of the aisle. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=263.24s)]
*  And at least one Republican who might be happy about that is Speaker Johnson. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  This past week, Democrats said they would vote against Congresswoman Greene's effort [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  to remove him. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=280.28s)]
*  Has Speaker Johnson asked for your help? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=281.88s)]
*  He has not. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=283.64s)]
*  And our view would traditionally be, let the other side work its own mess out. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=284.64s)]
*  But when that mess starts to impact the ability to do the job on behalf of the American people, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  then the responsible thing at that moment might be for us to make clear that we will [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=297.0s)]
*  not allow the extremists to throw the Congress and the country into chaos. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=303.52s)]
*  As chaos spreads across college campuses nationwide over Israel and Gaza, some far [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=309.2s)]
*  left members of Jeffries' own party have shown support for protesters. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  Leader Jeffries, whose district is 11 percent Jewish, spoke about the protests at his weekly [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=323.2s)]
*  press conference this past Wednesday. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=328.36s)]
*  Peaceful protest is an important part of the fabric of America. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=331.28s)]
*  But we shouldn't see any protests ever there into threatening the safety and security of [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=334.96s)]
*  others, into anti-Semitism or racism or xenophobia. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=342.56s)]
*  In all, 37 House Democrats recently voted against sending more military aid to Israel. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=349.2s)]
*  The divisive issue will follow Leader Jeffries and President Biden into the election this [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=356.4s)]
*  November, where control of the White House and Congress looks like a coin flip. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=361.52s)]
*  What do you think about how Israel has been waging this war against Hamas in Gaza? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=367.4s)]
*  Israel was put in a very difficult situation when it comes to the horrific events of 10-7, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=373.88s)]
*  a brutal terrorist attack by Hamas, which is an entity that has sworn to wipe Israel [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=382.4s)]
*  off the face of the earth. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=390.47999999999996s)]
*  So Israel was in a position where, of course, it had to respond to decisively defeat Hamas. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=392.35999999999996s)]
*  At the same time, my view has been that we have to do everything possible to get the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=397.91999999999996s)]
*  hostages out and to surge humanitarian assistance into Gaza. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=405.47999999999996s)]
*  But isn't it also true that while retaliating and going after Hamas terrorists, that Israel [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=412.44s)]
*  has been indiscriminate in its bombing? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=418.92s)]
*  I would not say that they've been indiscriminate. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=421.24s)]
*  I do think what we'd like to see moving forward is the execution of the new phases of this [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=423.88s)]
*  conflict with surgical precision. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=431.56s)]
*  You can still be a strong supporter of Israel and Americans' defense of Israel and be critical [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=434.8s)]
*  of their approach about how they've waged this war in Gaza. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=439.76s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=442.59999999999997s)]
*  But you seem reluctant to criticize Israel at all. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm dealing with the facts on the ground. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  The facts are, according to the UN, half of Gaza's 2.2 million people are on the verge [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=448.68s)]
*  of famine. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=453.40000000000003s)]
*  Has Israel done enough to get food and aid into Gaza? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=454.68s)]
*  Israel clearly needs to do more as they have recently acknowledged through their actions [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=458.08s)]
*  to surge humanitarian assistance into Gaza. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=467.12s)]
*  The other thing that I think is important... [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=471.08s)]
*  Only after they killed seven aid workers from World Central Kitchen. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=474.44s)]
*  That was horrific, including one American. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=478.36s)]
*  Now, in terms of the loss of innocent Palestinian life in this tough theater of war, that is [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=481.24s)]
*  deeply disturbing, tragic, and should be painful for anyone who has a shred of humanity in [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=491.76s)]
*  their body. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=501.48s)]
*  Palestinian civilians do not deserve to suffer for the sins of Hamas. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=503.36s)]
*  In March, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a staunch supporter of Israel, spoke out against [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  the way it's waging war in Gaza. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  The fourth major obstacle to peace is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=517.48s)]
*  Was Leader Schumer's speech a turning point? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=523.8000000000001s)]
*  Anything that Chuck Schumer has to say on the subject is going to be incredibly important [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=527.08s)]
*  and received. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=532.56s)]
*  But at the same time, every single member of Congress has the responsibility of answering [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=534.0799999999999s)]
*  to their constituency. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=540.8s)]
*  That's the beauty of American democracy. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=542.88s)]
*  So what Leader Schumer has to say on a given issue, what Mitch McConnell has to say on [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=545.1999999999999s)]
*  a given issue, yeah, there's some importance connected to it in Congress inside the Beltway. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=549.5999999999999s)]
*  That was a very long answer without answering my question. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=556.76s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=560.96s)]
*  Chuck Schumer criticizing the Prime Minister of Israel, calling for him to be replaced, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=562.44s)]
*  that's a big deal. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=567.84s)]
*  Chuck Schumer's words speak for themselves, but I think that trying to suggest that Leader [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=568.84s)]
*  Schumer is somehow undermining the U.S.-Israel relationship is ridiculous. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=573.96s)]
*  How worried are you that voters' frustration with President Biden over the war in Gaza [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=578.84s)]
*  could hurt Democrats' chances in this election year? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=587.4599999999999s)]
*  We can't take any vote for granted. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=591.38s)]
*  But I also believe that at the end of the day, voters are going to look at the totality [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=596.5s)]
*  of circumstances. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=601.74s)]
*  Who is fighting to deliver for everyday Americans? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=604.4s)]
*  And who is simply fighting for himself? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=608.6999999999999s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries says he learned about fighting for everyday Americans from his parents. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=612.9000000000001s)]
*  His father was a substance abuse counselor, his mother a social worker, who Jeffries says [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=618.74s)]
*  taught him and his brother, a college professor, to work hard and be good to people. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=624.34s)]
*  Jeffries attended NYU Law School, worked for a prestigious law firm, then spent a few years [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=630.46s)]
*  as an attorney for 60 Minutes parent company CBS before entering politics in 2006. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=636.22s)]
*  This election is about a fresh start, moving forward. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=642.82s)]
*  So many great pictures of Brooklyn all around here. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=645.78s)]
*  You were the first black leader for either party in either house ever. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=648.34s)]
*  What does that say about America? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=654.34s)]
*  Government of the people, by the people, and for the people isn't just a theoretical concept. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=656.76s)]
*  Like it actually exists in America. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=662.46s)]
*  He was raised in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, a few blocks away from his district. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=666.86s)]
*  Where Sundays were for church. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=673.74s)]
*  At 12 years old, he became an usher and says it taught him how to talk to people. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=676.38s)]
*  These are challenging times. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=682.26s)]
*  Jeffries says he visited more than 60 churches in Brooklyn last year. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=684.86s)]
*  And in Washington, we're going to continue to put people over politics. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=689.1800000000001s)]
*  One of Jeffries' allies told us his ability to connect to both young and old black voters [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=695.9s)]
*  makes him an important surrogate for President Biden this fall. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=702.3399999999999s)]
*  Black voters are a core Democratic constituency. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=705.9s)]
*  Why do you think support for President Biden has decreased among black voters? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=709.18s)]
*  I think that tremendous progress has been made for African Americans under the leadership of Joe Biden. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=714.3s)]
*  That's quantifiable. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=719.8199999999999s)]
*  But the reality is there's still real challenges. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=721.62s)]
*  One new challenge in communities in New York City and in many others around the country [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=725.54s)]
*  is the influx of migrants. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=730.74s)]
*  Shelters to house thousands of them have gone up in and around Jeffries' district. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=733.46s)]
*  What do you say to voters who not only see migrants streaming into the U.S., [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=738.46s)]
*  not just from Mexico and Latin America, but also from China and other countries, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=742.78s)]
*  and wonder what's Congress doing about this? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=747.58s)]
*  We have a broken immigration system and we have clear challenges at the border [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=750.1s)]
*  that we have to confront decisively and in a bipartisan way. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=756.06s)]
*  And the American people are crying out for us to do something about the situation at the border [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=761.22s)]
*  in a manner consistent with our values. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=766.86s)]
*  How big of an issue will abortion rights be this election year? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=769.62s)]
*  It's going to be an incredibly significant issue because on its own, it's about freedom. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=774.5799999999999s)]
*  And the extreme-magnate Republicans have set in motion the erosion of reproductive freedom. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=783.18s)]
*  We're going to fight for it with everything that we've got at our disposal. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=789.62s)]
*  If Roe v. Wade can fall, anything can fall. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=797.06s)]
*  Social Security can fall. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=802.86s)]
*  Medicare can fall. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=805.46s)]
*  Voting rights can fall. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=807.5s)]
*  And God help us all, but democracy itself can fall. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=809.86s)]
*  If Roe v. Wade can fall, then anything can fall. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=814.6600000000001s)]
*  Every single thing that we care about is on the ballot in November. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=819.0200000000001s)]
*  Leader Jeffries says Democrats have a story to tell beyond what voters have to lose in November [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=826.46s)]
*  and pointed to legislative wins for gun safety and the billions invested in American manufacturing [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=833.1s)]
*  and infrastructure. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=839.26s)]
*  Those are real results. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=840.78s)]
*  But two-thirds of voters think the economy was better under President Trump. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=844.1s)]
*  Well, that's just not the case, and we have to do a better job of laying out the facts [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=848.9399999999999s)]
*  that the economy has dramatically improved under the leadership of President Joe Biden. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=854.62s)]
*  But if those are the facts, why don't voters believe it? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=861.62s)]
*  Is that a communication problem? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=866.46s)]
*  Voters understand that more needs to be done, that there are challenges that remain. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=868.9s)]
*  We understand we have to lower costs. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=874.8199999999999s)]
*  We have to end price gouging. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=877.34s)]
*  We have to grow the middle class. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=879.6999999999999s)]

*  We have to solve the problems and challenges at the border. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=884.36s)]
*  We're on the right side of those issues, and we just have to make sure we make that [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=889.26s)]
*  case in a compelling, a clear, and a comprehensive way to the American people. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=893.74s)]

*  Not long ago, Arthur was the unlikely site of a daring experiment in American capitalism. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=984.62s)]
*  CHI Overhead Doors, which manufactures garage doors, was founded by a local Amish carpenter. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=990.46s)]
*  Then, in 2015, KKR, one of the world's biggest private equity firms, came to this small town [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=996.9000000000001s)]

*  Buried under credit card debt and with no savings, they had taken second jobs to support [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1061.8999999999999s)]

*  Give rank and file workers a stake in their company on top of salary, plus a voice in [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1139.76s)]
*  how the business is run day to day. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1144.54s)]
*  With skin in the game, they'll be motivated to work harder and smarter. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1147.06s)]
*  Ownership is really an ethos. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1151.74s)]
*  It's a mindset. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1153.54s)]
*  What I mean by that is what you want are people feeling like these are my products. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1154.54s)]
*  So if I'm sending out poor quality, that's a problem for me. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1161.94s)]
*  If our productivity is down or if our customers are unhappy, these are my customers. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1166.22s)]
*  And this doesn't happen overnight, but when they pay off, you do get behavior change. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1170.4199999999998s)]
*  I get people on the shop floor saying, I have ideas on how to reduce scrap or improve quality. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1174.98s)]
*  The concept is not a new one. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1179.26s)]
*  In the 70s, Congress passed laws to encourage employee ownership, a story 60 minutes covered [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1181.4399999999998s)]
*  at the time. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1187.22s)]
*  A year ago, the 75 employees of this company were told they were going to become part owners, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1188.22s)]
*  stockholders in infant specialties. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1193.1399999999999s)]
*  But as corporate America struggled with the complexity of a new model, the effort sputtered. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1195.1s)]
*  Today, while it's common for executives to be compensated with shares, fewer than a quarter [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1199.8200000000002s)]
*  of private sector employees own a stake in their company, all as their wages and wealth [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1204.8200000000002s)]
*  have stagnated. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1209.66s)]
*  On this topic, devout capitalist Pete Stavros can sound downright revolutionary. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1211.1000000000001s)]
*  You've said the social contract in America is broken right now. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1216.6200000000001s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1219.46s)]
*  That workers feel like they don't have hope, they don't have a way to get ahead. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1220.8200000000002s)]
*  Half of America earns an hourly wage. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1226.5400000000002s)]
*  Most of them have no assets, no plans for a dignified retirement. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1229.14s)]
*  This Stavros says is not just bad for society, it's bad for balance sheets. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1234.94s)]
*  70% of America doesn't like their jobs. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1239.94s)]
*  Some around 20% hate their jobs for throwing the proverbial wrenches in the machinery. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1241.94s)]
*  Like sabotage. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1246.7800000000002s)]
*  Sabotaging their own employer. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1247.7800000000002s)]
*  That's bad for human beings, bad for our economy. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1249.5s)]
*  You're very clear that this is not charity, this isn't philanthropy, this isn't socialism. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1251.98s)]
*  You are making a business case. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1257.18s)]
*  This is the right thing to do that also happens to be good business. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1260.54s)]
*  His obsession with employee ownership traces to his working class upbringing outside Chicago. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1264.74s)]
*  His father paved roads for a construction company. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1270.1200000000001s)]
*  And the lessons around the dinner table from my sister and I were really about the plight [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1273.3600000000001s)]
*  of the hourly worker. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1277.46s)]
*  There's no incentive. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1278.66s)]
*  I mean the thing that really drove my dad crazy, he used to talk about the need to just [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1279.66s)]
*  work steady. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1283.22s)]
*  If you work too fast and you're too productive, your hours go down and your paycheck goes [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1284.66s)]
*  down. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1288.7s)]
*  You need hours. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1289.7s)]
*  You need hours. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1290.7s)]
*  In business school at Harvard, Stavros published research on, you guessed it, employee ownership. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1291.7s)]
*  Once he'd reached the gleaning offices of KKR, he put the program into action for the [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1296.74s)]
*  first time in 2011. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1301.1000000000001s)]
*  Today, thanks to Pete Stavros, KKR has implemented the model at 47 companies and counting. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1302.9s)]
*  That's 100,000 employees globally, union, non-union, in manufacturing, e-commerce, even [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1309.62s)]
*  book publishing. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1315.9799999999998s)]
*  Will you do a deal that doesn't have employee ownership now? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1316.9799999999998s)]
*  In the U.S. no. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1320.1399999999999s)]
*  We've been at this almost 15 years. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1321.1399999999999s)]
*  This is the new way we are operating. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1323.3799999999999s)]
*  This is the model. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1325.5s)]
*  In February, we visited a recent KKR acquisition, Potter Global Technologies in St. Louis, manufacturer [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1326.6999999999998s)]
*  of fire protection equipment. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1333.1399999999999s)]
*  Companies were first learning the details of their new ownership plan. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1335.88s)]
*  It was part pep rally, part polished TED talk. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1339.16s)]
*  As of today, you're a part of a movement, a movement to change the way ownership is [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1346.98s)]
*  shared in corporate America. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1351.7600000000002s)]
*  Afterward, we sat down with factory employees Debbie Brummet, Craig Leppert, Mike Urby, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1353.2800000000002s)]
*  Donna Henson and Gina Grant to hear their reaction. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1358.5600000000002s)]
*  We all deserve it. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1361.5600000000002s)]
*  We've been doing it, but now we're going to get benefits. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1362.5600000000002s)]
*  All right, all right. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1364.56s)]
*  That's how I look at it. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1365.56s)]
*  We kept hearing employees start thinking like owners. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1367.2s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1370.76s)]
*  It's easy to spend somebody else's money, but what you work for and you own it, it's [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1371.76s)]
*  a difference when it's your money. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1375.4s)]
*  These big checks, that's a motivation? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1377.3600000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1379.16s)]
*  To know the payouts and what it can potentially bring in my future. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1380.16s)]
*  This is actually something I have prayed for. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1384.48s)]
*  It's personal to me. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1386.92s)]
*  The aim is for employees like these to get checks equivalent to at least a year's salary [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1388.28s)]
*  when KKR sells the company five or so years later. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1392.94s)]
*  Congratulations on me coming out here today. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1396.46s)]
*  Davros also offers workers free financial literacy training to better understand the [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1398.66s)]
*  economics. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1403.8600000000001s)]
*  But he is quick to stress any payout depends on how the company performs and whether KKR [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1405.3s)]
*  sells at significant profit. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1411.5s)]
*  It's risk. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1413.6200000000001s)]
*  Now there's no downside because workers are not investing out of their own pocket, but [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1414.6200000000001s)]
*  there's definitely no guarantee. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1419.1000000000001s)]
*  We always say we need to perform for this to work. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1421.18s)]
*  Have you had to have that ceremony on the shop floor of, look, we're selling, but unfortunately [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1424.18s)]
*  there's no pot at the end of the rainbow. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1430.82s)]
*  We haven't had that yet. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1433.78s)]
*  It will happen. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1434.86s)]
*  That day will come. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1435.86s)]
*  We've been fortunate so far. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1436.86s)]
*  Pete Stavros has his critics. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1438.22s)]
*  This after all is private equity, a sector often vilified for its aggressive business [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1440.26s)]
*  practices. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1445.34s)]
*  Here are some of the critiques we've heard about your efforts. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1446.34s)]
*  It's greenwashing. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1448.78s)]
*  It's whitewashing. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1449.78s)]
*  It's mostly public relations. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1450.78s)]
*  It's a watering down of the real employee ownership. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1451.78s)]
*  What do you say to detractors like that? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1455.5s)]
*  When you look at what workers are getting, I just think there's too much substance for [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1457.78s)]
*  someone to shrug it off and say, ah, that's just, that's fake. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1460.86s)]
*  But coming from a sector that doesn't traditionally act like this, that tends to cut jobs and [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1463.82s)]
*  tends to squeeze profits and tends to hollow out companies, does that create an additional [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1470.18s)]
*  challenge for you? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1474.02s)]
*  Well, I don't agree with that characterization. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1475.02s)]
*  You don't? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1477.22s)]
*  I think certainly mistakes have been made both in our industry and in capitalism. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1478.22s)]
*  If all private equity was doing was plundering, I just don't think it would be where it's [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1485.18s)]
*  at, which is continuing to gain market share. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1489.98s)]
*  Stavros does concede that when there is a sale, top executives stand to make orders [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1494.58s)]
*  of magnitude more than rank and file workers, tens of millions of dollars. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1498.64s)]
*  I think that's one of the things that I struggle with about employee ownership in general. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1503.72s)]
*  It's giving people a chance to get a leg up, but it is not going to solve the wealth inequality [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1509.32s)]
*  problem that we have. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1513.84s)]
*  Talk about this yawning wealth gap we have in the country. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1515.34s)]
*  Does private equity help that gap or help create it? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1519.88s)]
*  So we're investing capital, and that capital is owned for the most part by wealthy people. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1523.84s)]
*  That's just a fact of life. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1528.76s)]
*  So in a sense, we are compounding the problem. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1530.0s)]
*  So we'll be experimenting, we'll learn. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1534.2s)]
*  An imperfect messenger, perhaps, but Pete Stavros has emerged as the leading employee [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1537.0s)]
*  ownership apostle. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1541.64s)]
*  He's founded a nonprofit that teaches executives how to deploy the model. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1543.24s)]
*  He crisscrosses the country, preaching his gospel at business schools and before D.C. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1547.7s)]
*  lawmakers, advocating to update the tax code to incentivize employee ownership, which he [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1552.4s)]
*  hopes will soon be standard business practice, not an exotic exception. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1558.0s)]
*  This is an unbelievably popular idea with liberal progressives and MAGA Republicans [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1562.84s)]

*  It's not a government handout. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1573.6s)]
*  This is a benefit tied to work. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1574.6s)]
*  And the outcomes are driven by performance. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1575.92s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1599.9199999999998s)]
*  Obviously, I'm excited for myself. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1600.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean, how could you not be? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1602.24s)]
*  How could you not be? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1603.96s)]

*  Brown and Crystal were too modest to reveal exact numbers, but told us their check was [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1631.4399999999998s)]
*  in the mid-six figures. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1636.12s)]

*  Absolutely. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1639.12s)]
*  And not just for us, for our kids too. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1640.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1642.24s)]
*  Our kids don't have to worry about us being stressed out about money. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1643.4s)]
*  We're not working night shifts. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1647.0s)]
*  The Edwards family donated to their church. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1648.84s)]
*  They finally paid off that credit card debt. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1651.28s)]

*  in and on the community. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1667.68s)]
*  I'm curious, do you think this idea of, hey, employees can turn into employee owners, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1670.44s)]
*  is that a challenge or is that, hey, it can happen in the middle of Illinois, it can happen [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1676.8400000000001s)]
*  anywhere? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1679.76s)]

*  right? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1690.28s)]
*  If it can happen here, where can it not happen? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1691.28s)]
*  But this might be the biggest payoff of all. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1693.92s)]
*  The ownership was not a fad or a one-time windfall. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1697.04s)]
*  After KKR sold, the workers got a stake in the business under the new owners. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1700.78s)]
*  Why change a winning culture? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1705.44s)]
*  Why mess with success? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1707.36s)]
*  As the school year ends, many students will be only too happy to see math classes in their [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1720.92s)]
*  rearview mirrors. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1726.26s)]
*  It may seem to some of us non-mathematicians that geometry and trigonometry were created [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1728.06s)]
*  by the Greeks as a form of torture. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1733.26s)]
*  So imagine our amazement when we heard two high school seniors had proved a mathematical [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1735.9s)]
*  puzzle that was thought to be impossible for 2,000 years. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1741.66s)]
*  We met Kelsey Johnson and Nakaiya Jackson at their all-girls Catholic high school in [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1746.48s)]
*  New Orleans. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1751.52s)]
*  We expected to find two mathematical prodigies. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1753.06s)]
*  Instead, we found at St. Mary's Academy, all students are told their possibilities [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1756.1s)]
*  are boundless. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1762.3s)]
*  Come Mardi Gras season, New Orleans is alive with colorful parades replete with floats [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1770.4199999999998s)]
*  and beads and high school marching bands. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1776.6599999999999s)]
*  In a city where uniqueness is celebrated, St. Mary's stands out with young African-American [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1781.34s)]
*  women playing trombones and tubas, twirling batons and dancing, doing it all, which defines [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1786.6999999999998s)]
*  St. Mary's, students told us. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1793.22s)]
*  Junior Christina Blasio says the school instills in them they have the ability to accomplish [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1795.4199999999998s)]
*  anything. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1801.98s)]
*  That is kind of a standard here. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1802.98s)]
*  So we aim very high. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1805.02s)]
*  Like, our aim is excellence for all students. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1806.62s)]
*  The private Catholic elementary and high school sits behind the Sisters of the Holy [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1810.12s)]
*  Family Convent in New Orleans East. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1814.6s)]
*  The academy was started by an African-American nun for young black women just after the Civil [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1817.56s)]
*  War. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1823.32s)]
*  The church still supports the school with the help of alumni. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1824.32s)]
*  In December 2022, seniors Nakaiya Jackson and Kelsey Johnson were working on a school-wide [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1828.28s)]
*  math contest that came with a cash prize. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1835.36s)]
*  I was motivated because there was a monetary incentive because I was like, $500 is a lot [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1839.24s)]
*  of money, so I would like to at least try. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1844.6s)]
*  Both were staring down the thorny bonus question. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1848.04s)]
*  So tell me, what was this bonus question? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1851.8s)]
*  It was to create a new proof of the Pythagorean Theorem, and it kind of gave you a few guidelines [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1856.4s)]
*  on how would you start a proof. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1861.9s)]
*  The seniors were familiar with the Pythagorean Theorem, a fundamental principle of geometry. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1863.92s)]
*  You may remember it from high school. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1869.88s)]
*  A squared plus B squared equals C squared. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1872.04s)]
*  In plain English, when you know the lengths of two sides of a right triangle, you can [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1875.48s)]
*  figure out the length of the third. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1880.26s)]
*  Both had studied geometry and some trigonometry, and both told us math was not easy. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1882.92s)]
*  What no one told them was there'd been more than 300 documented proofs of the Pythagorean [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1889.68s)]
*  Theorem using algebra and geometry. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1895.4s)]
*  But for 2,000 years, a proof using trigonometry was thought to be impossible. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1898.5800000000002s)]
*  And that was the bonus question facing them. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1905.2s)]
*  When you looked at the question, did you think, boy, this is hard? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1908.5s)]
*  What motivated you to say, well, I'm going to try this? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1915.24s)]
*  I think I was like, I started something. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1917.84s)]
*  I need to finish it. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1920.44s)]
*  So you just kept on going? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1921.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1923.48s)]
*  For two months that winter, they spent almost all their free time working on the proof. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1924.48s)]
*  She was like, Mom, this is a little bit too much. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1930.56s)]
*  CeCe and Cal Johnson are Calce's parents. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1934.0s)]
*  So then I started looking at what she really was doing, and it was pages and pages and [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1936.64s)]
*  pages of like over 20 or 30 pages for this one problem. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1942.16s)]
*  Yeah, the garbage can was full of papers where she would work out the problems. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1946.4799999999998s)]
*  And if that didn't work, she would ball it up, throw it in the trash. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1950.3999999999999s)]
*  Did you look at the problem? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1954.6799999999998s)]
*  Nellisca Jackson is Nakaiya's mother. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1957.0s)]
*  Personally, I did not because most of the time I don't understand what she's doing. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1959.9599999999998s)]
*  What if we did this? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1966.0s)]
*  What if I write this? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1967.0s)]
*  Does this help? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1968.0s)]
*  A, X squared? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1969.0s)]
*  Their math teacher, Michelle Blue and Williams, initiated the math contest. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1970.0s)]
*  Did you think anyone would solve it? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1974.68s)]
*  Well, I wasn't necessarily looking for a solve, so no idea. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1976.84s)]
*  What were you looking for? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1979.68s)]
*  I was just looking for some ingenuity, you know. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1980.68s)]
*  Calce and Nakaiya delivered on that. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1984.8s)]
*  They tried to explain their groundbreaking work to 60 Minutes. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1987.6s)]
*  Calce's proof is appropriately titled The Waffle Cone. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1991.84s)]
*  So to start the proof, we start with just a regular right triangle where the angle in [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=1995.42s)]
*  the corner is 90 degrees and the two angles are alpha and beta. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2000.08s)]
*  So then what we do next is we draw a second congruent, which means they're equal in size. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2005.04s)]
*  But then we start creating similar but smaller right triangles going in a pattern like this. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2011.78s)]
*  And then it continues for infinity. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2018.9199999999998s)]
*  And eventually it creates this larger waffle cone shape. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2020.72s)]
*  Am I going a little too... [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2024.28s)]
*  You've been beyond me since the beginning. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2025.84s)]
*  So how did you figure out the proof? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2029.76s)]
*  Okay, so we have a right triangle, 90 degree angle, alpha and beta. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2031.92s)]
*  Then what did you do? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2037.16s)]
*  Okay, I have a right triangle inside of the circle and I have a perpendicular bisector [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2038.16s)]
*  at OP to divide the triangle to make that small right triangle. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2046.28s)]
*  And that's basically what I use for the proof. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2052.32s)]
*  That's the proof. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2056.04s)]
*  That's what I call amazing. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2057.18s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2059.04s)]
*  There had been one other documented proof of the theorem using trigonometry by mathematician [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2060.64s)]
*  Jason Zimba in 2009, one in 2,000 years. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2065.56s)]
*  Now it seems Nakaiya and Kelsey have joined perhaps the most exclusive club in mathematics. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2070.7999999999997s)]
*  So you both independently came up with proof that only use trigonometry. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2076.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2084.92s)]
*  So are you math geniuses? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2085.92s)]
*  I think that's a stretch. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2090.2000000000003s)]
*  If not genius, you're really smart at math. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2091.64s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2095.48s)]
*  To document Kelsey and Nakaiya's work, math teachers at St. Mary's submitted their proofs [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2097.44s)]
*  to an American Mathematical Society conference in Atlanta in March 2023. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2102.64s)]
*  Well, our teacher approached us and was like, hey, you might be able to actually present [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2107.56s)]
*  this. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2112.04s)]
*  I was like, are you joking? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2113.04s)]
*  But she wasn't. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2115.2s)]
*  So we went, I got up there, we presented, and it went well, and it blew up. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2116.2s)]
*  It blew up. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2122.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2123.2799999999997s)]
*  What was the blow up like? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2124.2799999999997s)]
*  Insane, unexpected, crazy, honestly. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2126.96s)]
*  Today's story features two high school students, Kelsey Johnson and Nakaiya Jackson. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2131.3199999999997s)]
*  It took millennia to prove, but just a minute for word of their accomplishment to go around [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2137.04s)]
*  the world. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2142.44s)]
*  They got a write-up in South Korea and a shout-out from former First Lady Michelle Obama, a commendation [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2143.68s)]
*  from the governor, and keys to the city of New Orleans. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2150.3599999999997s)]
*  Why do you think so many people found what you did to be so impressive? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2153.72s)]
*  Probably because we're African-American, one, and also women. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2158.72s)]
*  So I think, oh, and our age, of course, our age is probably quite a big part. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2162.96s)]
*  So you think people were surprised that young African-American women could do such a thing? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2167.44s)]
*  Yes, definitely. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2172.72s)]
*  I'd like it to actually be celebrated for what it is. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2173.72s)]
*  It's a great mathematical achievement. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2176.8399999999997s)]
*  Achievement, that's a word you hear often around St. Mary's Academy. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2179.16s)]
*  Kelsey and Nakaiya follow a long line of barrier-breaking graduates. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2184.12s)]
*  The late queen of Creole cooking, Leah Chase, was an alum. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2190.04s)]
*  So was the first African-American female New Orleans police chief, Michelle Woodfork, and [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2194.4s)]
*  judge for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, Dana Douglas. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2201.2799999999997s)]
*  Math teacher Michelle Bluen-Williams told us Kelsey and Nakaiya are typical St. Mary's students. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2205.08s)]
*  They're not unicorns? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2211.64s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2212.7599999999998s)]
*  If they are unicorns, then every single lady that has matriculated through this school [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2214.3199999999997s)]
*  is a beautiful black unicorn. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2219.16s)]
*  You good? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2222.72s)]
*  Pamela Rogers, St. Mary's president and interim principal, told us the students hear that [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2223.6s)]
*  message from the moment they walk in the door. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2229.52s)]
*  We believe all students can succeed. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2232.36s)]
*  All students can learn. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2235.28s)]
*  It does not matter the environment that you live in. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2236.92s)]
*  So when word went out that two of your students had solved this almost impossible math problem, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2240.12s)]
*  were they universally applauded? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2248.56s)]
*  In this community, they were greatly applauded. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2250.56s)]
*  Across the country, there were many naysayers. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2254.04s)]
*  What were they saying? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2256.52s)]
*  They were saying, oh, they could not have done it. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2258.24s)]
*  African-Americans don't have the brains to do it. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2260.7599999999998s)]
*  Of course, we sheltered our girls from that, but we absolutely did not expect it to come [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2262.8399999999997s)]
*  in the volume that it came. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2269.72s)]
*  And after such a wonderful achievement? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2272.3999999999996s)]
*  People have a vision of who can be successful. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2276.3599999999997s)]
*  And to some people, it is not always an African-American female. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2282.28s)]
*  And to us, it's always an African-American female. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2289.96s)]
*  What we know is when teachers lay out some expectations that say, you can do this, kids [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2294.28s)]
*  will work as hard as they can to do it. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2301.8s)]
*  Gloria Ladson-Billings, professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin, has studied [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2305.1600000000003s)]
*  how best to teach African-American students. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2310.68s)]
*  She told us an encouraging teacher can change a life. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2314.16s)]
*  And what's the difference, say, between having a teacher like that and a whole school dedicated [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2318.48s)]
*  to the excellence of these students? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2326.72s)]
*  So a whole school is almost like being in heaven. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2330.2s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2333.24s)]
*  Many of our young people have their ceilings lowered, that somewhere around fourth or fifth [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2336.0s)]
*  grade, their thoughts are, I'm not going to be anything special. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2342.76s)]
*  What I think is probably happening at St. Mary's is young women come in as perhaps ninth graders [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2348.36s)]
*  and are told, here's what we expect to happen, and here's how we're going to help you get [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2354.36s)]
*  there. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2358.52s)]
*  Who is the author of this story? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2359.52s)]
*  At St. Mary's, half the students get scholarships subsidized by fundraising to defray the $8,000 [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2361.16s)]
*  a year tuition. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2367.7999999999997s)]
*  Here there's no test to get in, but expectations are high and rules are strict. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2369.6s)]
*  No cell phones, modest skirts, hair must be its natural color. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2376.3199999999997s)]
*  Students Raya Siddique, Summer Ford, Carissa Washington, Tatum Williams and Christina Blasio [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2381.3199999999997s)]
*  told us they appreciate the rules and rigor. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2388.64s)]
*  Especially the standards that they set for us, they're very high and I don't think that's [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2392.0s)]
*  ever going to change. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2396.16s)]
*  So is there a heart of philosophy and essence to St. Mary's? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2397.56s)]
*  The sisterhood. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2403.0s)]
*  The sisterhood. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2404.0s)]
*  The sisterhood. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2405.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2406.0s)]
*  And you don't mean the nuns, you mean you. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2407.0s)]
*  So when you're here, there's just no question that you're going to go on to college. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2409.8799999999997s)]
*  College is all they talk about. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2415.92s)]
*  And Arizona State University. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2418.04s)]
*  Principal Rogers announces to her 615 students the colleges where every senior has been accepted. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2421.2s)]
*  So for 17 years, you've had a 100% graduation rate and a 100% college acceptance rate. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2428.52s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2437.16s)]
*  Nakaiya Jackson. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2438.16s)]
*  Last year when Nakaiya and Kelsey graduated, all their classmates went to college and got [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2440.48s)]
*  scholarships. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2445.96s)]
*  Nakaiya got a full ride to the pharmacy school at Xavier University in New Orleans. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2447.16s)]
*  Kelsey, the class valedictorian, is studying environmental engineering at Louisiana State [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2452.52s)]
*  University. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2458.36s)]
*  So, wait a minute, neither one of you is going to pursue a career in math? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2459.36s)]
*  No. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2463.56s)]
*  No. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2464.56s)]
*  I may take up a minor in math, but I don't want that to be my job job. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2465.56s)]
*  People might expect too much out of me if I'm a mathematician. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2471.76s)]
*  But math is not completely in their rearview mirrors. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2475.88s)]
*  This spring, they submitted their high school proofs for final peer review and publication [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2479.6s)]
*  and are still working on further proofs of the Pythagorean theorem. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2485.32s)]
*  Since their first two... [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2490.08s)]
*  We found five and then we found a general format that could potentially produce at least [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2491.56s)]
*  five additional proofs. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2496.36s)]
*  And you're not math geniuses? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2498.12s)]
*  No. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2499.6s)]
*  No. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2500.6s)]
*  I'm not buying it. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2501.6s)]
*  Now, the last minute of 60 minutes. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2505.88s)]
*  Tonight an update of a story from October. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2516.2400000000002s)]
*  A quiet invasion of the country of Georgia. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2518.8s)]
*  As the nation's president, Salome Zorabishvili, told Sharon Alfonsi, Russia occupies 20% of [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2522.6s)]
*  Georgia, even as Georgia applies for membership in the European Union. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2529.12s)]
*  A proposed law in Georgia's parliament could scuttle that membership. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2534.0s)]
*  Resembling Russian legislation, it opens the way for a crackdown on journalists, aid groups, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2538.56s)]
*  and other international agencies, and may draw Georgia away from democracy and closer [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2544.3999999999996s)]
*  to Russia's orbit. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2549.7999999999997s)]
*  This past week, Georgians took to the streets in protest. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2551.7599999999998s)]
*  They faced off against water cannons, tear gas, and riot police. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2555.7s)]
*  The government is expected to pass the law, but Georgia's president, Zorabishvili, has [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXMY9w0KRK8&t=2561.12s)]
