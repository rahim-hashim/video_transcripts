# The War in Gaza; The Prisoners; Wood to Whiskey | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM)
*  The war in Gaza is at a critical moment. A failed ceasefire, Israeli hostages still [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=0.0s)]
*  captive, and in Gaza's failing hospitals, volunteers fighting to save lives. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=13.44s)]
*  I can't stop bombs. I can't rescue hostages. But I can stand next to you. I can live amongst [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=20.44s)]
*  you. And it's not much, but it beats sparing your head and hatred and violence and ignorance. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=26.88s)]
*  Who did the U.S. government deport to El Salvador? 60 Minutes has been investigating the secretive [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=37.8s)]
*  operation that sent more than 200 men to a notorious Salvadoran prison, despite many [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=43.46s)]
*  not having criminal records. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=49.68s)]
*  Our client who was in the middle of seeking asylum just disappeared. One day he was there [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=52.16s)]
*  and the next day we're supposed to have court and he wasn't brought to court. You use the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  word disappeared. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=62.81999999999999s)]
*  Tonight we explore the fascinating life of the whiskey barrel, an ancient product that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  still plays a vital role in global commerce. Millions of new oak barrels are built in America [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=72.24s)]
*  every year, fired up and then filled with what will become bourbon through years of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=78.72s)]
*  aging as the wood delivers magic to the whiskey. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=84.28s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. I'm Bill Whitaker. I'm Anderson Cooper. I'm Sharon Alfonsi. I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=90.92s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. I'm Scott Pelli. Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=97.68s)]
*  Dr. Samer Attar is an orthopedic surgeon in Chicago, a professor of surgery at Northwestern, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=108.72s)]
*  and recently among the brave volunteers fighting for life in the war in Gaza. Gaza is 25 miles [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=118.84s)]
*  long and home to 2 million Palestinians, descendants of those displaced in the 1948 creation of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=127.2s)]
*  Israel. Gaza is ruled by a terrorist group called Hamas and in 2023 Hamas attacked Israel, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=134.68s)]
*  an atrocity that Israel says killed 1200 civilians, including 40 children, and captured 251. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  Israel's war to free its hostages and defeat Hamas has killed an estimated 50,000 Palestinians, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  15,000 of them children, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. The UN says [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=162.4s)]
*  92% of Gaza housing has been damaged. Last week on 60 Minutes, Leslie Stahl reported [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=169.88s)]
*  on the trauma and torture suffered by Israeli hostages. Tonight we have the story of the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=178.12s)]
*  desperate fight to save Gaza's civilians through the charity of nations and the mercy [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=185.32s)]
*  of volunteers like Samer Attar. That's Dr. Attar battling a stalled heart. The patient [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=191.58s)]
*  is a paramedic. An explosion near his ambulance killed his partner. But it's not just the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=201.98000000000002s)]
*  paramedics. Healthcare itself is dying in Gaza, with 33 hospitals damaged and the rest [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=208.54000000000002s)]
*  starved of supplies. Imagine 50 people showing up all at once. And 15 of them are dead on [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  arrival. And they're all trying to get into the emergency room and there's no place to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=230.44s)]
*  step. And there's not enough beds, so you're working and resuscitating and operating on [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=235.38s)]
*  patients on the floors smeared with dirt and blood. And you'd see just little kids [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=241.66s)]
*  shredded and twisted. Their insides falling out, dismembered, missing arms and legs. I [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=255.01999999999998s)]
*  remember one little girl just pounding her fists on the floor, just refusing to believe [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=263.26s)]
*  that her mom was dead. But they had to just forcefully pull her away to make room for [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=269.86s)]
*  incoming wounded because the pace of the wounded just doesn't stop. They keep coming. When [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=274.86s)]
*  these patients come into the emergency room, what is it that you don't have? There's no [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=280.98s)]
*  sterility. Anesthesia is kind of a luxury sometimes. We had two kids come in, two young [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=289.14s)]
*  kids involved in an explosion. One was missing skin over half of his body. The other one, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=296.21999999999997s)]
*  we did an emergency amputation of his leg. Both could have been saved. They were both [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=301.46s)]
*  brothers. But I remember the anesthesia doctor on the phone begging the blood bank for blood. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=306.82s)]
*  And there's only so much blood to give. And the blood bank said, sorry, we don't have [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=312.97999999999996s)]
*  any more to give you. We just can't give you any more. And it was a Palestinian doctor. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=315.58s)]
*  He collapsed to the ground crying. And he said he can't take it anymore because he's [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=321.66s)]
*  lost so many kids for something as simple as a blood transfusion. And that kid just, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=328.14000000000004s)]
*  we just sat back and helplessly watched him die on the operating room table. And his brother [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  was the same story. He could have been saved, but we didn't have blood. And he died the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=339.08000000000004s)]
*  next day. When anesthesia is a luxury, what do you do? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=344.94000000000005s)]
*  You say you're sorry a lot. It's not something you ever really want to be involved in. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=351.58s)]
*  This is a gentleman that showed up with an explosive injury to his hand. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=355.53999999999996s)]
*  Samer Atar is 49. His parents were Syrian doctors who immigrated to the U.S. in the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=360.58s)]
*  60s. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=367.58s)]
*  How many trips in does this make for you? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=368.65999999999997s)]
*  This is number four. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=370.58s)]
*  We met Dr. Atar in 2016 as he volunteered in the Syrian war. He's also worked in Ukraine. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=372.97999999999996s)]
*  This was his fifth mission to Gaza on rotations that last two or three weeks. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=382.58s)]
*  The bombs land so close. You feel the hospital shaking. At times the fighting and conflict [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=391.38s)]
*  is so intense you feel like the hospital is going to collapse on top of you. And there [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=399.65999999999997s)]
*  have been instances of hospitals that were attacked, that were invaded. So there's really [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=406.06s)]
*  no safe space. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=411.78s)]
*  Gaza medical facilities and ambulances have been attacked 670 times according to the [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=414.12s)]
*  U.N. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=420.26s)]
*  But the Israeli military says Hamas uses hospitals for shelter and arsenals. Dr. Atar has worked [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=423.97999999999996s)]
*  in five Gaza hospitals. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=432.17999999999995s)]
*  The Israelis would tell you that they are attacking these facilities when they do because [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=435.38s)]
*  Hamas is using them as command and control centers. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=441.38s)]
*  I just saw doctors and nurses and patients. I didn't see any tunnels. I didn't see any [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=446.5s)]
*  uniformed Hamas soldiers. I didn't see any hostages. If I did, I would have said and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=452.94s)]
*  done something about it. But I didn't. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=459.94s)]
*  As for the paramedic we saw earlier, Dr. Atar did restart his heart, but he doesn't know [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=468.34s)]
*  if the man lived. The doctor can't keep up with so many wounded. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=474.18s)]
*  It occurs to me that you have all of these patients in your memory and you never find [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=480.1s)]
*  out what happened to them. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=486.92s)]
*  Yeah, I remember. I remember all of them. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=489.92s)]
*  A few of his patients are evacuated. Israel has permitted a total of about 7,000 through [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=502.24s)]
*  its blockade. More than 300 children were medevaced by the Gulf state of Qatar in an [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=509.32s)]
*  act of charity that saw the patients escape the poorest place on earth for one of the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=516.4000000000001s)]
*  richest. Qatar's $8 billion Sidra Hospital opened a ward for the Gaza children. Dr. Mansour [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=523.2800000000001s)]
*  Ali is head of surgery. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=533.12s)]
*  How important was it to some of these patients to get out of Gaza? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=535.84s)]
*  Some of these patients are in a life and death situation because if they stayed there, they [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=540.84s)]
*  would have died from complication of their injuries, from wound infection and septic [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=546.12s)]
*  shocks and things. They could have died. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=553.12s)]
*  One of those saved is two-year-old Sanad. Sanad's grandmother Marwa Al-Arabi told us [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=556.24s)]
*  that their neighborhood was bombed one year ago. Sanad's face and tongue were torn apart. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=564.16s)]
*  He lost one arm. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=570.96s)]
*  Eleven people were killed, she told us, including my uncle, my brother-in-law and my daughter's [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=574.24s)]
*  children. All my children were injured. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=581.36s)]
*  The first time that you saw Sanad, after he was injured, what did you see? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=584.36s)]
*  I was hysterical. The sight was so horrifying. I didn't think he would survive. I thought [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=592.6800000000001s)]
*  he was taking his last breath. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=599.8s)]
*  Sanad and the others have been recovering in Qatar about a year. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=604.8s)]
*  How many of you lost your home? Almost all of you? How many of you lost one of your parents? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=610.04s)]
*  This girl suffered a traumatic head injury, repaired with a plate in her skull. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=617.04s)]
*  They bombed my grandfather's house, she told us. I was about to leave the house when a [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=625.92s)]
*  piece of shrapnel hit my head. Two of my brothers were killed. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=632.92s)]
*  I was in the hospital. I was in the hospital. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=636.92s)]
*  Two of my brothers were killed, along with my grandfather and grandmother. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=640.92s)]
*  Fifteen-year-old Lama told us that she was unconscious in a Gaza hospital for a week. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=652.92s)]
*  I didn't know what had happened, she said. I learned my leg was amputated. It was a month [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=660.92s)]
*  before I learned that my sister and brother had been killed. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=666.52s)]
*  Let's take off your shoes, okay? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=669.92s)]
*  Many of the children are patients of Dr. Lisa Thornton, chief of pediatric rehabilitation [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=671.92s)]
*  at Sidra. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=678.36s)]
*  This was my first time ever having any experience with war trauma. I'm from Chicago. I've seen [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=680.1999999999999s)]
*  a lot of trauma, a lot of violent trauma, but I had never seen anything like this. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=687.92s)]
*  What can you do to rehabilitate them? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=694.0s)]
*  Our goal is to get them back to childhood. Really, the primary occupation of childhood [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=696.84s)]
*  is play. We want to be able to get these kids back to being able to play. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=702.76s)]
*  If you have a child with multiple amputations, how can you achieve that? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=707.8000000000001s)]
*  First of all, we're blessed that children are resilient. If they're not in pain and [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=714.8000000000001s)]
*  they can move, they often figure it out. I had one young man who, sadly, both of his [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=720.72s)]
*  arms were blown off, so he had amputations here at the shoulders. He's nine years old. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=727.6s)]
*  Within a few weeks, he was using his feet. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=734.84s)]
*  What has he been able to do with his feet? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=737.52s)]
*  Well, he can feed himself. He can write a little bit, because you can hold a pen with [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=740.0s)]

*  What gives you hope? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=757.9s)]
*  Well, the kids. The children give me hope. They're playful and they're energetic and [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=759.62s)]
*  they're surviving. I believe that the human spirit is incredible, and the spirit of children [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=765.9399999999999s)]
*  is more than any of us have as adults. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=773.18s)]
*  For every child that is evacuated from Gaza, how many are left behind who need that kind [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=778.74s)]
*  of care? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=787.42s)]
*  Thousands. Thousands. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=791.42s)]
*  Those were the patients in the mind of Samir Attar when we met in Qatar. He told us many [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=793.82s)]
*  that he recalls were not wounded at all, but starving, because of the blockade. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=799.38s)]
*  I remember a kid called Karam. He was suffering from significant malnutrition. There just [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=806.26s)]
*  wasn't enough food and water where his mom was at, and he was in the ICU. His mom asked [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=814.34s)]
*  me to come meet him. I started talking to her, and then the nurses told me that Karam [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=820.06s)]
*  had been dead for over an hour. Mom just refused to let the nurses take away his body. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=826.58s)]
*  She kept showing me videos of what he used to look like and how he was so playful and [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=833.58s)]
*  how he was so kind, and she just couldn't believe that because they didn't have enough [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=838.32s)]
*  food and water, he didn't make it. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=843.34s)]
*  Israel's prime minister has said his country ensures humanitarian assistance reaches those [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=846.82s)]
*  in need. But the UN says Gaza is at risk of famine, and two million are homeless. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=852.86s)]
*  Thousands have protested in Gaza, calling for the end of the Hamas regime. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=860.42s)]
*  There's a lot of suffering. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=866.82s)]
*  Yeah, I can't stop bombs. I can't rescue hostages. I can't solve this crisis. I can't [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=868.02s)]

*  grief. I can feel your fear. I can serve your community. I can bear witness to your suffering, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=883.22s)]
*  and then just make some noise about it. And it's not much, but it beats bearing your [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=890.9s)]
*  head in hatred and violence and ignorance. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=896.54s)]
*  This violence began with the attack on Israel. In a two-month ceasefire earlier this year, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=903.14s)]
*  many Israeli hostages were released, but Israel believes 24 living hostages remain. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=909.54s)]
*  In our story last week, former hostages told Leslie Stahl of torture. Yarden Bebas spoke [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=916.76s)]
*  of Hamas terrorists murdering his wife and two children in cold blood. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=923.4s)]
*  Now, Israel is pressing its military campaign and has cut off nearly all food and humanitarian [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=929.42s)]
*  aid. In the 19th month of suffering, there is no end in sight. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=937.42s)]
*  Three weeks ago, 238 Venezuelan migrants were flown from Texas to a maximum security prison [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=951.8199999999999s)]
*  in El Salvador. That country's president offered to take them, and the Trump administration [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=958.26s)]
*  used a law not invoked since World War II to send them, claiming they are all terrorists [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=964.0600000000001s)]
*  and violent gang members. The government has released very little information about the [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=969.62s)]
*  men, but through internal government documents, we've obtained a list of their identities [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=974.62s)]
*  and found that an overwhelming majority have no apparent criminal convictions or even criminal [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=979.9000000000001s)]
*  charges. They are now prisoners. Among them, a makeup artist, a soccer player, and a food [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=985.62s)]
*  delivery driver, being held in a place so harsh that El Salvador's justice minister once said [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=992.66s)]
*  the only way out is in a coffin. The shackled men were forced to lower their heads and bodies [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=998.26s)]
*  as they were unloaded from buses and taken to El Salvador's mega prison known as the [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1006.2199999999999s)]
*  Terrorism Confinement Center, or SECOT. Andres Hernandez Romero was among them. Andres is [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1011.4799999999999s)]
*  a 31-year-old Venezuelan. He's a makeup artist. He is a gay man. He loves to do theater. He [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1019.28s)]
*  was part of a theater troupe in his hometown. Lindsay Toslowski, Andres' attorney, says [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1027.84s)]
*  he does not have a criminal record in the United States or Venezuela. She says he left [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1033.8s)]
*  his home country last year because he was targeted for being gay and for his political [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1039.24s)]
*  issues. Last May, Andres made the long trek north through the Darien Gap to Mexico, where [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1044.52s)]
*  he eventually got an appointment to seek asylum in the United States. At a legal border crossing [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1050.8799999999999s)]
*  near San Diego, he was taken into custody while his case was processed. Did he have [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1056.68s)]
*  a strong asylum case? We believe he did have a strong asylum case. He had also done a credible [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1062.32s)]
*  fear interview, which is the very first part of seeking asylum in the United States, and [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1068.1s)]
*  the government had found that his threats against him were credible and that he had [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1073.0s)]
*  a real probability of winning an asylum claim. But last month, Andres did not appear for [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1077.6s)]
*  a court hearing. Our client who was in the middle of seeking asylum just disappeared. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1083.1s)]
*  One day he was there and the next day we're supposed to have court and he wasn't brought [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1089.2s)]
*  to court. You use the word disappeared. Yeah, I use that word because that's what happened. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1093.92s)]
*  But Andres did appear in photos taken by Time magazine photographer Philip Holsinger, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1100.28s)]
*  who was there when the Venezuelans arrived at Secote. Holsinger told us he heard a young [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1105.68s)]
*  man say, I'm not a gang member, I'm gay, I'm a stylist. And then he cried for his [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1111.2s)]
*  mother as he was slapped and had his head shaved. By comparing Holsinger's photographs [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1117.04s)]
*  to photos of Andres' tattoos taken by the government, we were able to confirm that this [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1122.8999999999999s)]
*  is Andres. His lawyer, who was representing him pro bono, had never seen these photos [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1128.12s)]
*  before. It's horrifying to see someone who we've met and know as a sweet, funny artist [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1134.4399999999998s)]
*  in the most horrible conditions I could imagine. You fear for Andres' safety in there? Absolutely. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1148.9199999999998s)]
*  We have grave concerns about whether he can survive. In October, Tom Homan, who is now [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1157.52s)]
*  the White House border czar, told 60 Minutes the Trump administration's mass deportation [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1163.94s)]
*  plan would start by removing the worst of the worst. We're going to prioritize those [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1169.32s)]
*  with convictions. We're going to prioritize those security threats. We have to do that. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1174.52s)]
*  You got to get the worst first. But are they the worst? The Trump administration has yet [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1177.6399999999999s)]
*  of the Venezuelan men it sent to El Salvador last month. We obtained internal government [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1183.44s)]
*  documents listing their names and any known criminal information. We cross-referenced [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1189.24s)]
*  that with domestic and international court filings, news reports, and arrest records [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1194.48s)]
*  whenever we could find them. At least 22% of the men on the list have criminal records [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1199.64s)]
*  here in the United States or abroad. The vast majority are for nonviolent offenses like [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1205.96s)]
*  theft, shoplifting, and trespassing. About a dozen are accused of murder, rape, assault, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1211.58s)]
*  and kidnapping. For 3% of those deported, it is unclear whether a criminal record exists. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1217.9399999999998s)]
*  But we could not find criminal records for 75% of the Venezuelan's 179 men now sitting [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1224.74s)]
*  in prison. In response to our findings, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1232.1799999999998s)]
*  said many of those without criminal records, quote, are actually terrorists, human rights [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1238.6s)]
*  abusers, gangsters, and more. They just don't have a rap sheet in the U.S. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1244.08s)]
*  Border czar Tom Homan said immigration agents spent hours conducting rigorous checks on [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1249.52s)]

*  government presented in immigration court were these pictures of his tattoos, crowns [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1281.84s)]
*  which immigration authorities say can be a symbol of Tren de Aragua. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1287.6s)]
*  These are tattoos that not only have a plausible explanation because he is someone who worked [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1292.1200000000001s)]
*  in the beauty pageant industry, but also the crowns themselves were on top of the names [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1297.8799999999999s)]
*  of his parents. The most plausible explanation for that are that his mom and dad are his [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1302.72s)]
*  king and queen. Could it be possible that there is something [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1307.4399999999998s)]
*  that perhaps the government knows that you don't? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1312.0s)]
*  I don't think that that is possible. But if it was possible that they had some information, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1315.32s)]
*  they should follow the Constitution, present that information, give us the ability to reply [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1321.1999999999998s)]

*  said on social media that its intelligence assessments go well beyond just gang-affiliate [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1330.4s)]

*  We went back a decade and could only find photos like these. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1342.88s)]
*  Tattoos and social media were also used to link another Venezuelan migrant, Herce Reyes [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1348.04s)]
*  to the Tren de Aragua gang. Immigration court documents include this Facebook post from [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1354.0s)]

*  Herce was a soccer player in Venezuela. His lawyer says the tattoo honors his favorite [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1377.6799999999998s)]

*  wood, barrels have a long and fascinating history. First built and used by the Celts [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1766.16s)]
*  and Romans, they have held nearly every commodity over the centuries. Metal and plastic and [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1771.52s)]
*  cardboard long ago eclipsed barrels for the shipment of most items, but when it comes [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1777.4s)]
*  to wine and whiskey, especially bourbon whiskey, the oak barrel still reigns, not just as a [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1782.46s)]
*  container, but for the magic that the wood gives the whiskey. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1789.46s)]
*  We were speaking with someone and they called a whiskey barrel a breathing time machine. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1794.46s)]
*  I love that. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1803.6200000000001s)]

*  50 plus years. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1826.72s)]
*  50 plus years, yeah. I'll go to different places and look at barrels at distilleries [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1827.98s)]
*  or wineries around the world and I can see barrels that my grandfather made in the 1960s. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1833.2600000000002s)]
*  I still see them. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1840.7800000000002s)]
*  A barrel begins as a log from a white oak tree fed into what's known as a stave mill [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1843.18s)]
*  where it's cut into ever smaller pieces, staves, which are then arranged in huge Jenga style [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1852.1000000000001s)]
*  stacks and seasoned outdoors for three to six months before heading to a nearby cooperage [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1858.46s)]
*  where the barrels are built. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1865.0600000000002s)]
*  There's no nails will go here, no glue. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1866.9s)]
*  Brad Boswell's newest cooperage produces thousands of barrels every day. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1869.98s)]
*  How many of these go into a typical barrel? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1875.66s)]
*  Typically between 28 and 32 staves per barrel. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1878.54s)]
*  After a barrel is raised mostly by hand, it travels through a host of other steps and [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1883.06s)]
*  checks to make it ready to begin its life, including being toasted and then charred on [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1888.8600000000001s)]
*  the inside. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1895.54s)]
*  These are the barrels that make the air bespoke. We know exactly who this barrel is going to, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1897.14s)]
*  which distilleries. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1900.9s)]
*  How about that? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1901.7s)]
*  The demand for such a huge volume of barrels can be attributed mainly to one thing, bourbon. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1903.1000000000001s)]
*  President Franklin Roosevelt in the 30s became more specific about what bourbon whiskey should [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1911.98s)]
*  be and at that time he said bourbon should be in new charred oak barrels. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1916.7s)]
*  So if it's not in one of these barrels, it's not bourbon. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1921.5400000000002s)]
*  That's correct. Bourbon has to be aged in a new charred oak container. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1924.78s)]
*  That rule, plus booming consumer demand for bourbon starting in the early 2000s, has been [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1931.5s)]
*  very good for the barrel business. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1936.94s)]
*  3.2 million new barrels were filled with whiskey last year in Kentucky alone and more than [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1942.02s)]
*  14 million full barrels are aging in the state in massive warehouses known as rick houses. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1949.7s)]
*  How many barrels are in this rick house? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1957.3799999999999s)]
*  23,500 on six floors. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1959.94s)]
*  Dan Calloway is the master blender for Bardstown Bourbon, a young but fast growing Kentucky [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1963.18s)]
*  distillery. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1970.02s)]
*  To make a great whiskey you have to start with a great distillate, a clear spirit, but [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1970.78s)]
*  then the magic comes from the barrel. The fact that it's new charred oak, it's just [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1975.3400000000001s)]
*  incredible. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1979.66s)]
*  So the barrel is crucial to your product? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1980.66s)]
*  Absolutely. Depending who you talk to, some would say 50% of the flavor, maybe up to 70, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1984.14s)]
*  80% of the character is derived from that barrel. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1988.98s)]
*  The rest of the flavor comes from what's known as the mash bill. Grains like corn and wheat [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1992.5s)]
*  and rye that are mixed with water and fermented with yeast. Despite Bourbon having recently [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=1999.82s)]
*  been threatened or hit with tariffs by other countries in retaliation for President Trump's [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2005.82s)]
*  tariffs, Bardstown's huge distillery is still producing enough new whiskey to fill more [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2011.78s)]
*  than 5,000 barrels a week. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2019.3s)]
*  You take the clear liquid, which is basically what people call moonshine, go to the bar [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2022.3s)]
*  goes through this process and comes out as this beautiful brown tasty liquid here. How [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2029.5s)]
*  does that happen? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2035.86s)]
*  I always compare it to a seesaw. So when it comes off the still, moonshine like you said, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2037.26s)]
*  it's a seesaw that's out of balance. But every year that goes by of the barrel aging, the [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2043.62s)]
*  seesaw comes into balance. And what the barrel is bringing is caramel, vanilla, baking spice, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2049.62s)]
*  all this rich beautiful color. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2056.62s)]
*  How can solid oak produce all those flavors and spices? Back where the barrels are built, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2058.94s)]
*  Brad Boswell gave us a vivid lesson with a barrel that had just been toasted, a process [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2065.42s)]
*  that brings sugars in the wood to the surface. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2071.12s)]
*  Smell that, smell that. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2073.86s)]
*  That does smell delicious. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2075.86s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2077.86s)]
*  It really does. It's amazing. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2078.86s)]
*  There's a reason why people still use oak barrels 2,000 years later. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2080.86s)]
*  So when I'm sipping the bourbon, I'm sipping this barrel. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2085.86s)]
*  That's right. Absolutely. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2090.86s)]
*  After toasting, we and the barrels moved to the visually stunning char oven. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2092.6600000000003s)]
*  So we'll see this barrel coming through right here. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2097.6600000000003s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2100.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so actually the inside of the barrel is on fire. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2101.6600000000003s)]
*  So you just light the barrel on fire. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2104.6600000000003s)]
*  Yep, we light the barrel on fire. And that teases out more and more the flavors. And [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2106.6600000000003s)]
*  we call that an alligator char because the inside of the barrel actually looks like kind [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2112.46s)]
*  of an alligator's back. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2115.46s)]
*  And you can see. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2117.46s)]
*  We could see that blistering inside a newly charred barrel pulled off the line. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2118.8599999999997s)]
*  I mean, people expect this to smell like a campfire. It smells more like a confectionery [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2123.8599999999997s)]
*  product. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2128.8599999999997s)]
*  It does. I can smell the caramel and the vanilla. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2129.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2132.8599999999997s)]
*  What that barrel can give to the whiskey is evident in these glasses. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2133.8599999999997s)]
*  So this is the same exact distillate that came off the still at the exact same time, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2137.86s)]
*  went into a barrel four years later, and this we just kept in a glass bottle. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2142.86s)]
*  It's also apparent in the taste. First, the white lightning. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2146.86s)]
*  Wow, that gives a punch. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2151.86s)]
*  Yes, it does. It does. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2153.86s)]
*  And then the barrel-aged bourbon. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2155.86s)]
*  Oh, big difference. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2158.86s)]
*  Huge difference. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2160.86s)]
*  Smooth. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2161.86s)]
*  Oh, it's smooth. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2162.86s)]
*  The reason for that smooth comes from temperature swings in the rick houses, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2163.86s)]
*  according to Bardstown Bourbon's Dan Calloway. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2167.86s)]
*  We want those swings. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2170.86s)]
*  When it gets really hot, things expand, lets the liquid in. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2172.86s)]
*  When it gets cold, it contracts. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2177.86s)]
*  And it's that natural progression of in-out that ages the bourbon so beautifully as the liquid interacts with the wood. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2180.86s)]
*  As those barrels are aging whiskey for four, five, or six years, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2187.86s)]
*  some savvy investors have figured out there's money to be made. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2191.86s)]
*  Whiskey is an interesting asset in the sense that as it ages, it becomes more valuable. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2196.86s)]
*  Chris Heller is co-founder of California-based Cordillera Investment Partners. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2203.86s)]
*  So explain to me how this works. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2208.86s)]
*  You go up to a distiller and say, I want to buy those barrels filled with what will eventually become bourbon. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2211.86s)]
*  So that is exactly right. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2221.86s)]
*  Heller and his partners buy thousands of newly filled barrels from distillers, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2223.86s)]
*  pay to store them as the whiskey ages, then sell them to craft bourbon brands. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2228.86s)]
*  What are your starting costs? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2234.86s)]
*  Somewhere in the $600 to $1,000 range is sort of the price of what's called a new-filled barrel of whiskey. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2235.86s)]
*  At the end, what do you sell it for? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2242.86s)]
*  It can be anywhere from $2,000 to $4,000 by the end. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2244.86s)]
*  That's a pretty good return on your investment. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2251.86s)]
*  We really find it an interesting and compelling investment area. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2254.86s)]
*  Nice way to say it, huh? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2258.86s)]
*  Whoever makes it, owns it or ages it, when bourbon is emptied from a barrel after five or six years, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2265.86s)]
*  that barrel's life is just beginning and it's likely to travel the world. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2272.86s)]
*  It's really interesting that when the bourbon barrel is freshly dumped, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2279.86s)]
*  there's still around two gallons of actually bourbon trapped in that wood. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2282.86s)]
*  That is just seeped into the wood. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2287.86s)]
*  So then a lot of secondary users actually look forward to putting their product into the barrel again [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2289.86s)]
*  for four, six, ten, a lot of scotches, 12 years, 18 years. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2296.86s)]
*  And it can pick up that American bourbon taste. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2300.86s)]
*  Absolutely, and it pulls out that sweet bourbon. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2303.86s)]
*  That sweet taste in the wood makes used bourbon barrels very hot commodities. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2305.86s)]
*  We really view our role in the industry as moving as many barrels from the original source [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2312.86s)]
*  to the next stopping point as fast as possible. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2318.86s)]
*  Jess and Ben Lowsky own Midwest Barrels. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2321.86s)]
*  Their Kentucky warehouse is stacked to the rafters with empty barrels. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2324.86s)]
*  So we're the next stop for the second use of that barrel. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2329.86s)]
*  So in Kentucky here, we bring in barrels from all the major distilleries and then send them back out. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2332.86s)]
*  These barrels will be shipped out and then refilled with something else. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2337.86s)]
*  Correct, yeah. So the idea is to get these barrels in here and out of here as quickly as possible. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2341.86s)]
*  So we'll turn over this entire warehouse every two to three weeks. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2346.86s)]
*  Probably 70 to 80 percent of our business is overseas. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2350.86s)]
*  It started as a hobby. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2354.86s)]
*  While Ben was finishing his PhD in Nebraska, he began buying barrels and selling them to local craft breweries. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2356.86s)]
*  You said that a few barrels were a big order in the beginning. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2364.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2369.86s)]
*  What's a big order today? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2370.86s)]
*  Ten thousand. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2372.86s)]
*  Ten thousand. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2373.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2374.86s)]
*  India and China and Scotland and Ireland are by far four biggest markets. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2375.86s)]
*  The Kentucky Distillers Association says that the state exported more than $300 million worth of used barrels last year, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2380.86s)]
*  just to Scotland, where they'll be used to age Scotch whiskey for up to 40 years. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2389.86s)]
*  Could you just tick off for me the different spirits that these barrels will hold? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2395.86s)]
*  They start with bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, Scotch whiskey, tequila, rum, Pisco Maine Peru, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2402.86s)]
*  Cachaca Maine Brazil will use these barrels. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2411.86s)]
*  Beer. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2414.86s)]
*  Beer uses them. These barrels for sure end up in China. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2415.86s)]
*  A lot of these barrels end up in Japan. It's everywhere. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2418.86s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2424.86s)]
*  Now, master blenders like Bardstown's Dan Callaway... [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2425.86s)]
*  This will be cast strength direct from the barrel. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2429.86s)]
*  ...are bringing barrels back to Kentucky to do special finishes for their whiskeys. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2432.86s)]
*  So this is the first of its kind. It is an American whiskey finished in Indian whiskey barrels. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2438.86s)]
*  Indian whiskey is traditionally aged in a bourbon barrel. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2447.86s)]
*  So the physical barrel has left Kentucky, gone to Bangalore, filled with a barley, and then sent back here. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2453.86s)]
*  Callaway finished this whiskey in those barrels for 17 months. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2463.86s)]
*  My God, that's good. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2468.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2470.86s)]
*  Dan Callaway's newest creation, called Cathedral, may be his most miraculous yet. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2472.86s)]
*  We sourced wood in the Loire Valley, the Berset Forest, and this plot, this lot in the forest was selected to repair Notre Dame after the fires. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2479.86s)]
*  So most of the wood went there. We were fortunate to obtain six barrels made from that wood. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2492.86s)]
*  And we picked our best stocks of Kentucky bourbon up to 19 years old, filled the barrels. They aged for 14 months. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2500.86s)]
*  You know how wild that is? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2511.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2513.86s)]
*  That the beams that restored Notre Dame come from the same forest as your casks. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2514.86s)]
*  The same lot. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2520.86s)]
*  Now that's a story to tell. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2521.86s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2523.86s)]
*  And a whiskey to taste. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2524.86s)]
*  Ah, that's nice. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2528.86s)]
*  Now, the last minute of 60 Minutes. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2539.86s)]
*  Next week on 60 Minutes, we return to DeepMind, Google's laboratory for artificial intelligence where robots are learning to reason. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2543.86s)]
*  Hey, robot, put the blocks whose color is the combination of yellow and blue into the matching color ball. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2554.86s)]
*  The combination of yellow and blue is green. And it figured that out. It's reasoning. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2563.86s)]
*  Yeah, definitely, yes. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2571.86s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. That story and more next week on another edition of 60 Minutes. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIOnmB54EM&t=2574.86s)]
