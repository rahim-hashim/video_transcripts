# Rescue from Saigon and other miraculous escapes | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [December 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q)
*  You've heard of the brave and ingenious rescue of Jews from the Nazis by Oskar Schindler, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=0.0s)]
*  and the courageous and unlikely rescue of the American hostages from Iran depicted in [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=19.12s)]
*  the movie Argo. But nobody's heard of the daring and dangerous rescue of the Vietnamese [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=24.32s)]
*  from Saigon by John Reardon. It's a story that's never been told before. It happened [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=30.32s)]
*  nearly 40 years ago at the very end of the Vietnam War when everyone was trying to escape [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=37.28s)]
*  the communist incursion. No one was paying attention to an unassuming American banker [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=42.8s)]
*  who had already been evacuated going back in to save his stranded Vietnamese colleagues [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=49.2s)]
*  and their families. You got everybody, everybody worked at the bank, spouses and children. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=55.68000000000001s)]
*  Right. There were 105 in all who John Reardon, risking his own life, rescued in the last days [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=63.52s)]
*  of the war. Even now, four decades later, when they see him, you know they know he's the reason [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  they're alive. Today, they're leading prosperous lives as American citizens with children who are [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=78.0s)]
*  doctors and lawyers and with grandchildren. The bell, do you know my name? John Reardon. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=84.72s)]
*  You know, I'll ask that's more than I know. John Reardon was as far from Rambo and Mission [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=91.92s)]
*  Impossible as you could get. Back in 1975, he was a young banker, handsome and unattached, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=97.2s)]
*  working as the assistant manager of Citibank in Saigon. They gave you a villa. They gave me a villa. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=105.12s)]
*  And you lived well. I lived well, yes. He hosted barbecues at the villa for the bank's 34 Vietnamese [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=111.36s)]
*  employees. Tellers, secretaries, accountants, they were like a family, tying their future to American [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=118.4s)]
*  banking. But that April, communist tanks were barreling towards Saigon. Hundreds of thousands [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=126.16s)]
*  were leaving or trying to. Three weeks before Saigon fell, John got an order from Citibank in [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=135.04s)]
*  New York, burn everything important and get out. They said, John, we've chartered a 747 Pan Am that's [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=143.44s)]
*  coming in and we want you to take all of your staff and leave the bank and get out to this plane. By [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=151.44s)]
*  this point, it dawns on you what would happen to those people if you didn't get them out? Yeah, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=158.0s)]
*  some of them would be killed. It's scary. It was very scary. Cook Pham Vo worked in personnel. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=163.28s)]
*  Chi Vu was the head teller. They were hearing rumors of reprisals by the Viet Cong against [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=171.12s)]
*  anyone working for the Americans. Would you have been seen as traitors, as spies? The closer you to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=177.68s)]
*  American, the more they think you're a spy. But their own government set up checkpoints to keep [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=185.44s)]
*  people from leaving the country. Without exit papers, the staff had no way to escape. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=192.64s)]
*  John didn't want to leave without them, but the bank ordered him out. So he boarded that Pan Am [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=199.6s)]
*  flight to Hong Kong alone and the employees were left to fend for themselves. Did you feel abandoned? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=205.92s)]
*  Yes. Did John say anything to you when he left? I was crying so much. I was worried about my kids, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=212.88s)]
*  my husband. And he said, no worry, I'll be there for you. John and his bosses at Citibank spent [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=220.72s)]
*  day and night in Hong Kong cooking up rescue plans. They tried to send in helicopters, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=228.16s)]
*  even an oil tanker, and they asked the U.S. government to help, all in vain. I felt we had [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  all those people back in there and they were counting on us. And many, many times in the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=240.56s)]
*  conversations we had with them, they said to us, don't let us down. Please do everything you can. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=244.96s)]
*  But after two weeks of trying, Citibank said enough. A manager told the Hong Kong team, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=252.72s)]
*  if you try some daring rescue mission, you're fired. That night, John's immediate boss, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=258.72s)]
*  Mike McTie, a former Marine, asked John to dinner. And just as my steak arrived and I was picking up [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  my knife and fork and he's making small talk all of them, and then suddenly he says, you know, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=271.84s)]
*  John, one of us asked to go back. And I put down my knife and fork and pushed that steak back, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=275.67999999999995s)]
*  and I could feel tears coming out of my eyes. And he said, would you go back? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=283.44s)]
*  Go back, even though it meant losing his job, possibly losing his life. And yet, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=290.08s)]
*  11 days before Saigon would fall, the mild-mannered banker defied his bank and better judgment, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=296.64s)]
*  caught the very last commercial flight into Saigon and walked into the branch. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=304.08s)]
*  And everybody comes running around me and said, what do we do? What do we do? How are we going to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  get out of here and everything? But you're there under the authority of who? You're not working [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=313.36s)]
*  for Citibank. No one. I'm on my own. On his own authority, John moved them with their families, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=319.52s)]
*  all 105 of them, into his villa and another one nearby so they'd all be ready to go as a group [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=325.92s)]
*  when and if he came up with a plan. He told them to tell no one where they were. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  Four days went by. Nothing was working until a CIA agent told him the only way out now is on [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  U.S. military cargo planes that are evacuating Americans and their dependents. He says, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=347.92s)]
*  the evacuation has begun. Take your family and go out to the airport and process them through. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=354.88000000000005s)]
*  And I said, well, I don't have a family. And he said, just create a wife and children, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  no matter who they are, and go out there and sign the documents. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=369.68s)]
*  This is the first time you've heard this idea. Yes, yes. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=373.12s)]
*  Try and pass off his Vietnamese colleagues, their spouses and children as his family. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=376.56s)]
*  There were 105 of them. Do you say to him, are you kidding me, you don't say cockamamie? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=383.04s)]
*  No, no, because there'd been so much cockamania before that. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=389.92s)]
*  This is the time to jump on anything that looked like it was going to float. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=394.32s)]
*  You were at the end of your rope. Yes, absolutely. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=397.68s)]
*  It was worth a try, but not for all of them at once. He took the bank van and went out to [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  the airfield alone to see if it would work. I walked into that processing area and I, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=406.48s)]
*  somebody gave me a piece of paper. He said, list your dependence on here. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=412.48s)]
*  And I was fumbling for what piece of paper I was going to have to write this all down. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=416.32s)]
*  They said, just attach that to this piece of paper and keep going. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=419.36s)]
*  There were 15 names. You had a wife and 14 names. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  Right. That was kind of ambitious. Daughter, son, daughter, son. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=426.48s)]
*  This is the paper. Wife, daughter, daughter, son, 14 kids, some older than he was. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=430.8s)]
*  He was certifying on a U.S. government document that these were his children. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=438.8s)]
*  Is your heart pounding? Are you? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=443.68s)]
*  Yes, a little bit. I certainly was nervous. Yes. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=445.68s)]
*  He was stunned when the officer, no questions asked, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=448.48s)]
*  stamped it and handed John evacuation tags. He rushed to the villa to pick the 15 up, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=452.40000000000003s)]
*  amazed that such a crazy idea was actually working. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  Do you remember when he came back? What happened? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=463.44000000000005s)]
*  We're so happy. It's an elation to see he's a lifesaver. He an angel. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=465.84s)]
*  But you had to keep it secret, right? Yes. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=472.23999999999995s)]
*  You never told your parents? No. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=474.71999999999997s)]
*  So you never said goodbye? No. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=477.44s)]
*  Over the next four days, as fear gripped the city, John repeated this ruse, going back and forth [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=480.47999999999996s)]
*  to the airport 10 times, filling out papers with groups of six or eight. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=487.59999999999997s)]
*  Did any of these officers ever question you? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=493.36s)]
*  This one man, he said, haven't I seen you here before? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=497.04s)]
*  I said, no, sir. Absolutely not. Bang. I know he wanted to get going, too. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=501.28000000000003s)]
*  And then another time this man said, well, you've got one heck of a big family here. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=507.04s)]
*  You've been busy when you've been. I said, oh, yes, I've been here a long time. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=512.64s)]
*  So you just went back and back and back. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=518.16s)]
*  Hard to believe it would be that simple to do. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=521.36s)]
*  We recently met with seven of his daughters. They didn't think it was all that simple, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=523.92s)]
*  since John was separating them from their husbands. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=529.12s)]
*  All the staff, women, will go first and the husband will leave in a separate group. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=532.08s)]
*  At that moment, you know, I was like, thinking, will I ever meet and see my husband again? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=537.76s)]
*  Getting the husbands out was the most dangerous. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=547.6s)]
*  Yes, because they were either in the army or working for the government. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=550.64s)]
*  And if the MP, they saw anybody like that or they caught anybody like that, they would shoot right [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=558.72s)]
*  away. John was able to get the husband's fake adoption papers as his sons and managed to get [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=564.0s)]
*  some of them on what he thought was safe, a U.S. Embassy evacuation bus like this one to the airport. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=571.12s)]
*  But the bus was stopped by police looking for deserters. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=578.4s)]
*  The driver of the bus stopped at the checkpoint, opened the door, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=582.48s)]
*  and a Vietnamese police officer stepped onto the bus. And he looked up and down the aisle, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  and I thought, this is it. We're all going to be taken off this bus and shot. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=592.0s)]
*  But in a split second, a woman sitting in the front seat, a Vietnamese woman, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=596.96s)]
*  leaped up toward the policeman and poked her hands into his stomach. I thought she knifed him. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=602.5600000000001s)]
*  And then I saw a bag of something move from her hands to his hands. And I thought, aha, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=607.76s)]
*  it's a bribe. Bag of money. Bag of money, yes. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=612.9599999999999s)]
*  The bribe worked. He waved them through. The last group of men at the villa were afraid to risk [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=615.8399999999999s)]
*  another bus, but John was out of ideas. Finally, one of the men thought up an ingenious plan. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=622.7199999999999s)]
*  They pretended they were delivering bundles of money to the airport in the bank van. They even [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=631.04s)]
*  called the police for an escort like this. And they had rifles and everything, and they just [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=637.28s)]
*  led us right through the gates of the airport. You just went right on the plane with these guys? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=643.28s)]

*  One of them was Chi's husband. Every time I ask you about John, you cry. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  He's so kind, you know. You stay behind and take took us out. He did so much for us. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=656.88s)]
*  He saved my kids and my husband. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=668.0799999999999s)]
*  They flew on one of the last planes out of Saigon. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=672.72s)]
*  After that, the only route of escape were the helicopters at the U.S. Embassy. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=678.24s)]
*  Within a few days, Viet Cong tanks rolled into the presidential palace. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=687.36s)]
*  The war was over. What followed were years of starvation and brutal repression. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=692.4s)]
*  Many who tried to escape by boat drowned at sea. But thanks to John, the Citibank employees [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=699.52s)]
*  were flown out to either Guam or the Philippines and then all reunited at Camp Pendleton in California. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=706.72s)]
*  Do you think all this time you've been fired? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=714.24s)]
*  Yeah, I do still think that. I'm not worried about it, though. I'm still alive. They're all alive. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=716.48s)]
*  Important things. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=722.08s)]
*  Well, he wasn't fired. He was given a big bonus and hailed as a hero. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=723.36s)]
*  At the reunion for John in Long Island with a group of his children, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=729.12s)]
*  we found out they call him Papa. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=735.2s)]
*  Nice to see you. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=739.28s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=740.0s)]
*  I haven't talked to you in so long. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=741.04s)]
*  Citibank spent a million dollars to resettle all the employees, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=743.76s)]

*  We'll never forget you, too. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=751.2s)]
*  At the time in Saigon, he thought of his colleagues at the bank as his Vietnamese family. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=752.48s)]
*  Forty years later, still his family. But now, as American as... [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=759.04s)]
*  Do you think the people who came here have had good lives? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=766.96s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=771.04s)]
*  How many children do you actually have now? And grandchildren? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=772.5600000000001s)]
*  I just keep using the number 105, but the grandchildren, don't ask me. I can't keep up with that. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=775.2s)]
*  It's going to be... [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=780.5600000000001s)]
*  Now an extraordinary story from the Second World War, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=791.12s)]
*  a humanitarian story that didn't come to light for decades. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=794.72s)]
*  It concerns a young Londoner named Nicholas Winton who went to Prague [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=799.2s)]
*  and ended up saving the lives of 669 children, mostly Jews, from almost certain death. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=803.76s)]
*  His story begins at the end of 1938 with Europe on the brink of war. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=811.68s)]
*  In Germany, violence against Jews was escalating, and the infamous Munich Agreement [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=816.16s)]
*  paved the way for Hitler's armies to march unopposed into Czechoslovakia. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=822.8s)]
*  In London, Nicholas Winton had been following events and knew that refugees fleeing the Nazis [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=827.76s)]
*  were in dire straits. He went to Czechoslovakia to see if there was anything he could do to help. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=834.16s)]
*  What's strange is that for almost 50 years he hardly told anyone about what he had accomplished, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=841.12s)]
*  and for 50 years the children knew nothing about who had saved them or how. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=848.0s)]
*  We begin on October 1st, 1938. Nazi troops marched into the Sudetenland, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=857.76s)]
*  the German-speaking region of Czechoslovakia. Prague, the Czech capital, was flooded with [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=866.64s)]
*  desperate people trying to escape. A fortunate few were able to send their children abroad. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=872.72s)]
*  These parents, mostly Czech Jews, sensed war was coming and wanted to get their children out. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=879.4399999999999s)]
*  By chance, a cameraman filmed a man holding a boy, a 29-year-old Londoner. His name? Nicholas Winton. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=886.64s)]
*  All I knew was that the people that I met couldn't get out, and they were looking of ways of at least [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=895.84s)]
*  getting their children out. Nicholas Winton is one of the few people who can bear witness to those [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=906.4s)]
*  days because he's 104 years old. He told us he went to Prague to see if he might be able to save [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=912.0s)]
*  some people. But what made you think you could do it? I work on the motto that if something's [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=919.36s)]
*  not impossible, there must be a way of doing it. Back in London, Winton was a successful stock [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=925.92s)]
*  broker living the good life with a passion for sports, but he was deeply concerned about news [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=932.96s)]
*  reports from Czechoslovakia of German persecution. I went out into the camps [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=938.72s)]
*  where the people who had been displaced were put, and it was winter and it was cold. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=946.24s)]
*  Emigration wasn't an option. The world's doors were closed to the refugees. Conditions in the [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=955.6800000000001s)]
*  camps were brutal for the 150,000 people trapped there, especially for the children, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=961.84s)]
*  and no one focused on them until Nicholas Winton. But what did he do? We went to Jerusalem, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=968.4s)]
*  to Yad Vashem, Israel's memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, and asked Dr. David Silberklang, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=976.4s)]
*  a senior historian there. Winton went, set up shop in a hotel in the center of the old city in [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=983.52s)]
*  Prague, and began looking into how can I organize getting some of these refugees, particularly the [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=990.24s)]
*  children, out of here. What kind of experience did he have to qualify him for this immense [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=995.12s)]
*  bureaucratic task? None. Winton set up a small organization with one aim, to get as many kids [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1001.28s)]
*  out as fast as possible. People started coming to him in increasing numbers. He didn't have time in [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1009.6s)]
*  the day to meet them all. He'd work till two in the morning, get up early in the morning to meet [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1015.6800000000001s)]
*  the next people. As more and more were coming, saying, take my child, take my child. By the time [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1019.2s)]
*  he returned to London, he had a list of hundreds of children, and set out to convince British [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1023.36s)]
*  authorities to take him seriously. He did it by taking stationery from an established refugee [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1029.04s)]
*  organization, adding children's section, and making himself chairman. So that eventually they had to [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1035.52s)]
*  adopt me. So in fact, you managed to do what you did through a little deception, a little smoke and [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1042.96s)]
*  mirrors. Yes, to a certain extent, yes. It required quite a bit of ingenuity. No, it just required a [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1052.8s)]
*  printing press to get the the new paper printed. The children's section operated from a tiny office [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1060.96s)]
*  in central London. Winton's mother was in charge. The staff were all volunteers. During the day, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1068.4s)]
*  Winton worked as a stockbroker. Evenings, he wrestled with the British bureaucracy. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1076.0s)]
*  Did you approach any other countries to take some of the children? The Americans, but the Americans [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1081.76s)]
*  wouldn't take any, which was a pity. We could have got a lot more out. Winton had written President [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1088.3200000000002s)]
*  Roosevelt asking the U.S. to take in more children. A minor official at the U.S. Embassy in London [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1096.08s)]
*  wrote back, the U.S. was unable to help. Britain agreed to accept the children, but only if Winton [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1102.16s)]
*  found families willing to take them in. So he circulated the children's pictures to advertise [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1109.12s)]
*  them. But even after a family chose a child, British authorities were slow in issuing travel [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1115.04s)]
*  documents. So Winton started having them forged. He also spread some money around. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1121.28s)]
*  Took a bit of blackmail on my part. You were indulging in blackmail and forgery to get the [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1127.36s)]
*  children out. I've never heard it put like that before. But you seemed to be enjoying it. It [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1133.92s)]
*  worked. That's the main thing. The first 20 children left Prague on March 14, 1939. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1141.92s)]
*  The next day, German troops occupied Prague and the rest of Czechoslovakia. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1152.3200000000002s)]
*  Hitler rode through the streets triumphant. Hugo Meisel was 10 years old. Do you remember [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1157.04s)]
*  the Germans coming into Czechoslovakia? Not only do I remember, I personally saw Hitler standing up [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1163.76s)]
*  in the car and the children were expected to say, hire Hitler and so forth. I remember as if yesterday. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1170.0s)]
*  It wasn't long before violence against Jews, property confiscations and forced labor that [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1178.16s)]
*  began in the Sudetenland spread throughout Czechoslovakia. But the Nazis allowed Winton's [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1184.0s)]
*  trains to leave in keeping with their policy to cleanse Europe of Jews. Hugo Meisel's parents [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1190.08s)]
*  decided it was time to put him and his brother on one of the trains. I remember that they told us [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1197.2s)]
*  that we were going to England, maybe two or three months. It would be a holiday for us [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1204.16s)]
*  and that they would join us very shortly. And you believed them? Absolutely. Were your parents [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1210.56s)]
*  emotional when they said goodbye to you? No, I've asked myself that question many times. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1216.96s)]
*  How my parents [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1224.16s)]
*  had the strength. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1229.68s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1239.04s)]
*  It never occurred to me that what they were saying to us was not true. In other words, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1244.6399999999999s)]
*  that they realized that they would not be joining us within a short period of time. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1250.72s)]
*  Over the spring and summer of 1939, seven trains carried over 600 children through the heart of [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1257.3600000000001s)]
*  Nazi Germany to Holland, where they took a ferry to the English coast. From there, they [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1265.3600000000001s)]
*  caught a train to London. An eighth train carrying 250 more was scheduled to leave Prague on September [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1271.84s)]
*  1st. But that's the day the war began. They were all at the station, even on the train waiting to go. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1280.08s)]
*  And war was declared, so the train never left. Never heard really what happened to all those children. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1288.8799999999999s)]
*  But there's reason to suspect that not many of them survived. I think that's true. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1296.08s)]
*  Two years after that last train, the Nazis began implementing the final solution. Their [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1303.28s)]
*  plan to slaughter all the Jews of Europe. Czech Jews were rounded up and shipped to Theresienstadt, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1309.76s)]
*  an old military garrison town about an hour north of Prague, their first stop on the road to annihilation. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1316.48s)]
*  These tracks were the exit from Theresienstadt, the only exit. The tracks led east. The trains [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1324.8s)]
*  were called Polish transports, destination Auschwitz. Some 90,000 people took that one-way ride. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1331.68s)]
*  Among them, almost all the children, so Nicholas wasn't able to get out in time. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1340.5600000000002s)]
*  Their parents and the parents of the children already in England. After the war, you went back [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1345.92s)]
*  to Czechoslovakia. Was there one instant where you accepted the fact that your parents were dead? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1352.72s)]
*  For three years, we used to visit when trains came from Siberia, especially [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1359.6s)]
*  when the communists moved in in 1948, a lot of people started coming back from Siberia. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1364.56s)]
*  So I would go to a station hoping, and when films were being shown [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1371.36s)]
*  of people walking in concentration camps, Auschwitz and so forth, there's so many [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1379.28s)]
*  shots being taken by the Germans and so forth. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1387.36s)]
*  Never stopped looking. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1397.4399999999998s)]
*  The name of every Czech Jew murdered in the Holocaust is painted on the walls of Prague's [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1398.48s)]
*  Pinkus synagogue. Over 77,300 names, including Arnoska and Pavel Meisel, Hugo's parents. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1419.36s)]
*  And Nicholas Winton? During the war, he volunteered for an ambulance unit for the Red Cross, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1434.24s)]
*  then trained pilots for the Royal Air Force. He got married, raised a family, earned a comfortable [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1440.08s)]
*  living. For 50 years, he told hardly anyone what he had done. A question which I know [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1446.32s)]
*  intrigues everyone who hears your story is why did you keep it secret for so long? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1455.28s)]
*  I didn't really keep it secret. I just didn't talk about it. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1462.6399999999999s)]
*  All this time, you're in England, then you go back to Czechoslovakia, then you go to Israel. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1467.4399999999998s)]
*  You still had no idea how your departure from Czechoslovakia had been organized. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1474.24s)]
*  Absolutely no idea. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1480.6399999999999s)]
*  And you learned that by seeing it on television. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1482.48s)]
*  That's right. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1484.6399999999999s)]
*  In 1988, the BBC learned about Winton's story and invited him to be part of a program. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1486.08s)]
*  He had no idea that the people sitting around him were people he had saved. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1492.9599999999998s)]
*  Can I ask, is there anyone in our audience tonight who owes their life to Nicholas Winton? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1498.56s)]
*  If so, could you stand up, please? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1504.08s)]
*  Mr. Winton, would you like to turn around? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1508.72s)]
*  On behalf of all of them, thank you very much indeed. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1515.76s)]
*  I suppose it was the most emotional moment of my life, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1528.56s)]
*  suddenly being confronted with all these children who weren't by any means children anymore. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1534.08s)]
*  No, they weren't. And for the first time, they looked at you and knew that [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1540.56s)]
*  you were the reason that they were alive. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1545.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1547.76s)]
*  True. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1554.8799999999999s)]
*  I wore this around my neck. And this is the actual pass that we were given to come to England. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1556.2600000000002s)]
*  And I'm another of the children that you saved. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1564.2600000000002s)]
*  Lady Milner Grenfell-Bains describes Winton as one of the most modest people she's ever met. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1568.5800000000002s)]
*  Why do you think he didn't say anything for 50 years? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1575.46s)]
*  I think it was in his nature. He really felt that he'd done all he could. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1579.14s)]
*  And having got those children settled, he felt being there, done that, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1583.54s)]
*  my job's done, I've got other things to do. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1587.94s)]
*  Other things. For the last 50 years, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1590.5s)]
*  Winton's been helping mentally handicap people and building homes for the elderly. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1593.86s)]
*  We've just opened our second old people's home, and it's full, and it's doing very well. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1598.8999999999999s)]
*  And there are plenty of old people like me to go in. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1609.06s)]
*  But you're not there. You're at home. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1612.26s)]
*  Oh, I'd hate to go into one of my own homes. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1614.34s)]
*  Don't print that. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1619.78s)]
*  In 2003, Winton was knighted and became Sir Nicholas Winton. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1624.74s)]
*  In the Czech Republic, he's become a national hero. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1629.86s)]
*  He was celebrated in a documentary called Nicky's Family, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1633.62s)]
*  but he isn't really comfortable with all the adulation. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1637.62s)]
*  I'm not interested in the past. I think there's too much emphasis nowadays [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1641.5400000000002s)]
*  on the past and what has happened, and nobody is concentrating on the present and the future. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1649.8600000000001s)]
*  In 1939, Nicholas Winton used a two-week vacation to go to Prague [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1657.6200000000001s)]
*  and ended up saving the lives of 669 children. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1663.3000000000002s)]
*  In the decades since, of course, the children had children, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1667.46s)]
*  who then had children and so on, and the numbers multiplied. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1671.54s)]
*  You want to summarize it in one sentence. A guy takes a two-week vacation. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1676.66s)]
*  And ends up with 15,000 children. Yeah. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1681.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1684.82s)]
*  It's a pretty good story. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1685.54s)]
*  It's a great story. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1686.66s)]
*  They've got children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1688.26s)]
*  And none of them would be here if it hadn't been for Sir Nick. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1692.26s)]
*  That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Terrible responsibilities. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1696.1000000000001s)]
*  Tonight, for the first time, we have the story of the rescue of Jessica Buchanan. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1715.54s)]
*  It is the tale of a secret mission by SEAL Team Six that few people have heard about until now. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1720.98s)]
*  On a January night in 2012, members of SEAL Team Six jumped from a plane into the skies of Somalia. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1727.38s)]
*  Jessica Buchanan was being held hostage and the SEALs were descending just in time. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1734.66s)]
*  Buchanan was a humanitarian aid worker who had come to help children [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1740.66s)]
*  in one of the most dangerous places on earth. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1744.82s)]
*  Hers was an ordeal that ended in a flash of violence but had begun 93 days earlier [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1747.6200000000001s)]
*  when her car was stopped by bandits in a place she calls hell. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1754.9s)]
*  We stopped very abruptly, like so abruptly that I felt like everybody just [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1760.66s)]
*  fall forward. And then I start hearing all of this pounding on the windows and the windshield and all [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1766.5800000000002s)]
*  this shouting in Somali. And there's a man standing there screaming and he has an AK-47 and he's [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1772.26s)]
*  shouting and he's pointing it at us. And then he climbs into the car next to me and he points an [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1779.7s)]
*  AK in my face. And they're hyped up like they're on speed. And all of a sudden we just take off. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1784.26s)]
*  The driver just takes off and we just start slamming all over the place down these camel tracks. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1791.3799999999999s)]
*  What did you think they were going to do? I figured they were going to rape me [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1798.26s)]
*  and then kill me. And I just keep thinking this can't be the end. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1805.14s)]
*  This can't be the end of my life. I'm only 32 years old. I haven't had any children yet. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1812.58s)]
*  I didn't get to say goodbye to Eric. I didn't get to say goodbye to my dad. Like this can't be [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1819.38s)]
*  the end. Jessica Buchanan was facing the end at the end of the earth. Somalia, on the farthest tip [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1826.1s)]
*  of Africa, is war-torn and lawless. This is essentially no man's land. Militias battle over [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1833.46s)]
*  an unforgiving land, as we saw while covering a famine there in 2011. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1840.66s)]
*  It was the same year that Buchanan was with a Danish charity teaching children how to avoid [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1845.78s)]
*  landmines. On October 25th, her car was hijacked. The driver is driving like just a madman. We're [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1852.26s)]
*  bouncing all over the place. My head keeps hitting the window. It keeps hitting the roof. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1861.06s)]
*  I'm holding on to the side, the handle on the Land Cruiser, just trying to keep myself steady. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1865.46s)]
*  What happened next? It gets dark and we've changed vehicles a couple of times. More people have [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1872.02s)]
*  come. They're screaming and I hear from behind me a higher pitched voice going on and on in [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1877.3s)]
*  Somalia. And I think, my God, they have a woman involved in this. And I turn around and I see [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1886.82s)]
*  a small child in the back of the Land Cruiser with an AK-47 draped in ammunition. And I think [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1895.46s)]
*  the irony of why I came to Africa in the first place. Exactly the kid you were trying to save, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1905.22s)]
*  a child soldier. Yeah. What was he doing? Learning the trade. She'd been kidnapped by a [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1913.7s)]
*  co-worker, Paul Fisted. They drove into the night and then were ordered to march into the desert. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1921.62s)]
*  And they tell us to get down onto our knees. And I think, okay, this is it. Like I'm bracing myself [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1928.1799999999998s)]
*  to be shot in the back of the head. And I think that there's mercy in the fact that [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1939.78s)]
*  and I think that there's mercy in the fact that maybe they're not going to rate me first, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1948.02s)]
*  but that it's just going to be quick. And I'm waiting and I'm waiting. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1954.9s)]
*  And then all of a sudden somebody shouts from behind us, sleep. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1964.02s)]
*  And I think, oh my God, I didn't hear that correctly, did I? He just said sleep. She collapsed. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1970.5s)]
*  Slept through the night and the next morning was met by the man who led the bandits. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1977.7s)]
*  And we ask him, are you going to kill us? Is that why we're here? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1983.7s)]
*  He says, no, no, no, no. Money. We just want money. How much were they asking for? They started out at [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1991.22s)]
*  45 million dollars. They thought you were pretty valuable. I guess so. The bandits used her cell [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=1998.42s)]
*  phone to call her husband, Eric Landemann. The two had married on an African beach two years before, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2003.78s)]
*  but his number and the numbers of Buchanan's family had all been disconnected. It was part [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2010.5s)]
*  of the charity's emergency plan. The one number that worked was her Nairobi office with a hostage [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2016.74s)]
*  negotiator standing by. And so began months of talks. Where did they keep you day in, day out? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2023.1399999999999s)]
*  Under trees. Outside. You were outdoors for 93 days? Yeah. And in the night, they forced us to sleep [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2032.34s)]
*  out in the open. What were the nights like? Long and cold. Then the rainy season hit and it would rain [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2043.06s)]
*  all night long and you're already freezing. So then you're sitting there wet. What were you eating? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2051.06s)]
*  Tuna fish. Maybe once a day we would get a small can of tuna fish and a piece of bread. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2056.42s)]
*  Did you feel like you were beginning to lose your humanity at any point? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2063.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean they treated us like animals. To be so sick that you know you're vomiting [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2070.1s)]
*  behind bushes and you can't walk straight and you're laying in the fetal position on the ground [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2080.5s)]
*  under a tree and they don't even, they don't care. Their duty was to keep me from [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2086.9s)]
*  dying because then I wasn't worth anything. They were in the hands of men and boys who were chewing [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2095.3s)]
*  cot. It's a plant with the same effect as amphetamines. They were so hyped up [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2101.62s)]
*  on speed. It was like drinking pot after pot of coffee and then the crash would come and then it [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2109.14s)]
*  brought a lot of belligerence and a lot of anger and a lot of temper. You and Paul came up with [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2117.7s)]
*  nicknames for a lot of the people who were keeping you. That's one of the ways you kept [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2128.58s)]
*  yourself occupied. We did. The 10-year-old boy? Crack baby because he was cracked out all the time. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2132.18s)]
*  He was chewing cot and he had two black holes for eyes. There was nothing inside. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2138.02s)]
*  This is one of the camps where she was held. The bandits hit her, pointed their guns at her, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2146.2599999999998s)]
*  and put a knife to her throat, but it was exposure that took a toll. She lost 25 pounds. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2152.02s)]
*  After three weeks, the bandits made a video to prove that she was alive. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2159.46s)]
*  Have you seen the video? I have. Paul and myself just ago we are seeing in the air alive. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2164.66s)]
*  I can tell I'm starting to lose hope at that point. But hope would have to last for two more [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2171.54s)]
*  months. As the many weeks went by, did you think the American government's watching me, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2179.3s)]
*  they know where I am and somebody's going to get me out of here? No. Why? Because I'm just an aid [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2186.6600000000003s)]
*  worker. You didn't imagine that the president of the United States knew your name? Never. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2194.1800000000003s)]
*  Never in a million years. After three months in the desert, Buchanan had a serious urinary tract [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2200.34s)]
*  infection and in a final call to the hostage negotiator, she said this. I'd become so ill that [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2207.54s)]
*  I couldn't stand up. I couldn't walk because I was in so much pain. And I said, I think I have a [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2214.58s)]
*  kidney infection. And I started to cry and I said, I think I'm afraid I'm going to die out here. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2221.46s)]
*  When that call was received here in Nairobi, it set off a chain of events that led all the [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2230.74s)]
*  way to the Oval Office. The FBI and the military consulted doctors who said that if Jessica had a [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2235.86s)]
*  kidney infection, she might have just two weeks to live. That was transmitted to the president, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2242.42s)]
*  who was also informed that in just a few days there would be a new moon, perfect darkness [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2248.34s)]
*  for a SEAL Team rescue. Jessica Buchanan had chosen a star in the Somali sky to represent [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2254.7400000000002s)]
*  her mother, who had passed away a year before. She spoke to it every night and with no moon, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2262.26s)]
*  it was especially bright on January 25th. What did you say that night? Please tell God that I [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2269.3s)]
*  need some help. We need to get out of here. You couldn't have known that that prayer would be [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2276.0200000000004s)]
*  answered that night. I had no idea. She was on a mat trying to sleep when she heard a faint scratching [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2282.42s)]
*  noise. One of the bandits she nicknamed Helper heard it too. And I see this look of just sheer [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2290.58s)]
*  terror on Helper's face and then all of a sudden it's just this eruption of gunfire. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2298.02s)]
*  And I think, okay, well this is it. This really is truly the end. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2309.54s)]
*  And I cover up with my blanket again and I just start saying, oh God, oh God, oh God. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2316.1800000000003s)]
*  And I just remember thinking, or maybe I'm saying out loud, like I cannot survive this. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2320.1800000000003s)]
*  She thought she was being taken by a rival group, maybe al-Shabaab, Islamic extremists, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2326.7400000000002s)]
*  who would surely kill her. And then all of a sudden I feel all these hands on me, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2332.58s)]
*  roughly grabbing at me. And I try to protect myself and I pull the blanket closer on top of me and [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2338.02s)]
*  then I hear my name. But it's not a Somali accent, it's an American accent. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2349.46s)]
*  And I can't compute, like I can't understand that somebody is trying to kill me. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2358.34s)]
*  And I can't compute, like I can't understand that somebody with an American accent knows my name. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2364.7400000000002s)]
*  And they say, Jessica, we're with the American military. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2374.42s)]
*  We're here to take you home and you're safe. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2382.26s)]
*  And I pull the blanket down from my face and all I see is black, black masks, black sky. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2385.22s)]
*  And all I can say over and over is, you're American. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2390.66s)]
*  You're American. I don't understand, you're Americans. Thinking, how did you get here? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2397.3799999999997s)]
*  And I'm still alive. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2404.4199999999996s)]
*  And they ask me where my shoes are and I don't know and one of them picks me up and starts running. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2406.66s)]
*  He runs for several minutes and it puts me down on the ground. And then they identify themselves [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2414.1s)]
*  and that they knew I was very sick and they have medicine and they're trying to get me out of the [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2422.66s)]
*  They knew I was very sick and they have medicine and they have water, they have food [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2431.94s)]
*  and they've come to take me home. At one point, I think they thought they heard something. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2439.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't know, this group of men who risk their life for me already asks me to lie down on the ground [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2447.54s)]
*  because they're concerned that there might be someone out there and then they make a [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2457.62s)]
*  circle around me and then they lie down on top of me to protect me. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2463.7799999999997s)]
*  And we lay like that until the helicopters come in. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2472.42s)]
*  When all of those seals lay down on top of you, you were the most important thing in the world to them. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2477.62s)]
*  It's really hard to comprehend. They were going to take a bullet for you. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2484.58s)]
*  And they're so kind and they're so gentle and they are trying to assist me to get to the [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2490.02s)]
*  helicopter. But I think I've been out here for months, I can run to this helicopter myself and [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2495.62s)]
*  so I just break away and I just take off running through the scrub, through the bush and I throw [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2502.18s)]
*  myself onto that helicopter and push myself up against the wall. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2506.5s)]
*  And I don't start breathing until we actually lift up off the ground [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2512.66s)]
*  and they hand me an American flag that's folded. What did you think of that? I just started to cry. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2516.5s)]
*  At that point in time, I have never in my life been so proud and so very happy to be an American. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2523.46s)]
*  The seals left on other helicopters. She didn't see their faces, didn't hear their names. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2530.66s)]
*  They appeared and they were gone. The only thing left in the camp were nine dead bandits. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2536.1s)]
*  Mr. Speaker. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2543.2999999999997s)]
*  It all ended just hours before the State of the Union address. As the president walked in, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2546.1s)]
*  he had a secret with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta that almost no one understood until later. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2552.18s)]
*  Good job tonight. Good job tonight. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2558.66s)]
*  After the speech, President Obama called Buchanan's father. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2562.9s)]
*  Jessica met her husband, Eric, at a U.S. base in Italy. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2566.58s)]
*  I just couldn't believe he was standing there and that I was standing there. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2570.98s)]
*  And we had a second chance. And then later we flew to Portland, Oregon [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2579.46s)]
*  and I was reunited with my father and my brother and my sister and her husband. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2587.1400000000003s)]
*  What was the first thing you said to your father? Daddy. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2592.5s)]
*  I'm just, I'm so sorry that you had to go through this. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2601.3s)]
*  But we made it. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2610.02s)]
*  So did her Danish coworker, Paul Fisted, who was also rescued by the SEALs. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2611.06s)]
*  He said later that his lucky break was being captured with an American. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2615.8599999999997s)]
*  Jessica Buchanan has told her story in a new book, Impossible Odds, coming out this week. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2621.06s)]
*  You may recall that she said that her first thought when being taken was that she was [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2627.7799999999997s)]
*  too young to die because she hadn't had children. Well, she's taken care of that too. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2631.7799999999997s)]
*  She and her husband have a baby boy and they've moved back to the states from East Africa. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2638.02s)]
*  Stories of exodus mark a central theme in human history. War, famine, crippling poverty, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2653.7000000000003s)]
*  all have forced people to flee one country for another. But there's a growing risk of [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2660.26s)]
*  leaving home and homeland. In more than 70 countries worldwide, lesbian, gay, bisexual, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2665.3s)]
*  and transgender, or LGBT citizens, live in fear for their freedom, their safety, and in some cases, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2670.82s)]
*  their lives. Their governments not only sanction brutality against them, but often carry it out. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2678.1000000000004s)]
*  There is no obvious or easy escape path, but for those lucky enough to hitch a ride, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2684.42s)]
*  there is something called the Rainbow Railroad. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2689.7000000000003s)]
*  Like the Underground Railroad, the Rainbow Railroad helps those fleeing danger get across [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2692.74s)]
*  borders to safety. And like its historical namesake, this network shrouds its operations in secrecy. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2697.94s)]
*  But over a recent six-month period, we got a look at how the Rainbow Railroad works. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2705.22s)]
*  We met escapees from three continents and were on hand for a series of departures and arrivals. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2710.66s)]
*  Last June, on the first day of summer, Abinub Elias left his old life in Egypt [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2716.98s)]
*  and arrived a refugee at Toronto's Pearson International Airport. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2722.02s)]
*  You made it. How are you feeling? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2728.1800000000003s)]
*  Rainbow Railroad staff was there to greet him, and on the ride into town, Abinub took it all in. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2735.38s)]
*  New country, new landmarks. First stop, a familiar face. This reunion was nine months in the making. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2741.3s)]
*  Abinub and Ahmed Allah, two friends in their 20s, first met in Cairo [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2754.1s)]
*  on September 22, 2017. The occasion, a concert, was held in Cairo. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2762.02s)]
*  A Lebanese band, popular throughout the Middle East, whose lead singer is openly gay. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2768.34s)]
*  Caught up in the music and the moment, Abinub did the unthinkable for a gay Egyptian. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2780.7400000000002s)]
*  He raised the rainbow flag, a symbol of gay pride. Ahmed spotted this bold stranger in the crowd of [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2786.26s)]
*  35,000 and says he was inspired. He can do it, so I can do it too. This was unthinkable to you [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2792.98s)]
*  before the concert. So when I saw Abinub, okay, I can do it. The two waved the flag together. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2799.54s)]
*  You said it was the best five minutes of your life. Yeah, it was the best five minutes of my life. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2805.94s)]
*  In a bad situation in Egypt, you can't talk about anything. Now you are raising the flag, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2810.9s)]
*  you are talking about LGBT rights. Oh my God, you can't talk about that in Egypt, in the public, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2815.22s)]
*  public area. In Egypt, just being openly gay can bring trouble. Human Rights Watch says 300 LGBT [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2820.34s)]
*  citizens have been detained under the country's debauchery laws in the last five years. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2828.42s)]
*  Hours after the concert, Egyptian media denounced the flag raising and security forces took the [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2835.06s)]
*  opportunity to crack down on Cairo's LGBT community, arresting dozens. Panicked, Ahmed [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2840.98s)]
*  posted this video to social media to get his story on the record. It's clear to me that I [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2848.18s)]
*  am wanted by the police, he said. He was arrested days later for quote promoting immorality. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2856.02s)]
*  Police also questioned him about a woman named Farida. They're interrogating you and they know [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2862.66s)]
*  about Farida. Yeah, the first name asked me the first name was Farida. Farida Abouf, a trans woman [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2869.22s)]
*  and well-known LGBT rights worker in Cairo got word police were asking about her and knew she [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2876.02s)]
*  had to leave Egypt. She took this video the night she escaped. She says she couldn't risk being [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2881.94s)]
*  recognized along the way, so she cut her hair and took shots of testosterone to look more masculine [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2887.86s)]
*  again. Farida told us she almost didn't make it past Cairo's airport officials who pulled her [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2893.38s)]
*  aside for questioning. He looked to me like he knew something but he didn't tell me. You think the [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2899.3s)]
*  guard knew something was up? He looked to my eyes, eye contact, big eye contact. It's like I know [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2904.02s)]
*  everything. Farida made it to Canada where Rainbow Railroad staff was waiting for her, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2910.9s)]
*  having learned about her situation from their network in Egypt. They got her settled in Toronto [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2916.66s)]
*  where she told them about Abounoub who'd gone into hiding outside Cairo and Ahmed who was serving [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2922.34s)]
*  three months in solitary confinement. I was crying a lot. I told them please help my friends, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2928.34s)]
*  please arrange jail, can you please help them. But you're connecting your friends in Egypt [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2933.3s)]
*  with Rainbow Railroad once you're here. Yeah. Founded in 2006 and based in Toronto, Rainbow [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2937.38s)]
*  Railroad has evacuated more than 600 LGBT individuals from 22 hostile countries. The small [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2943.78s)]
*  unassuming operation fielded more than a thousand requests for help last year and says that number [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2951.2200000000003s)]
*  will increase this year. Yeah I would need from Cairo to Toronto. Referrals come from an international [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2956.82s)]
*  network of LGBT groups and safe houses. Then Rainbow Railroad secures visas and pays for flights [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2963.38s)]
*  to safety. All of it funded not by any government but with private donations of cash and also airline [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2970.1800000000003s)]
*  miles. Executive Director Kamali Powell reviews each case. What do they all have in common? The [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2976.9s)]

*  of being excommunicated by their churches, their families, their communities and so they've come [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2987.7s)]
*  to us really desperate. This isn't cultural homophobia, this is police, courts, legislators. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=2992.8199999999997s)]
*  We've heard stories of an individual who had a mob go to their house, burn it down and when they [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3000.1s)]
*  flee to go see the police, the police say that we cannot help you because you are gay. The police [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3007.2999999999997s)]
*  sanctions the mob. The police sanctions the mob. Sometimes the police are active perpetrators of [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3012.34s)]
*  this violence. He's talking about an incident that took place in Jamaica, one of 70 countries [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3016.82s)]
*  worldwide where same-sex relations are a crime. In seven of these countries punishable by death. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3022.82s)]
*  The United Nations says global gains in LGBT rights including marriage equality have been [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3029.6200000000003s)]

*  reports surfaced of authorities there rounding up, torturing and killing queer Chechens. Usman, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3050.2599999999998s)]
*  not his real name, survived this purge. He asked us to conceal his identity, fearing for the safety [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3056.8199999999997s)]
*  of his family back home. He recalls the day men in military uniform came for him at his work, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3062.98s)]
*  took him to an abandoned warehouse and tortured him with electric shocks. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3069.38s)]
*  They tied my hands behind my back and they beat me. They kept asking me for names and phone numbers. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3076.18s)]
*  Names and numbers of whom? Gay men I knew but I didn't give them anybody's name. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3082.82s)]
*  Even under torture. Yes, I'm very proud of that. After two weeks, Usman was released and a friend [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3090.5s)]
*  helped get him to a safe house in Russia. There he heard about a means to escape. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3100.42s)]
*  Rainbow Railroad. That's how you heard it the first time. In their largest operation to date, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3107.78s)]
*  Rainbow Railroad worked with Canada's foreign ministry to evacuate 42 Chechens, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3113.86s)]
*  including Usman, and find them asylum in Canada. A few months later, Powell and Usman went to the [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3119.14s)]

*  tough time to be seeking asylum in America, no longer a busy stop on the Rainbow Railroad. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3132.8199999999997s)]
*  Spain, the Netherlands and Canada are among the most popular destinations. The Chechen operation [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3139.14s)]
*  put Rainbow Railroad on the map, donations more than tripled, making it possible for [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3145.3s)]
*  staff to venture to half a dozen LGBT hostile countries and assess the need in person. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3150.7400000000002s)]
*  We went with Kamali Powell to Jamaica, well known for its beaches, less so for its homophobia. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3160.6600000000003s)]
*  Let me tell you what we can do. Rainbow Railroad gets more requests for safe passage from here [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3166.5800000000004s)]
*  than from anywhere else. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3171.94s)]
*  This is a gully, unfortunately like a sewerage drain area where members of the LGBTQI community sleep. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3176.34s)]
*  But it smells like a sewer system. Under the streets of Kingston, Powell took us to see a [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3188.02s)]
*  potential Rainbow Railroad client named Blue. His fear of being attacked because he is gay is so [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3194.18s)]
*  intense, Blue goes underground, quite literally, for refuge overnight. You have this place to [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3200.98s)]
*  yourself? This is my house. This is your house? He told us he sleeps on cardboard boxes and when [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3206.98s)]
*  the rain comes through the storm drain, he moves to higher ground. If I was not gay, I wouldn't be [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3212.82s)]
*  here because I'd be at home, but because of my lifestyle and they found out about me, that's why [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3218.5s)]
*  I'm here, right? Even Powell was taken aback by these conditions. Have you seen this in other [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3224.34s)]
*  countries? Nothing quite like this. Once you're labeled LGBT, it's almost like a scarlet letter, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3229.54s)]
*  like you walk around and someone can attack you at any moment. The threat of attack drives some gay [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3237.3s)]
*  Jamaicans to this remote hillside town where our cameras were allowed into this safe house. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3243.54s)]
*  Many of its residents will be referred to Powell, who went over the most urgent cases with house [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3249.46s)]
*  staff. The problem is getting to the hospital, right, as well? One resident told us he was [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3254.66s)]
*  stabbed 15 times. Another said she was doused with acid in an anti-gay attack. This is where they wait [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3259.8599999999997s)]
*  for wounds to heal and visas to come through. Across the island, the wait is over for Elton [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3267.94s)]
*  McDuffis, whose work with the local LGBT rights group made him a target. He told us he survived [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3275.2999999999997s)]
*  a knife attack and an attempted break into his apartment as assailants shouted anti-gay slurs. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3282.02s)]
*  After that, you said, I gotta get out. Yeah, I got out. He installed extra locks on the door [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3288.82s)]
*  and contacted Rainbow Railroad. He didn't tell his mother he was about to leave for good. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3295.38s)]
*  Like, I don't want my mom to worry, I don't want my family to worry, so I try to keep them out of [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3301.54s)]
*  this process. So what have you told them? I'll see you when I see you. Yeah, well I told her, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3305.94s)]
*  you're not going to see me for a long time. Nervous? Very. Why? Because I'm stepping into [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3310.34s)]
*  the unknown. The only thing I can say is I'm told that I'll be okay. I'll be in a better place, yeah. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3317.06s)]
*  You've called the worldwide exile of the LGBT community the civil rights issue of our era. What [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3326.26s)]
*  do you mean by that? What I mean by that is that we spent many years in North America saying that [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3332.1000000000004s)]
*  marriage equality was the most important marker for the advancement of LGBT people. What we [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3338.5s)]
*  haven't done is talk about thousands of thousands of displaced people who are victims of state [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3345.46s)]
*  sponsored violence only because of who they love. This is your new town. Yeah. Four weeks after we [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3352.98s)]
*  watched him leave Jamaica, Elton McDuffis had found a taste of home in Toronto and told us he was no [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3359.78s)]
*  longer living in fear. Whole neighborhood with pride flags and gay bookstores. What's it like [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3366.26s)]
*  when you walk around there? Like I said to my friend, we were walking on Church Street and [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3372.1800000000003s)]
*  there were a lot of gay couples walking and holding hands and I said I think we should hold hands. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3377.38s)]
*  You said we should hold hands. Yeah and we did and nobody cared and nobody looked and you know that [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3382.9s)]
*  was beautiful. The Egyptians too are making the most of their newfound freedom. Toronto's pride [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3389.62s)]
*  parade last summer was a highlight. Rainbow Railroad helped cover living expenses until the [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3398.1s)]
*  asylum claims were decided. Ahmed got his papers in March. Abanubes came through last month. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3404.02s)]
*  On this night in September they were reminded of how far they've come. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3414.2599999999998s)]
*  Mashrua Layla, the band whose concert sparked the LGBT crackdown in Cairo, was in Toronto to play a [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3418.42s)]
*  show and wanted to meet the Egyptian exiles. And when the music played, Abanubes and Ahmeds stood [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3425.1400000000003s)]
*  together just as they had in Cairo a year before. When I was in the jail I know that I will be able [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3436.26s)]
*  to hear this music again. I raised the flag again with Abanubes. It was an amazing moment for me. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3444.18s)]
*  I can do what I want now. I'm safe. You're safe? Yeah I'm safe. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNXWd9DK0Q&t=3449.7s)]
