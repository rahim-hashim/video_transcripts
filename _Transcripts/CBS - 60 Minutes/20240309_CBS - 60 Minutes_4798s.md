# Alzheimer's and Dementia | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [March 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk)
*  Music [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=0.0s)]
*  Mike and Carol Daly have been married for 53 years. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=12.9s)]
*  Like more than five million American families, they are dealing with dementia. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=16.62s)]
*  Carol has been suffering from Alzheimer's, the main type of dementia. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=21.18s)]
*  What makes this story so unusual [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=26.02s)]
*  is that almost every year for the past 10 years, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=28.56s)]
*  we've interviewed Mike and Carol [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=31.36s)]
*  as Alzheimer's took over her brain. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=33.26s)]
*  Even though this is intensely personal, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=36.2s)]
*  they wanted all of us to see the devastating impact [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=38.5s)]
*  of Alzheimer's on each of them over a decade. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=41.7s)]
*  We should have brought the bread. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=46.28s)]
*  When we first met Carol and Mike in 2008, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  Carol was active, conversational, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  and determined to make the best of her failing memory. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=53.14s)]
*  How old are you now? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=56.779999999999994s)]
*  65, 65 now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=59.78s)]
*  I think, right? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=64.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=65.06s)]
*  Carol's memory had been spotty for several years. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=66.32s)]
*  I started to notice it at home, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=69.56s)]
*  and I used to joke about it to my kids. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=70.9s)]
*  I would say, you know, I think she has Alzheimer's, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=72.62s)]
*  the way she forgets everything. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=75.4s)]
*  Then a doctor told her she really did have Alzheimer's. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=77.24s)]
*  Mike's mother had had it, now his wife. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=80.8s)]
*  Carol, when you heard the word Alzheimer's, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=84.10000000000001s)]
*  what did that do to you? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  I was devastated, because I saw his mother, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=89.64s)]
*  what she went through. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=93.14s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=94.30000000000001s)]
*  She was walking the streets in the middle of the night, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=95.54s)]
*  and we had to bring her home. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=98.38000000000001s)]
*  As Carol's memory deteriorated, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  she lost her job at a bank, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  and lost her ability to do a lot [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=105.26s)]
*  of what she'd always done at home. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  Did you used to be a good cook? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=109.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=111.46000000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=112.30000000000001s)]
*  What happened? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=113.2s)]
*  It stopped. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  It just, I just couldn't do it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=116.28s)]
*  What couldn't you do? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=118.68s)]
*  I didn't know what to do first. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=121.62s)]
*  The meatloaf. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  Oh, the meatloaf was the, that was the, what? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=125.16000000000001s)]
*  It was terrible. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=128.32s)]
*  They couldn't eat it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  Because? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=132.16s)]
*  I don't know what I did with the ingredients or whatever. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  They just couldn't eat it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=136.34s)]
*  And you're tearing up. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  It's upsetting for you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=139.6s)]
*  I don't want to be like this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=142.4s)]
*  I really don't, but. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=145.16s)]
*  Unable to concentrate, Carol had to give up reading [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=150.2s)]
*  and movies, hard for someone who'd worshiped Clark Gable. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=153.34s)]
*  Oh, so handsome. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=158.34s)]
*  So you remember that? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=160.54s)]
*  That I know. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=161.54s)]
*  They told us Carol's illness had brought them closer, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=165.28s)]
*  but they feared the future. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=168.56s)]
*  My fear is, I guess, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=171.92s)]
*  maybe it'd get worse, worse, you know? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=176.28s)]
*  And it probably would. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=180.16s)]
*  And it did. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=182.0s)]
*  Almost three years later, when we went back to visit, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=183.06s)]
*  Carol had no idea how old she was. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  80? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=190.06s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=191.9s)]
*  You're actually 67. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=193.74s)]
*  67? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=196.28s)]
*  67. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=197.14s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=198.64s)]
*  And what about her favorite actor? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=200.64s)]
*  Do you remember Clark Gable? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=203.04s)]
*  Oh yeah, that was my... [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=204.34s)]
*  Who is he? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=208.33999999999997s)]
*  Oh, I... [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=211.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=219.72s)]
*  Now Mike, a former New York City cop, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  had to apply her makeup and dress her. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=224.85999999999999s)]
*  But he told us this was his chance to repay [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=228.74s)]
*  all that Carol had done for him. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  She had a job, she cleaned house, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  she did the wash, she made the beds, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=237.06s)]
*  and she put up with me. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=239.46s)]
*  So all that's changed for us is the roles. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=241.5s)]
*  Now I do the wash, I make the beds, I help Carol. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=247.10000000000002s)]
*  But that's not what you signed up for. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=251.70000000000002s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=254.14000000000001s)]
*  When we took our oath, it's for better or for worse. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=255.6s)]
*  So I did sign up for it in the beginning. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=258.94s)]
*  But Mike had put on almost 20 pounds [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=261.74s)]
*  over the last two years and started taking pills [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=264.08s)]
*  to reduce anxiety and help him sleep. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=266.78s)]
*  The thing is, is I could sit here and feel sorry for myself, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=269.88s)]
*  but what is that gonna do for me? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  At our next meeting, one year later, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=277.62s)]
*  when Carol couldn't come up with words, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=279.65999999999997s)]
*  she answered with laughs. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=281.76s)]
*  What kind of thing? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  That's not right. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=286.18s)]
*  And three years since our first visit, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  she needed constant watching. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=295.36s)]
*  I can't go out by myself, you know, like that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=297.4s)]
*  So, we have to have somebody around. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=304.09999999999997s)]
*  That's a bad feeling. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=309.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=310.78s)]
*  You've lost your independence. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=312.18s)]
*  Yep. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=314.5s)]
*  That's what you do. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=318.14000000000004s)]
*  After all these years, I can't give up. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=320.38s)]
*  And I'll continue to try. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=323.88s)]
*  And I pray to God that she goes before me. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=326.88s)]
*  Because I'm not gonna put her in a nursing home. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=336.70000000000005s)]
*  I can handle it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=339.36s)]
*  We live a life. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=344.5s)]
*  But that life was a lot tougher [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=345.94s)]
*  when we returned two years later. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  By then, Carol could no longer remember her last name, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=350.1s)]
*  or this. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=354.04s)]
*  What's your husband's name? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=355.12s)]
*  My husband's. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=357.48s)]
*  Your husband's name? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=358.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=359.38s)]
*  The guy sitting to your left? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=360.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=361.78000000000003s)]
*  That big guy who loves you? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=363.48s)]
*  Yeah, who loves me. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=364.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=366.12s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=366.96s)]
*  Don't know what's coming tomorrow. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=372.91999999999996s)]
*  Beyond the memory loss, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=376.76s)]
*  as Alzheimer's affected more of her brain, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=378.32s)]
*  it was destroying more of her physical abilities. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=380.82s)]
*  She's losing the ability to control her feet, her hands. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=384.9s)]
*  It was six years ago that I first met you. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=389.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=391.7s)]
*  And at the time, you were shouldering all of the burden. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=392.53999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=395.38s)]
*  You're still shouldering all of the burden. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=396.3s)]
*  I mean, how are your shoulders? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=398.64000000000004s)]
*  They're sore, no doubt about it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  But you have to do what you have to do. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=403.92s)]
*  Carol. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=406.48s)]
*  At our next meeting, two years later, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=407.32000000000005s)]
*  conversation with Carol was impossible. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=409.18s)]
*  It's been almost eight years since we first met [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=411.72s)]
*  and since we first sat on this couch. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=413.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=415.76000000000005s)]
*  Without making you embarrassed, do you remember my name? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=417.86s)]
*  No. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=423.44000000000005s)]
*  What's this called? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=424.91999999999996s)]
*  What I'm wearing on my wrist. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=426.21999999999997s)]
*  What's the name of that? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=428.21999999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=432.26s)]
*  It's a wristwatch. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=433.09999999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=434.29999999999995s)]
*  Does that sound familiar? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=435.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=435.96s)]
*  Carol reached a point where she was not able [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=436.79999999999995s)]
*  to do anything for herself at all. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=441.65999999999997s)]
*  She couldn't feed herself, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=443.97999999999996s)]
*  couldn't go to the bathroom by herself. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=445.09999999999997s)]
*  Face me, okay. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=446.44s)]
*  And Mike had reached the point [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=448.09999999999997s)]
*  where he simply couldn't take care of her by himself. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=449.5s)]
*  So we hired a home care aide during the day, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=452.74s)]
*  costing almost $40,000 a year. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=455.40000000000003s)]
*  Now, Alzheimer's was hitting them financially [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=458.64000000000004s)]
*  on top of mentally and physically. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=461.62s)]
*  What would you say the toll has been [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=464.36s)]
*  of this long journey on you? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=466.34000000000003s)]
*  I'm dying. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=468.78000000000003s)]
*  I really took it in. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=471.16s)]
*  The stress, I don't have a heart attack to begin with. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=474.06s)]
*  You had chest pain. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=476.68s)]
*  They want to put me in the hospital. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=477.68s)]
*  I can't go to the hospital. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=479.0s)]
*  All right, what do I do with Carol? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=480.40000000000003s)]
*  Then she has anxiety attacks, part of the Alzheimer's. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=481.68s)]
*  Anxiety attacks may be part of what's happening to you too. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=485.88s)]
*  It sounds like if you had chest pain [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=489.44s)]
*  but it wasn't a heart attack, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=490.84000000000003s)]
*  is that what it was, an anxiety attack? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=492.28000000000003s)]
*  I just call it stress. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=493.96000000000004s)]
*  According to the Alzheimer's Association, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=497.64s)]
*  the vast majority of caregivers say [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=499.94s)]
*  their toughest challenge is emotional stress. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=502.12s)]
*  I can still remember when you said, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=505.32s)]
*  no big deal, I can handle this. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=507.36s)]
*  I think about that comment I made and I said, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=509.96s)]
*  what a jerk I was. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=513.68s)]
*  Well, not a jerk, but just you were sort of near [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=515.3199999999999s)]
*  the beginning of your journey and you didn't know. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=519.54s)]
*  Yeah, I thought this was it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=523.6s)]
*  So she can't remember things. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=527.24s)]
*  I see people with dementia, they function normally. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=528.64s)]
*  She can't walk. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=532.6s)]
*  The impact on everybody else is enormous. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=534.04s)]
*  One year later, 14 years since she was first diagnosed, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=539.52s)]
*  Carol was spending most of her days sitting silently, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=543.68s)]
*  no longer able to understand questions. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=547.08s)]
*  We can't communicate. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=550.04s)]
*  It's lonely. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=552.9s)]
*  Let me just get them so they go on nicely. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=556.4s)]
*  But watch what happened when social worker Dan Cohn [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=559.24s)]
*  put headphones on Carol and played some of her old favorites. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=562.12s)]
*  The words aren't there, but the beat is and the melody is. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=566.84s)]
*  Melody is pretty good. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=569.84s)]
*  In Alzheimer's, older memories are usually the last to go. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=572.0400000000001s)]
*  But even then, a faded distant memory [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=576.0400000000001s)]
*  can sometimes be revived. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=578.84s)]
*  And since the music we love is really tied [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=581.2800000000001s)]
*  to our emotional system and our emotional system [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=583.2800000000001s)]
*  is still very much intact, that's what we're connecting [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=585.24s)]
*  and that's what still works. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=588.44s)]
*  And we're still connected. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=589.84s)]
*  And we're still connected. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=591.4000000000001s)]
*  And we're still connected. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=592.84s)]
*  That's what we're connecting and that's what still works. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=594.36s)]
*  And it was tied to his emotional system too. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=596.28s)]
*  He was tearing up. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=599.0s)]
*  I think those tears were happy tears, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=600.24s)]
*  knowing that she hasn't lost it all. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=602.12s)]
*  It was like, wow, wow. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=606.36s)]
*  But the wow did not last. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=610.12s)]
*  When we met this past January, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=612.36s)]
*  Carol, now 74, was too far gone to react to music. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=614.32s)]
*  She's so changed, just since the last time I saw her. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=619.48s)]
*  And her pulse is as strong as can be, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=624.92s)]
*  and regular, and I'm feeling it right now. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=627.6s)]
*  So her heart seems strong, but she has so deteriorated. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=630.24s)]
*  Come on, stand up, Carol, come on. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=641.72s)]
*  Earlier that morning, they'd shown us how hard it is [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=645.36s)]
*  to get Carol ready for the day. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=647.88s)]
*  What didn't you realize would happen? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=650.52s)]
*  That she becomes a vegetable. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=653.48s)]
*  That's basically what I feel like she is now. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=656.4s)]
*  Mike is still too heavy. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=658.92s)]
*  His blood pressure's too high. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=660.84s)]
*  And a few months ago, his thoughts were too dark. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=662.72s)]
*  Ready to put the gun to my head. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=666.36s)]
*  I think I really thought of suicide. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=670.96s)]
*  Really? Yeah, it got to that point. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=674.28s)]
*  Caregiving is really tough. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=676.48s)]
*  Hardest job I've ever had. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=679.12s)]
*  And that's from a former New York City cop. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=681.1999999999999s)]
*  But suicidal thoughts are not uncommon [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=684.4s)]
*  for people taking care of a family member with dementia. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=686.64s)]
*  Mike hired more aides, so Carol now has 24-hour help. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=690.28s)]
*  It's draining his savings, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=694.56s)]
*  but allowing him to get out of the house [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=696.04s)]
*  and make new friends. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=698.0799999999999s)]
*  And that's helping lift his depression. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=699.76s)]
*  I leave this at home. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=702.92s)]
*  And when I go out, it's a new Mike out there, though. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=704.88s)]
*  But at home, he worries that Carol is in danger. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=708.56s)]
*  Has she fallen? Yes. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=712.4s)]
*  She hasn't broken any bones? No. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=714.4399999999999s)]
*  Just bruises, no. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=716.0799999999999s)]
*  So now, despite years of telling us [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=718.3199999999999s)]
*  he wouldn't put Carol in a nursing home... [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=720.72s)]
*  I'm coming to the point where maybe a nursing home [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=723.24s)]
*  is the answer for her, for her safety. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=728.56s)]
*  Ten days after that, and 53 years after their wedding day, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=732.84s)]
*  Mike did put Carol in a nursing home. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=736.8399999999999s)]
*  Do you still love her? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=739.56s)]
*  I loved Carol, who was Carol. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=741.5999999999999s)]
*  But now, Carol's not Carol anymore. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=746.0s)]
*  When Carol was still Carol, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=751.0s)]
*  that would have been the best time to discuss [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=753.3199999999999s)]
*  the kind of caregiving decisions [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=755.28s)]
*  Mike Daley eventually had to face alone. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=757.0s)]
*  Mike hopes that sharing such intimate details of their lives [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=760.7199999999999s)]
*  will help others be better prepared than they were. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=764.2s)]
*  This is a story about the cruelest disease [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=777.84s)]
*  you have never heard of. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=780.48s)]
*  It's called frontotemporal dementia, or FTD. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=782.48s)]
*  And given the devastating toll it takes on its victims [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=786.6400000000001s)]
*  and their families, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=789.96s)]
*  it ought to be much better known than it is. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=791.3199999999999s)]
*  FTD is the number one form of dementia [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=794.8399999999999s)]
*  in Americans under the age of 60. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=797.9599999999999s)]
*  What causes it is unclear, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=800.8s)]
*  but it attacks the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=803.56s)]
*  which control personality and speech, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=807.04s)]
*  and it's always fatal. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=809.8399999999999s)]
*  It is not Alzheimer's disease, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=812.48s)]
*  which degrades the part of the brain responsible for memory. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=814.48s)]
*  With FTD, people either display such bizarre behavior [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=818.08s)]
*  that their loved ones can hardly recognize them, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=822.84s)]
*  or they lose the ability to recognize themselves. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=825.84s)]
*  That's what happened to Tracy Lind one day a few years ago [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=830.2s)]
*  as she was standing in a public restroom. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=834.48s)]
*  I was washing my hands and I looked in the mirror [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=838.12s)]
*  and I did not recognize my own face. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=840.1600000000001s)]
*  Didn't recognize yourself. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=842.6400000000001s)]
*  No, I looked in the mirror [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=844.6s)]
*  and I kept looking, I remember, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=846.84s)]
*  I kept looking at this woman wondering who was she? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=849.8000000000001s)]
*  This is who she was, the very Reverend Tracy Lind, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=853.2800000000001s)]
*  Dean of the Episcopal Cathedral in Cleveland, Ohio, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=857.48s)]
*  one of the city's most prominent preachers and civic leaders. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=861.0400000000001s)]
*  She was 61 years old when both she and her spouse, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=865.0400000000001s)]
*  Emily Ingalls, began to notice trouble [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=868.96s)]
*  with things Tracy had always done very well, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=871.64s)]
*  like finding the right word, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=875.24s)]
*  recognizing congregants and friends' faces, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=877.44s)]
*  and of course, her own. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=880.5600000000001s)]
*  That's when I said, oh man, I gotta go see a doctor. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=882.88s)]
*  When that happened, were you scared? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=886.16s)]
*  Oh, I was scared to death. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=888.4s)]
*  Emily, what did you think was happening? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=890.2s)]
*  I thought there's something not right with her brain. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=892.6800000000001s)]
*  On election day 2016, Tracy Lind got the diagnosis, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=895.8s)]
*  frontotemporal dementia. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=900.8s)]
*  She has what's called the speech variant of the disease, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=903.04s)]
*  which among other things, attacks the part of the brain [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=906.48s)]
*  where language lives. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=909.56s)]
*  Sometimes you're just, you're fine and you're on. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=911.28s)]
*  And then there are other times [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=915.04s)]
*  that the words just don't come out. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=917.4s)]
*  I mean, even if I know what the word is, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=920.48s)]
*  sometimes I feel like I'm playing bingo. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=924.7199999999999s)]
*  And when I find the word, it's like I shout it. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=926.8399999999999s)]
*  I feel like an imbecile, you know. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=929.3199999999999s)]
*  Apple, oh yeah, apple, that's it, and I get all excited. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=932.28s)]
*  This is acutely painful for Tracy [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=936.04s)]
*  because being a powerful, effective speaker [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=938.8s)]
*  has always been at the core of her identity. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=941.72s)]
*  One of the first things you did [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=944.6800000000001s)]
*  once you got this diagnosis was to resign from your job [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=946.72s)]
*  as dean at Trinity Cathedral. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=950.92s)]
*  Why did you take that action so quickly? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=953.84s)]
*  Mainly it was, I knew I was starting to fail, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=956.08s)]
*  even though I was faking it pretty well. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=959.76s)]
*  Since stepping down, Tracy and Emily [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=965.28s)]
*  have traveled around the country and the world [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=967.84s)]
*  speaking and preaching about her FTD, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=970.36s)]
*  or as Tracy puts it, telling the story of dementia [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=973.68s)]
*  from the inside out. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=977.24s)]
*  I was determined to live what I had been preaching [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=979.16s)]
*  for over 30 years, that out of pain comes joy. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=982.68s)]
*  I'm gonna face this disease called FTD [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=987.7199999999999s)]
*  that I'd never heard of before, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=994.04s)]
*  and I'm gonna see what I can do with it. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=996.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you are aware of how unique [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=998.88s)]
*  this situation is, that you are in the middle [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1003.4799999999999s)]
*  of this decline from dementia, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1006.88s)]
*  and yet you're so able to articulate what that's like. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1010.7199999999999s)]
*  I am aware of that. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1015.96s)]
*  I think my curiosity is what's getting me through it. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1017.88s)]
*  Because otherwise, I'm just gonna lay down [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1022.12s)]
*  and roll up in a ball. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1025.24s)]
*  Tracy says she has good days and bad days. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1028.8s)]
*  Just in our interview, there were moments [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1032.28s)]
*  when she was completely in control, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1034.3600000000001s)]
*  and moments when she wasn't. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1036.84s)]
*  And I'm doing some, you know, I'm, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1038.88s)]
*  I know there's no, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1046.68s)]
*  Do you want help? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1052.96s)]
*  Can you help, please? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1053.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1054.68s)]
*  This is the way this very sad illness presents. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1056.0s)]
*  Dr. Bruce Miller may be the world's leading expert [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1059.8s)]
*  on frontotemporal dementia. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1063.0s)]
*  He runs a lab at the University of California, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1065.04s)]
*  San Francisco, that's doing cutting edge research [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1067.64s)]
*  on the two main forms of FTD. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1070.84s)]
*  The speech variant that Tracy Lind has, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1073.68s)]
*  and a behavioral variant that attacks personality, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1076.3200000000002s)]
*  judgment, and empathy. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1079.92s)]
*  Pleasure to see you both again. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1081.92s)]
*  On the day we visited Dr. Miller's clinic, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1083.88s)]
*  he and his team met with FTD patient, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1086.6000000000001s)]
*  Thomas Cox, and his wife, Laurie. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1089.5600000000002s)]
*  At first glance, Thomas seems fine, but he's not. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1092.3600000000001s)]
*  I've got an FTD. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1097.2s)]
*  Okay, and has it affected you so far? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1098.48s)]
*  No. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1101.88s)]
*  In fact, Laurie Cox says that starting a few years ago, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1103.4s)]
*  Thomas lost interest in her, in their son, and in his work, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1107.3200000000002s)]
*  so much that he was fired from his job. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1112.1200000000001s)]
*  By now, he's pretty much reduced [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1115.16s)]
*  to looking at photos on his phone. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1117.44s)]
*  That's Bugatti. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1119.8400000000001s)]
*  That's our dog. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1121.8400000000001s)]
*  Your dog. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1123.0400000000002s)]
*  I can blame the disease. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1124.1200000000001s)]
*  I can say that the disease stole my husband. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1125.48s)]
*  When a family sees someone with this illness, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1129.16s)]
*  they don't recognize them. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1132.08s)]
*  This is not the person I married that I love. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1133.84s)]
*  This is not my father or my mother. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1137.28s)]
*  You have said that FTD attacks people [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1140.08s)]
*  at the very soul of their humanity. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1144.04s)]
*  This is profound as anything [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1147.72s)]
*  that can happen to a human being. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1149.3999999999999s)]
*  It robs us of our very essence of our humanity, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1151.6399999999999s)]
*  of who we are. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1155.12s)]
*  Bruce Miller says because so many cases [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1156.8s)]
*  are first misdiagnosed as mental illness, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1159.56s)]
*  it takes an average of three years [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1162.6399999999999s)]
*  and several expensive brain scans [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1164.76s)]
*  to get a correct diagnosis of FTD. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1167.08s)]
*  So whether it's 20,000 new cases every year, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1170.36s)]
*  100,000, 200,000, we still don't know. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1173.6799999999998s)]
*  But in young people with neurodegeneration, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1177.72s)]
*  frontotemporal dementia is a big one. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1181.56s)]
*  So if you see someone who is suffering dementia [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1183.6s)]
*  at a younger age, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1186.6399999999999s)]
*  very strong likelihood that it's FTD. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1188.2s)]
*  Dr. Miller showed us this composite image [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1191.52s)]
*  of two of the major degenerative brain diseases. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1194.28s)]
*  Frontotemporal dementia, shown in blue, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1197.72s)]
*  Alzheimer's disease, shown in red. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1200.44s)]
*  So very different geography, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1203.3600000000001s)]
*  very different clinical manifestations. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1205.8000000000002s)]
*  What does the blue indicate? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1208.76s)]
*  The blue indicates that there's loss of tissue. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1210.4s)]
*  When we see loss of tissue in that brain region, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1213.5600000000002s)]
*  we know people have lost their interest in life, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1216.88s)]
*  their drive, they do less, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1219.96s)]
*  they care less about other people. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1222.96s)]
*  That loss of empathy, Miller says, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1225.4s)]
*  can produce dangerous, impulsive, even criminal behavior. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1227.6000000000001s)]
*  And those with behavioral FTD [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1231.44s)]
*  are rarely aware that anything has changed. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1234.24s)]
*  He went from being a caring, doting father and husband, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1238.0800000000002s)]
*  then it just seemed like he flipped the switch off [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1243.64s)]
*  and he had no idea that he changed. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1246.3999999999999s)]
*  He had no idea. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1248.8799999999999s)]
*  Amy Johnson and her husband, Mark, married in 2006, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1250.6s)]
*  settled in the small Minnesota town of Wyndham, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1254.9199999999998s)]
*  and now have four young children, three boys and a girl. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1257.76s)]
*  Three years ago, Amy says, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1262.3999999999999s)]
*  Mark suddenly seemed to stop caring about her and the kids. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1264.4799999999998s)]
*  That's the first time that I really remember thinking [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1268.76s)]
*  to myself, what happened? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1270.6799999999998s)]
*  Where did you go? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1272.8s)]
*  Amy recalls a day when she left Mark [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1274.44s)]
*  in charge of their sons, then three and two, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1276.76s)]
*  only to come home and find the boys playing outside, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1279.8s)]
*  alone, by a busy street, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1283.48s)]
*  while Mark sat inside watching TV, oblivious. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1285.76s)]
*  On other days, he began to display compulsive behavior [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1290.0s)]
*  she had never seen before. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1293.88s)]
*  He couldn't stop eating. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1296.28s)]
*  I started locking the food up. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1297.4s)]
*  He would walk down to the grocery store and buy more. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1299.24s)]
*  I took his credit card. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1301.48s)]
*  He'd walk down to the grocery store and steal food. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1302.52s)]
*  I mean, these changes that you saw, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1305.04s)]
*  did you ask him what's going on? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1306.48s)]
*  Yeah, and he just said, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1308.24s)]
*  oh, I don't think anything's different, is it? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1309.56s)]
*  It was. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1312.52s)]
*  Mark began making inappropriate remarks [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1313.92s)]
*  to a female coworker at the company [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1316.8s)]
*  where he worked as a manufacturing engineer. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1319.32s)]
*  He was fired. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1322.08s)]
*  And his reaction was, oh, well, I guess, okay. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1325.24s)]
*  So what's for supper tonight? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1331.08s)]
*  What was your reaction? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1332.76s)]
*  I was just devastated. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1334.28s)]
*  I was seven months pregnant at the time with our daughter. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1336.8s)]
*  With your fourth child? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1339.52s)]
*  With my fourth child. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1340.52s)]
*  So as this progresses, what's the eventual outcome? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1342.56s)]
*  Outcome of this is always death. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1347.52s)]
*  Always death. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1350.48s)]
*  Always death. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1351.4s)]
*  We have no way of intervening yet to slow the progression. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1352.24s)]
*  As FTD corrodes the brain, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1357.84s)]
*  it also eventually causes bodily functions to shut down. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1360.36s)]
*  That's what leads to death. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1363.8s)]
*  But Bruce Miller is optimistic, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1366.36s)]
*  pointing to promising research, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1368.48s)]
*  both in his lab and funded by NIH grants [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1370.3999999999999s)]
*  to scientists around the country. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1373.9199999999998s)]
*  Suddenly we have interventions in research [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1376.2s)]
*  that are going on that give me great hope. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1379.44s)]
*  When might you expect a breakthrough? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1382.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm hoping in the next five years [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1384.84s)]
*  that we will have very powerful therapies [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1386.76s)]
*  in certain variants of frontotemporal dementia [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1390.6s)]
*  that may stop it cold. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1394.4s)]
*  Tracy Lind and Emily Ingalls have no idea [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1396.64s)]
*  whether any breakthrough will come in time to help them. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1400.0s)]
*  If not, Tracy will eventually lose the ability [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1403.76s)]
*  to speak at all and then the ability to swallow. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1407.2s)]
*  The not being able to swallow part, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1411.16s)]
*  that's what's really frightening. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1413.48s)]
*  So I try to live in the present moment. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1416.08s)]
*  I'm not very good at living in the moment, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1420.3999999999999s)]
*  so I worry a lot about the future. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1422.12s)]
*  Do you worry about taking care of me? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1424.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I worry about taking care of you. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1427.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1430.6s)]
*  What's gonna be the hardest part? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1431.72s)]
*  I think the hardest part is gonna be [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1433.72s)]
*  the loss of the relationship. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1435.0s)]
*  Has Emily told you this before? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1437.9199999999998s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1441.52s)]
*  As you can see, caregivers suffer as much as patients. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1445.48s)]
*  For months, Amy Johnson kept Mark at home, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1450.08s)]
*  even as she mothered four small children [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1453.24s)]
*  and held a full-time job. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1455.84s)]
*  But his symptoms got worse and worse. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1458.1999999999998s)]
*  When did it become clear to you [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1461.0s)]
*  that you had to put him in a facility? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1462.36s)]
*  I went to an appointment [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1467.36s)]
*  with a psychiatric nurse practitioner, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1469.6799999999998s)]
*  and she said, I think it's time for you [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1472.64s)]
*  to look for a different place. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1474.92s)]
*  Because now when he thinks of something, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1476.52s)]
*  the part of his brain that tells him that's a bad idea [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1478.52s)]
*  doesn't work anymore. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1480.84s)]
*  Mark Johnson now lives in a facility [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1482.48s)]
*  about an hour away from home. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1484.8s)]
*  He's gained nearly 100 pounds due to compulsive eating, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1487.32s)]
*  even walking into elderly residents' rooms [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1491.08s)]
*  and taking their food. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1493.64s)]
*  Amy says his care now costs her nearly $7,000 a month. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1495.84s)]
*  Out of pocket? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1501.48s)]
*  Out of pocket. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1502.3999999999999s)]
*  He would be devastated to know [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1503.76s)]
*  that that's where his retirement savings are going [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1504.8s)]
*  and that they're not going to his family. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1507.12s)]
*  Crippling costs are common for FTD families, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1509.1999999999998s)]
*  and it's often tough to find a facility [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1512.4399999999998s)]
*  to care for patients like Mark Johnson. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1515.0s)]
*  The assisted living industry is not set up [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1517.76s)]
*  for six-foot-three 40-year-olds. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1520.4399999999998s)]
*  How's it going? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1523.3999999999999s)]
*  This is Bill. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1524.24s)]
*  How are you? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1525.1999999999998s)]
*  Very nice to meet you. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1526.04s)]
*  Amy visits Mark as often as she can [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1527.04s)]
*  and invited us to come along one afternoon. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1530.0s)]
*  He told us he'd just like to go home. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1532.96s)]
*  Do you think you need help? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1536.48s)]
*  No. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1539.2s)]
*  So you understand why you're here? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1543.56s)]
*  No. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1546.6000000000001s)]
*  Think you'd be okay at home? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1550.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1554.76s)]
*  I think Amy thinks, I don't want to put words in her mouth, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1559.96s)]
*  but I think she thinks this is the best place [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1565.16s)]
*  for you right now. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1567.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1569.2s)]
*  After another minute, Mark said, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1571.48s)]
*  all right, see ya, and we left him. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1574.1200000000001s)]
*  Big hug. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1577.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1578.2s)]
*  It's clearly painful for Amy to see [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1580.64s)]
*  what FTD has done to her husband [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1582.96s)]
*  and the way she's treated him. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1585.32s)]
*  She wants to see what FTD has done to her husband [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1587.28s)]
*  and to know what it will do. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1589.96s)]
*  They gave him two to five years to live. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1593.0s)]
*  Two to five years. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1595.52s)]
*  Two to five years. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1596.68s)]
*  So how are you doing now? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1598.36s)]
*  It depends on the day. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1600.16s)]
*  I miss him a lot. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1604.44s)]
*  Nobel Prize winning Colombian novelist, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1618.24s)]
*  Gabriel Garcia Marquez, once wrote of a mythical town [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1620.96s)]
*  in the middle of the jungle whose residents suffer [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1624.76s)]
*  from a mysterious affliction that erases their memories. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1627.48s)]
*  Today in a region of Colombia called Antioquia, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1631.68s)]
*  reality appears to be imitating fiction [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1635.2s)]
*  in a way that may answer questions for all of us. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1638.32s)]
*  As we first reported last fall, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1641.84s)]
*  Antioquia is home to the largest concentration [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1644.24s)]
*  in the world of people who carry a rare genetic mutation [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1647.04s)]

*  And as devastating as Alzheimer's is anywhere, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1656.48s)]
*  this is a particularly cruel version. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1659.8s)]
*  It strikes when people are in their mid-40s [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1662.52s)]
*  and lead to death about a decade later. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1665.3999999999999s)]
*  It is a tragic situation, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1668.44s)]
*  but a perfect scientific laboratory. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1670.84s)]

*  and lush countryside of Antioquia, Colombia, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1688.44s)]
*  whose capital city, Medellin, was once famous for murder [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1692.3600000000001s)]

*  a battle against an insidious disease. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1711.8400000000001s)]
*  This family, Mother Cecilia, her seven children [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1715.72s)]
*  and grandchildren, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1719.0s)]
*  lost its patriarch, Alonso. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1721.48s)]
*  For me, my father was number one. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1724.88s)]
*  Freddy, the oldest, remembers his dad, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1727.5600000000002s)]
*  always eager to join in and play with him and his friends. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1730.64s)]
*  He was a very joyful person. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1737.0400000000002s)]
*  He loved to dance. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1738.8000000000002s)]
*  He was a really nice person, a very good father [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1741.64s)]
*  before the disease. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1746.5200000000002s)]
*  When it first started, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1748.3600000000001s)]
*  what were you noticing that made you think, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1750.3600000000001s)]
*  he's different? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1752.3200000000002s)]
*  He started asking, what is the date today? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1756.64s)]
*  Do I have to go to work? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1758.64s)]
*  And we got concerned. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1760.3200000000002s)]
*  Alonso at the time was in his mid-40s, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1762.24s)]
*  so the memory loss and confusion made no sense. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1765.32s)]
*  His doctor suggested exercise and vitamins, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1769.12s)]
*  but Alonso just got worse, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1772.84s)]
*  forgetting the names of his children, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1775.0s)]
*  getting lost and disoriented. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1777.08s)]
*  His son, Victor, had to help him get dressed. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1779.76s)]
*  I gave him his shirt and I told him, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1784.6399999999999s)]
*  Dad, come, I'll help you put your shirt on. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1786.56s)]
*  And the first thing he did was to grab it. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1791.6s)]
*  And put it on through his feet. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1795.44s)]
*  Did he understand what was happening to him? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1798.44s)]
*  There were moments of lucidity, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1803.96s)]
*  where he would ask me and say, son, what's happening to me? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1806.84s)]
*  Why don't I remember? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1811.36s)]
*  I don't remember my children or my wife. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1813.36s)]
*  I don't know who I am. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1817.8799999999999s)]
*  His son, Julio, took him back to see the doctor. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1819.8799999999999s)]
*  When I asked the doctor, I told him, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1822.88s)]
*  Doctor, I'm not leaving here. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1824.88s)]
*  Until you tell me what is wrong with my father. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1836.88s)]
*  The doctor sent them to Francisco Lopera, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1841.4s)]
*  a neurologist at the University of Antioquia, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1844.4s)]
*  who knew exactly what was going on. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1847.4s)]
*  He was a young man who was at the University of Antioquia [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1850.4s)]
*  who knew exactly what was wrong with Alonso [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1853.4s)]
*  because he'd become the local authority [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1856.4s)]
*  on a rash of early onset Alzheimer's cases [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1859.4s)]
*  in and around Medellin. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1862.4s)]
*  They were getting disease very early in their life. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1864.4s)]
*  It all began many years earlier, back in the 1980s, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1868.4s)]
*  when Lopera was a young medical resident. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1872.4s)]
*  He had read about small numbers of people [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1875.4s)]
*  who developed Alzheimer's in their 40s. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1878.4s)]
*  So when a 47-year-old man came into his Medellin clinic [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1881.4s)]
*  with Alzheimer's-like symptoms, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1885.4s)]
*  he was intrigued and decided to investigate. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1887.4s)]
*  You met this one man, and you decided to go to where he was from? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1891.4s)]
*  I decided to go to the town where he was living. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1895.4s)]
*  Lopera learned that the man's father and grandfather [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1899.4s)]
*  had also lost their memories in their 40s. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1903.4s)]
*  Then, a few years later, another similar patient came into the clinic, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1906.4s)]
*  this time a 42-year-old woman from a town 40 miles away. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1910.4s)]
*  Dr. Lopera's then-nurse, Lucia Madrigal, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1915.4s)]
*  asked if any of her relatives also started losing their memories [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1919.4s)]
*  when they were young. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1923.4s)]
*  They told us, yes, that the father, the uncles, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1925.4s)]
*  the grandfather, the great-grandfather. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1930.4s)]
*  So I started making a little family tree on one page. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1934.4s)]
*  And I showed it to Dr. Lopera and told him, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1938.4s)]
*  look what we have here, what is this, so many with the same disease. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1941.4s)]
*  And so began a detective hunt that lasted more than a decade. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1945.4s)]
*  Lopera and Madrigal traveled all over the region, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1951.4s)]
*  finding more and more people afflicted with early-onset Alzheimer's [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1954.4s)]
*  and compiling family trees. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1958.4s)]
*  They thought it might be genetic. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1961.4s)]
*  So Madrigal spent days at parish churches, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1965.4s)]
*  poring over heavy ledgers where priests for generations [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1968.4s)]
*  had recorded village births, marriages and deaths. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1972.4s)]
*  Thanks to these meticulous records, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1976.4s)]
*  she was able to trace the disease back hundreds of years [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1979.4s)]
*  and to make an important discovery. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1983.4s)]
*  The different families were actually one huge extended family [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1985.4s)]
*  connected generations back by common ancestors who had died young [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1990.4s)]
*  with an unusual cause of death written down by the priest, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1995.4s)]
*  softening of the brain. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=1999.4s)]
*  This is what softening of the brain looks like in real life. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2003.4s)]
*  Fernando is 46 years old, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2007.4s)]
*  a descendant of that second patient years ago. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2010.4s)]
*  He started forgetting things when he was in his late 30s [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2015.4s)]
*  and now can no longer speak, feed himself [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2019.4s)]
*  or do just about anything on his own. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2026.4s)]
*  His aunt takes care of him round the clock [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2031.4s)]
*  just as she did with his mother when she got the disease at the same age. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2034.4s)]
*  Norelli is at an even later stage of the disease. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2040.4s)]
*  Despite her appearance, she is just 58 years old. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2044.4s)]
*  Patients were going from mild symptoms to complete dementia [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2049.4s)]
*  and then death within about a decade [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2052.4s)]
*  as Dr. Lepera showed us in these cognitive test results. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2055.4s)]
*  You can see at 38. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2059.4s)]
*  Even at 38, this man struggled, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2061.4s)]
*  as many older Alzheimer's patients do, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2064.4s)]
*  to copy a complex drawing accurately. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2067.4s)]
*  At 45. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2070.4s)]
*  And things got worse from there. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2072.4s)]
*  He lost more. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2074.4s)]
*  At 50. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2077.4s)]
*  At 51. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2081.4s)]
*  Dr. Lepera was convinced that what he and Madrigal were discovering [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2084.4s)]
*  was scientifically important. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2089.4s)]
*  But even as they found more patients and more related families, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2092.4s)]
*  he couldn't get anyone outside Colombia to take notice [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2096.4s)]
*  until 1993, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2100.4s)]
*  when a Harvard professor came to give a talk about Alzheimer's in Bogota [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2103.4s)]
*  several hours away. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2107.4s)]
*  There was a person in the audience, Francisco Lepera, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2109.4s)]
*  who came up after the talk and said, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2112.4s)]
*  you know, I have a family here that has early onset Alzheimer's. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2115.4s)]
*  Ken Koscik, now at UC Santa Barbara, was that professor. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2120.4s)]
*  A family. Could have been four people. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2125.4s)]
*  It could have been just four people, but he started to tell me how many it was. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2127.4s)]
*  And as I listened to him, I became just so absorbed [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2130.4s)]
*  and taken with what he was telling me that I changed all my plans, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2135.4s)]
*  went with him to Medellin, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2140.4s)]
*  and we began a collaboration that goes on to this day. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2143.4s)]
*  They showed Koscik what Lucia Madrigal showed us, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2146.4s)]
*  the family tree they had compiled based on all that searching through church records [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2150.4s)]
*  for just one of the affected families going back all the way to the 1800s. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2155.4s)]
*  This is one family? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2161.4s)]
*  Una sola. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2163.4s)]
*  It just kept unfolding and unfolding. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2165.4s)]
*  Covering these pages are small squares representing men, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2169.4s)]
*  circles for women. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2173.4s)]
*  The colored-in squares and circles mean the person got sick with Alzheimer's [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2175.4s)]
*  at an early age. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2179.4s)]
*  Look, she had these sons and a daughter, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2180.4s)]
*  and then it just kept going down through the generations. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2183.4s)]
*  When we looked at the family trees, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2186.4s)]
*  about 50% of the offspring were getting the disease. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2188.4s)]
*  That's a clear signature of a gene. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2192.4s)]
*  But what gene? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2196.4s)]
*  Koscik connected Dr. Lepera with leading geneticists in the U.S. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2198.4s)]
*  and they started collecting blood samples and searching. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2203.4s)]
*  Within a year, a major breakthrough. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2207.4s)]
*  They found a specific mutation in a gene on chromosome 14, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2210.4s)]
*  one tiny flaw in the DNA responsible for all this family suffering. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2215.4s)]
*  The discovery was published in 1997 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2221.4s)]
*  Lepera had identified the largest concentration of early onset Alzheimer's cases in the world. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2227.4s)]
*  If a person has that mutation, do they get Alzheimer's? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2234.4s)]
*  Yes, they do. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2239.4s)]
*  If they have it, they definitely get the disease. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2240.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2243.4s)]
*  There are some mutations where you don't definitely get it, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2244.4s)]
*  but this is a bad one. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2246.4s)]
*  And if you have this mutation, you get it. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2248.4s)]
*  For families like Alonso's, discovering the mutation was a blessing, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2250.4s)]
*  a crucial first step toward finding a way to fight the disease. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2255.4s)]
*  But it was also a curse because it meant that anyone whose parent had the mutation [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2259.4s)]
*  has a 50-50 chance of having inherited it too. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2265.4s)]
*  Do any of you know if you have that mutation? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2269.4s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2274.4s)]
*  No. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2275.4s)]
*  Nobody knows. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2276.4s)]
*  Nobody knows. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2277.4s)]
*  Well, somebody knows. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2278.4s)]
*  Dr. Lepera and his team have been testing for the mutation and compiling a database. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2280.4s)]
*  But their policy is not to tell family members if they have the mutation or not [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2285.4s)]
*  and not even to reveal the results to Dr. Lepera. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2291.4s)]
*  Since at this point, there is nothing that can be done to help. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2294.4s)]
*  Sometimes I ask which one will get it, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2298.4s)]
*  but I throw that thought away because I don't want to think about that. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2302.4s)]
*  I pray a lot to God that none of them gets it. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2306.4s)]
*  I don't want to see my children with that disease. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2309.4s)]
*  Each one of you knows because of your father that you have a 50-50 chance. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2314.4s)]
*  So what kind of a weight does that put on you day in and day out? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2321.4s)]
*  I've even prayed to God that if there's one person who has to have the disease, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2327.4s)]
*  I say to God, let it be me. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2335.4s)]
*  I thank God that I'm a nurse and that I would be able to take care of them, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2338.4s)]
*  but I tell myself first I had to go through it with my dad, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2344.4s)]
*  the experience of the disease. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2351.4s)]
*  And I may have to go through it with one of my siblings or with several we don't know. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2355.4s)]
*  Sarah told us she would love to have children of her own, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2360.4s)]
*  but given her risk of developing the disease, she's decided against it. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2364.4s)]
*  So that my children don't have to go through my same experience. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2371.4s)]
*  You've been working on this for 30 years. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2376.4s)]
*  How do you cope with all this pain? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2379.4s)]
*  It was not the response we had expected. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2384.4s)]
*  It's that hard. It's that hard. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2394.4s)]
*  But Dr. Lopera knew that even in the midst of all his tragedy, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2400.4s)]
*  there might just be a glimmer of hope, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2404.4s)]
*  because what he had discovered in these families, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2407.4s)]
*  hundreds of people destined to develop Alzheimer's [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2410.4s)]
*  and easily identifiable with a simple genetic test, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2413.4s)]
*  presented a unique scientific opportunity to test whether it's possible [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2417.4s)]
*  to step in and stop early onset and maybe all Alzheimer's disease before it starts. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2422.4s)]
*  That part of the story when we come back. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2429.4s)]
*  Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2433.4s)]
*  More than five million Americans have Alzheimer's right now. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2444.4s)]
*  And given the aging baby boomer population, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2448.4s)]
*  that number is projected to nearly triple by mid-century. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2451.4s)]
*  Yet unlike many other leading killers, there is no effective treatment. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2456.4s)]
*  And Alzheimer's diagnosis is essentially a prescription for a slow descent into oblivion [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2461.4s)]
*  and an exorbitant loss of the memories, spatial skills, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2467.4s)]
*  and ability to think that make us who we are. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2471.4s)]
*  Early onset Alzheimer's patients, like the hundreds of family members in Colombia, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2475.4s)]
*  are a tiny fraction of the whole. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2480.4s)]
*  But to scientists, they could be everything, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2483.4s)]
*  because they are offering researchers something they have never had before, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2486.4s)]
*  a way to test whether intervening early before any symptoms start [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2490.4s)]
*  might halt the disease in its tracks. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2495.4s)]
*  Answers are still years away, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2498.4s)]
*  but with more than a thousand Americans developing Alzheimer's every day, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2501.4s)]
*  a way to prevent it cannot come soon enough. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2505.4s)]
*  The scene we witnessed in Dr. Pierre Theriot's exam room [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2510.4s)]
*  at the Banner Alzheimer's Institute in Phoenix [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2515.4s)]
*  is one that plays out in neurologist offices every day. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2518.4s)]
*  So if I asked you what city we're in right now, what would you say? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2522.4s)]
*  You know, right, I don't know at this moment. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2526.4s)]
*  Norm, age 72, has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2532.4s)]
*  the typical late in life form so many of us fear. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2536.4s)]
*  It begins with mild memory and thinking problems [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2540.4s)]
*  and spirals into full-on dementia. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2544.4s)]
*  Who is that young lady over there? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2547.4s)]
*  Betsy. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2550.4s)]
*  Betsy. And is she a friend? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2551.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2554.4s)]
*  How do you know Betsy? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2556.4s)]
*  Because I've been loving her for a long time. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2558.4s)]
*  Okay. Is she your sister? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2561.4s)]
*  A little bit of both. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2564.4s)]
*  Uh-huh. Is she your wife? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2567.4s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2570.4s)]
*  Okay. Okay. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2573.4s)]
*  I think you're somebody. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2575.4s)]
*  Really good. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2578.4s)]
*  I wish I was. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2579.4s)]
*  They've been married 51 years. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2580.4s)]
*  Unlike early onset Alzheimer's, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2583.4s)]
*  there's been no single gene identified that causes this. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2586.4s)]
*  Now touch your nose. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2589.4s)]
*  No way to know who among us is destined to get it. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2591.4s)]
*  What percentage of all people are going to get Alzheimer's? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2595.4s)]
*  One percent of us 60 or older will have a dementia like Alzheimer's disease, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2599.4s)]
*  but by the time you hit 85, that percentage is approaching 40-ish percent. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2605.4s)]
*  That's a Dogen, and these are Gogens. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2611.4s)]
*  Alzheimer's disease has been called out by the World Health Organization [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2616.4s)]
*  as the coming pandemic of the West. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2620.4s)]
*  We have to do something to put it behind us. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2623.4s)]
*  Can you draw the numbers for a clock? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2626.4s)]
*  But Dr. Claudia Kawas, a leading Alzheimer's researcher and clinician [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2629.4s)]
*  at the University of California Irvine, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2633.4s)]
*  says she's frustrated that she can't offer her patients any hope. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2636.4s)]
*  Oops. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2640.4s)]
*  I have to say, I've been doing this now for a third of a century, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2642.4s)]
*  and when I started, I just never would have believed [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2646.4s)]
*  we would still not be closer than we are now to making a real difference. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2649.4s)]
*  It has been a little disappointing. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2655.4s)]
*  It hasn't been for lack of trying. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2658.4s)]
*  Kawas gave us a quick primer on the telltale signs of Alzheimer's [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2661.4s)]
*  in the brain after autopsy. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2665.4s)]
*  Every place you see a brown spot, that is a senile amyloid plaque. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2668.4s)]
*  In contrast, you see these black things that tend to be triangular shaped. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2673.4s)]
*  Those are what we call neurofibrillary tangles. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2677.4s)]
*  The relationship between plaques and tangles isn't completely understood, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2680.4s)]
*  but because it's been shown that amyloid plaques build up in the brain [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2685.4s)]
*  before tangles and years before patients develop symptoms, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2689.4s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies have spent hundreds of millions of dollars [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2694.4s)]
*  since the early 2000s developing drugs to remove amyloid from the brain [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2698.4s)]
*  and hundreds of millions more to test those drugs in patients like Norm. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2704.4s)]
*  Of all the trials that have been done, what percent have succeeded? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2709.4s)]
*  About 1%. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2715.4s)]
*  In other words, a resounding failure. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2717.4s)]
*  So what does that say, do you think? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2720.4s)]
*  Well, it says either amyloid is not the right thing to go after [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2722.4s)]
*  or it says we need to remove it earlier on in the process [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2726.4s)]
*  before it's made all the other things cascade after it. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2730.4s)]
*  You know, if you give a polio vaccine when somebody has polio, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2733.4s)]
*  you can understand why it doesn't work. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2737.4s)]
*  You're saying that maybe those drugs haven't worked [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2739.4s)]
*  because the person already had Alzheimer's? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2742.4s)]
*  Exactly, and maybe if we give them early enough, it might work. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2745.4s)]
*  But how can you test drugs on people before they develop the disease [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2749.4s)]
*  when you don't know who among us is going to get it? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2754.4s)]
*  So good morning, sir. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2757.4s)]
*  Dr. Terrio and the executive director at the Banner Alzheimer's Institute, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2759.4s)]
*  Dr. Eric Ryman, realized there was a place where you could know [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2763.4s)]
*  who was going to get Alzheimer's. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2768.4s)]
*  Antiochia. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2771.4s)]
*  That's when my phone began to ring. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2773.4s)]
*  By then, Ken Kosick had been studying the Colombian extended family for 15 years. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2775.4s)]
*  Received a call from the people at Banner and they said, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2781.4s)]
*  you know, you have this family. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2785.4s)]
*  We know when they're going to get it, we know who's going to get it. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2787.4s)]
*  Can we start treating before the disease strikes? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2791.4s)]
*  Kosick connected Terrio and Ryman with Dr. Lepera, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2794.4s)]
*  who by that time had identified hundreds of people who carried the gene mutation, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2798.4s)]
*  guaranteeing that they would be struck with Alzheimer's in the prime of their lives. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2803.4s)]
*  Ryman and Terrio traveled to Medellin and met with both healthy [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2809.4s)]
*  and sick members of the extended family. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2813.4s)]
*  Is this particular family in the world extraordinary? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2816.4s)]
*  There's nothing else like it. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2822.4s)]
*  The idea that there's this concentration within roughly 100 miles of each other [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2824.4s)]
*  is just an extraordinary phenomenon. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2830.4s)]
*  And a perfect scientific laboratory. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2834.4s)]
*  To lay the groundwork for a large clinical trial, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2837.4s)]
*  Banner flew a group of extended family members from Medellin to Phoenix for PET scans. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2840.4s)]
*  One goal, to compare the brains of those with and without the mutation [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2847.4s)]
*  years before any memory loss began when they were in their 30s. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2852.4s)]
*  Dr. Ryman showed us the results. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2857.4s)]
*  This is somebody who doesn't have the gene. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2860.4s)]
*  They have no plaques in the brain. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2863.4s)]
*  But in members of the family with the mutation, it was a different story. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2865.4s)]
*  Extensive amyloid deposition in the brain. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2870.4s)]
*  That's the red. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2872.4s)]
*  Red is more amyloid, but yellow is also amyloid. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2873.4s)]
*  This brain had even more. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2876.4s)]
*  The images showed that amyloid plaques build up in the brain [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2879.4s)]
*  more than a decade before memory loss begins. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2883.4s)]
*  So if a drug could remove that red and yellow, maybe the disease could be prevented. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2887.4s)]
*  Banner developed a plan for a multimillion-dollar drug trial [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2893.4s)]
*  and convened a meeting with leading scientists, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2897.4s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies and representatives of the NIH. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2900.4s)]
*  At the end of the meeting, each scientist was allowed to say one closing thought [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2904.4s)]
*  and Francisco had the last word. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2909.4s)]
*  Lepera. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2911.4s)]
*  And he paused a long time. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2912.4s)]
*  And you could hear a pin drop in the room. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2914.4s)]
*  I said to them, we, the families, are waiting for you. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2916.4s)]
*  They're waiting for you. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2924.4s)]
*  That's the point when, you know, the goosebumps came and we said, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2926.4s)]
*  we really have to make this work. We really do. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2930.4s)]
*  And they did. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2933.4s)]
*  With a commitment of $15 million from NIH, another $15 million from philanthropists, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2935.4s)]
*  and the rest from drug company Genentech, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2941.4s)]
*  the trial on an immunotherapy drug to remove amyloid plaque [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2944.4s)]
*  enrolled its first patient three years ago, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2949.4s)]
*  and they've been enrolling more people ever since. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2952.4s)]
*  They told me about this story and I said, yes, I'll go right away. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2955.4s)]
*  And anything that you need, I'm here. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2959.4s)]
*  Freddy and all his siblings signed up. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2962.4s)]
*  The plan is to enroll a total of 300 members of the extended family [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2966.4s)]
*  who are healthy and have no memory loss yet, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2970.4s)]
*  200 who have the mutation and another 100 who don't. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2974.4s)]
*  That way, no one will learn their genetic status just by being accepted into the study. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2978.4s)]
*  Of the 200 with the mutation, half will get injections of the drug, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2984.4s)]
*  the other half will be injected with a harmless placebo. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2989.4s)]
*  The study is double-blind. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2994.4s)]
*  Neither patients nor investigators will know who's getting what. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=2996.4s)]
*  They have to come in every two weeks for at least five years, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3000.4s)]
*  long enough to see whether the group taking the drug does better than the group taking placebo. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3005.4s)]
*  Final results aren't expected until 2022. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3011.4s)]
*  Is this the first time in all these years of seeing these patients [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3016.4s)]
*  that you can actually offer them hope? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3020.4s)]
*  Yes, this is the first time because in the past we only offered them education, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3024.4s)]
*  better quality of life, but no hope to have a solution. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3030.4s)]
*  And now they have hope, a big hope. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3036.4s)]
*  What would be the best outcome? [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3039.4s)]
*  Nobody who receives the immunotherapy experiences any worsening of their thinking or memory ability. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3042.4s)]
*  It doesn't change at all, it doesn't decline. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3048.4s)]
*  That would be fabulous, that's a stretch goal. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3050.4s)]
*  And that would be just the beginning. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3053.4s)]
*  If it makes a difference for them, I think there's a reasonable chance [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3056.4s)]
*  it could make a difference for all the rest of the people who get Alzheimer's disease. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3060.4s)]
*  Tell me which hand I'm touching. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3064.4s)]
*  And that, of course, is the ultimate goal, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3066.4s)]
*  to help prevent the late-in-life form of Alzheimer's that we're all susceptible to. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3068.4s)]
*  The hope is that one day every one of us could be screened [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3074.4s)]
*  and when necessary treated before problems begin. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3078.4s)]
*  It might be the case that just like when you go to your doctor [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3082.4s)]
*  to get your cholesterol checked in your blood to see if you need drugs to lower your cholesterol, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3085.4s)]
*  you would go and get an amyloid PET scan and it would be part of routine prevention. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3090.4s)]
*  What if the drug removes the amyloid and they still get the disease? [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3097.4s)]
*  I think that'll mean that there are other things we need to be targeting besides amyloid. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3105.4s)]
*  But will you say that the drug test was successful? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3110.4s)]
*  The hardest this is to say, yes. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3114.4s)]
*  I think that we need to know the answer. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3117.4s)]
*  The answer to whether the field's focus on amyloid plaque removal for the last 15 years has been a failure. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3122.4s)]
*  If this test doesn't work, they will at least know they need to go in a different direction. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3130.4s)]
*  You know, Victor, all the other drug trials that have gone on for years have all failed. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3136.4s)]
*  You know that. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3142.4s)]
*  But this is going to be the exception. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3147.4s)]
*  This is the exception. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3150.4s)]
*  If it does work, this saves this community. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3152.4s)]
*  Wouldn't that be amazing? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3156.4s)]
*  That would be amazing. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3158.4s)]
*  To me, I am always impressed that these families that come from such a remote area of the world [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3159.4s)]
*  have the potential for informing all of us globally about a path forward for conquering Alzheimer's. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3166.4s)]
*  The study has now enrolled all its participants, and the NIH recently awarded as much as $14.8 million [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3176.4s)]
*  in additional funding over the next five years. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3184.4s)]
*  It's too late, though, for Fernando, the early onset Alzheimer's patient being cared for by his aunt. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3188.4s)]
*  He passed away this spring at the age of 47 from pneumonia. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3195.4s)]
*  Anyone who's had experience with Alzheimer's disease knows the agony of watching someone fade away [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3206.4s)]
*  as it steals memory and, at the end, a person's own identity. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3211.4s)]
*  Tonight, we'll show you an experimental way to try and beat back Alzheimer's. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3215.4s)]
*  It's been tested on just a handful of patients, but it caught our attention because of the doctor involved, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3220.4s)]
*  Dr. Ali Rezai, who 60 Minutes first met 20 years ago. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3226.4s)]
*  Dr. Rezai is a neuroscience pioneer who's developed treatments for Parkinson's disease and other brain disorders. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3231.4s)]
*  Over the last year, we followed this master of the mind as he attempted to delay the progression [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3238.4s)]
*  of Alzheimer's disease and its worst symptoms using ultrasound. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3244.4s)]
*  We saw a cutting-edge approach to brain surgery with no cutting. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3249.4s)]
*  If we can, we should not be doing brain surgery. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3253.4s)]
*  You're a brain surgeon. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3256.4s)]
*  I am. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3257.4s)]
*  But I should be out of a job because brain surgery, it's cutting the skin, opening the skull. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3258.4s)]
*  It can be barbaric. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3263.4s)]
*  I'm going to go work right in there. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3264.4s)]
*  It looked like a scene from a sci-fi movie. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3266.4s)]
*  Let's make it a little bit more comfortable. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3269.4s)]
*  A halo-wrapped patient pushed into a tube as a team of doctors manipulate his brain from the other side of the glass. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3271.4s)]
*  Gain high, modulate power, three minutes. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3279.4s)]
*  Okay, we're ready to go. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3281.4s)]
*  Dr. Ali Rezai allowed us to try to stop the brain from being affected by Alzheimer's disease. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3282.4s)]
*  Dr. Rezai allowed us to witness his revolutionary attempt to use ultrasound to slow down the cognitive decline [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3287.4s)]
*  in three patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3294.4s)]
*  It's never been done before. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3297.4s)]
*  There's no miracle cure here. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3299.4s)]
*  It's advancing medicine with calculated risks and pushing the frontiers. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3301.4s)]
*  So we're targeting these areas. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3305.4s)]
*  Dr. Rezai and his team are focused on these red patches in the patient's brain scans. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3307.4s)]
*  The red indicates the densest beta amyloid protein. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3312.4s)]
*  That gummy protein is believed to play a major role in Alzheimer's by disrupting communication between brain cells. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3316.4s)]
*  In people with Alzheimer's, it accumulates much faster. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3323.4s)]
*  And over time, these protein aggregates, we call them plaques, like plaques in the arteries. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3328.4s)]
*  They keep on accumulating and impacting function. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3334.4s)]
*  There are two FDA-approved drugs on the market that can help break up that brain plaque. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3338.4s)]
*  Adacanamab was approved in 2021, followed by Licanamab last year. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3344.4s)]
*  Both are given intravenously, but they work slowly. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3350.4s)]
*  Typically, you go into the clinic and you get an IV and you have the antibody infusion over one to two hours. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3355.4s)]
*  And you have to do it once a month or twice a month for 18 months and longer. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3362.4s)]
*  And during those 12 to 18 months, the brain is continuing to progress. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3367.4s)]
*  Alzheimer's is not going away. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3371.4s)]
*  It takes so long because the drugs have a hard time getting through something called the blood-brain barrier. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3373.4s)]
*  This tight filter of cells lined the blood vessels to keep toxins from leaking into the brain, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3379.4s)]
*  but it also prevents almost all of the medication from getting into. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3385.4s)]
*  We think that that's what's causing the baby disruption by opening this here. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3390.4s)]
*  Dr. Rezai thought he could solve that problem with ultrasound, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3393.4s)]
*  the same technology that's been used for 70 years to give doctors a view of organs and fetal development. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3397.4s)]
*  Just sit in there. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3403.4s)]
*  Good. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3404.4s)]
*  You're good. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3405.4s)]
*  Come back. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3406.4s)]
*  He chose ultrasound because it easily penetrates the skull and can be focused, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3407.4s)]
*  like sunlight through a magnifying glass, to help open the blood-brain barrier and allow the drugs to rush in. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3411.4s)]
*  This way we're getting the payload, the therapeutic payload, exactly to the area it needs to go with a high penetration. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3418.4s)]
*  But we've got to be careful because we want to be safe about this. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3425.4s)]
*  You don't want to deliver too much. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3427.4s)]
*  You don't want to open the blood-brain barrier too much. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3429.4s)]
*  Because if you open it too much, what could happen? [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3431.4s)]
*  You can get bleeding in the brain. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3433.4s)]
*  You can get swelling in the brain. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3434.4s)]
*  You can get many other problems. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3436.4s)]
*  So you have to get it just right. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3438.4s)]
*  We will show you exactly how that worked and the early results in a minute. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3440.4s)]
*  But to understand why one of the country's most accomplished brain surgeons is betting on ultrasound... [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3444.4s)]
*  Okay, open and close your hands for me. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3450.4s)]
*  We have to go back to 2002, when Dr. Rezaie first caught our attention in a story Morley Safer reported on treating Parkinson's disease. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3452.4s)]
*  Look up. Show me your teeth. Stick a tongue out. Very good. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3462.4s)]
*  Dr. Rezaie was among the first to implant a pacemaker-type device in the brain, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3466.4s)]
*  which stopped uncontrollable movements suffered by Parkinson's patients. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3471.4s)]
*  It's like traveling through a labyrinth, as in the Greek myth. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3476.4s)]
*  And around every quarter you have that blood-thirsty monster that can jump on you. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3479.4s)]
*  So you want to be careful to avoid these areas. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3483.4s)]
*  That kind of implant surgery is now routine for advanced Parkinson's. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3485.4s)]
*  Dr. Rezaie went on to write hundreds of scientific papers, secure dozens of patents, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3490.4s)]
*  and present his Parkinson's research to Congress and the White House. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3495.4s)]
*  He could have gone to any big city research center, but, true to form, he chose to try something different [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3499.4s)]
*  and moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, where he is the executive director of the Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3505.4s)]
*  It was a fantastic move because we're able to achieve so many things that would have been difficult at other institutions. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3512.4s)]
*  Sometimes in the bigger institutions you may not be hungry as much for it. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3518.4s)]
*  You may have a thousand different agendas and priorities. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3522.4s)]
*  Here we think we have a very nimble and agile team that can quickly get outcomes. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3526.4s)]
*  Like in 2019, this is video Dr. Rezaie's team took when they were among the first to use ultrasound to treat tremors. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3531.4s)]
*  For 15 years, Dan Wall had been suffering from essential tremor, a neurological disorder. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3539.4s)]
*  You okay? You got a hat on now. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3545.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3547.4s)]
*  All right, very good. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3548.4s)]
*  Rezaie's team focused ultrasound into a part of the brain called the thalamus [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3549.4s)]
*  and destroyed a pinpoint-sized patch of tissue doctors believed was responsible for the tremors. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3554.4s)]
*  These are the 980 elements converging right there. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3560.4s)]
*  Wall was awake during the procedure. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3563.4s)]
*  Touch my finger with your finger. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3565.4s)]
*  After two hours, the 71-year-old's tremor was gone. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3567.4s)]
*  I'm feeling afraid I'm on drop. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3571.4s)]
*  You got it. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3573.4s)]
*  I've got it. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3575.4s)]
*  Really good. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3576.4s)]
*  Do you want to show off? [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3577.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3578.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3579.4s)]
*  Right support. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3580.4s)]
*  That success helped convince Dr. Rezaie that focused ultrasound could be adapted to patients with other brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3582.4s)]
*  My first symptoms that I noticed were that I was having trouble typing at work. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3593.4s)]
*  Did you think you had Alzheimer's? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3599.4s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3601.4s)]
*  Dan Miller is just 61 years old. His wife Kathy began noticing changes four years ago. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3603.4s)]
*  He kind of hid it pretty well. And then I noticed he was having trouble, his clothes would be backwards and those kinds of things. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3610.4s)]
*  Just little things. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3619.4s)]
*  Just little things, yes. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3620.4s)]
*  A scan of his brain revealed what Dan had been hiding. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3622.4s)]
*  Mr. Miller had very large amounts of beta amyloid. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3625.4s)]
*  The red spots indicated a buildup of those beta amyloid proteins, the so-called brain plaque, a marker of Alzheimer's. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3629.4s)]
*  Dr. Rezaie explained to Miller he couldn't cure him of the disease, but he hoped to slow its progression. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3637.4s)]
*  Why take part in the trial if it's not a cure? [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3644.4s)]
*  I have to explain to you that I was at the point, you know, like in Dante's Inferno where it says, abandon all hope, you who enter here. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3647.4s)]
*  For me it was just, you know, let's do this, you know. What do I have to lose? [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3657.4s)]
*  And you are infused, sir. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3661.4s)]
*  Here's how it worked. Hours before the procedure, Miller was given an IV treatment of adacanumab, one of those two new drugs to reduce beta amyloid plaque. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3663.4s)]
*  Miller was then fitted with this million-dollar helmet, similar to the one the team used to treat tremor patients. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3675.4s)]
*  It directs nearly a thousand beams of ultrasound energy at a target the size of a pencil point. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3682.4s)]
*  Basically the patient lies on the MRI table and the head goes inside the helmet. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3689.4s)]
*  And the patient is immobilized with a halo or with a mouthpiece because we don't want movements to cause errors in our targeting in the brain. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3695.4s)]
*  Is that comfortable? [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3703.4s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3704.4s)]
*  That pops out? [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3705.4s)]
*  Once inside, the MRI machine gave Dr. Rezaie a 3D view of the plaque he would target in Dan Miller's brain. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3706.4s)]
*  The next step was an IV solution that contained microscopic bubbles. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3713.4s)]
*  When hit with ultrasound energy, the bubbles pry open that blood-brain barrier. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3718.4s)]
*  Okay, ready, we can sonicate now. There we go. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3723.4s)]
*  The bubbles start vibrating. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3728.4s)]
*  They're moving. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3730.4s)]
*  They're moving. They start expanding. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3731.4s)]
*  So you can open the barrier temporarily. Now it's open for 24 to 48 hours and then it reseals. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3735.4s)]
*  So this gives you a tremendous opportunity for 24 to 48 hours with the barrier being open so now therapeutics can get inside the brain. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3742.4s)]
*  You can't hear ultrasound. That noise is a signal to tell Rezaie's team the ultrasound is doing its work. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3752.4s)]
*  Very nice opening of the blood-brain barrier. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3759.4s)]
*  Each dot represents an area where all the waves, all the ultrasound waves converge and open the blood-brain barrier. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3763.4s)]
*  So this is just one blast, if you will? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3770.4s)]
*  One blast getting there. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3772.4s)]
*  And you're hitting one point? [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3773.4s)]
*  One point and then it moves to the next one. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3775.4s)]
*  Even though patients were awake, they told us they didn't feel a thing. It all took a couple of hours and they went home when it was over. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3779.4s)]
*  The three patients were given the treatments of ultrasound with infusion once a month over six months. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3787.4s)]
*  That's another target right there. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3792.4s)]
*  The result? Beta amyloid plaque targeted with ultrasound were reduced 50% more than areas treated by infusion alone. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3794.4s)]
*  That's the top of the head right there. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3803.4s)]
*  Dr. Rezaie shared the three patients' brain scans with us. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3805.4s)]
*  And the red indicates more density of beta amyloid plaques in the brain. So you can see as you treat it. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3808.4s)]
*  Look closely at the areas outlined in white that were targeted with ultrasound and the drug. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3816.4s)]
*  You get reduction right there. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3821.4s)]
*  Whoa, that's after. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3823.4s)]
*  That's after. You can see the plaques are very significantly reduced by opening the blood-brain barrier just in one area. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3824.4s)]
*  Ready? Have your lay back. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3831.4s)]
*  Dan Miller and the third patient in the trial had larger areas of their brain targeted with ultrasound. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3832.4s)]
*  And this is his baseline. And then you can see here after 26 weeks, there's a very dramatic reduction in the beta amyloid in the areas as outlined by this white mark. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3838.4s)]
*  And now we're going to look at patient number three. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3851.4s)]
*  And this patient underwent antibody infusion therapy plus ultrasound. You can see this area, which is really amazing. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3854.4s)]
*  The ultrasound opened the blood-brain barrier and the antibody went in faster and cleaned out the plaques. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3862.4s)]
*  What was your reaction when you saw this scan? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3868.4s)]
*  I mean, my jaw dropped. I'm like, whoa. I was actually even in the clinic seeing patients. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3870.4s)]
*  And the PET scan technician called and said, oh, yeah, there's a big change. I'm like, how do you know? We have to analyze it. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3875.4s)]
*  He's like, no, you can see it on the screen. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3881.4s)]
*  What did you think when Dr. Rezaie shared the scans with you? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3883.4s)]
*  It was surreal. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3890.4s)]
*  You can really see it. You don't have to be a doctor to understand what's going on there. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3892.4s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3895.4s)]
*  Even the red is decreasing. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3897.4s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3899.4s)]
*  Kathy Miller says she can see it in her husband, too, who slips up once in a while, but hasn't slipped further away. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3900.4s)]
*  He has trouble finding things. I'll send him into the kitchen to get something and he's like, it's not there. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3907.4s)]
*  I'm like, yes, it is. I can see it, but he can't see it. But if that's the worst, that's nothing. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3913.4s)]
*  He'll take it. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3921.4s)]
*  I'll take it. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3922.4s)]
*  Do you feel hopeful about the future? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3923.4s)]
*  I do, yes. I learned that what I needed to do is accept that the old Dan is gone and then start working on the new me, which has a future. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3925.4s)]
*  Dr. Rezaie's team told us there's been no change in the ability of the three patients to do their daily activities since the ultrasound treatments ended in July. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3942.4s)]
*  Now that Dr. Rezaie has shown FOGUS ultrasound can clear beta amyloid plaques faster, he has FDA approval to use ultrasound to try and restore brain cell function lost to Alzheimer's. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3951.4s)]
*  What's the result of breaking up all those plaques to the damage that's already been done to the brain? [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3964.4s)]
*  We don't know if it's going to reverse the damage to the brain because Alzheimer's, the underlying cause is still occurring. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3969.4s)]
*  So we have another study that we're looking at with ultrasound. First clear the plaques, then deliver ultrasound in a different dose to see now if we can reverse it or boost the brain more for people with Alzheimer's. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3977.4s)]
*  When we come back, we'll show you Dr. Rezaie's new way to use ultrasound to reset the brain and help people suffering from drug addiction. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=3992.4s)]
*  The human brain contains 100 billion neurons. That's as many cells as there are stars across the Milky Way. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4008.4s)]
*  Dr. Ali Rezaie has spent 25 years exploring this frontier of medicine. The surgical techniques and therapies he pioneered are in use around the world. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4016.4s)]
*  Dr. Rezaie allowed us to see his latest research over the last year at the Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute in Morgantown, West Virginia. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4026.4s)]
*  It includes revolutionary treatments for a brain disease suffered by 24 million Americans, addiction. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4035.4s)]
*  The results so far have been life changing for the people we met once trapped by drugs. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4042.4s)]
*  Looking back, I didn't have a chance. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4049.4s)]
*  What do you mean you didn't have a chance? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4051.4s)]
*  I couldn't do anything without having that drug in my system. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4053.4s)]
*  Jared Buchalter is the son of a coal miner. At 6'3", he was a high school football standout who dreamed of playing wide receiver at Penn State. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4058.4s)]
*  But after a shoulder injury, he got hooked on painkillers. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4067.4s)]
*  The very first time that I took that first pill, I knew that I wanted that feeling for the rest of my life. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4071.4s)]
*  What does it feel like? [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4078.4s)]
*  It's just pure euphoria. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4079.4s)]
*  He took us to where he said he often went to buy drugs, including heroin. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4081.4s)]
*  Everybody in Morgantown knows to come here. Probably 17, 18 years old, just a kid. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4085.4s)]
*  Buchalter still looks like an athlete. It's hard to imagine he was an addict for more than 15 years. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4093.4s)]
*  He told us he does not remember how many times he overdosed and that he couldn't stay clean for more than four days. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4099.4s)]
*  I didn't know where I was going to sleep some nights. My family didn't want me around anymore. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4106.4s)]
*  I did so many things to hurt them that it was just too much for them to deal with. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4112.4s)]
*  Four years ago, a psychologist who'd worked with Buchalter introduced him to Dr. Olly Rezai, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4118.4s)]
*  who was gearing up to perform a new kind of brain surgery to treat severe addiction. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4124.4s)]
*  Our protocol was people that have failed everything. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4130.4s)]
*  Once you've tried everything? [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4133.4s)]
*  Everything. Residential programs, multiple failures, detox multiple times, outpatient, inpatient, multiple overdoses. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4134.4s)]
*  I think he classified it as end-stage drug user. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4143.4s)]
*  I mean end-stage makes you think that this is the end of your life. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4147.4s)]
*  Correct. And here and now at the age of 34, he's a drug addict. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4150.4s)]
*  Dr. Rezai thought he might be able to adapt technology he helped develop years earlier to treat Parkinson's disease to treat people with severe addiction. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4156.4s)]
*  We've been able to map out with neuroscience imaging there's a specific part of the brain that is electrically and chemically malfunctioning that is associated with addiction. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4165.4s)]
*  So it's not just willpower, it's what's happening in the brain. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4176.4s)]
*  It's a brain disease. It's an electrical and chemical abnormality in the brain that occurs over time with recurrent use of drugs. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4179.4s)]
*  And this can be any substance. It's alcohol, it can be opioids, amphetamines, cocaine. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4188.4s)]
*  And they all are involved in the brain. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4194.4s)]
*  And so your idea was what with the implant? [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4197.4s)]
*  Parkinson's, we implant that in the movement part of the brain that is electrically malfunctioning causing shaking. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4200.4s)]
*  In this case, we're going in the behavioral regulation, anxiety and craving parts of the brain. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4206.4s)]
*  Dr. Rezai has seen the impact of addiction on people with severe addiction. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4213.4s)]
*  The problem is so severe in Morgantown, a vending machine dispenses the overdose antidote Narcan for free. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4218.4s)]
*  The National Institute on Drug Abuse agreed to support Dr. Rezai's attempt to fight addiction with a brain implant. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4226.4s)]
*  In 2019, the FDA gave him a green light to attempt to fight addiction. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4234.4s)]
*  That is Jared Buchhalter. He agreed to be the first addiction patient in the U.S. to get the implant. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4239.4s)]
*  Dr. Rezai's team interviewed him the day before the surgery. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4246.4s)]
*  The best outcome possible would be just to cut the cravings out and just get the right treatment. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4250.4s)]
*  And that's what we're doing. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4258.4s)]
*  At that time, I was so desperate for a better life that I was willing to do just about anything and I signed up to do it. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4261.4s)]
*  I think some people might look at this and think, well, I'm going to be a doctor. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4270.4s)]
*  I'm going to be a doctor. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4274.4s)]
*  I'm going to be a doctor. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4276.4s)]
*  I'm going to be a doctor. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4278.4s)]
*  I'm going to be a doctor. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4280.4s)]
*  I'm going to be a doctor. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4282.4s)]
*  I'm going to be a doctor. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4284.4s)]
*  And I signed up to do it. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4286.4s)]
*  I think some people might look at this and think an electronic implant in the brain sounds a little creepy. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4288.4s)]
*  People maybe 50 years ago, they say an implant in the heart sounds creepy. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4295.4s)]
*  Now it's like normal. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4299.4s)]
*  Twenty-five years ago, people were saying, what are you doing? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4301.4s)]
*  You're putting an implant in the brain for Parkinson's? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4304.4s)]
*  But now it is routine, part of standard of care for advanced Parkinson's. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4307.4s)]
*  This is video from the seven-hour procedure. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4312.4s)]
*  Surgery so new, it didn't have a name yet. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4316.599999999999s)]
*  Dr. Rezai opened a nickel-sized hole in Buckhalter's skull. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4319.44s)]
*  Then he directed a thin wire with four electrodes deep inside. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4323.759999999999s)]
*  Jared, are you okay? [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4328.719999999999s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4329.599999999999s)]
*  All right. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4330.28s)]
*  Jared was awake during the surgery. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4331.2s)]
*  Why was that necessary? [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4333.12s)]
*  To map the brain. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4334.92s)]
*  We have tiny microphones the size of a hair we put inside the brain, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4336.16s)]
*  and they're going slowly with micro robots. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4340.4s)]
*  They go at increments of a thousandth of a millimeter. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4342.92s)]
*  Very slow, we drive them into the brain, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4345.5599999999995s)]
*  and we're listening to the neurons talking to each other. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4347.96s)]
*  In addiction, we want to find the area in the reward center, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4350.5599999999995s)]
*  so that confirms where we are in the brain. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4354.32s)]
*  Once we listen and say, okay, that's the right sound, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4357.12s)]
*  then we put the final therapeutic pacemaker. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4360.12s)]
*  What does it sound like? [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4363.0s)]
*  Static electricity, which may be electricity to you, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4364.48s)]
*  but it's music to my ears. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4367.28s)]
*  Music because Dr. Rezai says it's a signal, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4369.44s)]
*  that he found the right spot in the brain for the implant. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4373.28s)]
*  Once in place, the wire was connected to a device [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4377.4s)]
*  placed below the collarbone. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4380.679999999999s)]
*  The electrical pulses it sends to the brain [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4383.16s)]
*  are intended to suppress cravings. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4385.719999999999s)]
*  Buckhalter said it was painless. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4388.48s)]
*  Post-surgery, the system is adjusted remotely [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4390.639999999999s)]
*  with a tablet computer as needed. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4393.679999999999s)]
*  When they turned the unit on, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4396.12s)]
*  it was an immediate change. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4398.32s)]
*  What was the change? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4400.0s)]
*  Just felt better, you know, just felt like I did [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4401.599999999999s)]
*  prior to ever using drugs, but a little bit better. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4406.08s)]
*  And it was at that point that I knew [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4409.639999999999s)]
*  that I was gonna have a legitimate shot at doing well. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4411.8s)]
*  In all, four patients with severe drug addiction [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4418.08s)]
*  had the implant surgery. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4420.719999999999s)]
*  One had a minor relapse. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4422.5199999999995s)]
*  Another dropped out of the trial completely. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4424.4s)]
*  But two have been drug free since their operations, [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4427.16s)]
*  including Jared Buckhalter, who's been clean for four years. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4430.4s)]
*  If you hadn't met Dr. Rezai, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4434.84s)]
*  if you hadn't gone through this implant, [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4436.76s)]
*  do you think you'd be sitting here talking to me today? [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4439.2s)]
*  You may be talking to my parents, you know, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4442.24s)]
*  those that have lost their loved ones to a drug overdose, [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4444.96s)]
*  but you wouldn't be talking to me. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4450.32s)]
*  There's no doubt about that. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4452.08s)]
*  Ah, beautiful, beautiful. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4453.92s)]
*  The surgery was a success, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4456.08s)]
*  but opening someone's skull is always risky. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4458.4s)]
*  Dr. Rezai thought he could reach more patients quickly [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4461.8s)]
*  if he used ultrasound. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4465.36s)]
*  He was already using it to treat other brain disorders [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4467.48s)]
*  and was convinced focused ultrasound [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4470.68s)]
*  could target the same area of the brain as the implant. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4473.16s)]
*  Is this brain surgery without a knife? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4476.96s)]
*  It is, indeed. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4479.2s)]
*  So there's no skin cutting, there's no opening the skull. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4480.44s)]
*  So it is brain surgery without cutting the skin, indeed. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4484.64s)]
*  Now this is just the measuring part, right? [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4487.76s)]
*  Dr. Rezai explained how his team would be the first [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4489.68s)]
*  to treat addicts by aiming hundreds of beams of ultrasound [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4492.4400000000005s)]
*  to a precise point deep inside the brain. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4496.200000000001s)]
*  So the area that we're treating [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4499.72s)]
*  is the reward center in the brain, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4502.04s)]
*  which is the nucleus accumbens, [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4504.6s)]
*  which is right down at the base of this dark area. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4506.08s)]
*  And then we deliver ultrasound waves [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4511.04s)]
*  to that specific part of the brain, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4515.24s)]
*  and we watch how acutely on the table [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4517.56s)]
*  your cravings and your anxiety changes [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4520.68s)]
*  in response to ultrasound. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4523.08s)]
*  How is the ultrasound making a change here? [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4524.44s)]
*  Ultrasound energy is changing the electrical [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4528.12s)]
*  and chemical milieu or activity in this structure [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4531.56s)]
*  in the brain involving addiction and cravings. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4535.28s)]
*  So you're just resetting them [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4538.84s)]
*  and giving them kind of a fresh start? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4539.96s)]
*  At this point, it seems like the brain is being reset [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4542.84s)]
*  or rebooting of the brain, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4545.400000000001s)]
*  and the cravings are less, they're managed, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4547.04s)]
*  anxiety's better. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4550.2s)]
*  So now that allows them to interact with the therapist. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4551.76s)]
*  It's very important to know that this is not a cure, [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4554.56s)]
*  but an augmentation of the therapy [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4558.0s)]
*  by reducing the cravings and anxiety [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4560.2s)]
*  that's so overwhelming that the therapist [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4562.68s)]
*  has difficulty working with the patient. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4565.12s)]
*  Last February, we watched Dr. Azai [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4567.16s)]
*  use focused ultrasound to treat Dave Martin, [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4569.88s)]
*  who told us he's been surrounded by friends and family [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4573.32s)]
*  who use drugs his whole life. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4576.5599999999995s)]
*  When'd you start using drugs? [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4578.88s)]
*  When I was seven years old. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4580.5599999999995s)]
*  Seven? Yes. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4581.72s)]
*  I did drugs for 37 years. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4583.5199999999995s)]
*  What kind of drugs were you using? [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4585.88s)]
*  Anything I can get my hands on. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4588.599999999999s)]
*  Inside the MRI, Martin was shown these images [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4591.5599999999995s)]
*  of drug use to stoke his cravings. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4595.08s)]
*  His legs were moving a lot and he was very agitated. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4597.6s)]
*  A simultaneous brain scan allowed Dr. Azai and his team [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4600.36s)]
*  to immediately spot the area in the nucleus accumbens [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4604.28s)]
*  that was most active. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4608.0s)]
*  I'd like to see the targets one more time. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4609.4s)]
*  90 watts of ultrasound energy were beamed at a target [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4611.04s)]
*  the size of a gumdrop. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4614.88s)]
*  Ready, sonicate. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4616.64s)]
*  Within minutes, we noticed Martin's foot [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4619.48s)]
*  that had been anxiously bouncing was still, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4621.56s)]
*  and he told Azai's team that those same images [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4624.88s)]
*  of drugs he was shown earlier [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4627.4800000000005s)]
*  were now not sparking the need for a fix. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4629.240000000001s)]
*  Heroin is going down. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4631.8s)]
*  Meth is also going down. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4633.88s)]
*  Marijuana's down. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4635.96s)]
*  Marijuana's down? [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4637.240000000001s)]
*  A lot, actually. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4638.080000000001s)]
*  Good. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4639.04s)]
*  Keep on sonicating. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4640.04s)]
*  The day of the procedure, it was the best day of my life. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4642.360000000001s)]
*  I didn't experience the same effect [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4645.64s)]
*  as like the times before. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4649.8s)]
*  You didn't feel like I need that? [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4652.0s)]
*  I want that. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4653.4800000000005s)]
*  I feel like I needed the urge or the desire [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4655.28s)]
*  to use wasn't there anymore. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4658.2s)]
*  So within 15 to 20 minutes of treatment, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4660.36s)]
*  the craving and anxiety melts away. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4663.36s)]
*  And we're seeing this pattern in multiple instances. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4666.16s)]
*  Then they can walk away after this? [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4668.759999999999s)]
*  Get off the table and go home. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4671.16s)]
*  And how long does this entire procedure? [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4674.24s)]
*  One hour. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4676.24s)]
*  One hour. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4677.08s)]
*  One hour. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4677.92s)]
*  Have you been around people still using drugs? [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4678.92s)]
*  Yes, yes, unfortunately I have. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4681.5199999999995s)]
*  It didn't even trigger me. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4683.92s)]
*  I used to use endurine with needles. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4686.8s)]
*  And it was a little while ago, not too far back, [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4689.68s)]
*  but this one individual was trying to hit herself [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4692.92s)]
*  and they couldn't hit. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4698.0s)]
*  And they asked me, can you hit me? [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4698.92s)]
*  Do you actually put drugs in this person? [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4702.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I actually stuck them, drew the blood back. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4704.200000000001s)]
*  Now before when I drew the blood back, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4707.120000000001s)]
*  it would like make me sweat [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4708.88s)]
*  because I couldn't wait to hit myself. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4711.160000000001s)]
*  But this time it was just like, [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4712.92s)]
*  God, I hope they don't OD and I kill them here. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4715.04s)]
*  But I didn't have any urge to desire or anything. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4717.56s)]
*  So. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4721.4800000000005s)]
*  Dr. Rezai's team told us Dave Martin [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4723.16s)]
*  did admit to taking one pain killing pill [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4725.6s)]
*  at a party in December. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4728.6s)]
*  Still 10 of the 15 patients [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4730.4s)]
*  in the ultrasound clinical trials [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4733.04s)]
*  have remained completely drug free. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4735.4s)]
*  Dr. Ollie Rezai is trying the same ultrasound therapy [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4739.08s)]
*  on 45 more addiction patients [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4743.52s)]
*  and is already thinking about expanding [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4745.400000000001s)]
*  the use of ultrasound to help people [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4747.72s)]
*  with other brain disorders. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4749.8s)]
*  I wanna get a vasia. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4751.320000000001s)]
*  Including post-traumatic stress disorder and obesity. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4752.68s)]
*  Let's do it again. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4755.76s)]
*  This is serious business. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4756.68s)]
*  Research never been done before. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4757.96s)]
*  We have to learn more. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4759.72s)]
*  We have to replicate our findings. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4761.08s)]
*  Is there any risk at running towards something quickly? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4763.16s)]
*  There's always risk, but you cannot advance [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4766.92s)]
*  and make discoveries without risk. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4770.48s)]
*  But we need to push forward and take the risk [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4772.679999999999s)]
*  because people with addiction and Alzheimer's [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4774.879999999999s)]
*  is not going away. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4778.919999999999s)]
*  It's here. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4780.16s)]
*  So why wait 10, 20 years? [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4781.04s)]
*  Do it now. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4783.679999999999s)]
*  Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4784.96s)]
*  Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4788.92s)]
*  tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4793.120000000001s)]
*  tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLQz1vMmvk&t=4796.040000000001s)]
