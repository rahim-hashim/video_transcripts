# Stories about Israel and Palestine from the archives | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [November 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao)
*  The Middle East [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=0.0s)]
*  Getting a peace deal in the Middle East is such a priority to President Obama that his [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=13.84s)]
*  first foreign calls on his first day in office were to Arab and Israeli leaders. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=18.84s)]
*  And on day two, the President made former Senator George Mitchell his special envoy [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=23.76s)]
*  for Middle East peace. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=28.16s)]
*  Mr. Obama wants to shore up the ceasefire in Gaza, but a lasting peace really depends [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=30.08s)]
*  on the West Bank, where Palestinians had hoped to create their state. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=35.56s)]
*  The problem is, even before Israel invaded Gaza, a growing number of Israelis and Palestinians [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=39.6s)]
*  had concluded that peace between them was no longer possible, that history had passed [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=45.44s)]
*  it by. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=50.8s)]
*  For peace to have a chance, Israel would have to withdraw from the West Bank, which would [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=51.94s)]
*  then become the Palestinian state. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=56.0s)]
*  It's known as the two-state solution. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=58.56s)]
*  But while negotiations have been going on for 15 years, hundreds of thousands of Jewish [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  settlers have moved in to occupy the West Bank. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=66.52s)]
*  Palestinians say they can't have a state with Israeli settlers all over it, which the settlers [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=70.36s)]
*  say is precisely the idea. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  Daniela Weiss moved from Israel to the West Bank 33 years ago. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  She's been the mayor of a large settlement. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=83.8s)]
*  I think that settlements prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state in the land of Israel. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=86.16s)]
*  This is their goal and this is their reality. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  Though settlers and Palestinians don't agree on anything, most do agree now that a peace [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=99.64s)]
*  deal has been overtaken by events. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  Dr. Mustafa Barghouti is a former candidate for Palestinian president. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=107.16s)]
*  While my heart still wants to believe that the two-state solution is possible, my brain [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=112.68s)]
*  keeps telling me the opposite because of what I see in terms of the building of settlements. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=119.04s)]
*  So in a way these settlers are destroying the potential peace for both people that would [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  have been created if we had two-state solution. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=130.60000000000002s)]
*  Andy told us Israel's invasion of Gaza, all the death and destruction, convinces him that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=135.08s)]
*  Israel does not want a two-state solution. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  I am very worried that what Israel has done has furthered us much further from the possibility [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  of two-state solution. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  Palestinians had hoped to establish their state here on the West Bank, an area the size [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  of Delaware. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=156.76s)]
*  But Israelis have sliced it up with scores of settlements and hundreds of miles of new [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=158.12s)]
*  highways that only settlers can use. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=162.82s)]
*  Palestinians have to drive or ride on the older roads. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=166.42000000000002s)]
*  When they want to travel from one town to another, they have to submit to humiliating [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=169.72s)]
*  delays at checkpoints and roadblocks. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=173.92s)]
*  There are more than 600 of them on the West Bank. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=176.64s)]
*  Why do the Israelis have so many checkpoints? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=179.76s)]
*  I think the main goal is to fragment the West Bank. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=182.28s)]
*  Maybe a little bit of them can be justified because they say it's for security, but I [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=186.02s)]
*  think the vast majority of them are basically to block the movement of people from one place [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=189.76s)]
*  to another. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=195.18s)]
*  Here's how they block Dr. Barghouti. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=196.38s)]
*  He was born in Jerusalem, grew up in Jerusalem, and worked in a hospital there for 14 years. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=198.5s)]
*  Four years ago, he moved to a town just 10 miles away. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=204.5s)]
*  But now because he no longer lives in Jerusalem, he can't get back in, ever. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=208.26000000000002s)]
*  One minute. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=212.94s)]
*  You cannot go to Jerusalem? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=214.62s)]
*  At all. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=216.18s)]
*  Can't you get a permit to go? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=217.3s)]
*  I asked for a permit to go to Jerusalem during the last two years about 16 times. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=218.82s)]
*  And 16 times they were rejected. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=227.14s)]
*  Like most Palestinians, I don't have a permit to go to the city I was born in, to the city [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=229.26s)]
*  I used to work in, to the city where my sister lives. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=234.26s)]
*  Here's what he's up against. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  Scores of Israeli settlements dominating the lowlands like Crusader fortresses. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=239.22s)]
*  Many are little cities, and none of them existed 40 years ago. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=244.76s)]
*  The Israelis always take the high ground. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=249.0s)]
*  Sometimes the hills, sometimes the homes, and sometimes Arabs are occupied inside their [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=251.6s)]
*  own homes. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=257.08s)]
*  This house, for example, the highest house on the highest hill overlooking the town of [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=258.08s)]
*  Nablus. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=262.56s)]
*  We learned that Israeli soldiers often corral the four families who live here and take over [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=263.64s)]
*  the house to monitor movement down below. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=268.76s)]
*  We're going into an apartment owned by Mr. Nasif here in Nablus. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=272.2s)]
*  We understand that Israeli soldiers came in this morning and without any notice, without [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=276.03999999999996s)]
*  any invitation, came into the apartment and have been there ever since. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=280.32s)]
*  We cannot speak with you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=284.48s)]
*  There is a soldier. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=286.44s)]
*  There's soldiers? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=288.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=289.0s)]
*  What are they doing here? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=290.0s)]
*  We are prison here. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=291.0s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=292.0s)]
*  They are keeping here and the soldiers upstairs. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=293.0s)]
*  We cannot move. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=294.0s)]
*  We are in a prison. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=295.0s)]
*  We are in a prison. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=296.0s)]
*  We are in a prison. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=297.0s)]
*  We are in a prison. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=298.0s)]
*  We are in a prison. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=299.0s)]
*  We are in a prison. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=300.0s)]
*  We are in a prison. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=301.0s)]
*  We cannot move. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=302.8s)]
*  We cannot speak with you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=303.8s)]
*  You can't leave the house? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=304.8s)]
*  No. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=305.8s)]
*  They told you that? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=306.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=307.8s)]
*  I can't breathe. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=308.8s)]
*  How long are they going to stay? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=309.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=310.8s)]
*  Are they paying you any money? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=311.8s)]
*  You are kidding. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=312.8s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=313.8s)]
*  Hamdan Nasif, a bank manager, said he had to get to his bank to open the safe, but that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=314.8s)]
*  soldiers won't let him go. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=318.56s)]
*  He told us when the soldiers come, they wake everybody up and herd them into a kitchen [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=320.88s)]
*  for hours while soldiers sleep in their bedrooms. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=325.8s)]
*  They can't leave or use the phone or let us in. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=329.36s)]
*  He sent us downstairs to see if his brother would open the door so we could ask the soldiers [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=333.36s)]
*  why they keep taking over this house. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=339.48s)]
*  You want to come? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=341.96000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  Just open the door and then... [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=343.96000000000004s)]
*  The soldiers closed the door from the keys. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  They take the keys. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=355.96000000000004s)]
*  So we left, and that night so did the soldiers. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=358.6s)]
*  But when we returned two days later, the soldiers were back for more surveillance. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  This time, they kept the women under house arrest, but let the men go to work and the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=366.32000000000005s)]
*  children go to school. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=370.8s)]
*  When the children returned, we caught a glimpse of two armed soldiers at the top of the stairs. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=373.12s)]
*  Then more children came home, but the soldiers wouldn't open the door again. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=380.72s)]
*  They say if you don't go back behind the wall, the children will not enter the house. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=386.24s)]
*  But this is where the children live. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=393.8s)]
*  Yes, but you need to go away from the door so I can let the children come in. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=395.8s)]
*  Who are you? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=401.8s)]
*  He's a commander here. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=404.8s)]
*  He's a commander here? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=405.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=406.8s)]
*  Can we talk to you? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=407.8s)]
*  No. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=408.8s)]
*  Well, we're talking to you now. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=409.8s)]
*  Why don't you tell us what you're doing here? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=410.8s)]
*  You lost your voice. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=415.24s)]
*  Well, they've closed the door now. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=416.24s)]
*  They've closed the window. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=419.64000000000004s)]
*  So I guess if the children are going to get home, we have to leave. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=421.08000000000004s)]

*  The Nassifs told us the soldiers usually stay for a day or two, always coming and going [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=435.52000000000004s)]

*  When they do go, the Nassifs never know when they'll be occupied again. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=442.12s)]
*  It could be tomorrow, next week, or next month. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=446.36s)]
*  The only certainty, they say, is that the soldiers will be back. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=449.4s)]
*  Another crippling reality on the West Bank is high unemployment, now about 20 percent. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=454.56s)]
*  So some Palestinians can only find jobs building Israeli settlements. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=460.12s)]
*  They're so ashamed to work here that they asked us not to show their faces. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=464.92s)]

*  But the two and a half million Arabs have their strategy, too. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=478.36s)]

*  them good. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=495.52s)]
*  They could try ethnic cleansing, drive the Palestinians out of the West Bank. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=496.52s)]
*  They could give the Palestinians a vote. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=501.24s)]
*  That would be the democratic option, but it would mean the end of the Jewish state. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=503.2s)]
*  Or they could inflict apartheid, have the minority Israelis rule the majority Palestinians. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=507.15999999999997s)]
*  But apartheid regimes don't have a very long life. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=513.24s)]

*  Absolutely. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=523.72s)]
*  Apartheid? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=524.9200000000001s)]

*  You cannot unscramble that egg. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=581.8s)]
*  Does this mean that the settlers have won? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=584.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=587.0s)]

*  I don't know forever and ever, but they will remain and will flourish. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=591.28s)]
*  The settlers, the attitude that I present here, this is the heart, this is the pulse, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=596.08s)]
*  this is the past, present and future of the Jewish nation. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=601.76s)]
*  So you're saying basically that you and your fellow settlers are immovable. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=604.8s)]
*  I say that we and the settlers here are immovable. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=611.08s)]
*  We will stay forever. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=616.5600000000001s)]

*  She's Foreign Minister Zippy Livni, a candidate to become prime minister in elections next [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=622.64s)]
*  month. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=627.9200000000001s)]
*  She's also Israel's chief negotiator with the Palestinians. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=628.9200000000001s)]
*  And she told us peace is unthinkable with the settlers where they are. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=632.32s)]
*  Can you really imagine evacuating the tens of thousands of settlers who say they will [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=637.08s)]
*  not leave? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=643.6s)]
*  It's not going to be easy, but this is the only solution. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=644.6s)]
*  But you know that there are settlers who say we will fight, we will not leave, we will [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=647.64s)]
*  fight. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=652.12s)]
*  So this is the responsibility of the government, of the police to stop them. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=653.12s)]
*  As simple as that. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=656.8000000000001s)]
*  Israel is a state of law and order. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=660.08s)]
*  And disorder. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=664.44s)]
*  Here's what happened three years ago when the army evicted just nine families from a [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=665.84s)]
*  West Bank settlement called Ammona. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=670.44s)]
*  It was chaos. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=672.9200000000001s)]
*  The first time since the creation of the state that Jews were in pitched battle against Jews. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=674.2800000000001s)]
*  To Israelis of all stripes, it was not a pretty picture. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=680.2800000000001s)]
*  And it made the government loathe to try again. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=684.12s)]
*  Officials fear that more battles to empty settlements could rip Israel apart. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=687.2800000000001s)]
*  They're afraid that religious officers in the army, and there are an increasing number [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=692.2s)]
*  of them, would disobey any order to evict settlers. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=696.28s)]
*  There will be a mutiny in the army. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=700.4s)]
*  A mutiny in the army. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=702.96s)]
*  I think a mutiny against such an illegal order will make our army only stronger. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=704.32s)]
*  The army is evicting Arabs from their homes in East Jerusalem, which Palestinians hoped [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=712.88s)]
*  to make their capital. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=717.8s)]
*  Outraged, Arabs tried to save their homes, but the Israelis had the guns. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=721.92s)]
*  Israel demolished more than a hundred Arab homes in the past year, ruling they'd been [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=729.8399999999999s)]
*  illegally built. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=733.68s)]
*  Arabs say this is just another tactic to drive them out. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=735.4799999999999s)]
*  But officials say they also knocked down unauthorized Jewish buildings on the West Bank. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=740.8399999999999s)]
*  They're put up by youngsters, the Next Generation's campaign to populate the land. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=745.88s)]
*  Daniela Weiss told us they will not be stopped. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=750.76s)]
*  The army tore this down this morning. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=753.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=755.8000000000001s)]

*  Yes, and we will have the upper hand. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=757.8000000000001s)]
*  But the army will tear it down again. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=759.5600000000001s)]
*  So we will rebuild it. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=761.36s)]
*  The experience shows that the world belongs to those who are stubborn, and we are very [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=764.2s)]
*  stubborn. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=770.36s)]
*  Stubborn, she says, because they were ordered to populate this land by no less an authority [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=771.36s)]
*  than God. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=777.32s)]
*  This is the mission of our generation. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=778.8s)]
*  The most important point is this. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=781.36s)]
*  To hold strong to the soil of the Holy Land. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=788.12s)]
*  Jerusalem is one of the holiest cities on Earth for Jews, for Muslims and for Christians. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=802.4s)]
*  It's also one of the most difficult issues at the negotiating table as Palestinians and [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=808.48s)]
*  Israelis struggle to continue the peace talks. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=813.28s)]
*  The challenge is how to divide the city between the two sides. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=816.6s)]
*  Back in 2000, then President Clinton came up with some parameters for how to do it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=820.6s)]
*  Areas populated mostly by Jews would remain Israeli. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=826.4s)]
*  Those populated mostly by Arabs would become the new Palestinian capital. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=829.8000000000001s)]
*  That meant that for the most part, East Jerusalem would go to the Arabs. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=834.88s)]
*  Well, it's not so simple anymore. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=838.88s)]
*  In the decade that's elapsed, more and more Israeli settlers have moved east into the [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=841.4799999999999s)]
*  Arab-populated areas. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=846.0s)]
*  One place where it's gotten especially complicated and volatile is the Arab neighborhood of Silwan. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=848.4799999999999s)]
*  The complication in Silwan involves an Israeli archaeological dig called the City of David. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=855.52s)]
*  Go to Jerusalem today and you'll likely visit the City of David, one of the world's great [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=862.08s)]
*  archaeological wonders, where diggers are sifting back through time. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=870.28s)]
*  Scores of workers filling hundreds of buckets, unearthing thousands of years. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=875.16s)]
*  This tunnel is 3850 years old. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=880.96s)]
*  And this was the way it was? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=884.88s)]
*  This is exactly original. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=886.24s)]
*  Look at these stones. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=887.84s)]
*  You can even see the chisel marks along the walls. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=888.84s)]

*  nestled in this little cave. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=909.64s)]
*  We were taken down excavated tunnels no human eye has seen for two millennia and shown the [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=911.4799999999999s)]
*  process of removing the layers of history, sandbag by sandbag, from when the city was [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=917.64s)]
*  sacked by the Romans and before them the Babylonians. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=923.16s)]

*  in the Bible, particularly from the time of David, the king who made Jerusalem his capital. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=951.76s)]
*  People believe that when King David captured the city, he snuck underground through this [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=957.96s)]
*  tunnel which led him underneath the city wall up into the city. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=962.4s)]
*  Half a million tourists visit the site every year with guides who try to bring King David [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=966.44s)]
*  to life. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=971.72s)]
*  There's an implicit message that because David conquered the city for the Jews back [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=974.24s)]
*  then, Jerusalem belongs to the Jews today. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=978.8s)]
*  Today I've seen scores and scores of soldiers coming through. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=982.88s)]
*  It's part of their cultural day to try to learn about what they're fighting for. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=987.94s)]
*  And when we bring them here, they understand that they're not just fighting for today. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=991.52s)]
*  They actually represent the return of the Jewish people to Israel after thousands of [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=995.36s)]
*  years. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=998.6800000000001s)]
*  Archaeology is being used as a political tool. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1000.12s)]
*  Maybe I hate to use the word, but indoctrination almost. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1004.0s)]
*  I wouldn't call indoctrination. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1007.0999999999999s)]
*  I would call giving meaning to life, giving meaning to why we're here. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1008.3599999999999s)]
*  But for all the talk of King David, one thing is glaringly missing here at the city of David. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1011.8199999999999s)]
*  There's actually no evidence of David, right? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1018.5999999999999s)]
*  There's no doubt that this is the city of David from the Bible. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1022.0799999999999s)]
*  There's no doubt that the Bible took place here. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1025.2s)]
*  There's no proof of David himself until we find the actual name we can't say. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1028.56s)]
*  Another problem is an inconvenient truth that biblical Jerusalem is not located in the western [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1033.4799999999998s)]
*  half of the city. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1039.56s)]
*  It's right under the densely populated Arab neighborhood of Silwan. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1041.1599999999999s)]
*  And according to the Clinton parameters, Silwan should be part of a Palestinian state. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1045.84s)]
*  To remedy that, organizations that move Jewish settlers into Arab areas have infiltrated [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1051.6399999999999s)]
*  Silwan. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1057.44s)]
*  Under heavy security, a group of settlers live in this seven-story building. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1058.44s)]
*  They barricaded themselves in and refused to leave. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1063.24s)]
*  With some 450 Jews living among tens of thousands of Arabs, Silwan is now at the center of the [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1067.0s)]
*  battle to keep all of Jerusalem under Israeli control. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1073.52s)]
*  So how does the city of David tie into this? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1078.72s)]
*  Well, while a government agency oversees the excavations, the dig and the site are largely [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1081.76s)]
*  funded and run by something called El Ad. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1087.6399999999999s)]
*  Doron Spielman works for El Ad, which claims they're not a settlers organization, though [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1091.28s)]
*  people we spoke to say they are. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1096.72s)]
*  I think that'd be correct to call us an organization who believes deeply in the history of Jerusalem. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1099.72s)]
*  So it's all archaeology? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1105.32s)]
*  Archaeology and rebuilding a Jewish neighborhood. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1107.68s)]
*  So El Ad is doing archaeology and settlements? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1110.26s)]
*  We are doing archaeology and we are buying homes and buying land. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1113.66s)]
*  But is it El Ad's goal to ease the Arabs away from where we are right now? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1117.82s)]
*  Put it this way, if there's a home that an Arab wants to sell and I have the money to [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1124.22s)]
*  buy it and I can move, enable a Jewish family to live there, and I can dig archaeologically [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1128.62s)]
*  underneath it, then I think that's a wonderful thing to do. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1134.54s)]
*  The Arabs say it's a provocative thing to do. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1137.18s)]
*  Devout Jews Yonatan and Dvorah Adler live in one of the houses El Ad bought. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1140.7s)]
*  El Ad has raised tens of millions of dollars, half from the United States, and buys these [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1146.38s)]
*  homes on land the Palestinians claim for a future state. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1152.02s)]
*  The Adlers raise their six kids here on the actual dig. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1156.74s)]
*  The city of David is where Jerusalem began. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1161.66s)]
*  This is where prophets walked, this is where half of the Bible was written. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1165.14s)]
*  And yet when you see those maps it's over on the Palestinian side. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1168.8600000000001s)]
*  Maps are written on paper, this is written on our hearts. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1175.0600000000002s)]
*  But it is one of the proposals on the table. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1177.8600000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you, Jerusalem cannot be divided. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1181.98s)]
*  Jews would never allow it. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1186.18s)]
*  The Adlers say they don't mind living behind gates and having guards on their roof. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1187.5s)]
*  They would never consider leaving. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1192.88s)]
*  But you're like a soldier on the front line. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1195.2s)]
*  I don't think we see ourselves as soldiers at all. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1197.3600000000001s)]
*  We see ourselves very much as regular everyday people living in a very, very special place. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1199.24s)]
*  Palestinian Jawad Siam was born in this very, very special place and says he can trace his [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1207.1200000000001s)]
*  roots here back 930 years. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1212.44s)]
*  He's pessimistic about the Palestinians ever having their own state. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1215.74s)]
*  What will happen to this village if there's a two-state solution? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1220.04s)]
*  I don't think there will be a two-state solution. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1223.52s)]
*  It's not possible to do it. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1226.68s)]
*  Today the settler groups are much stronger than before. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1228.2s)]
*  The settler groups in Jerusalem, they are controlling. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1231.36s)]
*  He's angry that Elad bought his grandmother's house and moved a number of Jewish families [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1234.36s)]
*  in. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1239.14s)]
*  So he's become an activist leader in Silwan where there have been a string of escalating [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1240.22s)]
*  confrontations. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1245.24s)]
*  In this protest at the city of David, Jawad got into a shouting match with a site worker [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1246.6s)]
*  behind a gate. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1251.68s)]
*  And you will be rubbish of the history. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1252.68s)]
*  There is no proof that King David was here. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1254.72s)]
*  You want to take our village. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1257.4s)]
*  Some of the incidents have become violent, like this one just nine days ago. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1258.92s)]
*  Boys were throwing stones at passing cars. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1263.56s)]
*  Watch what happens next as two of the boys get hit by one of the cars. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1266.48s)]
*  The driver was, of all people, the head of Elad. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1272.32s)]
*  He later went to the police and said he hadn't stopped because he felt his life was in danger. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1277.8s)]
*  Both boys survived, one with a broken leg. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1283.56s)]
*  Fighting often erupts here with Israeli guards brought in to protect the settlers. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1287.6s)]
*  Clashes are daily inside Silwan between the villagers and settlers and the gun guards [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1292.52s)]
*  for the security there. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1297.24s)]
*  The government pays for the gun guards? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1298.72s)]
*  It's tax money. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1301.2s)]
*  I pay it. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1302.64s)]
*  Everyone who is paying taxes is paying it. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1303.64s)]
*  You pay taxes and that money goes to pay for the guards to guard the settlers? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1305.72s)]
*  Of course. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1310.6000000000001s)]
*  So you're helping guard the settlers? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1311.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a fan of the settlers, of the gun guards. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1313.16s)]
*  Jawad says that Elad uses the dig's archaeological prestige to hide its aim of moving the locals [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1317.0800000000002s)]
*  out. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1323.52s)]
*  And he believes that the tunneling is a way for Elad to extend its reach deeper into Silwan. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1324.64s)]
*  They think you're digging under their houses. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1330.52s)]
*  It does at points go underneath homes, deep underneath the ground, which is why we have [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1332.72s)]
*  these metal supports around us. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1336.84s)]
*  But it's under Arab homes. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1339.16s)]
*  It's under Jewish homes, Arab homes and a road. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1341.8799999999999s)]
*  What concerns these residents, Leslie, is not the tunnel. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1344.56s)]
*  It's where the tunnel's going. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1347.28s)]
*  It's what the tunnel means that concerns them. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1348.7s)]
*  Well, where's the tunnel going? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1351.08s)]
*  The tunnel one day will open into the Western Wall Plaza. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1352.44s)]
*  And you will have undergone an experience that shows the Jewish temple was important [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1355.36s)]
*  600 years before Muhammad. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1360.12s)]
*  To understand why this is so explosive, you have to understand the geography. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1362.6399999999999s)]
*  Silwan lies in the shadow of some of the holiest sites in the world, Judaism's Western Wall, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1368.08s)]
*  and Islam's Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1374.6s)]
*  There's a feeling of encroachment. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1378.04s)]
*  The Arabs feel it. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1380.9199999999998s)]
*  There's no other place in the world that Jews want to live more than here. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1382.44s)]
*  The Arabs have Mecca, they have Medina, and they may also be interested in Jerusalem, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1385.96s)]
*  but for the Jews, this is our only home. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1390.5600000000002s)]
*  That feeling of Jewish encroachment has been heightened by the mayor of Jerusalem, Mir [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1392.88s)]
*  Bar-Kat, who is doing all he can to make sure East Jerusalem remains under Israeli sovereignty. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1397.5400000000002s)]
*  We have to maintain a united Jerusalem. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1404.44s)]
*  The mayor brought us to a hilltop over Silwan to show us his latest project called King's [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1407.76s)]
*  Garden. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1413.24s)]
*  This is the most important area in the world. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1414.24s)]
*  In the whole world? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1416.36s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1417.92s)]
*  And in the valley right there below us is where King's Garden was. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1419.2s)]
*  He wants to create a Bible-themed garden and turn it into a tourist park adjacent to the [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1422.84s)]
*  city of David. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1428.24s)]
*  But as with the dig, the local Arabs see this as another attempt to gobble up their side [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1429.6s)]
*  of Jerusalem. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1435.04s)]
*  Building the mayor's park requires demolishing 22 Arab homes in Silwan. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1436.68s)]

*  That's why you have to be very smart and sensitive dealing with an area so important in the city [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1446.3600000000001s)]

*  that. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1459.8s)]
*  But the locals want to stay in their homes. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1460.8s)]
*  I heard you wanted to evict people. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1463.2s)]
*  Where are those houses? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1466.1999999999998s)]
*  That's just not true. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1467.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, wait, if you make a park, then those houses can't be there anymore. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1468.1999999999998s)]
*  They mustn't have been there in the first place. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1472.6s)]
*  So you will evict. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1474.1999999999998s)]
*  You will evict. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1475.72s)]
*  Not evict. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1476.72s)]

*  improvement of quality of life. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1481.6s)]
*  His park, he says, will upgrade the area, and he'll allow the people who'll be evicted [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1483.5s)]

*  The locals tell us the only way to do that would be to build on top of other homes in [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1491.68s)]

*  Public opinion, especially while the peace talks are underway, is looking at this and [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1504.5600000000002s)]
*  saying you're trying to move Arabs out of Jerusalem. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1509.5600000000002s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1513.24s)]
*  But that's the way it looks. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1514.74s)]
*  Well, the facts are. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1516.0800000000002s)]
*  And my question is, why not wait till the peace talks are settled? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1517.0800000000002s)]
*  Leslie, the facts are wrong. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1520.32s)]
*  Those structures are illegal. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1522.2s)]
*  They're sitting in an area that the world, the world wants to be part of a city that [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1524.08s)]
*  is flourishing, that is clean, that is beautiful. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1531.48s)]
*  So what I'm saying here is get your facts right before you bash Israel, before you bash [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1534.88s)]
*  Jerusalem. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1540.48s)]
*  But my question is why now? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1541.48s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1543.84s)]
*  What do you mean why now? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1544.84s)]
*  Because it's on the table at the peace talks. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1545.84s)]
*  Leslie, listen, I'm committed to bring more tourism to the city of Jerusalem. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1548.3200000000002s)]
*  Now this plan is a plan that I started a year and a half ago. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1552.2s)]
*  You say that Jerusalem must never be divided. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1557.1200000000001s)]
*  But most of the rest of the world says that if you want peace, that may be the price that [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1560.76s)]
*  you have to pay. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1565.8000000000002s)]
*  Leslie, it's not going to work. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1566.8000000000002s)]
*  You have to understand that for a city to be functional, to increase tourism, to be [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1569.3200000000002s)]
*  able to see the sights that you've seen, it has to be a United City. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1575.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, in the city of David, the excavations are continuing in full force. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1578.96s)]
*  You can say they're digging in. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1585.44s)]
*  Settlements have been a stumbling block in peace negotiations of the past. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1590.04s)]
*  And what your organization is dedicated to doing could become the stumbling block again. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1595.56s)]
*  We are looking, Leslie, to go down and uncover history. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1602.32s)]
*  If coming back to my home after 3,000 years is a stumbling block to peace, then I think [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1605.76s)]
*  that that is not a very good peace. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1611.76s)]
*  Christianity may have been born in the Middle East, but Arab Christians have never had [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1626.1599999999999s)]
*  it easy there, especially not today. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1631.0s)]
*  In Iraq and Egypt, scores of churches have been attacked, hundreds murdered. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1633.92s)]
*  In Syria, revolution seriously threatens Christian communities. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1638.52s)]
*  The one place where Christians are not suffering from violence is the Holy Land. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1643.64s)]
*  But Palestinian Christians have been leaving in large numbers for years, so many. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1648.92s)]
*  The Christian population there is down to less than 2 percent. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1654.4s)]
*  And the prospect of holy sites, like Jerusalem and Bethlehem, without local Christians, is [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1658.52s)]
*  looming as a real possibility. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1664.36s)]
*  This is what the Holy Land looks like today. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1667.6s)]
*  Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1669.8799999999999s)]
*  Nazareth, where he grew up. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1672.28s)]
*  Jerusalem, where he died and where Christians believe he was resurrected. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1674.44s)]
*  Nazareth is inside the State of Israel. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1679.12s)]
*  Bethlehem is on the Israeli occupied West Bank. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1681.96s)]
*  The Christian section of Jerusalem is also under Israeli control. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1685.16s)]
*  We know the area well. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1690.48s)]

*  to half of humanity. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1698.26s)]
*  Still, when we decided to do the story last year, we did not realize it would become so [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1700.0400000000002s)]
*  controversial. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1706.0s)]
*  Our story begins in Bethlehem, where it all began. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1707.76s)]
*  We went to St. Catherine's in the Church of the Nativity. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1716.52s)]
*  For local Catholics, this is their parish church. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1721.2s)]
*  The day we went, a confirmation was underway. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1726.48s)]
*  Father Marwan Ditas of Franciscan led one child after another up to the altar, watched [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1731.04s)]
*  by proud parents. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1737.36s)]
*  The church was so crowded, it was difficult to believe that Christians now make up only [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1739.1599999999999s)]
*  18 percent of what was for centuries an overwhelmingly Christian town. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1744.36s)]
*  We are the living stones of the Holy Land. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1750.6s)]
*  From here it all started and it had to continue. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1752.9199999999998s)]
*  It's a must. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1755.7199999999998s)]
*  It must continue. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1756.7199999999998s)]
*  If there is no people, no Christians here, it will never continue. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1757.7199999999998s)]
*  Here in Jerusalem, the numbers are even bleaker than in Bethlehem. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1762.4799999999998s)]
*  Theophilus III, the patriarch of the Greek Orthodox, has lived through the decline. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1766.72s)]
*  His church, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, is the most sacred site in Christendom. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1773.96s)]
*  He took us up to the roof. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1779.4s)]
*  You've got to know a patriarch to get here. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1781.24s)]
*  Coming. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1783.72s)]
*  So you are in the Holy Sepulcher, inside the Holy Sepulcher. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1784.72s)]
*  Just inside here is the tomb. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1787.72s)]
*  That is, the tomb which covers the site of the resurrection. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1789.6000000000001s)]
*  When you first came here in 1964, what was the percentage of Christians in the Old City? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1794.18s)]
*  There were around 30,000 Christians living in the Old City. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1800.38s)]
*  And now how many are there? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1805.22s)]
*  Very few. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1807.18s)]
*  So few, some 11,000 Christians out of a population of almost 800,000, just one and a half percent. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1808.42s)]
*  As leaders are afraid, Jerusalem could become a museum, a spiritual theme park, a great [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1820.9s)]
*  place for tourists and pilgrims, but not for the Arab Christians whose roots date back [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1826.8200000000002s)]
*  to the church's very beginnings. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1832.7s)]
*  Christianity started here. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1836.02s)]
*  The only thing that Palestine was able to export so successfully was Christianity. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1839.1000000000001s)]

*  more and more like a piece of Swiss cheese, where Israel gets the cheese, that is the [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1881.62s)]

*  Members of your family have already left. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1977.5800000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1979.74s)]
*  And they have asked you to leave too. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1980.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1983.94s)]
*  What do you say to them? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1985.26s)]
*  I tell them, we have to stay. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1986.26s)]
*  We need to stay and struggle and fight. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1989.02s)]
*  This is our cross. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1991.18s)]
*  For all Palestinians, just leaving Bethlehem is a struggle. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1993.18s)]
*  Getting to Jerusalem only seven miles away, whether it's to pray, go to a doctor, visit [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=1997.18s)]
*  family members or work, means going through this Israeli checkpoint. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2002.62s)]
*  That can take hours. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2007.22s)]
*  But before Palestinians can get even this far, they need a permit from the Israelis, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2008.66s)]
*  which can take weeks or months to obtain and is frequently denied. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2013.74s)]
*  We regret any inconvenience caused by the security precautions, but it's their inconvenience, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2018.7s)]
*  it's our survival. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2025.26s)]
*  Michael Oren, who used to be Israel's director of inter-religious affairs, is Israel's ambassador [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2026.82s)]
*  to the United States. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2032.66s)]
*  We have to protect our country, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do in order [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2034.7s)]
*  to survive. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2039.46s)]
*  For Palestinian Christians, the survival of their culture is in danger. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2041.42s)]
*  In towns like Bethlehem, which used to be distinctively Christian, Muslims now are a [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2047.86s)]
*  clear and growing majority. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2052.58s)]
*  The veil is replacing the cross. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2054.82s)]
*  But inside Israel, in Christian towns like Nazareth, Arabs are Israeli citizens, and [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2058.38s)]
*  according to Ambassador Oren, they're thriving. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2064.38s)]
*  The reason Christians are leaving the West Bank, he says, is Islamic extremism. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2067.74s)]
*  I think that the major problem in the West Bank, as in elsewhere in the Middle East, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2073.54s)]
*  is that the Christian communities are living under duress. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2077.7799999999997s)]
*  And this duress is coming from Muslims, not from the Israeli occupation. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2080.8599999999997s)]
*  I believe that the major duress is coming from that. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2084.74s)]
*  Great selling point. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2087.7799999999997s)]
*  Easy to sell to the American public. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2090.7s)]
*  Zahi Hurri is a Palestinian businessman. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2093.62s)]
*  He owns the West Bank Coca-Cola franchise. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2097.06s)]
*  I'll tell you, I don't know of anybody, and I probably have 12,000 customers here. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2100.38s)]
*  I've never heard that someone is leaving because of Islamic persecution. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2108.82s)]
*  Harry Shavit, one of Israel's most respected colonists, believes Christians have become [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2113.7400000000002s)]
*  collateral damage. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2118.86s)]
*  I think this is a land that has seen in the last century a terrible struggle between [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2120.7000000000003s)]
*  political Judaism and political Islam in different variations. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2130.18s)]
*  And the Christians are being squeezed in the middle between the Jews and the Muslims. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2136.54s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2140.54s)]
*  Should Israel be concerned about that? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2141.54s)]
*  I think we should all be concerned about it. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2143.46s)]
*  Political Judaism and political Islam are rocky. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2146.02s)]
*  They are harsh. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2149.7799999999997s)]
*  And the friction, the clash between them is very violent. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2152.42s)]
*  In 2009, this group of Christian activists did something unprecedented. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2157.58s)]
*  They published a document called Kairos criticizing Islamic extremism and advocating nonviolent [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2163.1s)]
*  resistance to the Israeli occupation, which they called a sin against God. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2170.14s)]
*  It was endorsed by the leaders of 13 Christian denominations, including Greek Orthodox, Roman [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2176.2599999999998s)]
*  Catholic, Lutheran, and Anglican. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2182.42s)]
*  These are denominations who have been exceedingly critical of the state of Israel and sometimes [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2186.54s)]
*  to the point of going beyond legitimate criticism. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2190.46s)]
*  So what does that mean to go beyond legitimate criticism? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2192.82s)]
*  Accusing us of crimes that would be very, I think, historically associated with anti-Semitism. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2196.06s)]
*  And it was actually so inflammatory, Bob, that many of us didn't even bother responding [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2205.06s)]
*  to it. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2210.42s)]
*  They are fearful of this document because they are afraid this might influence the Christian [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2211.42s)]
*  world. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2217.1800000000003s)]
*  Reverend Rahim, who helped write the document, says it's anything but anti-Semitic. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2218.1800000000003s)]
*  This document doesn't ask for violence. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2224.46s)]
*  It doesn't ask for revenge. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2228.5s)]
*  The most powerful thing in this document, actually, is that asking for hope and love [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2231.86s)]
*  and faith. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2237.66s)]
*  Do you think the Israeli government ever thinks of the fact that if Christians aren't being [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2238.8599999999997s)]
*  treated well here and America is an overwhelmingly Christian country, that this could have consequences? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2243.54s)]
*  Israel is not persecuting Christians as Christians. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2251.7799999999997s)]
*  The Christians in the Holy Land suffer from Israeli policies that are a result of the [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2256.42s)]
*  overall tragic situation. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2263.8199999999997s)]
*  And this, of course, has consequences for everybody. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2265.8199999999997s)]
*  For Israel, there could be serious economic consequences. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2270.14s)]
*  According to Israeli government figures, tourism is a multi-billion dollar business there. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2273.9799999999996s)]
*  Most tourists are Christian. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2280.02s)]
*  Many of them are American. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2281.62s)]
*  That's one reason why Israelis are very sensitive about their image in the United States. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2283.74s)]
*  And that could be why Ambassador Orin phoned Jeff Fager, the head of CBS News and executive [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2288.74s)]
*  producer of 60 Minutes, while we were still reporting the story, long before tonight's [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2294.6s)]
*  broadcast. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2300.04s)]
*  He said he had information our story was, quote, a hatchet job. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2301.3199999999997s)]
*  It seemed to me outrageous, completely incomprehensible that at a time when these communities, Christian [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2306.52s)]
*  communities throughout the Middle East, are being oppressed and massacred, when churches [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2317.12s)]
*  are being burnt. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2322.2799999999997s)]
*  And one of the great stories in history is unfolding. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2324.0s)]
*  I think it's, I think it's, I think it got me a little bit mystified. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2326.92s)]
*  And who is the reason to call the president of, chairman of CBS News? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2331.0800000000004s)]
*  Well, I'm the ambassador of the state of Israel. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2336.4s)]
*  I do that very, very infrequently as ambassador. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2339.52s)]
*  That's an extraordinary move for me to complain about something. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2342.6800000000003s)]
*  When I heard that you were going to do a story about Christians in the Holy Land and Maya [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2345.0s)]
*  and had, I believe, information about the nature of it, and it's been confirmed by [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2353.68s)]
*  this interview today. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2360.12s)]
*  Nothing has been confirmed by the interview, Mr. Ambassador, because you don't know what's [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2361.12s)]
*  going to be put on air. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2365.3599999999997s)]
*  Okay, I don't, true. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2366.56s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, I've been doing this a long time, and I've received lots of reactions [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2368.08s)]
*  from just about everyone I've done stories about, but I've never gotten a reaction before [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2373.8999999999996s)]
*  from a story that hasn't been broadcast yet. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2380.24s)]
*  Well, it was the first time for everything, Bob. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2383.56s)]
*  This land has seen just about everything over the centuries. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2389.3599999999997s)]
*  The ritual in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, the day before Easter, hasn't changed in more [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2393.2799999999997s)]
*  than a millennium. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2398.3599999999997s)]
*  We went into the church with Patriarch Theophilus and watched thousands jostling to get as close [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2401.08s)]
*  as they could to the tomb from which they believe Christ was risen. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2406.7999999999997s)]
*  Pilgrims have been coming here since 1106 A.D. to wash themselves in the holy fire to celebrate [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2413.88s)]
*  the founding miracle of Christianity. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2422.24s)]
*  They'll certainly continue to do so, but how many will be coming from the neighborhood? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2425.16s)]
*  That's not a religious question anymore. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2430.24s)]
*  It's political. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2432.72s)]
*  We went looking for a place of calm in the Middle East, a place not wracked by violence, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2443.12s)]
*  anxiety, torment. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2452.7999999999997s)]
*  Not an easy mission these days, but we found one in the unlikeliest of spots, Israel's [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2454.8399999999997s)]
*  largest city, Tel Aviv, bordered on all sides by danger. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2460.56s)]
*  Tel Aviv has been through rough times over the decades, bloodshed, bombings, Scud missile [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2465.72s)]
*  attacks. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2471.44s)]
*  And today the situation looks dicier than ever. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2472.6s)]
*  Revolutions, civil wars, Islamic extremists are just a few hours' drive away in every [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2475.4s)]
*  direction. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2481.16s)]
*  And if Iran ever builds that bomb, Tel Aviv will be well within range. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2482.2799999999997s)]
*  So anything could happen any time. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2487.4s)]
*  But somehow, Tel Avivians have learned how not to worry about tomorrow. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2489.92s)]
*  For them, the only time is now. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2494.92s)]
*  And the best place to spend now, 12 months a year, is the beach. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2499.56s)]
*  You would be forgiven for thinking this is Miami on the Med, thousands of miles from [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2505.88s)]

*  The island of sanity in this country. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2517.36s)]
*  In this country. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2518.36s)]
*  And in the Middle East. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2520.24s)]
*  Yeah, but the island is very big. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2521.24s)]
*  Ron Huldai, who fought as a fighter pilot in three wars, has been mayor of Tel Aviv [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2522.24s)]

*  in Tel Aviv. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2538.56s)]
*  You look that way, there are thousands of missiles from Hezbollah pointing in Tel Aviv. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2539.76s)]
*  How do you deal with that? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2544.96s)]
*  This is our life. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2547.5s)]
*  What else we can do? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2548.5s)]
*  When you go out of your home in New York, you have the chance to get a car accident. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2550.68s)]

*  pointing at you. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2559.44s)]
*  But in life there are a lot of risks. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2561.96s)]
*  Always. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2564.68s)]
*  Always. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2565.68s)]
*  Iran today, Iraq yesterday. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2566.68s)]
*  During the first Gulf War, Saddam Hussein rained scuds on the city. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2572.08s)]
*  Soon after that, the streets of Tel Aviv became killing zones as Palestinian suicide bombers [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2577.44s)]
*  blew up buses and cars and clubs. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2583.52s)]
*  But the bombings didn't stop Tel Avivians from going to the beach by day and the bars [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2586.7599999999998s)]
*  by night. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2591.92s)]
*  Eric Kneller lived through it all. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2593.08s)]
*  Do you ever feel like you're dancing on the Titanic? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2595.68s)]
*  Sometimes. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2598.8s)]
*  Maybe part of the reasons people dance on the tables is because they really believe [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2599.8s)]
*  that tomorrow Tel Aviv is going to be attacked. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2604.0s)]
*  And they really do live as if it's the last day of Pompeii. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2606.56s)]
*  And they want to grab every second of it. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2610.9199999999996s)]
*  And many do. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2614.8799999999997s)]
*  There are more bars than synagogues in this city of the Jews. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2615.8799999999997s)]
*  And remember, Tel Aviv is not that far from where Moses came down the hill with those [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2622.2799999999997s)]
*  commandments. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2628.04s)]
*  Tel Aviv wasn't always a latter-day Saddam. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2629.04s)]
*  Twenty years ago, Tel Avivians were in the vanguard of the peace movement, cheering Israeli [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2634.2799999999997s)]

*  at the White House. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2645.48s)]
*  Negotiations began but then stalled. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2646.92s)]
*  So the activists went home and retreated into apathy. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2650.04s)]
*  Years ago, people in Tel Aviv were passionately political. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2654.56s)]
*  They're not anymore. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2659.4s)]
*  What happened? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2660.7200000000003s)]
*  They're tired. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2661.7200000000003s)]
*  Part of it is that they're tired. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2662.7200000000003s)]
*  People have said to me that they've become numb. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2664.52s)]
*  There's a feeling of stagnation in that sense. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2667.56s)]
*  There's a feeling that there's not really hope. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2670.44s)]
*  There's no political debate in Israel. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2673.96s)]
*  There's no debate almost about anything. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2677.4s)]
*  Gideon Levy is a columnist with one of Israel's leading newspapers. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2680.08s)]
*  It's all about the next vacation, the next Jeep, the next restaurant. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2684.52s)]
*  And the good life in Tel Aviv enables you to ignore the real questions. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2691.56s)]
*  Is it bad taste to bring up politics at a dinner party? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2697.04s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2700.12s)]
*  Why to spoil the party? [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2701.12s)]
*  Why to spoil the party? [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2703.36s)]
*  This ongoing party with politics, who needs it when life is so beautiful, when life is [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2705.32s)]
*  so short, when women are so pretty and food is so tasty? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2711.08s)]
*  And when the economy is booming, the recession passed Tel Aviv by. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2716.2s)]
*  There's low unemployment. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2720.96s)]
*  Everyone can afford the basics. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2727.4s)]
*  But there are wide income gaps in what used to be a fairly egalitarian society. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2729.16s)]
*  Property prices have soared more than 70% in the last three years. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2734.76s)]
*  Rentals are so high, it's said a starving artist doesn't even have a place to starve. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2739.92s)]
*  But for the elite, and there are more of them every year, life can be glorious. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2750.32s)]
*  Wealth is rampant and Yossi Vardi has it. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2755.56s)]
*  He owes it, he says, to making a modest investment in an idea proposed by his young son. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2759.1200000000003s)]
*  They called it instant messaging. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2765.2000000000003s)]
*  That was the foundation, wasn't it? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2768.1600000000003s)]
*  It was early, it was pioneering, it was successful. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2771.32s)]
*  Then after 18 months, AOL came and bought the whole company. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2774.6400000000003s)]
*  How much? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2777.6800000000003s)]
*  According to the press, $407 million in 1996. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2778.7999999999997s)]
*  Vardi is now called the godfather of what has become a vast software empire. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2783.2s)]
*  Tel Aviv, this start-up city, has more high-tech start-up companies than anywhere outside Silicon [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2788.2s)]
*  Valley. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2795.0s)]
*  It is so far ahead of the curve, you can barely see the end of it. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2796.2s)]
*  Why does Israel have so many start-ups? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2800.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, some people say it's because of the military. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2804.08s)]
*  Some people say it's because of the universities, the level of education. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2808.7200000000003s)]
*  Some people say it's because of the level of technology. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2812.52s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2816.52s)]
*  I say it's a cultural phenomena and the secret source behind it is the Jewish mother. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2817.52s)]
*  Every start-up kid here has a Jewish mother which drives them crazy, which will push them [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2825.36s)]
*  and challenge them and inspire them. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2833.16s)]
*  And inspire young people from all over Israel and the world to flock here for the good life. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2839.56s)]
*  Lonely Planet, that hip travel magazine, has voted Tel Aviv the third hottest city in the [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2846.16s)]
*  world, complete with cops patrolling on roller skates and city officials giving interviews [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2851.7999999999997s)]
*  in places where American politicians wouldn't dare to be seen. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2858.12s)]
*  Outside a trendy bar, we ran across Tel Aviv's deputy mayor, Asaf Zameer. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2863.76s)]
*  What are you drinking? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2868.76s)]
*  This is vodka soda because I'm on a diet. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2869.76s)]
*  And there aren't any people who would be watching you on television and saying, what the hell [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2871.76s)]
*  is our deputy mayor doing drinking outside a bar at two in the morning? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2875.76s)]
*  This is what I'm supposed to be doing. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2880.36s)]
*  I've done this, I've been doing this before. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2882.16s)]
*  This is my way of life and most of the young people in Tel Aviv, we go out every evening. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2884.36s)]
*  The people that vote for me will find it fine. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2891.76s)]
*  Tel Avivians love to think of themselves as avant-garde. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2895.76s)]
*  The art scene is vibrant. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2898.76s)]
*  New openings every week. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2901.76s)]
*  Fashion is cutting edge. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2904.76s)]
*  Along with music and dance and theater. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2908.76s)]
*  And compared to the rest of Israel, Tel Aviv is not only more cosmopolitan, but more tolerant. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2911.76s)]
*  People seem to get along. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2918.1600000000003s)]
*  Religious and secular, soldiers and civilians, straights and gays. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2920.1600000000003s)]
*  In a poll published this year, the city was voted the best gay destination in the world. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2927.1600000000003s)]
*  Those old closet makers are going out of business. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2933.1600000000003s)]

*  What's the problem? [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2947.56s)]
*  Here it's not don't ask, don't tell, it's don't ask, who cares? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2950.56s)]
*  Who cares? Exactly. Don't ask, ask, tell me. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2954.56s)]
*  I don't care. Grab a gun, go fight. I don't care. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2956.56s)]
*  All Israelis, men and women, are drafted into the army when they're 18. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2960.56s)]
*  Galushchovsky did his three-year service in the late 70s. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2965.56s)]
*  Today he's a gay activist and a columnist for one of Tel Aviv's hippest magazines. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2968.56s)]
*  In many parts of the world, parents, definitely including Jewish parents, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2973.96s)]
*  are not happy when their kid turns out to be gay. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2978.96s)]
*  Is it the same here? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2981.96s)]
*  No, here it's a little different because, you know, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2982.96s)]
*  Israel is a war zone, it's been a war zone for many years. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2984.96s)]
*  It's very hard to raise a child here. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2988.96s)]
*  They can die in the army, they can die in a suicide bombing. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2990.96s)]
*  So the whole feeling of an Israeli parent is that it's a big war to keep your kid alive till 21. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=2994.96s)]
*  So if 22, or any age, he comes and says, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=3003.36s)]
*  okay, I'm gay, you know, this is, it's not as bad. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=3006.36s)]
*  And that chronic war continues. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=3010.36s)]
*  The very week we were there in the bubble of safety that is Tel Aviv, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=3013.36s)]

*  This is their dark backyard to which they will never go, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=3041.36s)]
*  to which they have no interest, about which they know so little. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=3046.36s)]
*  And Tel Avivians don't really care? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBswCrpLSao&t=3051.36s)]
