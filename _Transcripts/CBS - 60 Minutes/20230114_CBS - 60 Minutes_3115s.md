*  of growing up in Louisville, Kentucky. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=54.86s)]
*  How did you get from Kentucky to the top of Hollywood? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=58.62s)]
*  Desperation. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=63.3s)]

*  You really wanted this. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=77.86s)]
*  I knew if I just was given the chance that it would work. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=80.06s)]
*  I just knew. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=84.06s)]

*  You are not a stand-up guy right now. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=121.82000000000001s)]
*  If it's me reading the signs, if it's me reading the signs. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=124.30000000000001s)]
*  You're reading the signs? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=127.10000000000001s)]
*  You're reading the signs? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=128.1s)]

*  Don't you dare forget that part. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=138.98000000000002s)]
*  We fell madly in love. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=140.3s)]
*  And in Joy, she was a desperate mother turned entrepreneur. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=143.85999999999999s)]
*  It's the only mop that you're ever going to buy, the best mop you're ever going to use. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=147.14s)]
*  She earned Academy Award nominations for all three movies. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=151.14s)]
*  I'm just the crazy slut with a dead husband. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=155.01999999999998s)]
*  And took home the Best Actress Oscar for Silver Linings' playbook. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=159.5s)]
*  Hey, Tiffany. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=163.22s)]
*  But Jennifer Lawrence is not one to rest on her laurels. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=164.82s)]
*  I am hard on myself. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=168.78s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=172.17999999999998s)]
*  I get paid a huge amount of money to be able to do what I love. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=173.66s)]
*  So you're the one putting this pressure on you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=179.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=181.62s)]
*  Too many people sacrificed so that I could be here. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=182.62s)]
*  My parents, you know, changed their entire lives to support me. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=185.22s)]
*  And I worked too hard to get here to be stupid about it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=189.98000000000002s)]
*  Lawrence's father owned a construction company. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=194.54000000000002s)]
*  Her mother ran a summer camp. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=196.62s)]
*  She told us her two older brothers pretty much ignored their annoying little sister. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=198.48s)]
*  Did you used to play act when you were growing up? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=203.64s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=207.12s)]
*  I was constantly performing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=208.12s)]
*  We just didn't know that that meant I was an actor. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=210.64s)]
*  I just thought, you know, I was a weirdo. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=212.56s)]
*  But I understand that you pretended to have a problem with your leg at school. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=214.48s)]
*  Who told you that? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  Oh, we've got our sources. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  In school, I told everybody I had a wooden leg. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=222.32s)]
*  And I like walked in a very consistent lap, like incredibly consistent. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  And when my mom came to get me from school, my teachers were like, it's awful. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  What happened to Jennifer's leg? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=234.88s)]
*  And my mom's like, she does not, she's, her leg has not been amputated. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=236.88s)]
*  I used to just invent stories just to invent them. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=244.48s)]
*  She used zany antics to hide the fact she was a poor student, hyperactive, didn't fit [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=248.76s)]
*  in. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=254.88s)]
*  She could drive her parents crazy. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=255.88s)]
*  My parents were just, you know, they would go through periods of time where they just [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=257.64s)]
*  wanted me out of the house. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  And it was called a lockout. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=263.64s)]
*  And so I'd go to the door and it was locked. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=265.6s)]
*  And I'd be like, all right, I got to find something else to do until my parents are [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=267.64s)]
*  ready to deal with me again. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=271.04s)]
*  You were a handful. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=272.36s)]
*  I was a handful. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=273.36s)]
*  And I got it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=274.36s)]
*  We never fought about it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  I've always been very self-aware about my annoyingness. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=278.88s)]
*  She told us she felt lost in school and dreamed of becoming an actor. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=283.64s)]
*  At 14, she badgered her parents to visit New York, where, improbably, she was discovered [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=288.2s)]
*  by a modeling scout, then given some scripts to read. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=294.4s)]
*  I struggled through school. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  I never felt very smart. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=300.28s)]
*  And when I'm reading the script and I feel like I know exactly what it would look like [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=302.44s)]
*  if somebody felt that way, that was a whole part of my brain that I didn't even know existed, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  something that I could be confident in. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  And I didn't want to let it go. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  What was it you wanted so much? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=319.28s)]
*  It's so hard to explain. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  It was just an overwhelming feeling of, I get this. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=324.55999999999995s)]
*  This is what I was meant to do. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=327.96s)]
*  And to get people to try to understand that when you're 14 years old, wanting to drop [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=329.47999999999996s)]
*  out of school and do this and your parents are just like, you're out of your mind. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=333.76s)]
*  Did you finish up high school? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=337.4s)]
*  I dropped out of middle school. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=341.0s)]
*  I don't technically have a GED or a diploma. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  I am self-educated. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=350.32s)]
*  Do you regret that? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  No, I really don't. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=355.12s)]
*  I wanted to forge my own path. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=357.65999999999997s)]
*  I found what I wanted to do and I don't want anything getting in the way of it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=359.12s)]
*  And even friends, for many years, were not as important to me as my career, I mean, from [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=362.91999999999996s)]
*  the age of 14. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  That stubborn determination landed her a role in a sitcom. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=369.56s)]
*  When her parents saw her happy and focused for the first time, they agreed to accompany [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=373.20000000000005s)]
*  her to Hollywood. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=378.56s)]
*  She never went back to school. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=380.0s)]
*  Spell house. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=382.28000000000003s)]
*  At 18, she wrangled the lead in a small, bleak independent film called Winter's Bone. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=383.68s)]
*  I don't know what to do. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=390.28000000000003s)]
*  It was a breakout performance that earned her first Oscar nomination. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=394.12s)]
*  Not a lot of dialogue, but yet your presence fills the screen. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=398.52s)]
*  It was really just feeling, believing, you know, in this situation, look at it through [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=404.44s)]
*  her eyes, and then that's always going to come across in your eyes, in your face, in [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=411.24s)]
*  your body language. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=416.08s)]
*  That empathy, you can channel that into acting. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=417.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's how I act. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=420.79999999999995s)]
*  That's really my only tool, I think. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=423.12s)]
*  No acting training? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=426.53999999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=428.08000000000004s)]
*  It's just empathy. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=429.08000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=430.32s)]
*  Is that difficult or easy for you to do? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=431.32s)]
*  It's easy. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=435.0s)]
*  To just let go of Jennifer Lawrence? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=436.0s)]
*  Yeah, because that's when you get the high. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=438.28000000000003s)]
*  That's what I crave, that really getting lost into something, being almost possessed by [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=441.16s)]

*  nudity. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=487.02s)]
*  And I realized there's a difference between consent and not. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=488.7s)]

*  It didn't vaporize, but I did feel like I took the power out of having my body taken [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=513.02s)]

*  She got so mad at me, she said, I don't do that. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=635.46s)]
*  I don't dance like that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=637.86s)]
*  And then she goes, wait a second. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=638.86s)]
*  This feels like home. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=639.86s)]

*  You got to have it. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=681.7s)]
*  I got to have it. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=682.7s)]
*  It's her defense against the brutal cutthroat side of show business, which has been on conspicuous [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=684.7s)]

*  He produced her Oscar winning movie, Silver Linings Playbook. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=702.34s)]

*  And when it came out and I heard about it, I wanted to kill him. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=715.7800000000001s)]

*  Why not blame the studio? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=744.54s)]
*  They're the ones who didn't pay you. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=745.54s)]
*  Because I didn't fight hard enough. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=747.94s)]
*  It was my own mentality that led me to believe that I didn't deserve to be paid equally. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=749.78s)]
*  Would you do that again? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=756.3000000000001s)]

*  Does that translate into money and power? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=766.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=769.3399999999999s)]

*  written. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=775.42s)]
*  I have an amazing career bill. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=776.42s)]
*  But you do. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=778.8599999999999s)]

*  This is right now. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=782.2199999999999s)]
*  This is all very temporary. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=783.5799999999999s)]
*  Hollywood is very fickle. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=786.8599999999999s)]
*  What, you're like the flavor of the month? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=788.9s)]

*  men and women, with women in leadership positions. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=968.5799999999999s)]
*  As British Prime Minister, Thatcher strode the world stage for more than a decade. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=973.54s)]
*  The Iron Lady of the Western World. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=978.3399999999999s)]
*  Leaving heel prints on the backs of her own conservative party's old boys club. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=982.66s)]
*  Did you like her? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=988.78s)]
*  I am in awe of what she did. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=989.78s)]
*  The policies you can argue with, but to sit in the hot seat, I can't even imagine having [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=994.14s)]
*  that steadfastness. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1002.98s)]
*  I'll just have a small one because I'm watching my figure. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1003.98s)]
*  Their stories are both about transformation. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1009.58s)]

*  One of the things she did was get a drama teacher to tell her how to support her voice. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1025.82s)]
*  Because her voice is sort of lighter like mine is. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1031.74s)]
*  And they taught her to support it and bring it up from the depths of her place where the [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1038.94s)]
*  conviction lies and to carry it through without a breath until the end of the thought. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1048.22s)]
*  And then not to give him a chance to interrupt her. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1053.1s)]
*  She was also a lover or hater, remarkably single minded and confident that her way was [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1056.34s)]
*  the only way. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1062.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1064.34s)]
*  I have a lot of that. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1066.1s)]
*  It was typecasting, wasn't it? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1068.1s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1072.8999999999999s)]

*  It's her husband of 33 years, sculptor Don Gummer, and their children, a son and three [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1083.66s)]

*  There's something I want to show you. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1093.18s)]
*  On the theory that high school is destiny, we took her back to the days long before she [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1095.8200000000002s)]
*  became Meryl of the movies. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1101.5800000000002s)]

*  Back then in Bernardville, New Jersey, she was just playing Meryl Louise Streep. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1108.14s)]
*  So, not so plain. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1113.54s)]
*  Pretty, blonde, vivacious cheerleader, our homecoming queen, where the boys are. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1115.54s)]
*  Where the boys are, indeed. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1121.9399999999998s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1123.9399999999998s)]
*  Bernardian art editor, that's what I was. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1124.9399999999998s)]
*  And the morning announcer, Diane Sawyer, eat your heart out. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1126.9399999999998s)]
*  Home movies made it clear. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1132.1399999999999s)]
*  The camera loved her from an early age. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1133.74s)]
*  But the homecoming queen didn't care much for the movies of the day. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1136.98s)]
*  She was fascinated by the classics. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1141.1399999999999s)]
*  There was one channel that had older movies. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1143.4799999999998s)]
*  And I loved Carole Lombard, and I loved Kate Hepburn, and Bette Davis, and Barbara Stanwyck. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1148.2399999999998s)]

*  Though she had dabbled in acting, she got serious about it at the Yale Drama School. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1160.1599999999999s)]
*  That led to an audition with the public theater director, Joe Pepp. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1165.6999999999998s)]
*  Joe Pepp could be a taskmaster, yes? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1170.48s)]
*  Not to me. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1174.72s)]
*  Pepp gave her her first break on Broadway, a small role in a period piece called Trelawney [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1178.8s)]
*  of the Wells. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1185.0s)]
*  Joe Pepp asked you if you could do a southern accent? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1186.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1189.3600000000001s)]
*  And he said, wait, try it. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1190.3600000000001s)]
*  Do this southern. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1192.52s)]
*  Can you do a southern accent? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1193.52s)]
*  I'm from, not even southern New Jersey, you know. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1196.56s)]
*  I pulled it up out of probably some four o'clock movie somewhere. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1202.8799999999999s)]
*  I heard it was from the Diana Shore show. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1206.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, maybe that was it. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1209.76s)]
*  See the USA in your Chevrolet. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1212.08s)]

*  Yes. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1218.84s)]
*  Oh God, wasn't she divine. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1219.84s)]
*  Here's where I forgot my lines in the seagull. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1221.8799999999999s)]
*  Soon she was doing the classics on this outdoor stage, competing with airplanes, heat, rain, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1225.1599999999999s)]
*  and more. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1233.28s)]

*  Did you hear that? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1236.28s)]
*  Her career took off so fast that one summer she did Taming of the Shrew here at night. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1237.28s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1243.28s)]
*  And during the day shot two movies, Kramer vs. Kramer and Woody Allen's Manhattan. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1244.9599999999998s)]

*  Are you writing a book about our marriage? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1253.2s)]
*  You leave me alone. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1255.4s)]
*  Her range was astonishing. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1257.24s)]
*  One year a Texan, Karen Silkwood. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1259.1200000000001s)]

*  She wore spandex for Mamma Mia, a nun's habit for a doubt, and a beard playing a rabbi in [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1272.4s)]
*  Angels in America. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1281.36s)]

*  And you're not prime minister anymore. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1343.76s)]
*  To tell an honest story about a big life in its ebb, you have to deal with this part of [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1346.3600000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1355.88s)]

*  was threatened by the lady of the house. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1425.4s)]

*  The case led to the abolition of slavery in the state. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1450.26s)]

*  But one thing that drives her crazy is the snail's pace of movie making, shooting the [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1471.78s)]
*  same scene time and time again. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1477.6399999999999s)]

*  Yeah, but I guess I have less tolerance for it. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1494.28s)]
*  I like movies that have little budget and so they can't do that. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1496.76s)]
*  Do you think that movies are better, getting better than when you started? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1500.82s)]
*  I think the acting's better. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1505.3799999999999s)]
*  I think the acting is better than in the classic days, frankly, of movies. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1508.3799999999999s)]
*  If you look at the movies being made, the big movies that are being made are about comic strips. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1513.6599999999999s)]
*  Well I don't see those. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1520.62s)]
*  Or vampires or gross behavior. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1521.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1524.4199999999998s)]
*  All aimed at 18 year old boys. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1525.4199999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1529.22s)]
*  It's called the narrowing of the audience. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1530.64s)]
*  The movie business has worked assiduously to discourage you and other intelligent, discerning [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1532.4s)]
*  people from the theater, from the movie theater. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1540.04s)]
*  They have worked hard to get rid of you because you don't go then buy toys and games. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1543.92s)]
*  And then there's the Streep Enigma, that hint of a Mona Lisa smile, or as the Italians call [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1552.28s)]
*  the painting, La Gioconda. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1558.26s)]
*  Jack Nicholson says of you, it's the Gioconda smile. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1561.14s)]
*  The mystery of Meryl that appeals. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1568.34s)]
*  Is that a snake? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1571.74s)]
*  What is a Gioconda? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1572.74s)]
*  No, you're thinking of an anaconda. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1573.74s)]
*  It's a Mona Lisa. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1578.74s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1581.74s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1582.74s)]
*  All that education down the drain. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1584.24s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1588.24s)]
*  I thought, what is he? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1589.24s)]
*  It's good to have something that is undiscoverable, which frankly I think every human being has. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1591.24s)]
*  I don't think I'm that mysterious, but I'm glad he thinks so. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1600.24s)]
*  We'll soon know what audiences and Oscar voters think of Streep's portrayal. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1606.24s)]
*  The actress, the prime minister. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1612.74s)]
*  No doubt at odds politically, but each compelled to leave their mark. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1615.74s)]
*  To brilliant performers, to sisters under the skin. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1620.74s)]
*  Did you discover anything of yourself in her? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1625.74s)]
*  No, what do you mean? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1628.74s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1631.74s)]
*  My dutifulness, my desire to work hard, my desire to do the right thing. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1636.24s)]
*  To, you know, be a good girl. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1643.24s)]
*  All those things I think she grew up with, and so did I. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1648.24s)]
*  Every once in a while you draw the short straw here at 60 Minutes. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1653.74s)]
*  This time we were told to spend a few days with a woman who is often called the most beautiful woman in the world. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1668.74s)]
*  Angelina Jolie. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1675.74s)]
*  She may well be the most photographed, the most recognizable, and the highest paid actress in Hollywood. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1678.24s)]
*  She's certainly the number one target for paparazzi everywhere. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1684.24s)]
*  And that's how many Americans know her, from the tabloids, as wild, weird, and eccentric. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1689.24s)]
*  But the Angelina we met was quite different from all that. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1696.24s)]
*  For starters, she just wrote and directed a film about a very serious topic. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1699.24s)]
*  It's released next month, and she doesn't even appear in it. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1705.74s)]
*  For the first time, Angelina has moved behind the camera, where she says she feels more comfortable. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1708.74s)]
*  We linked up with her in the indisputably beautiful city of Budapest, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1717.74s)]
*  which is where she shot most of her film, In the Land of Blood and Honey. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1721.74s)]
*  We came here to Budapest for logistics and for financial reasons, because we're a tiny movie. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1725.74s)]
*  It may be a tiny movie, but look at it. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1731.24s)]
*  It's about a heavy subject, the war in Bosnia, which was fought in the early 90s, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1734.24s)]
*  killed at least 100,000 people, and brought ethnic cleansing to Europe for the first time since Hitler. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1740.24s)]
*  What did your friends and colleagues say when you said, hey, I'm going to direct a film about the war in Bosnia? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1748.24s)]
*  I think people that really know me weren't surprised, but I think they all thought it was a bit crazy. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1753.24s)]
*  I think everybody still thinks it's a bit, you know. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1757.24s)]
*  I still think it's crazy. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1760.74s)]
*  You could have done a light comedy or an action flick. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1762.74s)]
*  I think I'd be terrible with a comedy. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1765.74s)]
*  There's certainly no humor in this movie about a Muslim woman named Ila, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1768.74s)]
*  who starts to fall in love with a Serb named Daniel. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1772.74s)]
*  After the war breaks out, Bosnians are rounded up and locked up by the Serbs, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1776.74s)]
*  and Daniel, a Serb captain, becomes Ila's jailer. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1781.74s)]
*  This is a gorgeous building. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1785.74s)]
*  It is a gorgeous building. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1787.74s)]
*  They've made horrible things happen inside here. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1789.24s)]
*  And beautiful things. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1791.24s)]
*  Angelina shot the jail scenes in this Budapest museum, and she relied heavily on her actors. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1793.24s)]
*  They all come from the former Yugoslavia. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1799.24s)]
*  She let them rewrite scenes, and they speak the native language in the film, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1801.24s)]
*  which will be released with English subtitles. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1805.24s)]
*  Angelina said she wanted to make the film as realistic as possible. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1808.24s)]
*  We all spoke about every speech, every scene, and made sure that it was right and true. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1812.24s)]
*  So everybody helped to educate me, and we all adjusted the script together. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1818.24s)]
*  Can you see? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1822.74s)]
*  While we were there, Angelina gave the cast a sneak preview of the film's trailer. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1825.74s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1834.74s)]
*  And they thought it reflected the reality of their war. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1835.74s)]
*  Goran Kostich and Zana Marjanovic play the two lovers. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1840.74s)]
*  People I know and my friends and their families never thought in their life [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1846.24s)]
*  that everything they had could be taken away from them. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1851.24s)]
*  It goes to the core of who I am and what I am and what we are, I suppose. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1855.24s)]
*  It's very personal. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1859.24s)]
*  Others might find the plot implausible. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1861.24s)]
*  An affair between a Muslim prisoner and the Serb commandant of the prison [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1863.24s)]
*  where women are getting raped every day. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1868.24s)]
*  Some Bosnian women who had been through that found the film objectionable. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1871.74s)]
*  The Bosnian government temporarily withdrew Angelina's permit to shoot there. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1876.74s)]
*  You walked into a minefield, and when you were writing the script, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1881.74s)]
*  did you realize that every step you took, there was a mine in your way? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1886.74s)]
*  I didn't know it was going to be as sensitive. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1892.74s)]
*  Everything, everything was something to be very careful about and sensitive. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1894.74s)]
*  But Angelina says, remember, it's a movie, a love story, not a documentary. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1901.24s)]
*  There's a lot of heart. There's also a lot of brutality. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1907.24s)]
*  There's a lot of brutality. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1910.24s)]
*  A lot more than there ever was in a film that you acted in. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1911.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1913.24s)]
*  Am I making you nervous? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1915.24s)]
*  She has acted in more than 30 films, and her first ones, like Gia, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1916.24s)]
*  about a drug-addicted fashion model felt edgy and real. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1921.24s)]
*  Angelina, whose actor parents broke up before she was one, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1925.74s)]
*  experimented with drugs and a few other things early in her life. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1929.74s)]
*  She says she used those experiences to get into her roles. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1934.74s)]
*  It's good to be home. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1938.74s)]
*  She won an Oscar for her chilling portrait of a schizophrenic in Girl, Interrupted. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1940.74s)]
*  Later, she switched gears as Laura Croft, a character from a video game in Tomb Raider. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1947.74s)]
*  Dodging bullets. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1954.24s)]
*  And played a spy, Mrs. Smith, to Brad Pitt's Mr. Smith. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1955.24s)]
*  You were once asked if you wanted to play a Bond girl, and you said, nope. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1961.24s)]
*  You wanted to play Bond. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1968.24s)]
*  Well, you didn't play Bond, but you played a Bond-like character in Salt. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1970.24s)]
*  Is that one of your ambitions, to punch through these gender stereotypes? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1974.24s)]
*  It's not something I intentionally did, but when it comes my way, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1979.24s)]
*  and I'm aware of it, it was really fun to do. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1982.74s)]
*  Especially because I just had kids. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1984.74s)]
*  I just had my twins and I'd been in the nightgown for about seven months, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1986.74s)]
*  and I felt like getting up and punching something. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1989.74s)]
*  Her favorite movie was not an action flick, but a tragedy based on a true story. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1992.74s)]
*  In A Mighty Heart, Angelina plays Marianne Pearl, the widow of Daniel Pearl, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=1998.74s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal reporter who is beheaded by terrorists in Pakistan. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2003.74s)]
*  No! No! [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2008.74s)]
*  That was a moment I'll never forget. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2013.74s)]
*  That was the hardest thing, yeah. As an actress, that was the hardest thing. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2015.74s)]
*  Many of her films earned her more money than praise. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2021.74s)]
*  Critics have often been tough, but some directors rave about her. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2024.74s)]
*  Clint Eastwood said she's a great talent hampered only by the fact that she has, quote, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2029.74s)]
*  the most gorgeous face on the planet. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2035.74s)]
*  That face has sold a lot of handbags and magazines, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2037.74s)]
*  but early on, Angelina Jolie flirted with a very different career. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2041.74s)]
*  You wanted to be a funeral director. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2046.74s)]
*  Mm-hmm, I did. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2049.74s)]
*  And you even took courses to prepare yourself. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2050.74s)]
*  It sounds like this very strange, eccentric, dark thing to do, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2053.74s)]
*  but in fact, I lost my grandfather and I was very upset with his funeral. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2058.74s)]
*  And so we discussed that maybe there are ways where this whole idea of how somebody passes [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2063.74s)]
*  and how a family deals with this passing and what death is should be addressed in a different way. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2069.74s)]
*  If this acting thing didn't work out, that that was going to be my backup. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2074.74s)]
*  She can joke about it now, but there were other times, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2078.74s)]
*  scary and dangerous times, that she told us were not funny at all. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2082.74s)]
*  I went through heavy, darker times and I survived them. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2087.74s)]
*  I didn't die young, so I'm very lucky. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2091.74s)]
*  There are other artists and people that didn't survive certain things. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2093.74s)]
*  Talk about heavy, darker times. What are you referring to? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2096.74s)]
*  I was hoping you'd miss that. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2101.74s)]
*  Nothing I want to go into a lot of detail about, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2103.74s)]
*  but I think people can imagine that I did the most dangerous and I did the worst, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2106.74s)]
*  and for many reasons I shouldn't be here. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2110.74s)]
*  That's a very provocative phrase, for many reasons. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2113.74s)]
*  Well, sir, you just think that those too many times where you came close to [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2115.74s)]
*  too many dangerous things, too many chances taken, too far. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2120.74s)]
*  Her odd behavior was out there for everyone to see. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2126.74s)]
*  The intimate way she kissed her brother in public, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2130.74s)]
*  the vials of blood she and her second husband, Billy Bob Thornton, wore around their necks. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2133.74s)]
*  Angelina acknowledges she's taken quite a walk on the wild side, but says she's moved on. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2139.74s)]
*  I'm Angie. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2146.74s)]
*  In recent years, she has been traveling the world as a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2147.74s)]
*  She's visited more than 20 countries, primarily to work with refugees. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2152.74s)]
*  You used to be a pretty bad girl. Now you are a U.N. ambassador. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2157.74s)]
*  You are a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2160.74s)]
*  You're a humanitarian activist. Do you ever miss being a bad girl? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2164.74s)]
*  I'm still a bad girl. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2169.74s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2171.74s)]
*  You know, I still have that side of me that is, it's just, it's in its place now. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2172.74s)]
*  It belongs, you know, it belongs to Brad or it belongs to our adventures. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2177.74s)]
*  Angelina and Brad Pitt have had three children together. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2184.74s)]
*  She also adopted three from three different countries, Cambodia, Ethiopia and Vietnam. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2188.74s)]
*  The tabloids have the couple splitting up one week, getting married the next. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2194.74s)]
*  Angelina told us they have no plans to get married. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2199.74s)]
*  The vast majority of Americans know you because you're on the cover of magazines every week [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2203.74s)]
*  and every time they go to a supermarket, they see you. What are they missing? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2209.74s)]
*  Me? I don't see those things. I don't know what they are, but I assume they're not me. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2214.74s)]
*  Sure you do. You know what they are. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2219.74s)]
*  They're not who I am. They're not what I spend my day caring about. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2220.74s)]
*  I find them quite shallow and often very wrong when I do hear about what they are. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2223.74s)]
*  But they make it impossible for her to do anything in public. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2227.74s)]
*  Even in Budapest, we could only lunch with her in the private room of a restaurant. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2231.74s)]
*  When you're Angelina Jolie, though, there's no such thing as private. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2236.74s)]
*  Take her tortured relationship with her father, the actor John Voight. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2240.74s)]
*  He actually went on television and said his daughter had serious mental problems. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2244.74s)]
*  That even shocked Hollywood. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2250.74s)]
*  For years, Angelina refused to talk to her father. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2252.74s)]
*  After her mother died, she started seeing him again. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2256.74s)]
*  But she gives her mother, Marceline Bertrand, all the credit for where she is today. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2259.74s)]
*  Your mother's a beautiful woman. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2265.74s)]
*  She is. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2267.74s)]
*  You're a pretty chubby kid. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2269.74s)]
*  I was all cheeks, yeah. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2271.74s)]
*  Big lips. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2272.74s)]
*  Big lips. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2273.74s)]
*  Angelina also says it was her mom who taught her how to raise her own kids. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2274.74s)]
*  At the house Angelina's renting in Budapest, we weren't allowed to film her children, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2279.74s)]
*  unless you call Jacques one of her kids. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2285.74s)]
*  He seemed to love the camera almost as much as the camera loves Angelina. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2288.74s)]
*  He likes you. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2293.74s)]
*  You're here because Brad is shooting a film here. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2294.74s)]
*  You're not shooting a film? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2297.74s)]
*  No, we never work at the same time. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2298.74s)]
*  What's better, when Brad is working and you're with the kids, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2300.74s)]
*  or when you're working and Brad is with the kids? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2303.74s)]
*  When I'm home with the kids. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2305.74s)]
*  But a lot of full-time parents would love to be shooting movies. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2306.74s)]
*  Yes, they would, because it's easier. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2309.74s)]
*  My mother was a full-time mother. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2311.74s)]
*  She didn't have much of her own career, her own life, her own experiences, her own... [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2314.74s)]
*  everything was for her children. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2319.74s)]
*  And you try to be the same kind of mom that she was? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2321.74s)]
*  I will never be as good a mother as she was. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2325.74s)]
*  I will try my best, but I don't think I could ever be. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2327.74s)]
*  She was just grace incarnate. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2330.74s)]
*  She was the most generous, loving... [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2333.74s)]
*  She's better than me. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2341.74s)]
*  It's clear that you can talk about anything but your mother, without dwelling up. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2343.74s)]
*  Yeah. That's my soft spot. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2348.74s)]
*  Angelina's biggest regret is that her mother won't be there for the premiere of In the Land of Blood and Honey, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2358.74s)]
*  a film she suspects won't have the commercial appeal of anything she's done. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2364.74s)]
*  It's going to open soon. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2370.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2371.74s)]
*  Nervous? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2372.74s)]
*  I am nervous that people are going to not understand it. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2373.74s)]
*  Right now, if you had to decide that in six months you're going to either act in a film or direct a film, what would you do? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2377.74s)]
*  I'd prefer directing. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2383.74s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2385.74s)]
*  Yeah. I loved having the spotlight on somebody else, and I would much prefer it. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2386.74s)]
*  Angelina's already writing and planning to direct another war film about Afghanistan, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2390.74s)]
*  and she knows, as a director, her beauty and her acting skills won't be worth a nickel. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2396.74s)]
*  It's nice. It's nice for all of that not to matter. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2402.74s)]
*  It's also risky. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2406.74s)]
*  Is it? I mean, I think what's risky is living your life and never trying for anything [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2408.74s)]
*  and never doing something brave and never getting yourself scared. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2413.74s)]
*  Are you scared? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2417.74s)]
*  In a good way. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2419.74s)]
*  The story of a child star done in by fame is as old as Hollywood itself. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2426.74s)]
*  But the story of a child star from one of America's greatest acting families, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2431.74s)]
*  who nearly destroys herself, then bounces back to become not just a leading lady, but a major film producer, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2435.74s)]
*  well, that story belongs only to Drew Barrymore. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2441.74s)]
*  She was famous by seven, abusing drugs by 11, and at 15 was widely known as the [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2444.74s)]
*  The Child Star. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2447.2999999999997s)]
*  She may have come from acting royalty, but in many ways she was an orphan, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2450.74s)]
*  a wild child raised by crews on movie sets. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2454.74s)]
*  She's 34 now, and though she still sometimes talks like a teenager, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2457.74s)]
*  she's become one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2461.74s)]
*  succeeding far beyond what anyone could have predicted. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2464.74s)]
*  How did she do it? That's what we wanted to find out. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2467.74s)]
*  We met up with Drew Barrymore on Broadway in New York. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2471.74s)]
*  At the height of afternoon rush hour, she stopped traffic. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2474.74s)]
*  Do you feel comfortable in New York? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2478.74s)]
*  I feel very comfortable in New York. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2480.74s)]
*  It's been a while, but a Barrymore on Broadway was something generations of New Yorkers were once used to. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2482.74s)]
*  This Broadway theater is named for her great aunt, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2488.74s)]
*  who was a very famous actress and actress. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2492.74s)]
*  She was a very famous actress and actress, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2495.74s)]
*  I'm from the Barrymore Theater. Welcome. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2497.74s)]
*  This Broadway theater is named for her great aunt, Ethel, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2499.74s)]
*  a legendary stage actress in the early 1900s. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2502.74s)]
*  You have the same profile. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2505.74s)]
*  Yeah, we have that distinct, weird profile. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2507.74s)]
*  It's a good profile. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2511.74s)]
*  I don't want to be too self-congratulatory about it. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2513.74s)]
*  I just love the fact that we have this sort of family stamp. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2516.74s)]
*  That Barrymore stamp grays silver screens from silent movies through the 1940s. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2520.74s)]
*  Her great aunt, Ethel, and her grandfather, John Barrymore, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2525.74s)]
*  were considered the greatest actors of their generation. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2528.74s)]
*  May I say one thing? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2531.74s)]
*  Oh, there is nothing to be said. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2533.74s)]
*  Drew's great uncle, Lionel, was a famous character actor [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2537.74s)]
*  who will forever be known as the sinister banker Potter in It's a Wonderful Life. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2540.74s)]
*  You once called me a warped, frustrated old man. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2545.74s)]
*  Acting has been the family business for hundreds of years. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2550.74s)]
*  Going back to Georgiana Drew and John Drew [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2554.74s)]
*  and my great-grandfather Maurice Barrymore, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2557.74s)]
*  it was such a sort of circus of odd, interesting people that loved acting. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2560.74s)]
*  There are Barrymores who have been acting since George III was in power. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2570.74s)]
*  Like the 14th century. It dates back to the family tree. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2573.74s)]
*  And I thought, well, I'm not crazy if I feel this magnetic, blood-lined pull to do this thing. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2577.74s)]
*  She felt the pull as a child, but she'd been pushed into the business long before that. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2585.74s)]
*  That's Drew when she was just 11 months old, starring in a commercial for dog food. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2591.74s)]
*  Her big break, however, came at the age of six when the blockbuster hit E.T. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2597.74s)]
*  Drew's scene-stealing Gertie made her an international star. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2603.74s)]
*  Movie audiences loved the precocious Gertie, and so did director Steven Spielberg, who Drew calls her godfather. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2609.74s)]
*  I've always said about Drew that she's tenaciously optimistic. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2618.74s)]
*  And she had really the kind of imagination that not only invited E.T. into a reality within herself, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2625.74s)]
*  but it invited all of us to believe that what Drew was seeing was true. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2632.74s)]
*  On the set between takes, seven-year-old Drew used to talk with E.T. She'd tell him her secrets. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2636.74s)]
*  I liked hanging out with him, and I would bring him lunch and put a little handkerchief around his neck. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2643.74s)]
*  But you knew he was fake. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2648.74s)]
*  I knew he was fake, but that red-beating heart just said so much to me, and I don't know. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2650.74s)]
*  I just felt like I could talk to him. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2655.74s)]
*  I just want to say goodbye. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2657.74s)]
*  It turns out the little girl with the famous family was pretty much on her own. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2660.74s)]
*  Her father, an actor who struggled with drugs and alcohol, was rarely around. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2665.74s)]
*  Drew's mom, who also acted, had to work to support them both. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2669.74s)]
*  On the movie set, Drew says she finally found a home. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2673.74s)]
*  When I did E.T., it sort of solidified, like, the only family I know are these film crews, these gypsies, these filmmakers. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2677.74s)]
*  That was the solidification and the clicking revelation of this is what I want to do with my life, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2686.74s)]
*  and this is where I'm going to survive. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2692.74s)]
*  It was a family. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2694.74s)]
*  It was the perfect family. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2695.74s)]
*  So what's it like when a movie's over? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2697.74s)]
*  That was the devastating part, was just, okay, if it's over, how do you keep this going? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2700.74s)]
*  Because the family moves on. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2708.74s)]
*  Yep. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2709.74s)]
*  I mean, people get other jobs. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2710.74s)]
*  Yep. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2711.74s)]
*  There were plenty of other acting jobs for Drew after E.T., but there were plenty of other temptations as well. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2712.74s)]
*  Her mom became her manager, but neither she nor her child seemed very much in control. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2717.74s)]
*  By nine, Drew and her mom were regulars at night clubs in Los Angeles and New York. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2723.74s)]
*  You had no discipline as a kid? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2729.74s)]
*  None. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2731.74s)]
*  No authority? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2732.74s)]
*  None. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2733.74s)]
*  None whatsoever. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2734.74s)]
*  No parental authority telling you, this is right, this is wrong? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2735.74s)]
*  Quite the opposite. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2737.74s)]
*  It was more like, can you get me into that club? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2738.74s)]
*  It was very excessive and wild and hedonistic. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2740.74s)]
*  When did you start smoking? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2745.74s)]
*  When I was nine. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2746.74s)]
*  Nine? [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2747.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2748.74s)]
*  Not something I'm proud of at all. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2749.74s)]
*  When did you take your first drink? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2752.74s)]
*  Somewhere around that same time. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2753.74s)]
*  I thought the two went really nicely together. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2756.74s)]
*  And how about marijuana? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2758.74s)]
*  Eleven. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2761.74s)]
*  Who gave you a joint at age eleven? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2762.74s)]
*  My friend's mom, actually, just to make it sound even crazier. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2764.74s)]
*  Yeah, I was raised around hippies. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2767.74s)]
*  Cocaine? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2771.74s)]
*  Twelve. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2772.74s)]
*  A twelve-year-old doing cocaine? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2773.74s)]
*  I know, it's nuts. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2776.74s)]
*  Some people don't survive, though, that experience phase. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2777.74s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I also don't think that it has to be so heavy. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2782.74s)]
*  It's like, oh, it's just so tragic. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2786.74s)]
*  No, it wasn't. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2788.74s)]
*  It was an extraordinary experience. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2789.74s)]
*  I went through it, and I learned a lot. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2792.74s)]
*  And did I learn it in front of everyone, which was righteously embarrassing? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2795.74s)]
*  Sure. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2799.74s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2800.74s)]
*  Made me stronger. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2802.74s)]
*  It may have made her stronger, but at the time, it wasn't clear she'd get through it. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2804.74s)]
*  At the age of thirteen, she was forced into rehab [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2808.74s)]
*  and ended up in treatment on and off for more than a year. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2811.74s)]
*  When you were in rehab, your dad called you. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2814.74s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2818.74s)]
*  But he was calling to ask you for money. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2819.74s)]
*  Great dad. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2821.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he would ask me for money on birthdays and, you know, in inappropriate times. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2823.74s)]
*  And then I just wrote him off, like, you're not a father. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2830.74s)]
*  I just learned you cannot emotionally invest in people who are not attainable. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2833.74s)]
*  She'd also learned that she could legally separate herself from her parents. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2839.74s)]
*  She discovered that from, of all places, a movie she starred in. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2843.74s)]
*  It was called Irreconcilable Differences. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2847.74s)]
*  The reason I went to a lawyer to divorce my parents [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2850.74s)]
*  is because I can't take living with either one of them anymore. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2853.74s)]
*  At fifteen, out of rehab, Drew Barrymore petitioned the state of California to emancipate herself. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2857.74s)]
*  Arguing she'd be better off without her mother and father. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2862.74s)]
*  The court agreed, and she was on her own. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2866.74s)]
*  I did what I had to do to get there, which was play by the rules and re-figure out my life [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2869.74s)]
*  and disconnect myself from the people I knew and the lifestyle I knew [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2875.74s)]
*  and, you know, prove that I was a responsible citizen with a good head out of my shoulders. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2880.74s)]
*  And I did. And therefore I was rewarded by being emancipated. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2886.74s)]
*  You get your own apartment. Yeah. Signed your own lease. Yes. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2891.74s)]
*  You got a job. Yes. What kind of a job? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2894.74s)]
*  I worked at a coffee house called The Living Room, and my boss just hated me. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2897.74s)]
*  He was just like, please, at one point he was like, go live your dreams and get out of my shop. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2902.74s)]
*  Her agents told her she was overweight and unemployable, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2910.74s)]
*  but she missed acting and missed the impromptu families that film sets create. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2913.74s)]
*  I missed my tribe, and I was really alone out there. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2918.74s)]
*  And so I just started going on auditions again. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2923.74s)]
*  It took her years of TV movies and small roles in low-budget films, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2927.74s)]
*  but Drew Barrymore won Hollywood and audiences back. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2931.74s)]
*  Her quirky sense of humor and girl-next-door appeal [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2935.74s)]
*  have made her a leading lady in a number of hugely successful romantic comedies. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2938.74s)]
*  People seem to root for her, no matter what the film is, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2943.74s)]
*  no matter what role she's in or what she's doing. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2946.74s)]
*  Well, you know, it's very easy to root for the little girl in E.T. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2949.74s)]
*  And that little girl has grown up, and she's still the same character that she was in E.T. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2952.74s)]
*  You know, she just has a kind of... She casts a spell. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2957.74s)]
*  Unlike many Hollywood-leading ladies, she's remarkably approachable onscreen and off. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2961.74s)]
*  She never seems afraid to reveal too much, even if she sometimes goes too far. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2967.74s)]
*  About that eye-popping late-night appearance in 1995, she says she has no regrets. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2973.74s)]
*  I felt like Pan. I was like, you know, in the forest, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2980.74s)]
*  thinking that life was some hippie nudist comedy. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2984.74s)]
*  You know, get on David Letterman's desk and just be free and have fun, and that's just who I was. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2987.74s)]
*  That is still part of who she is, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2992.74s)]
*  but in Hollywood she's increasingly taken seriously as an actor and a producer. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=2994.74s)]
*  This year she was nominated for an Emmy playing eccentric socialite Edie Biel, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3000.74s)]
*  a woman made famous by the 1975 documentary Grey Gardens. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3004.74s)]
*  This is the real Edie Biel. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3009.74s)]
*  It's very difficult to keep the line between the past and the present. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3011.74s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's awfully difficult. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3015.74s)]
*  And this is Drew Barrymore's portrayal. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3019.74s)]
*  It's very difficult to keep the line between the past and the present. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3022.74s)]
*  Awfully difficult. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3027.74s)]
*  As a producer, Drew has made movies that have grossed more than $900 million. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3029.74s)]
*  The walls of her Hollywood office are covered with photos and movie stills she uses for inspiration. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3034.74s)]
*  They just constantly remind me of what it is I'm trying to do. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3040.74s)]
*  Her latest focus is directing. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3045.74s)]
*  Right where you are. Perfect. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3047.74s)]
*  Her directorial debut is a film called Whip It, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3050.74s)]
*  an unusual coming-of-age story set in the world of Texas roller derby. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3053.74s)]
*  The little girl who grew up on movie sets is now in charge of them. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3059.74s)]
*  You've created your own family. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3063.74s)]
*  Absolutely. And everybody gets the chance to do that. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3065.74s)]
*  It's her friends who are now her family. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3068.74s)]
*  Many of them work with Drew on all her films. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3071.74s)]
*  She currently isn't speaking with her own mother and hasn't for a long time. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3074.74s)]
*  She reconciled with her father shortly before he died in 2004. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3078.74s)]
*  There are a lot of us little gypsies out there that need to go and find another place [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3082.74s)]
*  a safer, healthier, or just a different venue in order to develop and find ourselves. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3087.74s)]
*  I am so lucky to live the life that I do. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABP9KcGwgho&t=3094.74s)]
