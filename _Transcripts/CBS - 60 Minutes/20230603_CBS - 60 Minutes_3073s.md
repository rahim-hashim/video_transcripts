# Great White Sharks, Whales, Ocean Floor Metals, Ocean Plastic Plague | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [June 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU)
*  The book and movie Jaws introduced us to the great white shark more than 40 years ago and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=0.0s)]
*  scared us out of our wits. Much of the film was shot in the waters off Cape Cod, Massachusetts. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=19.48s)]
*  The irony is that when it came out in the mid-1970s, there were very few white sharks [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=25.84s)]
*  around Cape Cod. The species was in the midst of a serious decline, and the movie made it [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=32.0s)]
*  worse with fishermen hunting the few great whites that there were. White sharks were [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=37.76s)]
*  granted federal protection in 1997 and in the years since have made a comeback that [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=43.8s)]
*  has delighted conservationists and frightened swimmers and surfers. On Cape Cod this summer, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=50.08s)]
*  shark sightings and beach closings were about as common as lobster rolls. As we saw for ourselves, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=56.16s)]
*  the Atlantic great white shark is back. Look at this fish. Look at this fish. Yeah, look at this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=62.56s)]
*  On a Tuesday in mid-September, we're with Dr. Greg Schomal, chief shark scientist for the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=74.24s)]
*  Massachusetts Department of Marine Fisheries, following an 11-foot white shark swimming just [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=80.55999999999999s)]
*  feet off the beach near Truro on Cape Cod. And if you're standing there, you don't know that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=87.52s)]
*  I have no idea. You don't know that shark. No idea. She's like 10 feet offshore. Yeah, it's very close now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  White sharks are so close to shore because that's where their favorite food is. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=99.92s)]
*  Grey seals, thousands of which now call Cape Cod home. This is the restaurant right here. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=105.2s)]
*  These sharks have found the restaurant and they're waiting for the doors to open, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=111.92s)]
*  you know, and when those seals begin to leave the beach, you know, it's dinner time. It's dinner time. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=115.52s)]
*  Schomal and his team from the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy are trying to attach [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=121.76s)]
*  electronic tracking tags to as many sharks as they can, nearly 200 so far. The way they do it [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=127.04s)]
*  is fascinating. Pilot Wayne Davis locates sharks from his spotter plane, then guides [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=134.56s)]
*  boat captain John King onto them. Yeah, use a little gas, John. He's right on the shore. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=141.12s)]
*  It's about as good as it's going to get. Standing on a pulpit on the bow of a small boat, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=146.88s)]
*  Greg Schomal wields a long pole that has a dart and a tag at the end. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=152.96s)]
*  Right there. Done. You got him? Tag. That was it. There he goes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=160.72s)]
*  Beautiful, beautiful placement, Greg. Yeah, thank you, John. Nice work. You can see where it was? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=166.24s)]
*  Yeah, you can see it right at the base of the door. So see it? Yeah. Now we're going to learn [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=172.0s)]
*  about that fish for the next nine, 10 years. They will track the fish because the tag constantly [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=175.84s)]
*  emits a ping that is picked up when the shark swims close to acoustic receivers attached to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=182.32s)]
*  buoys. And how many of these do you have up and down the coast? We have over a hundred out all [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=187.92s)]
*  over Massachusetts. And that's just you? That's just us. Yeah, so we can actually track the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=193.2s)]
*  movements of our white sharks when they leave here. The tags also help Schomal and his research [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=198.0s)]
*  colleague, Megan Winton, figure out just how many sharks there are and have established that Cape Cod [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=203.44s)]
*  is now one of the world's white shark hot spots. They regularly haul buoys out of the water [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=211.2s)]
*  and download data from them to a tablet that displays each time a tagged shark swims by. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  Lots of white shark detections. This tells them a lot about individuals. They have confirmed that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=225.83999999999997s)]
*  they are loners and that the same one will often come back to precisely the same hunting ground [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  year after year. A white shark seemed to be hunting Greg Schomal last year when it came up [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=239.6s)]
*  jaws open right under the pulpit. Oh, holy crap. What? That shook him up for a bit, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=246.24s)]
*  but he insists it shouldn't shake up the public. You know, all I can tell them is, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=257.12s)]
*  is that the probability of them being bitten is incredibly low, but it's not much more I can say. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=262.32s)]
*  That fear is primal. I think that fear is primal. I think it's innate. I think it's in them. It's [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=269.6s)]
*  in us. It's in all of us. Five days after our day on the water off Cape Cod, we needed a bigger boat [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=275.12s)]
*  for a very different shark tagging expedition. 600 miles to the northeast, just off Hay Island [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  in Nova Scotia. We boarded a 125 foot research ship called O search, which has [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=290.24s)]
*  been tagging Atlantic white sharks from Florida to Canada since 2012. Founder Chris Fisher invited [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=299.44s)]
*  us to join the first day of his 2019 Nova Scotia expedition. And we come up here, we've been here [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=306.96s)]
*  24 hours, we've seen two or three sharks and no one ever even knew to come look here before. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=313.76s)]
*  O search launches a team on a small boat to hook white sharks, much as fishermen would [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=319.52s)]
*  using long lines, bait and floats to keep them near the surface. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=325.68s)]
*  O search is a converted Alaskan crab boat equipped with a platform that's lowered into the water off [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=334.32s)]
*  one side. As the small boat tows the shark alongside, O search fishing master Brett McBride [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  leaps onto the submerged platform into water that's 49 degrees. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=349.12s)]
*  With the line in his hand, he guides an 1100 pound male white shark onto the cradle. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=356.24s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, look at that. The platform is raised out of the water, effectively [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=365.36s)]
*  beaching the shark. It offers no resistance worn out after being hooked and towed for nearly an [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=372.0s)]
*  hour. McBride gets right in its face to insert a hose between its giant jaws. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=379.44s)]
*  A team member starts a clock. They don't want to keep the shark out of the water for more than 15 [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=392.48s)]
*  minutes and O search chief scientist Dr. Robert Huter gives me an opportunity I'm not quite sure [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=398.16s)]
*  I want. So Bill, just go ahead, go ahead and take your time to feel how beautiful that is. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=406.16s)]
*  Oh my god. How smooth. Then go this way, rub your hand the other way and you feel it's kind of bumpy. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=412.88000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. My god. The O search team swarms the shark, drawing blood and tissue samples, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=420.0s)]
*  picking off parasites to be analyzed and measuring its girth and length. 371 [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  total. That's 371 centimeters or 12 feet two inches. The biggest Atlantic great white they've [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  caught was a 16 foot female who weighed 3500 pounds. As Chris Fisher measures this one, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=442.48s)]
*  Bob Huter inserts an acoustic tag like the one Greg Skomal attaches with a dart. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=451.12s)]
*  That doesn't harm the shark. No, it's just it floats in the body cavity. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=457.6s)]
*  Yeah, let's roll the shark. Everybody step back. After the shark is rolled onto its belly, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=462.88s)]
*  there you go. Chris Fisher drills through the dorsal fin. He insists it's no more painful than [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=469.04s)]
*  piercing an ear. He's attaching the tag that really sets O search apart in the world of white [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=477.04s)]
*  shark tracking. This spot tag allows us to track this animal in real time for up to five years. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=483.36s)]
*  The spot tag will send a signal to a satellite each time this shark's dorsal fin comes above [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=489.2s)]
*  the surface of the water. O search has put nearly 50 of them on Atlantic white sharks [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=495.35999999999996s)]
*  and displays their tracks on its website. And that's how you learn not only where they are, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=501.35999999999996s)]
*  but what they're doing where they are, which is what you need to know to manage, right? Where's [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=506.79999999999995s)]
*  the mating? Where's the birthing? Where's the foraging? Where's the gestating? While some [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=510.79999999999995s)]
*  scientists criticize the O search techniques as too invasive, they are gathering a lot of data. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=515.12s)]
*  17 different research projects will get samples and information from a single shark. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=522.24s)]
*  Still, there are a lot of unknowns. No white shark has ever been kept in captivity [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=530.8s)]
*  and no one has ever seen them mate or give birth anywhere. But there are also discoveries. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=537.84s)]
*  The O search team has confirmed that the waters off Long Island are an important nursery for [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=545.1999999999999s)]
*  baby whites like these called pups. Did you get him? Yep, got him. And back on Cape Cod, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=550.88s)]
*  acoustic tags are teaching Greg Skomel about just how far adult sharks travel. So what's the most [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=559.28s)]
*  interesting thing you have learned about them? We now know based on the tagging work we've done the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=566.56s)]
*  last 10 years is that when they leave Cape Cod, they go down to Florida and they spend the time [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=570.72s)]
*  the Gulf of Mexico and they overwinter in these southern climates. But then some of these sharks [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=576.0s)]
*  move out into the open Atlantic Ocean and when they're out in the middle of the Atlantic, they [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=581.8399999999999s)]
*  dive down to depths as great as 3000 feet every day. And there's not a scientist on Earth that [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=585.92s)]
*  can tell you why they do that. Scientists have learned how long-lived they are. White sharks, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=591.52s)]
*  we now know, live over 70 years. 70 years. 70 years. They don't start hunting seals until [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=597.92s)]
*  they're late teens, but when they do, watch out. In this footage Greg Skomel shot, you see a seal [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=605.2s)]
*  leap out of the water with a shark right on its tail. Have you ever seen that before? Here the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=613.6s)]
*  shark catches a seal and the ocean water explodes in blood red in an instant. The shark then swims [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=621.6800000000001s)]
*  away with half a seal in its jaws. Seals have been protected by federal law since 1972 and some 25,000 [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=629.36s)]
*  now live near Cape Cod. More seals means more sharks and that's what worries the swimmers and [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=639.6800000000001s)]
*  surfers sharing the water with them. This photo was taken at the Cape barely a week ago. Great [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=647.04s)]
*  white sharks very rarely attack people. The one that killed a swimmer named Arthur Medici [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=654.24s)]
*  just off this beach last September was the first fatal attack on Cape Cod since 1936, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=660.72s)]
*  but it triggered a fear of attacks that can hardly be measured. Scary warning signs on every beach [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=667.52s)]
*  stop bleed kits at lifeguard stands. A phone app called Sharktivity that reports sightings in real [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=675.44s)]
*  time with local news doing much the same and community meetings packed with frightened citizens. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=682.72s)]
*  No sharks or seals are worth a young man's life, they're just not. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=691.36s)]
*  You're the scientists but you also live here and you know people are afraid. We can't bury our heads [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=698.08s)]
*  in the sand when it comes to shark attacks and so that's in my face every day now and then it [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=704.5600000000001s)]
*  always falls back on the you know the question of well what do you tell your kids to do you know. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=710.64s)]
*  What do you tell your kids to do? You know I tell my kids don't go out past waste deep. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=716.16s)]
*  That's chilling advice for swimmers, for surfers and for the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce. I mean [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=721.92s)]
*  we basically got to undo everything Jaws did. I mean we got half the people on the eastern seaboard [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=728.56s)]

*  we wouldn't say where we are or even what ocean this is. Suffice to say it involves several [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=936.08s)]
*  airplanes and many thousands of miles. Toward the end of that journey Watson sent this trimaran to [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=942.96s)]

*  So Watson came to the Bardo from a floating hideout that we agreed not to show. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=962.96s)]
*  He is one of the founders of Greenpeace and now at the age of 62 he calls his new armada Sea Shepherd. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=969.92s)]
*  Paul thanks for seeing us. Thank you. The simple fact is this if the oceans die we die. Sea [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=977.92s)]
*  Shepherd was set up to uphold those international laws and regulations protecting our oceans but [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=983.84s)]
*  why is that your job? Countries enforce laws. Why are you doing this? Well I just do not see [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=988.88s)]
*  the political will on the part of these governments to do anything. But that makes you a vigilante. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=995.04s)]
*  You're deciding on your own that you're going to enforce these laws. What gives you the right? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1000.08s)]
*  Because I want to survive and I want to make sure that my children survive and I'm not going to sit [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1004.8s)]

*  will to to uphold these laws. The whaling ban makes an exception for research and the Japanese [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1014.48s)]
*  proclaim that exception in tall letters on their ships. They set their own quotas about 900 minkees, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1021.12s)]
*  50 fin whales and 50 humpbacks. These are minkees and even though the Japanese reserve the right to [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1028.56s)]
*  kill humpbacks they haven't according to the International Whaling Commission. There is no [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1035.92s)]
*  scientific basis for what they're doing. We have seen them take a whale onto the factory vessel. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1041.84s)]
*  There's no scientist there. There's nobody measuring anything. They simply cut them up, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1048.0s)]
*  send them down below and package them. So this is not science. This is bogus. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1051.76s)]
*  The International Court of Justice in The Hague will be deciding whether Japan's whaling is really [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1056.32s)]
*  for research or should be stopped. But while the whaling continues, Sea Shepherd fouls the Japanese [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1061.36s)]
*  plan with rope to catch their propellers. The Japanese fire back with water [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1068.96s)]
*  and ear-splitting sirens. Sea Shepherd throws stink bombs. The Japanese return concussion grenades. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1076.8s)]
*  You called Sea Shepherd, which you founded, the most aggressive no-nonsense conservation [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1085.28s)]
*  organization in the world and you said quote, I don't believe in protests. That is far too [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1091.2s)]
*  submissive. What do you mean? Well protesting is sort of like please, please, please don't do that [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1096.72s)]
*  but they'll do it anyway. They just ignore you. So protest is submissive. We're not a protest [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1101.52s)]
*  organization. We're an interventionist organization. We intervene against illegal activities. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1107.3600000000001s)]
*  But this is what happened recently when Sea Shepherd tried to intervene. The whaler kept [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1112.48s)]
*  coming and sheared the bow off of Watson's two million dollar boat which eventually sank. No [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1117.3600000000001s)]
*  one was seriously hurt. Watson claims he has cut the Japanese catch because of these tactics, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1123.76s)]
*  the same tactics that the Japanese say are illegal. You're in sort of a prison aren't you? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1131.36s)]
*  Well it's a pretty nice prison. It's, you know, I don't mind being on the ocean. It's a beautiful [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1137.68s)]
*  place and certainly the citizens out here tend to be more peaceful. But when people call your [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1143.36s)]
*  tactics violent, how do you respond to that? I mean you look at this footage, it looks violent. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1149.44s)]
*  It's hostile. The Japanese are committing violence against living whales. We are not hurting anybody [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1154.8s)]
*  so we're not violent. This battle is fought in the last place where humpback whales are considered [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1159.6000000000001s)]
*  endangered by the international agency that decides these things. These South Pacific humpbacks feed [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1166.4s)]

*  research is done around a speck on the map called Rarotonga. This volcanic island, part of the Cook [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1179.92s)]
*  Islands, is just 21 miles around with 10,000 residents and not a single traffic light. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1196.56s)]
*  Here we found the human who may know humpbacks best. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1205.28s)]
*  Hello beautiful. He's putting on quite a lovely show for us [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1216.56s)]
*  and you just have to be careful and respect their space. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1221.52s)]
*  They take up a lot of space. Nan Hauser is an American marine biologist who intended to come [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1225.1200000000001s)]
*  to Rarotonga for one month of research but that was 16 years ago. Now her home and her lab are on [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1233.8400000000001s)]
*  the side of the volcano and she spends her days eye to eye with her subjects. As you watch them, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1241.76s)]
*  as you see these massive animals and look at them in the eye and they're looking at you and [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1250.16s)]
*  they've never seen what a human looks like before and so they're curious about you and you're curious [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1255.36s)]
*  about them. Humpbacks are acrobats. Their fins are like wings up to 20 feet long. They cooperate with [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1261.28s)]
*  each other to hunt for the krill and small fish that they eat by the tons. We've learned a lot [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1270.24s)]
*  about them in recent years and some of what we know is because Nan Hauser risked her life [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1276.88s)]
*  to discover it. She's part of an international mission to harpoon humpbacks with small satellite [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1285.2s)]
*  transmitters. That rubber boat feels tiny next to an animal 50 feet long that weighs 79,000 pounds. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1292.0800000000002s)]
*  It's very very dangerous. All they have to do is pick up their tail and give you a good whack [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1306.88s)]
*  and all your bones are broken and your organs are ruptured so it's very scary, very very scary. My [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1313.44s)]
*  heart is pounding. When they surface to breathe the transmitter stuck in their blubber sends a [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1319.2800000000002s)]
*  signal. Now we know that humpbacks can travel 10,000 miles a year. That's the world record for a [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1327.44s)]
*  mammal. 80 percent of their lives are spent submerged and this is where Nan Hauser has made [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1334.8s)]
*  some of her most beautiful discoveries. Here we see a male standing on his head upside down singing [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1342.0s)]
*  a song. They are motionless and the song bellows out. The humpback song can be 20 minutes long and [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1350.8s)]
*  they repeat the same song again and again. Males in one region will all sing the same song the same [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1363.68s)]
*  way but next year they'll return with a new composition. So this is air somehow moving [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1370.96s)]
*  around inside their heads that's making this sound even though they don't have vocal cords. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1379.28s)]
*  Correct it's almost I think like taking a balloon full of air and going [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1384.96s)]
*  The sound carries for miles and Hauser believes it's all to mark their territory. They take turn [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1395.44s)]
*  singing perhaps to say my lungs are bigger I can hold my breath longer I can sing a more beautiful [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1403.3600000000001s)]

*  Can you do some of the sounds that you've heard? I think the most common whale sound is kind of the [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1417.4399999999998s)]
*  but we get everything we've even had the laughing monkey creaky doors [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1425.6s)]
*  Oh [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1431.52s)]
*  What are they saying? We don't know. So you speak whale but you don't understand? Absolutely. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1437.1200000000001s)]
*  But she does understand a calf's jaw-clapping anger. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1448.72s)]
*  Hauser captured it when a mother went off to mate and left this calf behind. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1452.88s)]
*  He does a small jaw clap right here. What does that mean? Oh well now I know it means I'm upset [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1457.6s)]
*  and I'm going to have a little bit of a temper tantrum. You can see him here. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1463.4399999999998s)]
*  He's saying pay attention to me. Exactly. Humpbacks give birth to one calf a year so their [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1468.32s)]
*  comeback has been slow but steady. Before the whaling ban there were maybe 5,000 left in the [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1474.24s)]
*  world but now it's estimated there are 80,000. The biggest threats to them these days are [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1480.96s)]
*  collisions with ships and the kind of miles-long fishing line that wrapped up this whale. They [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1487.6000000000001s)]
*  get wrapped up and then they get held underwater and they need to come up for air otherwise they [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1494.64s)]
*  suffer and they drown. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1502.0s)]
*  Hauser hopes that the satellite tags will mark migration routes so that man can steer clear. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1504.0s)]
*  History may show that we stopped the global slaughter just in the nick of time. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1510.88s)]
*  Humpbacks are now found in every ocean, their numbers back to about 30 percent of what they [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1517.04s)]
*  had been before whaling. It's a sign that a fascinating and beautiful part of the planet [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1523.04s)]
*  is on the mend. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1528.56s)]

*  the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The nodules were discovered more than a century ago. Now [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1587.6s)]
*  new technology has triggered a fierce competition to go get them. These metals are critical for [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1593.84s)]
*  modern life, cell phones, electric cars, and supercomputers. 19 countries including China [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1600.3999999999999s)]
*  and Russia have already jumped into the deep, but the one country on the sidelines? The United States. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1607.4399999999998s)]
*  More on that in a moment, but first we wanted to take a look at this new frontier. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1614.72s)]
*  Our adventure began at three in the morning. Loading up our tugboat, we pulled out of San Diego. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1623.52s)]
*  The harbor lights sank quickly behind us. Ten hours later, we were cutting through the chop of [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1630.16s)]
*  the Pacific with nothing to see but the tossing ocean. So it wasn't hard to spot the Maersk [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1637.36s)]
*  Launcher, a 300-foot mining research vessel that we'd come to join. All we had to do was get on board. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1643.84s)]
*  While the launcher dangled a rope ladder above us, the tugboat backed in. With swells over 10 feet, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1653.28s)]
*  timing was everything. At the top of the wave, we took a leap of faith [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1662.0s)]
*  and landed in the new world of deep sea mining. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1671.28s)]
*  We were traveling with Gerard Barron, the CEO of Canadian company Deep Green Metals. He was eager [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1676.88s)]
*  to catch up with the launcher's crew. They'd been at sea for five weeks on a test run, mapping the [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1683.68s)]
*  sea floor and fishing for nodules. This was the sunken treasure we had come to see. What makes [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1690.0s)]
*  them so valuable? What is in that? Well, that is an electric vehicle battery in a rock. It looks [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1697.2s)]
*  like a lump of charcoal. It does, but it's a beautiful lump of nodule. The amazing thing is [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1704.48s)]
*  it's filled with nickel and cobalt and copper and manganese, and that's everything we need to build [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1711.44s)]
*  a battery. All right, start coming up. To get the nodules, the crew hoists a three-ton rig called [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1718.24s)]
*  a box core over the side. Plunging into the ocean, it begins its three-mile descent to the sea floor. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1726.0s)]
*  Hours later, it neared the bottom. It felt like watching a new lunar landing. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1735.2s)]
*  And there they were, giant fields of nodules covering an alien landscape. Millions of years [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1741.44s)]
*  old, the nodules grow by absorbing metals from the seawater, expanding slowly around a core of [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1748.3999999999999s)]
*  shell, bone or rock. The potential is staggering. Estimates of their worth run from eight to more [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1754.8799999999999s)]
*  than $16 trillion. They are primarily found in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, or CCZ, about two [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1762.88s)]
*  million square miles of ocean between Hawaii and Mexico. On this research trip, Deep Green scooped [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1768.8s)]
*  up over 100 helpings of the seafloor, each box reeled back on board heavy with the catch of the [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1776.96s)]
*  day, thousands of nodules. The nodules are so big, they're so small, they're so small, they're so [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1783.84s)]
*  thousands of nodules. In 30 years as a geologist, Warwick Miller told us he'd never seen anything [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1790.88s)]
*  like it. It was a great day to be a geologist. What did you mean? We were standing by the box [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1798.72s)]
*  core. I remember holding my hand up, it was covered in mud. It's nice that I get to touch him, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1805.84s)]
*  you know, it's better than looking at him in a glass case, for example. There are all sizes, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1810.32s)]
*  all different sizes like this? There's different types. The type you're holding there would be [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1815.6000000000001s)]
*  a type three nodule, which is larger and it's got a characteristic sort of cauliflower texture to it. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1820.32s)]
*  Miller told us each nodule has the same proportion of metals. After they're weighed and measured, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1827.04s)]
*  they're stored in a refrigerated container. They will be further analyzed on shore to help Deep [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1833.76s)]
*  Green figure out where to mine first. They hope to start in three years. There's that many of them [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1839.84s)]
*  down there. Exactly. If they found deposit with this much metal concentration on land, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1846.32s)]
*  it would be a bonanza that nobody would stop talking about for years. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1851.36s)]
*  The rules for deep sea mining are set by an obscure UN agency called the International [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1856.32s)]
*  Seabed Authority. It's already divided the CCZ into dozens of concessions. Deep Green operates [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1862.72s)]
*  two. The company calculates the nickel and cobalt in their patch of ocean alone [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1870.88s)]
*  is enough to make batteries for 150 million electric cars. I love the fact that they're [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1876.5600000000002s)]
*  the way we're going to get away from fossil fuels. I love the fact that in these are all the metals [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1883.2s)]
*  we need to go and build those batteries. I mean, it's the most amazing coincidence that I've ever [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1889.92s)]
*  encountered. Mother Nature made these nodules. They're just sitting there. It's like, okay, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1896.56s)]
*  you guys, you've messed up planet Earth. Come and get me. So you call yourself an environmentalist. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1901.28s)]
*  You're also a miner. How do you combine the two? Well, you know, I don't call myself a miner, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1907.2s)]
*  but we are collecting nodules off the ocean floor. So if you're not a miner, what do you call what [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1913.04s)]
*  you will be doing? Well, we call it harvesting. Harvesting. Harvesting nodules from the ocean [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1918.8s)]
*  floor. Unlike on land, there's no drilling or digging. Instead, enormous deep sea robots will [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1923.76s)]
*  do the heavy lifting. To see one of the most advanced, we traveled to Antwerp, Belgium. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1931.84s)]
*  In a country better known for beer and chocolate, we met Patania. It's a caterpillar. It's a [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1938.56s)]
*  caterpillar track. So we said, what is the fastest caterpillar on earth? And it's called the Patania [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1944.16s)]
*  ruralis. Chris Van Nea, the managing director of Global Sea Mineral Resources, or GSR, told us [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1949.52s)]
*  Patania costs $12 million. It's what you might expect if you crossed a bulldozer with a giant [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1957.36s)]
*  vacuum cleaner and then stuffed it with electronics. The nodules are sucked into a stream and they go [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1964.32s)]
*  into the system. It's got the capacity to store three tons of nodules. Three tons. Three tons of [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1970.48s)]
*  nodules. How many nodules are down there? It is estimated that there is more nickel, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1976.24s)]
*  more cobalt, and more manganese than on the rest of the planet. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1981.2s)]
*  In 2017, GSR was the first to put a robot on the sea floor. Last summer, expectations were high for [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1985.1200000000001s)]
*  Patania's second plunge into the Pacific. A specially built frame swung the 35-ton machine [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=1994.0s)]
*  over the edge of the ship, a fiber optic umbilical cord unspooling as it sank from site. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2001.44s)]
*  But then something went wrong. The crew lost the signal to Patania. The test was called off. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2008.64s)]
*  Was that a big setback? A very big setback. You have said that the deep sea has no mercy. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2015.92s)]
*  Is this what you mean? That's exactly what we mean. It has no mercy. It has to be [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2022.64s)]
*  1000 percent perfect or it won't work. GSR hopes to take Patania back to the [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2026.56s)]
*  Clarion-Clipperton zone soon. When mining begins, Van Nea told us, the nodules will be pumped to the [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2032.8s)]
*  surface to a waiting ship before they are processed on shore. With supplies of some [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2039.9199999999998s)]
*  critical metals running low, the race to develop underwater crawlers like this one led by a Dutch [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2046.48s)]
*  group is in high gear. But some scientists fear that deep sea mining will wreck the sea floor, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2052.72s)]
*  a world not fully understood. This rare albino octopus nicknamed Casper, a species only [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2059.8399999999997s)]
*  discovered three years ago. When we go out and collect a sample on the sea floor, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2067.6s)]
*  we collect hundreds of new species. Things that you've never seen before. Sure, oh yeah. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2072.7999999999997s)]
*  Craig Smith is an oceanographer at the University of Hawaii. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2078.56s)]
*  He told us he was surprised at how much life could survive three miles deep. His expeditions [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2082.96s)]
*  to the CCZ have turned up fantastical creatures like this squid worm or a fluorescent sea cucumber [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2089.9199999999996s)]
*  dubbed a gummy squirrel. There are other deep sea originals too. A foot long shrimp, a ping pong tree [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2098.3199999999997s)]
*  sponge and a galloping sea urchin. Mining companies say that the CCZ is only about one percent of the [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2106.8s)]
*  ocean. That the ocean is so vast that it could absorb the activity in that small portion of the ocean. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2116.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that's a little bit like saying the Amazon rainforest is only eight percent of the global [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2122.96s)]
*  land area. So we can wipe it out and it doesn't matter. Won't deep sea mining actually be less [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2128.0s)]
*  invasive, have less of an impact than mining on land? I would say no. Mining is mining. I think [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2135.36s)]
*  it's similar to strip mining on land and it'll take a really long time for things to recover. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2142.8s)]
*  Smith is working with the United Nations Seabed Authority which set aside nine protected areas [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2150.2400000000002s)]
*  that will be off limits to miners and Chris Van Nea has invited independent scientists to monitor [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2156.7200000000003s)]
*  GSR's work. If you find that the environmental impact is severe, would this stop the project? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2163.76s)]
*  Absolutely. I don't think we're not into this project to come up with a means to produce metals [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2172.6400000000003s)]
*  worse than what is being done today. We're in it because we believe it can be done better. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2178.48s)]
*  So far 19 different countries have licenses in the Clarion-Clipperton zone. China has more than [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2183.6800000000003s)]
*  anyone else. Russia and Japan have also jumped in. So has France, Germany, Korea, even Cuba and [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2190.24s)]
*  Tonga have stakes. Who's missing? The United States. It's not for lack of trying. The UN's law of the [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2198.56s)]
*  sea covers deep sea mining and in 1994 President Bill Clinton signed the treaty but it was dead on [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2207.44s)]
*  arrival in the Senate despite repeated attempts to ratify it including this past July. Is that [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2215.36s)]
*  doing us harm? Absolutely. We don't have a seat at that table. Jonathan White is a retired rear [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2222.56s)]
*  admiral who now runs a non-profit to protect oceans. He told us that being outside the treaty [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2228.1600000000003s)]
*  means the U.S. has no say in how this new gold rush is being run. It's a law and if we're not [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2235.92s)]
*  going to be part of that lawful system doesn't it make us sort of outlaws of the sea? With the U.S. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2243.28s)]
*  on the sidelines China has poured hundreds of millions into its deep sea ambitions. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2249.76s)]
*  Last month China unveiled its new weapons that included an underwater drone that will patrol [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2258.1600000000003s)]
*  the ocean. If you're in the military a weapon system the guidance of our weapons, x-ray machines, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2265.2000000000003s)]
*  microwaves they all rely on elements that are hard to come by. So China controls most of these [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2270.96s)]
*  elements from terrestrial sources? Yes. And now they're going after the lion's share of the sea [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2276.48s)]
*  bed sources? They certainly are. Does that concern you? It absolutely concerns me. It concerns me [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2283.12s)]
*  with relation to our national security going forward. We need to be in this game. My problem [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2290.88s)]
*  is with sovereignty. So we called the 22 senators opposed to the treaty, all republicans, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2297.12s)]
*  to ask why. None would appear on camera. Those who wrote us said that ceding any control to the [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2303.3599999999997s)]

*  of the sea it will soon be too late. And if we don't what does that mean for us? I think it means [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2318.4s)]
*  that again we become more isolated especially in terms of a growing global economy. And more [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2326.8s)]
*  dependent on China? And absolutely more dependent on China. So what sense does that make? It makes [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2332.48s)]
*  no sense. The country that made it to the moon first may now miss the race to this new frontier [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2337.6800000000003s)]

*  Plastic is everywhere. It's not unusual to see water bottles or grocery bags wash up on our [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2363.36s)]
*  beaches. But surely if you traveled far enough away from people and cities you might be able [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2369.76s)]
*  to find a pristine beach untouched by the plague of plastic, right? Well we decided to find out. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2375.44s)]
*  This summer we traveled to Midway Atoll, a small group of islands midway between the U.S. and Asia. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2382.6400000000003s)]
*  It's an American territory best known as the site of one of the most important battles of World War II. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2389.36s)]
*  Today the islands are closed to the public and home to a host of exotic animals including a [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2395.6s)]
*  charismatic seabird called the Laysan albatross. It's not easy to get to Midway. Visiting involves [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2402.0s)]
*  a long permitting process in a chartered plane from Honolulu to the middle of the ocean. We're [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2411.36s)]
*  almost midway to midway right now from Oahu. After three hours tiny slivers of light appear, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2417.28s)]
*  a postage stamp in the vast Pacific. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2424.48s)]
*  As soon as we landed it felt like we'd tumbled down the rabbit hole into a curious wonderland. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2426.8s)]
*  There are so many birds on the atoll we could only get here after dark once they'd settled down for [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2435.84s)]
*  the night. As we made our way inland the albatross chicks were oblivious to our caravan. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2441.44s)]
*  But by daybreak it seemed like we'd found paradise, a tiny atoll surrounded by turquoise waters. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2447.8399999999997s)]

*  beaches and of course the birds. So many birds, over a million flapping, snapping, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2461.6s)]
*  chattering, Laysan albatross, the largest colony anywhere in the world. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2470.0s)]
*  They just don't get out of the way. Some are friendlier than others just like people. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2477.52s)]
*  Amanda Boyd works with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service which oversees Midway. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2484.4s)]
*  Every day its beaches are the scene of small life and small life. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2490.88s)]
*  Once they're off the albatross can spend months at sea venturing thousands of miles [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2494.24s)]
*  but returning to the same spot and the same partner. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2498.56s)]
*  A relationship that begins with more preening and chest pumping than other animals. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2505.6s)]
*  The albatross is a species of fish that lives in the wild and is known for its [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2511.2s)]
*  partner. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2515.44s)]
*  A relationship that begins with more preening and chest pumping than a Miami nightclub. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2519.76s)]
*  Oh my gosh to watch them dance and as they're courtshipping. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2528.64s)]
*  When you find a pair that has actually been together and they're in sync it's mesmerizing. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2535.84s)]
*  They know each other's cues and it's just it's like art. It's beautiful. It's inspiring to watch that. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2541.12s)]
*  Inspiring and loud. Honking lovers who are mostly ignored by their neighbors. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2548.7999999999997s)]
*  If any place should be unspoiled it's Midway. The atoll is blissfully isolated off limits to [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2559.84s)]
*  the public and protected as part of one of the largest marine reserves in the world. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2566.56s)]
*  Geez. So it was disturbing to see this. What are those orange and yellow things? Harbor booms. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2572.4s)]
*  Kevin O'Brien oversees marine debris removal in the region for the National Oceanographic [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2580.32s)]
*  and Atmospheric Administration. Hundreds of tons of plastic have been retrieved from Midway in the [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2586.24s)]
*  last two decades. He showed us this year's pile, a veritable department store of discarded debris. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2592.0s)]
*  Here an intact CRTV screen. A whole screen. Yeah. Oh look at this. So you've got enough things you [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2599.92s)]
*  can sort it I guess. Toothbrushes. We find an incredible amount of toothbrushes. Tires. Tires. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2607.04s)]
*  These can be dangerous because the young monk seals often will get curious and stick their snout [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2614.32s)]
*  into these eel cones. Sometimes we'll find jugs full of chemicals with the lids still on [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2619.12s)]
*  which we have to treat pretty carefully because we're never sure what what's in it. You know the [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2625.68s)]
*  label's gone and we've found car bumpers, motorcycle helmets, fireman's helmets, golf clubs, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2629.2799999999997s)]
*  bowling balls. All this trash ends up here because Midway sits at the edge of the Great Pacific [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2637.04s)]
*  Garbage Patch, a vast ocean whirlpool that draws in plastic from coastlines around the world. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2643.52s)]
*  Kevin O'Brien has been coming to Midway for a decade to survey and retrieve the debris. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2650.72s)]
*  This is some of what he hauled away last month. These nets are almost always made of some sort [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2658.16s)]
*  of plastic. Once they've been weathered in the environment they can become very brittle. Whoa. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2663.84s)]
*  And can easily break down into micro plastics. So this looks like it's breaking apart [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2669.6s)]
*  and going away. Right. But it's not. But it's not. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2676.64s)]
*  Long before plastics invaded Midway, U.S. forces repelled a Japanese assault in the Second World War. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2686.3999999999996s)]
*  The Japanese had hoped to use the islands as a bridge to the mainland. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2693.52s)]
*  The American victory there in 1942 was a turning point. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2698.6400000000003s)]
*  Today there's a monument to the Americans who died in the Battle of Midway. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2705.6s)]
*  And if you tour the islands you find relics everywhere. Decaying artillery, derelict hangars, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2712.48s)]
*  and beneath the water the rusting skeletons of old warships. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2718.72s)]
*  And of course evidence of the new battle underway here. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2724.0s)]
*  We've been cleaning it up for years. And it keeps coming. And it keeps coming. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2728.3199999999997s)]
*  On a walk along one of the beaches we found a shoreline strewn with bottles and buoys, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2731.68s)]
*  crates and canisters. Is this a problem that's unique to these islands? It's really not. There [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2736.9599999999996s)]
*  are beaches like this all over the world. And it's a very unique experience. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2742.9599999999996s)]
*  There are beaches like this all over the world. What is unique about Midway is that none of this [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2747.04s)]
*  plastic you see on the beaches here originates here. It's a problem that doesn't know borders. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2752.08s)]
*  I think a lot of people see this on their beaches and it kind of looks like sea glass at first. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2757.04s)]
*  Yeah it looks like a mosaic. It's really colorful. Actually kind of beautiful. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2761.6s)]
*  Yeah. But what is it really? But a lot of this is really plastics, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2764.7200000000003s)]
*  you know. And we can sift it here and see what we come up with. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2770.4s)]
*  Look at that. Sure. This is a bottle cap you can see. And what's the harm with this? Are fish eating this? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2773.2s)]
*  Yeah. The smaller the piece of plastic, the smaller the animal that can consume it. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2782.64s)]
*  Do we know that they definitely have effects on fish? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2786.72s)]
*  We don't know that for certain. These plastics become a magnet essentially for toxic chemicals [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2790.16s)]
*  that are found in the environment. PCBs, pesticides, fire retardant chemicals. And [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2795.2799999999997s)]
*  so the longer a piece of plastic stays in the environment, the more toxic it becomes. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2801.36s)]
*  Studies have found these microplastics in everything from supermarket seafood to drinking water. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2806.4s)]
*  But scientists don't yet know what all that means for our health. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2812.6400000000003s)]
*  When an adult comes in, they'll make a couple of noises saying, hey, I'm back. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2817.1200000000003s)]
*  But the effects on birds are easier to see. Kelly Gooddale, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologist, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2821.52s)]
*  took us on a ride around Midway to show us the impact all this plastic is having on them. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2828.56s)]
*  So the adults have been coming back every few days to a couple of weeks to feed them. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2835.36s)]
*  What's happening right now? It's regurgitating up more food. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2840.08s)]
*  Dinner time here might make you lose your appetite. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2844.24s)]
*  Oh, did you see that squid? That was a whole squid. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2847.6s)]
*  Yeah. That ought to keep you happy for a while. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2851.84s)]
*  For all the fish and squid they catch, the albatross bring back plastic, too, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2854.96s)]
*  from that great Pacific garbage patch. Gooddale showed us their nesting grounds. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2861.6800000000003s)]
*  So here we do have a chick that did die. And as you can see, if you want to take a look at it. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2867.12s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. In here, you see there are so many pieces of plastic. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2874.0s)]
*  Oh, plastic bag. And they eat the plastic bags. Why? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2880.88s)]
*  You know, these can look like food sources. It could look like a squid to them. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2886.56s)]
*  Yeah. So they think this is food? [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2890.64s)]
*  They do think it's food. And you know, flying fish, they can lay eggs on floating debris. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2892.56s)]
*  And so they will absolutely lay eggs on pieces of floating plastic. So if the adults are out there [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2897.6800000000003s)]
*  foraging, they pick up those eggs as well as pieces of plastic in there. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2903.84s)]
*  So it's the serving dish for the egg? Yes. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2908.32s)]
*  And of the birds that you end up looking at and dissecting, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2911.1200000000003s)]
*  what percentage of them have plastics in them? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2916.0800000000004s)]
*  Every single bird has plastic in it. Every bird. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2918.88s)]
*  Yes. U.S. fish and wildlife scientists estimate the birds carry five tons of plastic back to [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2921.2000000000003s)]
*  midway in their stomach every year. Some of it Kelly Gooddale collects in catalogs. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2928.4s)]
*  A comb. This one is probably one of the most disturbing ones. This was... [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2935.12s)]
*  Oh my goodness. You have bottle caps in here. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2941.92s)]
*  This looks like trash from a drug store. It pretty much is. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2944.8s)]
*  Okay. All of this was inside one bird. Yes. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2949.12s)]
*  Parts of this atoll can look like the site of a disaster. And while Gooddale says it's [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2952.72s)]
*  impossible to pinpoint the cause of death in every case, there's no question plastic can be [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2957.84s)]
*  fatal to these birds. Either by filling up their stomachs and leaving little room for food, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2964.6400000000003s)]
*  or by tearing up their insides. As these photos from Fish and Wildlife show, that plastic, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2970.8s)]
*  which scientists say can take hundreds of years to decompose, is often the only thing left after [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2977.76s)]
*  the birds have gone. Everyone, no matter where you live, has a role in this problem. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2984.64s)]
*  Even someone in South Dakota, for instance, who has a river near their home and doesn't dispose [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2991.7599999999998s)]
*  of their plastic bottle appropriately, might be contributing to this problem. All the way out here. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=2998.4s)]
*  All waterways lead to the ocean. And once this stuff gets into the ocean, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=3003.04s)]
*  the ocean currents can take it anywhere. Anywhere and everywhere, it's hard to find [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=3007.3599999999997s)]
*  a place not plagued by plastic. Just then, we got a reminder of what else is at stake [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=3014.32s)]
*  as an endangered monk seal paddled by. What's this guy doing, you think? Is he coming in to eat? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=3020.32s)]
*  He's coming in. He's checking it out. These are the locals. And whether or not you care about all [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=3026.0800000000004s)]
*  these incredible species that live up here in this very remote place, it doesn't necessarily [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=3031.04s)]
*  matter because there are so many other things that rely on the ocean. People rely on the ocean for [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=3036.48s)]
*  their livelihood. Fishermen. People rely on the ocean for recreation, tourism. And right here, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=3041.6s)]
*  we have an indicator of the health of our ocean. You say this is an indicator. What does it tell [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=3047.36s)]
*  you? It tells us that the scale of the problem is massive and is global. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ux54z_zAU&t=3051.68s)]
