# Recreating Dinosaurs; Photographing Wildlife; Up Close With Lions | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [July 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg)
*  There's something about dinosaurs that captures the imagination. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=0.0s)]
*  Giant mysterious animals that roamed the earth for millions of years, now gone forever. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=18.02s)]
*  All they've left us are their fossils, the dried out mineral remnants of the creatures [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=23.72s)]
*  they once were, with the organic material that gave them life long gone. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=28.42s)]
*  Or so everyone always thought, until B. Rex, a 68 million year old Tyrannosaurus Rex who [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=33.940000000000005s)]
*  was dug up and named by a paleontologist from Montana State University, whose unorthodox [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=41.94s)]
*  approach to dinosaurs may be changing the whole dino ball game. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=48.14s)]
*  Think dinosaur and most of us think this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=56.14s)]
*  The 1993 classic film Jurassic Park with its dinosaur resurrection experiment gone wrong [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=59.82s)]
*  and its embattled hero famed paleontologist Alan Grant. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=66.94s)]
*  You consulted on that movie. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=71.74s)]
*  I did consult on all those movies. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=72.74000000000001s)]
*  And they said the guy Alan Grant was you. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=74.46000000000001s)]
*  Yes, well fortunately he didn't get eaten. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=77.34s)]
*  Meet Jack Horner, the real life Alan Grant. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=81.42s)]
*  He's one of the most prominent and controversial paleontologists in the country, a dyslexic [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=85.22000000000001s)]
*  MacArthur Foundation genius who never finished college and who says he doesn't care why dinosaurs [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=90.9s)]
*  went extinct. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=97.10000000000001s)]
*  To him the important part is how they lived. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=98.58000000000001s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out the biology of dinosaurs and what they were like as living creatures. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=101.82000000000001s)]
*  You want to know what their behavior was, how they treated their young. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=107.26s)]
*  I want to know everything we can know about them and make one if we can. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=111.1s)]
*  Make a dinosaur? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=117.46s)]
*  The things Jack Horner says make him a maverick, but the finds he's made, including more T-Rexes [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=119.14s)]
*  than anyone else in the world, make him a legend. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=125.32s)]
*  So you can tell me what these are. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=128.14s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=130.7s)]
*  Are these teeth? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=133.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=134.6s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=135.6s)]
*  Not just any teeth, the teeth of the oldest T-Rex ever found. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=136.76s)]
*  This little pocket right here in the teeth is where the next tooth sits. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=142.0s)]
*  Dinosaurs replace their teeth throughout their life and T-Rex replace it all of their teeth [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=146.4s)]
*  every year. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  Here you can see the jaw. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  But Horner is most famous for discovering a kinder, gentler side of dinosaurs. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=155.4s)]
*  You like that? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=160.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=161.76s)]
*  In the mountains of Montana, he and his team uncovered the first dinosaur nesting ground [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=162.84s)]
*  in the world, a vast landscape of eggs, nests and babies that helped change our image of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=167.28s)]
*  dinosaurs. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  Thanks to Horner's influence, Jurassic Park showed that most dinosaurs were social animals [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  who lived in colonies and he's found evidence they actually cared for their young. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=181.28s)]
*  This is the tibia, the shin bone. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=186.2s)]
*  And this is a little less than a month old. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=188.48s)]
*  And here, here is the same bone. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=192.44s)]
*  Of an adult? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  Of a one year old. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=199.44s)]
*  A one year old. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=200.52s)]
*  Horner figured out that such rapidly growing baby dinosaurs couldn't walk at first, meaning [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=202.48s)]
*  that their parents were bringing food back to them in the nest, like birds. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=208.32s)]
*  His discoveries lent support to a then controversial, but now widely accepted theory that dinosaurs [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=213.8s)]
*  actually gave rise to modern birds. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=220.68s)]
*  If a little kid today studies all this in school and they look up in the sky and see [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=226.0s)]
*  a bird turn to mom and say, you know, that's a dinosaur. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  They're right. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  They're right. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  They're right. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  Jack Horner told us that birds are dinosaurs. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=242.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=243.0s)]
*  Sean Carroll is a professor of molecular biology and genetics at the University of Wisconsin. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=244.0s)]
*  So really dinosaurs never went extinct. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=249.56s)]
*  Dinosaurs never went extinct, but we all think they did. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  And it was an asteroid event that took out a lot of life on earth, including T. rex and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=254.84s)]
*  all the most famous dinosaurs. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=259.56s)]
*  But this other group, what we call birds, made it through. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=261.24s)]
*  And of course there's thousands of species of birds still around today. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=265.8s)]
*  The dinosaur bird connection is largely settled now, but that hasn't stopped Horner from using [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=269.46s)]
*  unusual means to make unusual discoveries. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=275.1s)]
*  He's found the perfect partner in his protege, Mary Schweitzer, a professor at North Carolina [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=279.08s)]
*  State University who studies the internal makeup of ancient bone. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=284.36s)]
*  She let us in on the paleontologist trick for telling dinosaur bone from rock. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=289.52s)]
*  You don't just look at it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=295.7s)]
*  Touch your tongue to that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=297.52s)]
*  She actually wanted me to lick it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=299.18s)]
*  It's supposed to stick like Velcro. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=301.64s)]
*  Oh, it did. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=303.48s)]
*  That's bone. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=306.76s)]
*  That's how you can tell. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=307.94s)]
*  Yeah, because the bone is filled with little capillaries. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=309.14s)]
*  And when you put your tongue on it, the moisture from your tongue sucks up the capillaries. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=313.14s)]
*  This is 80 million years old and it can do that? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=317.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=319.9s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=320.9s)]
*  Rocks don't do that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=321.9s)]
*  The tricky thing about Schweitzer's work is that she needs to get her hands on the insides [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=322.9s)]
*  of dinosaur bones, which means literally breaking the bones apart and sometimes dissolving pieces [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=327.5s)]
*  of them in acid. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=333.7s)]
*  Most paleontologists won't let her near their precious finds. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=335.54s)]
*  Jack is the only paleontologist out there who lets me dissolve his dinosaurs. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=339.38s)]
*  Dissolve his dinosaurs? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=344.14000000000004s)]
*  You mean ruin them? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=345.14000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=346.14000000000004s)]
*  Isn't that considered a little sacrilegious to take one of these precious artifacts, fossils [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=347.14000000000004s)]
*  that have been in the ground for 68 million years and crack it in half? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=351.76s)]
*  We found the first dinosaur embryos, the first babies inside of eggs. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=357.98s)]
*  And that was just from breaking eggs open and looking inside. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=362.74s)]
*  I mean, people had always thought that eggs were so precious, they didn't want to break [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=365.58s)]
*  them and look inside. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=369.58s)]
*  And yet, they're like presents. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=371.18s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's like having a Christmas present and never unwrapping it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=373.38s)]
*  Did you ever, though, have a moment where it was kind of heartbreaking? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=377.22s)]
*  No. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=381.98s)]
*  I'm destroying, never. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=382.98s)]
*  No. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=383.98s)]
*  Glue is cheap. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=384.98s)]
*  Horner's practice of breaking dinosaur bones apart and sending the insides to Mary Schweitzer [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=385.98s)]
*  has landed the two of them at the center of one of the biggest controversies paleontology [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=391.38000000000005s)]
*  has seen in years. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=396.18s)]
*  It started back in 2000 with a series of coincidences. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=398.18s)]
*  A member of Jack's team, Bob Harmon, wandered away from a dig site one day to eat lunch [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=402.98s)]
*  and noticed a small piece of bone sticking out of the side of a 50-foot cliff. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=409.20000000000005s)]
*  I could tell pretty much what it was from where I was sitting that it was a T-Rex metatarsal. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=414.18s)]
*  How was it sticking out? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=419.38000000000005s)]
*  I mean, it was a side. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=420.54s)]
*  Here's a cliff. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=421.54s)]
*  It was like a little jutting out. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=422.54s)]
*  Yep, exactly. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=424.21999999999997s)]
*  He got a folding chair and he stacked it on these rocks right there. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=425.21999999999997s)]
*  And you can see that this is on the sheer side hill of a cliff. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=429.34s)]
*  This is not possible. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=432.74s)]
*  Is he attached to anything? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=433.74s)]
*  No, he's not. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=435.74s)]
*  That's Bob. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=436.74s)]
*  Jack named the T-Rex, B-Rex, in Bob's honor and made the decision to dig it out. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=438.34s)]
*  But this was under 50 feet of rock. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=444.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, this was in a terrible place. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=446.38s)]
*  There was no road to it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=448.5s)]
*  There was no access to it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=449.62s)]
*  And so for the next three summers, we sent out climbing crews, people that could repel [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=451.86s)]
*  down cliffs with jackhammers. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=456.78s)]
*  I mean, it was a horrendous undertaking. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=458.78s)]
*  The site was so remote that bones had to be lifted out by helicopter. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=461.2s)]
*  But the giant cast containing B-Rex's thigh bones was too heavy. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=466.4s)]
*  The chopper couldn't get it off the ground. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=471.08s)]
*  So after all that excavating, Jack gave the order to cut one of B-Rex's femurs in two. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=473.92s)]
*  Now that was heartbreaking. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=480.48s)]
*  No, not really. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=481.48s)]
*  I mean, you get a chance to see inside. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=482.48s)]
*  He shipped the bone fragments that fell out to Mary Schweitzer. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=487.5s)]
*  So the first piece I pulled out, I picked it up and I looked at it and I said, it's [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=491.58000000000004s)]
*  a girl and it's pregnant. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=496.46000000000004s)]
*  That's the first time, as I understand it, that anyone had ever been able to identify [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=498.84s)]
*  gender in any dinosaur. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=503.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=505.96s)]
*  Mary recognized a specific type of bone called medullary bone, which female birds produce [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=506.96s)]
*  when they're about to lay eggs. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=513.3399999999999s)]
*  No one had ever found it before in a dinosaur. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=515.86s)]
*  It was yet another link to birds. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=518.9599999999999s)]
*  And it meant that B-Rex was definitely no Bob. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=521.4s)]
*  So she calls you up and she says... [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=525.66s)]
*  She calls up and says, we have medullary bone. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=527.08s)]
*  Oh, now this had to be thrilling. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=529.76s)]
*  Yes, very exciting. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=531.8000000000001s)]
*  And that wasn't all. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=534.1600000000001s)]
*  What happened next happened by mistake. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=535.88s)]
*  Mary put some fragments of the bone in acid to dissolve away the outermost layer of mineral. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=538.72s)]
*  But the acid worked too fast and all the mineral dissolved away. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=544.7s)]
*  Being a fossil, there should have been nothing left. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  But there was. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=553.12s)]
*  And it was elastic, like living tissue. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=554.6s)]
*  This is the piece. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=558.0600000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=559.24s)]
*  She showed us video she took under the microscope. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=560.32s)]
*  That's really what happened? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=563.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=564.36s)]
*  That's the dinosaur bone? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=565.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=566.36s)]
*  Without mineral now. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=567.36s)]
*  That's what was left. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=568.36s)]
*  It looked like the soft tissue she would have expected to find if it had been modern bone. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=569.48s)]
*  This was impossible. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=575.3s)]
*  This bone was 68 million years old. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=577.0s)]
*  So you see this and you think what? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=579.8s)]
*  You say... [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=584.24s)]
*  I didn't want to tell anybody. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=585.24s)]
*  You'd be ridiculed, right? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=586.24s)]
*  And so I said to my technician, okay, do it again. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=588.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=591.64s)]
*  And yet in sample after sample, they were there. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=592.8s)]
*  Things that look suspiciously like flexible, transparent blood vessels. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=596.4399999999999s)]
*  She finally mustered the courage to tell Jack. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=601.54s)]
*  She said she dissolved the bone away and there were blood vessels. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=604.78s)]
*  I was like shocked. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=608.1999999999999s)]
*  How could that be? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=610.4s)]
*  How could that be? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=611.4s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=612.4s)]
*  The things Mary was finding inside dinosaur bones... [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=613.4s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=616.28s)]
*  Blood vessels and even what seemed to be intact cells pose a radical challenge to the existing [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=617.6s)]
*  rules of science. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=623.96s)]
*  That organic material can't possibly survive even a million years, let alone 68 million. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=625.8s)]
*  Mary, Jack and their team published their B-Rex findings in a series of papers in the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=633.24s)]
*  journal Science and were promptly attacked. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=637.84s)]
*  Critics said their samples might have been contaminated or that the supposed blood vessels [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=641.96s)]
*  were actually something called biofilm, a type of slime. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=647.08s)]
*  But as Mary showed us, she's been able to replicate her findings. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=652.04s)]
*  These are pieces of an even older dinosaur, a well-preserved 80 million year old duck [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=656.72s)]
*  bill. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=662.08s)]
*  When she dissolved it away in acid... [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=663.08s)]
*  Let's put this under the scope here. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=666.12s)]
*  Well look. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=667.6800000000001s)]
*  Is that a blood vessel? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=668.6800000000001s)]
*  This is a blood vessel. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=669.6800000000001s)]
*  You see the branches right there? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=670.6800000000001s)]
*  And look at all of them. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=672.6s)]
*  And it's so consistent over and over and over again. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=673.6s)]
*  We do this bone and it comes out and I get excited every time. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=676.6s)]
*  I can't help it. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=679.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, 80 million years old. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=680.9200000000001s)]
*  Mary published her new results last spring and while some of her critics have been swayed, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=683.32s)]
*  the controversy still rages. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=688.56s)]
*  And the stakes are high. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=691.04s)]
*  If blood vessels can survive 80 million years, what about DNA? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=692.8199999999999s)]
*  Jack Horner is looking. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=698.28s)]
*  His crews are now wearing surgical gloves, unheard of in the world of paleontology, where [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=700.5s)]
*  no one used to worry about getting skin cells, sweat, even an occasional spilled beer on [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=705.88s)]
*  fossils. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=711.92s)]
*  Jack is skeptical that the full dinosaur DNA sequence will ever be found. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=713.16s)]
*  But that hasn't stopped him. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=718.3399999999999s)]
*  He's come up with a whole new idea for his dream of making a dinosaur. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=720.1999999999999s)]
*  The best way is just to use a modern dinosaur. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=725.1999999999999s)]
*  The chicken. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=729.16s)]
*  Because evolution works, birds are actually carrying ancestral DNA. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=731.86s)]
*  Horner has written a new book proposing a plan to mine that ancestral DNA as a way to [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=737.6s)]
*  reverse engineer a chicken into what he calls a dino chicken. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=743.4200000000001s)]
*  It may seem improbable that this is carrying DNA from something like this. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=748.82s)]
*  But when you think about it, birds, like the dinosaurs they evolved from, still walk on [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=754.96s)]
*  hind legs. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=760.2s)]
*  Most have three toes pointing forward with one in the back. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=761.8000000000001s)]
*  And they even all have wishbones. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=765.64s)]
*  As for dinosaur features you don't see in modern chickens, like long tails, Horner's [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=768.3s)]
*  contention is they can be brought back since you can still see them in embryos as little [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=773.88s)]
*  chicks grow. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=779.96s)]
*  As the chicken embryo develops, it does develop a fairly long tail before a gene kicks on [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=781.36s)]
*  and destroys it. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=789.0s)]
*  So if we can stop that gene, we theoretically can get a chicken to hatch out with a relatively [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=790.8s)]
*  long tail. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=797.3199999999999s)]
*  So you're not saying actually change the gene. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=798.3199999999999s)]
*  Switching a gene on or switching a gene off. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=801.8399999999999s)]
*  He says picture a chicken with a long tail, teeth, and little claw-like hands instead [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=804.68s)]
*  of wings. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=810.42s)]
*  So maybe there will be a dino chicken. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=811.56s)]
*  I'm sure there will be a dino chicken. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=813.76s)]
*  You're sure there will be a dino chicken? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=815.7199999999999s)]
*  I think we'll be able to make a dino chicken within the next five years. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=817.48s)]
*  Boy, I see a new movie coming out of this. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=821.32s)]
*  This time I could get eaten. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=825.88s)]
*  Tonight we're going to take you into the wild with a remarkable photographer who spent his [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=839.96s)]
*  life on the trail of elusive and endangered animals. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=844.56s)]
*  His name is Tom Mangelson, and at 72 he still travels to remote and inhospitable places. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=848.3199999999999s)]
*  What he brings back are some of the most spectacular pictures of wild animals you'll ever see. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=854.76s)]
*  On most mornings for nearly 50 years, this is what Tom Mangelson has done. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=861.7199999999999s)]
*  He's ventured into the wilderness, camera in hand. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=866.54s)]
*  Last September in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, he waited in an early autumn snowfall [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=870.52s)]
*  for his subject to appear. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=876.16s)]
*  As is often the case, it took quite a while. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=879.52s)]
*  Over the course of your lifetime, the amount of time you've spent waiting is incalculable, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=883.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=886.56s)]
*  Stupid. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=887.56s)]
*  Stupid? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=888.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=889.56s)]
*  Have you learned anything with all that waiting? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=890.56s)]
*  You wait long enough, it does pay off. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=892.68s)]
*  For Mangelson, it usually does. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=894.52s)]
*  Whether it's a male grizzly bear with battle scars, a cheetah chasing down its prey in [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=897.52s)]
*  Tanzania, or butterflies sipping on the tears of a giant caiman in Brazil, each of Mangelson's [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=902.1999999999999s)]
*  photographs tells a story. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=908.72s)]
*  His images have documented species like mountain gorillas, black rhinos, and jaguars, once [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=911.4399999999999s)]
*  dominant, now in danger. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=917.64s)]
*  On every continent, in every season, no matter the conditions, Mangelson has painstakingly [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=920.76s)]
*  built a reputation not on personality, but on patience. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=926.12s)]
*  Do you have patience with people the same way you have patience with animals? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=931.44s)]
*  No. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=934.4s)]
*  No? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=935.4s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=936.4s)]
*  I wish I did. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=937.4s)]
*  I don't. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=938.4s)]
*  Do you like animals more than people? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=939.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=941.48s)]
*  Really? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=942.48s)]
*  Well, not you. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=943.48s)]
*  He especially likes the dangerous kind. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=945.4s)]
*  In a jungle in India, where it would be deadly to be on foot, Mangelson climbed onto an elephant's [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=947.92s)]
*  back for this shot of a Bengal tiger, paws red, fresh from a kill. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=953.28s)]
*  In the Arctic, where temperatures can be 30 degrees below zero, he spent years documenting [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=958.8s)]
*  the behavior of polar bears. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=964.1s)]
*  He nicknamed this group the Bad Boys of the Arctic. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=966.6s)]
*  He's captured adult male bears play fighting, a mama bear slyly keeping watch as her cubs [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=970.48s)]
*  nearby, and a group of bears trying to survive as their world melts away. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=977.04s)]
*  People often mistake Mangelson's photographs for paintings, and since the 1970s, he's sold [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=983.6s)]
*  them out of galleries, like this one in Jackson, Wyoming. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=988.96s)]
*  His photo catch of the day is often called the most famous wildlife photograph in the [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=992.94s)]
*  world. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=997.84s)]
*  It's such an extraordinary image. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=998.84s)]
*  In this day and age, people would think that this is Photoshop, that you've got a photo [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1000.28s)]
*  of a fish somewhere. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1004.32s)]
*  I mean, it's so perfect. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1005.32s)]
*  It was taken in 1988 before Photoshop even existed. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1006.32s)]
*  People think it's fake. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1010.6s)]
*  But you don't believe in that, I mean, as a photographer? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1011.6s)]
*  No, I mean, this is the magic, this is the moment, this is the decisive moment. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1013.88s)]
*  And this little tiny space right here, I think is so important, is it, yeah, a quarter of [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1017.08s)]
*  an inch. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1022.0400000000001s)]
*  It's in its mouth, but it hasn't actually made contact yet with its mouth. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1023.2s)]
*  One nanosecond later. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1027.52s)]
*  Mangelson shuns the use of digital manipulation. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1029.8400000000001s)]
*  What he sees through his lens is what you get. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1032.74s)]
*  And at a time when many photographers build their portfolios by going to game farms like [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1036.06s)]
*  this one to photograph captive animals, Mangelson insists on only documenting them in their [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1040.7s)]
*  natural habitat. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1046.78s)]
*  OK, Anderson. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1047.78s)]
*  Let's see what we can find. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1048.78s)]
*  As we saw when we joined him before dawn outside Jackson Hole. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1053.58s)]
*  You always get up this early? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1057.78s)]
*  There's only one way to do it. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1058.78s)]
*  The only way to do it is like do it every day or be really lucky. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1059.82s)]
*  He's taking us to a bend he knows on the Snake River. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1066.18s)]
*  Do you hear the elk? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1069.18s)]
*  It's a sharp whistle. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1074.18s)]
*  That's it. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1077.18s)]
*  That's the sound of the wild deer. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1080.18s)]
*  He's been here hundreds of times trying to get the perfect shot of elk crossing the [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1084.42s)]
*  water. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1089.3000000000002s)]
*  So now it's just a waiting? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1090.3000000000002s)]
*  Yep, a waiting. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1092.3000000000002s)]
*  What's the longest you've ever spent in any spot and not here but anywhere? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1095.3000000000002s)]
*  42 days with the cougars. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1100.3000000000002s)]
*  42 days? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1103.3000000000002s)]
*  I went home at night and slept and then we'd go back at daybreak. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1104.3000000000002s)]
*  But you would spend all day there? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1108.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1110.02s)]
*  So 12 hours a day? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1111.02s)]
*  12 or 14. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1112.02s)]
*  12 or 14 hours a day for 42 days. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1113.62s)]
*  Did you get the shot? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1116.62s)]
*  Finally. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1117.62s)]
*  This was the shot worth waiting for. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1118.62s)]
*  The elusive cougar coming out of her den at dusk, taken in 1999. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1121.62s)]
*  It's among the first photographs to document the life of a wild female cougar. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1126.62s)]
*  It helped launch a movement to protect the cats against human encroachment. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1131.62s)]
*  Back at the river after a three hour wait. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1136.62s)]
*  Right between the trees. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1139.62s)]
*  There she comes. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1143.2199999999998s)]
*  That was cool. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1157.2199999999998s)]
*  That was worth the wait. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1159.2199999999998s)]
*  Just kind of extraordinary. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1163.2199999999998s)]
*  We headed back to his office in Jackson to take a look at an amateur's attempt. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1166.82s)]
*  I think it's beautiful. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1173.82s)]
*  It's gorgeous. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1174.82s)]
*  Me too. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1175.82s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that one at all. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1176.82s)]
*  Is she out of focus? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1178.82s)]
*  Maybe slightly. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1180.82s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1181.82s)]
*  Yep. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1182.82s)]
*  I'm not quite sure. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1183.82s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1184.82s)]
*  Mangelson's shot was of course in perfect focus. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1185.82s)]
*  Shoot when else he's captured at that same river in fall, summer and winter. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1190.82s)]
*  Mangelson credits his father with his love of the wild. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1197.82s)]
*  He grew up on the bank of the Platte River in Nebraska where he was schooled in hunting and fishing. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1201.82s)]
*  As a teenager in the 1960s, Mangelson earned the title world champion goose caller. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1207.82s)]
*  No small feat considering this is bird country. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1213.82s)]
*  Mangelson has grown from home to 400 species as well as one of the great migrations on earth. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1217.82s)]
*  Every spring, half a million Sandhill cranes stop on this stretch of the Platte River. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1224.82s)]
*  They're fattening up on grain before migrating north as far as Siberia. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1229.82s)]
*  It is an awesome and ancient ritual. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1235.82s)]
*  Fossils show cranes have come here for nearly 10 million years. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1238.82s)]
*  As a spectacle of sight and sound, Mangelson has shared for 17 years with his friend and ally, Jane Goodall, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1242.82s)]
*  whose life work with chimpanzees has revolutionized our understanding of primates. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1249.82s)]
*  Today, Goodall and Mangelson team up to raise money and awareness for the protection of cranes as well as chimpanzees and cougars. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1255.82s)]
*  He's taught me so much about the Platte River and what goes on here [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1264.82s)]
*  and what it was like when he was a boy and how he started off as a hunter because that's what one did [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1269.82s)]
*  and then how gradually he realized he loved these creatures much too much. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1275.82s)]
*  He couldn't go on being a hunter and so he hunts with his camera. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1280.82s)]
*  Here they come, lots and lots and lots. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1286.82s)]
*  Look at the light on those up there. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1290.82s)]
*  What's amazing is this ancient migration still carries on. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1292.82s)]
*  I think it's completely amazing. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1297.82s)]
*  I agree. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1299.82s)]
*  It gives me hope that nature will manage in spite of us. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1300.82s)]
*  Oh, look at this. Beautiful, huh? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1305.82s)]
*  Next year, do you think you could invest in a silent camera? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1314.82s)]
*  One of the qualities that I love about Tom is his passion. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1320.82s)]
*  And it's when you have that kind of passion and that kind of commitment that you're more likely to get other people involved [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1324.82s)]
*  because we can never win an argument by appealing to people's heads. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1331.82s)]
*  It's got to be in the heart. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1336.82s)]
*  And I use the power of storytelling and writing and Tom uses the power of images. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1338.82s)]
*  If all artists have a muse, Tom Mangelson's is this 22-year-old female grizzly bear. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1346.82s)]
*  She doesn't have a proper name but is known by the research number 399, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1352.82s)]
*  a creature from America's wild past when 50,000 grizzlies roamed the lower 48. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1357.82s)]
*  Less than 2,000 grizzlies remain today. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1363.82s)]
*  For more than a decade, Mangelson has chronicled every facet of 399's life, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1366.82s)]
*  emerging from a long winter's nap, swatting magpies away from a meal. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1372.82s)]
*  He's watched and worried as she's given birth to three sets of triplets and a set of twins. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1378.82s)]
*  She's nursed, protected and taught more than a dozen bear cubs. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1383.82s)]
*  Mangelson's photographs, including this one he dubbed an icon of motherhood, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1388.82s)]
*  have made 399 the most famous grizzly in the world. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1393.82s)]
*  What do you think it is about grizzly bears that so captures people's imagination? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1397.82s)]
*  I think it's their wildness and their rarity and their... [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1401.82s)]
*  You see intelligent they are? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1405.82s)]
*  6 399 will go to the road and she'll look both ways. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1407.82s)]
*  She'll tell the kids to stay on one side of the road. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1410.82s)]
*  She'll go across and then she'll talk to them. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1413.82s)]
*  Okay, you can come across now. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1416.82s)]
*  Isn't that smart? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1418.82s)]
*  There's also something about grizzly bears that there's a grace to it [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1419.82s)]
*  but ferocity is always lurking there. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1422.82s)]
*  But I like that idea that we're not the top of the food chain. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1425.82s)]
*  In Mangelson's portraits, ferocious grizzlies have personalities too, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1429.82s)]
*  but sometimes it's easy to miss the details. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1433.82s)]
*  Notice a leftover piece of grass tucked in the corner of this grizzly's mouth like a toothpick. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1436.82s)]
*  But it's Mangelson's wide shots that may matter the most. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1442.82s)]
*  They help people understand animals like 399 can't survive without their habitat. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1445.82s)]
*  Mangelson took us out to show us why he believes seeing your first grizzly can change your life. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1451.82s)]
*  It's right there. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1458.82s)]
*  It's right there. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1459.82s)]
*  Okay, so it's really close. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1460.82s)]
*  It was an adult female grizzly resting just off the road. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1461.82s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1465.82s)]
*  It's a gorgeous bear. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1467.82s)]
*  Now you see how she just scratched the back of your ear like your dog might? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1470.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1473.82s)]
*  Isn't that great? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1474.82s)]
*  Now she's scratching your belly. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1476.82s)]
*  It's so incredible to see. It's amazing. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1478.82s)]
*  A third of 399's offspring have been killed in interactions with humans, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1480.82s)]
*  hit by cars or shot by elk hunters out of fear. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1485.82s)]
*  Last year, the federal government removed grizzly bears around Yellowstone from the endangered species list. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1489.82s)]
*  Wyoming and Idaho are now deciding whether to open a hunting season on the bears. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1495.82s)]
*  There's people here who have said that they can't wait for a season to open so they can shoot 399 [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1500.82s)]
*  because that would be the biggest prize, the biggest trophy. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1507.82s)]
*  You've had hunters actually say that to you, that they want to shoot 399 because 399 is so famous. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1510.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1516.82s)]
*  Hard, hard to believe. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1518.82s)]
*  While he worries about what will be lost, Tom Mangelson is determined to show us the beauty and fragility of what still survives. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1520.82s)]
*  And so he sets out once again, patiently making his way alone into the wild. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1528.82s)]
*  It's my gift in a way that I can give people, hopefully, to preserve what we have left, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1535.82s)]
*  preserve wilderness, preserve species like grizzly bears, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1541.82s)]
*  and make them think about it, and make them think that this is what we need to say for our children. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1544.82s)]
*  Joel Sartore, an acclaimed National Geographic photographer, is a man on a mission. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1563.82s)]
*  He's trying to photograph every species, every animal, bird, fish, reptile, and insect in captivity. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1568.82s)]
*  Sartore sides with scientists who estimate half the species alive today could be extinct by the end of this century. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1576.82s)]
*  So he travels to zoos around the world to take pictures of what we're losing [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1584.82s)]
*  and to ignite conservation efforts to prevent extinctions. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1590.82s)]
*  He calls his project the PhotoArc. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1594.82s)]
*  On this arc, the animals go in one by one. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1598.82s)]
*  He's beautiful, isn't he? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1603.82s)]
*  To catch Joel Sartore in action, we flew halfway around the world to the Philippines, home to hundreds of unique species. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1604.82s)]
*  Flew 20 hours to get here. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1613.82s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1616.82s)]
*  And you came all this way to take a picture of a Palawan stink badger. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1617.82s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1621.82s)]
*  Boy, is he stinky. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1623.82s)]
*  He's smaller than a skunk, but smells worse. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1625.82s)]
*  He's part badger, part skunk, and he fired a reeking rocket after he entered the photo cage. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1627.82s)]
*  How could something that cute be that stinky? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1635.82s)]
*  It smelled so terrible that the next animal to leave the red carpet and head into the photo cage, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1638.82s)]
*  a rare Palawan binturon, took one whiff, smelled stink badger stink, and backed out. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1644.82s)]
*  Sartore said he should have photographed the stink badger last, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1651.82s)]
*  but the little stinker is a pungent prize. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1656.82s)]
*  There's nobody else coming along to photograph a stink badger. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1659.82s)]
*  I'm the only one. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1662.82s)]
*  And that's the case for 90% of the species I photograph, maybe 95%. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1664.82s)]
*  These are things that nobody will ever know existed if it weren't for the PhotoArc. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1669.82s)]
*  If they could just see how beautiful this thing is, they would care. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1675.82s)]
*  Okay, get that other light. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1680.82s)]
*  Joel cares so much, he spends half the year traveling the world. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1682.82s)]
*  We saw him work 12-hour days in stifling, humid, 100-degree heat. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1687.82s)]
*  Okay, let's switch to white. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1693.82s)]
*  It was tough for us just watching him build pop-up studios, switching between backdrops of black and white. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1695.82s)]
*  Why did you decide to use either black or white backgrounds? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1703.82s)]
*  There are no distractions in these pictures. It's just the animal and you. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1707.82s)]
*  And that animal is often looking you in the eye. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1711.82s)]
*  That's when it all works. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1714.82s)]
*  Here's what happened years ago when Joel tried to photograph a chimp. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1716.82s)]
*  He spent more than an hour taping up the white background. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1720.82s)]
*  So now doesn't this look nice? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1725.82s)]
*  More than an hour for this. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1727.82s)]
*  Animals can be frustrating and dangerous, like this fierce Luzon warty pig, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1734.82s)]
*  found only on a few Philippine islands. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1740.82s)]
*  Handlers had herded him into a makeshift photo pen. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1743.82s)]
*  Joel got as close as he dared, lying in a trough usually used for pig waste. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1747.82s)]
*  The tusks are sharp, the hooves are sharp. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1753.82s)]
*  You know what? I'm concentrating. I got lots to do. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1756.82s)]
*  Beyond the tusks and hooves, this pig packs a mean temper. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1759.82s)]
*  You've heard the expression, when pigs fly? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1766.82s)]
*  Watch. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1769.82s)]
*  Like a cow jumping over the moon, except it was a pig. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1773.82s)]
*  Let's see if I got it. I've never had that happen, ever. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1776.82s)]
*  He's sharp, you can see him. We're done. That's good. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1780.82s)]
*  We got our picture. We don't ever need to photograph this species again. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1783.82s)]
*  But then there was Trixie, perhaps the world's sweetest orangutan. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1787.82s)]
*  We met her not far from the mean-spirited pig at the Avalon Zoo outside Manila. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1793.82s)]
*  We're just going to let her see the flash. So far, so good. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1799.82s)]
*  The key question, would Trixie move in front of the white background? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1804.82s)]
*  Do you think she would want to stand over there and get her picture? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1809.82s)]
*  She's amazing. Awesome. Look at that. Oh, sweet girl. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1812.82s)]
*  It's like a couple girls. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1816.82s)]
*  If she lays down to look at you, you get down with her. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1818.82s)]
*  You just lay down on the ground and eye level. She was completely calm. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1822.82s)]
*  Later, Sartori showed us his favorite Trixie shots at National Geographic Headquarters in Washington. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1826.82s)]
*  So what do you think she's thinking? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1833.82s)]
*  I think she was just thinking, you know, is there a banana in this somewhere for me? A mango? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1835.82s)]
*  Let's go in there and get her on black. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1840.82s)]
*  Very nice, very nice. I like the one on white better, I think. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1844.82s)]
*  It's more direct. It's more like she's involved. She's a partner in the process. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1848.82s)]
*  Hold, hold. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1852.82s)]
*  I put my hand out. I wasn't quite sure she was going to take it, but she did. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1854.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's soft. And it was soft. Yeah. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1858.82s)]
*  That was an amazing experience. Yeah. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1861.82s)]
*  What makes a great picture? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1864.82s)]
*  Emotion. That's what you look for in any great photograph. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1866.82s)]
*  What's emotion in an animal? A moment. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1870.82s)]
*  We're looking for the eyes. Humans are primates and we're really, really responsive to eyes. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1872.82s)]
*  We're all about eye contact. But you shoot them like they're models. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1877.82s)]
*  I do, like they're going in for their high school senior portrait. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1880.82s)]
*  Sartori shoots birds in tents so they won't fly away. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1884.82s)]
*  This white-crowned hornbill posed like a preening pro. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1889.82s)]
*  Completely different from Joel's first attempt to shoot this species back in the States. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1894.82s)]
*  Ready? Yeah. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1899.82s)]
*  So this lady, her name is Jen, not a bashful bird at all. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1901.82s)]
*  Ow. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1905.82s)]
*  What she didn't tell me is that bird is such a badass. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1906.82s)]
*  He attacks her when he goes in to feed him. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1909.82s)]
*  This is going to be one of those things where I'm back here. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1911.82s)]
*  So I said, can you put that bird in my tent? She went, sure, I can. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1914.82s)]
*  This is like a $6,000 camera. Doesn't he know that? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1918.82s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey, hey. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1921.82s)]
*  Ow. God. That's my blood right there. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1923.82s)]
*  That's why he wanted to shoot a calm hornbill in the Philippines. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1928.82s)]
*  Very nice bird. Up, up. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1932.82s)]
*  But here, the red rat snake kept attacking. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1935.82s)]
*  God, they're real lungy, aren't they? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1938.82s)]
*  Fortunately, he's not venomous. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1941.82s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1944.82s)]
*  Since he bit our cameraman, Mark Laganga. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1945.82s)]
*  I enjoy seeing the 60 Minutes cameraman get bit instead of me. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1949.82s)]
*  But the next snake was extremely venomous. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1953.82s)]
*  Is that the spitter? Yeah. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1956.82s)]
*  The Palawan spitting cobra can blind you if it spits in your eye, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1958.82s)]
*  and it can spit 10 feet. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1962.82s)]
*  That's why Joel wore goggles. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1965.82s)]
*  But watch how close he gets to this cobra. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1968.82s)]
*  I always thought when they had their hood out like that, that that meant danger. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1972.82s)]
*  Well, he's reacting to us. We're like skyscrapers to this guy. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1976.82s)]
*  So he's going to stand up and look as big as he can. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1979.82s)]
*  They have a space prepped already. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1982.82s)]
*  In zoos, Sartori can shoot more than 20 species in one day. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1984.82s)]
*  In the wild, it could take several days to get one good shot. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1988.82s)]
*  Now, with natural habitats vanishing, some species can only be found in zoos. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=1993.82s)]
*  A lot of them only exist in zoos. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2000.82s)]
*  They have these captive breeding programs for some of the rarest animals in the world. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2002.82s)]
*  So when people say, well, they're down on zoos, well, they haven't seen a good zoo, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2006.82s)]
*  and they don't know the conservation effect of good zoos. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2010.82s)]
*  Sartori spent his first 16 years at National Geographic taking pictures in the field. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2013.82s)]
*  He scored numerous magazine covers and endured various hardships. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2020.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's me. That's on Alaska's North Slope. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2026.82s)]
*  I wanted to show the insect load up there. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2028.82s)]
*  And also, I hadn't made a good picture in three days. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2030.82s)]
*  And so the editors here will say, Joel, we can't publish your excuses. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2033.82s)]
*  The mosquitoes, though, my God. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2037.82s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2039.82s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2040.82s)]
*  I've been a bee itch for a long time. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2041.82s)]
*  He came up with the photo-arc idea after his wife developed breast cancer. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2043.82s)]
*  That's my son Cole and my wife Kathy. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2049.8199999999997s)]
*  She went on chemo for nine months, and I was grounded. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2052.8199999999997s)]
*  I was home for a year. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2057.8199999999997s)]
*  So I was really worried she was not going to make it, but we all made it through. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2059.8199999999997s)]
*  She's fine today. It's been 13 years, which is great. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2063.8199999999997s)]
*  Wonderful. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2066.8199999999997s)]
*  It really does make you appreciate how limited our time is. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2067.8199999999997s)]
*  So the cancer changed all of your lives. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2070.82s)]
*  Yeah, and started the photo-arc. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2073.82s)]
*  It was a desperate last-ditch effort to use my life for something that's worthwhile, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2076.82s)]
*  something that could save nature. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2082.82s)]
*  In the Bible, the arc saves all the creatures on Earth. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2084.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2088.82s)]
*  Is that your goal? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2089.82s)]
*  Giddy up. You bet. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2090.82s)]
*  What makes you think you can save them with a photo? [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2092.82s)]
*  We can reach more people now than ever, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2095.82s)]
*  We can post to National Geographic Instagram and Facebook [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2097.82s)]
*  and reach over 100 million people and do it again and again and again. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2100.82s)]
*  His latest pictures are published periodically, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2106.82s)]
*  and they've appeared on the Empire State Building and the Vatican. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2108.82s)]
*  Yeah, the site of St. Peter's Basilica. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2112.82s)]
*  The Pope was sitting there watching, which was awesome. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2115.82s)]
*  We flew with Joel to the Philippine island of Negros. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2119.82s)]
*  Here, vast forests were cut for timber, robbing wildlife of vital habitat. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2122.82s)]
*  Now there's hardly any lowland forests left, less than 5% here. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2128.82s)]
*  Negros has its own type of critically endangered warty pig. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2132.82s)]
*  This mother was saved from a hunter's snare. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2136.82s)]
*  In the zoo, she's helping to save her species. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2139.82s)]
*  She's got her babies. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2143.82s)]
*  You can see that bridle marking on her snout that's really definitive. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2145.82s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2148.82s)]
*  Wow. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2149.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's beautiful. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2150.82s)]
*  I think these are going to be on the ground. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2151.82s)]
*  Joel, who spends so much time away from home, brought his daughter Ellen on this trip. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2153.82s)]
*  So what do you think of what he's doing? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2159.82s)]
*  I think it's extraordinary what you're doing. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2161.82s)]
*  Really? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2163.82s)]
*  You do. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2164.82s)]
*  Oh, you're going to make me cry. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2165.82s)]
*  Don't cry. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2166.82s)]
*  I've never heard you say that. You do? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2167.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2168.82s)]
*  But he is gone all the time. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2169.82s)]
*  He hasn't been to the last seven of my birthdays, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2170.82s)]
*  just because my birthday is in migration season. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2172.82s)]
*  Migration season. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2175.82s)]
*  That's true. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2177.82s)]
*  So he's gone. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2178.82s)]
*  That's a birthday buster, huh? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2179.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2180.82s)]
*  The next day, Sartori showed us a beetle he had spotted. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2181.82s)]
*  I think he'd be worth putting in the photo art. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2185.82s)]
*  A species he hadn't shot before. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2187.82s)]
*  So there's nothing too small for you, huh? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2189.82s)]
*  Nothing too small. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2191.82s)]
*  If you can see it with your eyes, we'll photograph it. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2192.82s)]
*  How big is this guy? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2195.82s)]
*  That guy is the size of a grain of rice. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2196.82s)]
*  Tiny. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2199.82s)]
*  Yeah, tiny. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2200.82s)]
*  So every animal fills up your frame. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2201.82s)]
*  That's right. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2204.82s)]
*  Small or large. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2205.82s)]
*  He's as big as a polar bear. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2206.82s)]
*  Why do you do that? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2207.82s)]
*  Because it gives them all equal say, equal voice. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2208.82s)]
*  The big charismatic mammals get all the ink. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2211.82s)]
*  They get all the press. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2213.82s)]
*  The gorillas and the rhinos and the tigers. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2214.82s)]
*  Nobody's thinking about these little guys. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2217.82s)]
*  I am. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2219.82s)]
*  Sartori shot another little guy, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2221.82s)]
*  believed to be the very last member of a now extinct species. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2223.82s)]
*  That's the last rab's fringed-limbed frog. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2228.82s)]
*  What's that like, knowing that this animal will not exist anymore [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2231.82s)]
*  shortly after you take the picture? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2236.82s)]
*  Well, does it make me sad? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2238.82s)]
*  Sure. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2239.82s)]
*  But does it inspire me to go out and keep working like I do? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2240.82s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2244.82s)]
*  We put this together in my office. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2245.82s)]
*  This just shows you what rodents can look like [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2247.82s)]
*  and what parrots look like. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2250.82s)]
*  Biodiversity in a glance. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2252.82s)]
*  Just primates. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2257.82s)]
*  Wow. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2261.82s)]
*  And we've done a lot more since then. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2263.82s)]
*  You go out farther and farther and farther. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2265.82s)]
*  Hundreds of species, thousands of species. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2267.82s)]
*  Just amphibians. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2270.82s)]
*  There's so much diversity, but you'd never know it. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2272.82s)]
*  Wow, look at that. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2275.82s)]
*  You'd never know it. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2276.82s)]
*  So you've been doing this how long now? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2277.82s)]
*  Twelve years. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2279.82s)]
*  How many species have you photographed? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2280.82s)]
*  8,255, but who's counting? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2282.82s)]
*  You're about halfway through. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2285.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2287.82s)]
*  And you're how old now? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2288.82s)]
*  Fifty-five, almost fifty-six. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2290.82s)]
*  Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2292.82s)]
*  Just as loud as that 60-minute stopwatch, baby. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2293.82s)]
*  Time's running out. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2296.82s)]
*  It is. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2297.82s)]
*  But you know, at least my life will be spent doing something [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2298.82s)]
*  that's hopefully mattered to the world. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2301.82s)]
*  The African lion is the most feared predator in the wild. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2317.82s)]
*  It is designed to kill. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2321.82s)]
*  But tonight we'll show you a very different side [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2323.82s)]
*  of these awe-inspiring animals. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2326.82s)]
*  Our guide is South Africa's self-taught animal behaviorist, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2329.82s)]
*  Kevin Richardson. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2332.82s)]
*  Getting up close and personal with lions is his life's work. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2334.82s)]
*  It has earned him the nickname, the lion whisperer. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2338.82s)]
*  We visited his sanctuary a few hours outside of Johannesburg, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2341.82s)]
*  where Richardson spends most of his days with his 28 adopted lions. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2345.82s)]
*  But the story of how he ended up with an extended family of huge cats [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2351.82s)]
*  reveals some disturbing truths about a South African tourism industry [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2356.82s)]
*  with a sinister side. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2361.82s)]
*  Ha, ha, ha, ha. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2366.82s)]
*  You're a mad thing. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2369.82s)]
*  We strapped a couple of small cameras onto Kevin Richardson [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2371.82s)]
*  to get a good look at the unique relationship he has with these animals. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2375.82s)]
*  Cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2380.82s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2383.82s)]
*  First stop this morning, finding two of his lions, Gabby and Bobcat. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2384.82s)]
*  Oh. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2389.82s)]
*  Gah. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2391.82s)]
*  When they hear his call, they rush out to greet him like a long-lost friend. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2394.82s)]
*  Hello, my goody. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2399.82s)]
*  Oh. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2401.82s)]
*  Oh. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2403.82s)]
*  Oh, shoot. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2405.82s)]
*  This emotional bond is incredibly rare. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2408.82s)]
*  That was nice, now. Did you enjoy? Did you have a good time? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2415.82s)]
*  His ability to interact with them so freely is a result of the fact [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2419.82s)]
*  that he has known them since they were cubs [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2423.82s)]
*  when Richardson worked at a lion park for tourists. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2426.82s)]
*  All of these animals were born in captivity [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2430.82s)]
*  and can never be released into the wild. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2433.82s)]
*  But they are far from tame [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2436.82s)]
*  and wouldn't accept any other human being getting this close to them. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2438.82s)]
*  Oh, God. Have you had a long day today? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2442.82s)]
*  Eh? It's been horrible. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2445.82s)]
*  It's been a terrible day. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2447.82s)]
*  You had to spend the entire day out in the bush. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2450.82s)]
*  Oh, what a nightmare. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2454.82s)]
*  You're very heavy, my boy. Can you get off me? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2457.82s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2460.82s)]
*  That's kind of you. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2462.82s)]
*  Richardson himself acknowledges [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2464.82s)]
*  that the boundaries are different with each animal, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2466.82s)]
*  a lesson he learned the hard way [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2469.82s)]
*  when he was bitten by a lion he didn't know well. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2472.82s)]
*  We kept our cameras at a safe distance [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2475.82s)]
*  and at times shot from a drone hovering overhead. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2478.82s)]
*  You don't get nervous at all when she's licking your face like that? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2484.82s)]
*  No, you've got to have trust that she's not going to do anything [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2488.82s)]
*  except to tend to, uh, bite you like that. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2492.82s)]
*  So right now she's just playing? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2499.82s)]
*  She's just playing, yeah. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2501.82s)]
*  It all depends on how you roll with them. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2503.82s)]
*  If you kind of stiffen up and pretend that you're all nervous, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2506.82s)]
*  then they stiffen up and they want to grab you [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2510.82s)]
*  and they want to claw you and they want to bite you, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2513.82s)]
*  even if you know them. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2516.82s)]
*  Right. Does she know that she's stronger than you? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2518.82s)]
*  Ah! [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2521.82s)]
*  I don't know if she consciously thinks that she's stronger than me. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2524.82s)]
*  I think she just respects the fact that, you know, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2529.82s)]
*  I'm part of her group and she wants me on my back now. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2533.82s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2540.82s)]
*  You're a nightmare, you lions. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2542.82s)]
*  This is not a circus act. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2544.82s)]
*  Unlike the vast majority of people who work with captive lions, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2547.82s)]
*  Kevin Richardson doesn't carry a stick or a stun gun, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2551.82s)]
*  and he doesn't control his animals through fear. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2555.82s)]
*  In this relationship, the lions are his equals, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2558.82s)]
*  and they rarely take orders. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2561.82s)]
*  You're naughty. You know you're a naughty lion. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2564.82s)]
*  You're a naughty cat. You're a naughty cat. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2566.82s)]
*  That means he can break every one of the established rules [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2569.82s)]
*  for interacting with these big cats. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2573.82s)]
*  He looks them in the eye, gets down to their level, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2576.82s)]
*  lies down on the ground with them. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2579.82s)]
*  And people who know lions say you should never, ever turn your back on one. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2583.82s)]
*  Look at all come along. Whoa! [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2588.82s)]
*  We got that! Yes! [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2591.82s)]
*  But seen from the drone, that same incident reveals Kevin's secret. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2595.82s)]
*  The lioness goes on to do exactly the same thing to the male lion. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2600.82s)]
*  But Richardson is just one of the pride. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2605.82s)]
*  They do seem to be attached in a way because when you go away, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2610.82s)]
*  they do miss you and they do lovingly greet you when you come back. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2614.82s)]
*  They're the only social cat, as we know, a truly social cat. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2618.82s)]
*  So that's quite important to lions. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2622.82s)]
*  What do you think the biggest misconception about lions is? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2624.82s)]
*  Biggest misconception is mindless, man-eating killer. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2627.82s)]
*  In fact, they are really just big, scared animals that are designed to kill [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2632.82s)]
*  because that's how they've evolved. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2638.82s)]
*  But the truth be known, they'd rather run away than confront. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2640.82s)]
*  There we go. That's not so bad. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2645.82s)]
*  We were told we would probably be okay sitting in an open truck. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2647.82s)]
*  But when a lion weighing more than 400 pounds sidles up for a closer look, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2652.82s)]
*  that doesn't seem like much of a guarantee. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2658.82s)]
*  You're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2661.82s)]
*  They're just so big. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2664.82s)]
*  Yeah, I suppose something that always struck me was the first time I saw a lion. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2666.82s)]
*  It was a big boy like him. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2672.82s)]
*  And I drove into this camp and he started roaring next to the window. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2674.82s)]
*  But he looked me in the eyes. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2677.82s)]
*  I was in quite a low-slung car. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2679.82s)]
*  And that's a memory I'll never forget, you know, just the power of the roar, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2681.82s)]
*  but also the sheer size. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2686.82s)]
*  I was like, ooh, I didn't realize they were that big. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2687.82s)]
*  How many people are there who can do what you do? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2690.82s)]
*  Many people around the world who have amazing relationships with animals and with lions. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2693.82s)]
*  So yeah, I don't think it's... [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2700.82s)]
*  I'm not going to claim it as something unique to Kevin Richardson. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2702.82s)]
*  But would you say you have a gift? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2705.82s)]
*  I think the gift really is to maybe explore the boundaries [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2707.82s)]
*  where most people would be bitten or scratched or, you know, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2711.82s)]
*  be in such a vulnerable position where they think, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2715.82s)]
*  I don't ever want to put myself in that situation. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2718.82s)]
*  And you've got to do it once. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2720.82s)]
*  You know, it's an amazing thing to suddenly be able to turn your back on a full-grown lion [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2722.82s)]
*  and not worry that he's going to come and grab you in the back of the neck. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2728.82s)]
*  So I suppose from that perspective there is a bit of... [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2732.82s)]
*  maybe it's ballsiness, I don't know. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2737.82s)]
*  And the gift that goes with it, I suppose, is knowing when to leave them alone. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2740.82s)]
*  Kevin Richardson started this sanctuary to protect his lions [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2745.82s)]
*  from a multi-million dollar industry that he was once a part of. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2749.82s)]
*  For years, Richardson worked at the Lion Park, one of dozens of places in South Africa [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2754.82s)]
*  where tourists, many of them Americans, pay top dollar for the privilege of petting lion cubs. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2760.82s)]
*  One candy. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2766.82s)]
*  The parks breed their lions constantly to ensure a supply of cubs year-round. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2769.82s)]
*  But once the lions reach maturity, they are too dangerous to be near tourists. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2774.82s)]
*  Places like the Lion Park claim that their older cats are sent out [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2780.82s)]
*  to live the rest of their days in good homes. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2784.82s)]
*  Well, the question I have is where are these good homes? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2787.82s)]
*  Because I'd like to visit a few of those good homes myself [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2790.82s)]
*  and maybe even some of my cats could go to these good homes. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2793.82s)]
*  The reality is they aren't any. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2796.82s)]
*  This is where many of those cubs actually end up, in something called a canned hunt. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2798.82s)]
*  Where for prices up to $100,000, you can go into an enclosure and shoot a lion. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2807.82s)]
*  It's entirely legal, but online videos from animal rights groups [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2813.82s)]
*  and hunting operations show how brutal it can be. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2818.82s)]
*  An animal that has been petted and fed by humans since birth makes a pretty easy target. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2822.82s)]
*  Chris Mercer runs a campaign to try to get canned hunting banned. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2828.82s)]
*  You put the lion into the enclosure and then the hunter comes and shoots it and takes it out. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2833.82s)]
*  So essentially it's like shooting fish in a barrel. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2839.82s)]
*  There's no skill involved at all. It's not hunting at all. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2842.82s)]
*  Your canned lion hunter is actually a collector. He's not a hunter. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2849.82s)]
*  A collector of trophies. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2856.82s)]
*  He's a collector of trophies. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2858.82s)]
*  Most of the tourists who pay to play with cubs believe that they're helping the animals. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2860.82s)]
*  Whenever you pet a lion cub, you are directly enriching the canned lion hunting industry. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2866.82s)]
*  And I hope that anybody watching this program takes this to heart. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2874.82s)]
*  What percentage of cubs in these facilities do you think end up in hunting operations? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2878.82s)]
*  Virtually all the cubs that are petted in this country are going to be shot sooner or later. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2885.82s)]
*  How do you know that? [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2891.82s)]
*  Well, we know that there is no other market for adult lions other than the hunting industry. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2893.82s)]
*  Lions eat meat. Meat's expensive. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2901.82s)]
*  So every day that that huntable lion remains with the breeder is money lost. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2904.82s)]
*  They have to get rid of it. And it's the hunting operation that takes it. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2911.82s)]
*  The cub petting business has spent years trying to hide that fact. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2916.82s)]
*  We went to the lion park where Kevin Richardson started out. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2921.82s)]
*  His former boss, Rodney Furr, claims that parks like his aid conservation. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2925.82s)]
*  By allowing people to interact with the lions, he said, it raises interest in the species. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2931.82s)]
*  They like to play. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2937.82s)]
*  I can see the appeal. They're beautiful animals. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2939.82s)]
*  We asked Furr where these lions would end up. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2943.82s)]
*  We try and sell them to incredible zoos and parks around the world. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2947.82s)]
*  So you would claim right now that no lions that are bred here end up in a hunting facility? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2952.82s)]
*  Yeah, now that I'm prepared to do under oath. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2958.82s)]
*  Because we've been given a few names of people who you've allegedly sold lions to, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2962.82s)]
*  all of whom are associated with hunting operations. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2968.82s)]
*  Nazir Kaji, Cobus Van Vestersen, Cobus Jacobs, Ben Dermany. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2971.82s)]
*  Yeah, well, let me interrupt you there. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2978.82s)]
*  Now that's true, but like I said, we haven't done that for the last couple of years. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2981.82s)]
*  Even within the last 18 months though, we've been told you've sold one batch of 17 lions to Nazir Kaji [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2986.82s)]
*  and another batch of 17 lions to Joanne Hulley, who resells lions to hunt operators. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=2993.82s)]
*  Is that correct or not? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3001.82s)]
*  Well, I'm surprised it's 18 months because I thought it was longer. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3003.82s)]
*  Now, like I said, we were doing it. We were selling it to traders. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3007.82s)]
*  And of course, you as well. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3013.82s)]
*  So some of your lions have ended up... [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3016.82s)]
*  I thought it was more than 18 months. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3018.82s)]
*  But the reality is some of your lions have ended up in hunting operations. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3020.82s)]
*  And it's very difficult for you to guarantee that they won't continue to end up in these hunting operations. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3026.82s)]
*  Well, they won't do it while I'm here. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3032.82s)]
*  This whole thing about canned hunting, what is canned hunting? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3034.82s)]
*  And I think it's grossly exaggerated. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3039.82s)]
*  What about all the jobs that we're providing and the hunting farms? There's thousands of jobs. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3042.82s)]
*  This has got to be weighed up against the odd lion that may be sold when he's eight years old. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3049.82s)]
*  In the wild, he wouldn't probably even live to eight. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3054.82s)]
*  That's right. That's right. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3057.82s)]
*  For Kevin Richardson, the idea that the lions he had worked with since birth might end up in a canned hunt was too much. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3059.82s)]
*  So he teamed up with a partner to buy all 26 of them and move them to his sanctuary. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3067.82s)]
*  So you couldn't leave without taking your lions with you. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3075.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3078.82s)]
*  And the logistics of getting 26 lions... [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3079.82s)]
*  It's been a struggle, put it that way, yeah. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3081.82s)]
*  Wildlife documentary work and a paid volunteer program are covering the bills for now. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3085.82s)]
*  But lions can live for more than 20 years. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3091.82s)]
*  So these lions are almost like your adopted family now. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3095.82s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3098.82s)]
*  You're stuck with them. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3099.82s)]
*  I am. And some are good and some are bad. You've got to take the good with the bad. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3100.82s)]
*  Like family. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3106.82s)]
*  Exactly. You can't pick and choose. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3107.82s)]
*  I formed relationships with a bunch of lions unknowingly at the time, what the consequences potentially later on down the line would be. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3109.82s)]
*  Not really knowing what I was actually getting involved with. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3120.82s)]
*  But I'll be the first to admit that it's an emotional connection that I have. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3124.82s)]
*  And I can't just turn my back on them now. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8yPhaAZAg&t=3128.82s)]
