# Rikers Island; 30 years on death row; Eyewitness testimony reliability | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [April 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk)
*  The [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=0.0s)]
*  There has been a lot of talk about criminal justice reform in America, and it would be [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=13.58s)]
*  hard to find a place more in need of reform than Rikers Island, the most important jail [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=17.92s)]
*  in New York City. Located in the middle of the East River, Rikers holds about 10,000 [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=23.42s)]
*  inmates. It's a volatile mix. Some have been convicted of minor crimes, but as many as [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=29.16s)]
*  80% are awaiting trial. Many are there because they can't make bail. And in a trend that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=35.02s)]
*  reflects a growing national problem, Rikers holds a rising number of mentally ill inmates. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=41.5s)]
*  The mentally ill now make up more than 40% of the population. Correction officers are [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=48.0s)]
*  not adequately trained to deal with this population. The result is a disturbing pattern of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=53.46s)]
*  neglect and excessive force that is the focus of our story tonight. It has led the U.S. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=59.08s)]
*  attorney Preet Bharara to intervene. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=64.64s)]
*  What you really had, we found, was a culture of violence on top of a code of silence. And [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=69.0s)]
*  that is a deadly combination. And I mean that literally, as we found in a number of cases [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=76.22s)]
*  that we have brought in connection with Rikers Island. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=82.96s)]
*  Felt by those deaths and a stream of alarming reports about Rikers Island, Preet Bharara, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=86.08s)]
*  who is the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, launched a two-year [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=91.44s)]
*  investigation into the jail complex. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=95.44s)]
*  We found in an alarming number of cases there was no discipline with respect to officers [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=97.96s)]
*  at all. You had an officer who had dozens of complaints against him and was never disciplined [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=102.68s)]
*  once or maybe just one time. And that's something that has to change. People have to understand [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=107.84s)]
*  that there are consequences for their actions, not just the inmates, but the officers as [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  well. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  How long has this been going on? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  Years and years. Too long. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  Rikers is a 400-acre island just off the tarmac of LaGuardia Airport in the shadows of Manhattan [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=121.64s)]
*  skyscrapers. One bridge leads in and out. It's surrounded by its own moat. The inmate [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=127.56s)]
*  population has come down dramatically, from a high of 20,000 to 10,000. But despite the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=134.84s)]
*  injuries, city data shows violence has gone up over the last decade. Because of the U.S. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=141.84s)]
*  attorney's findings, an unusual collaboration was formed. Bharara, the prosecutor, teamed [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=148.44s)]
*  up with plaintiff's lawyers, the Legal Aid Society and private attorney Jonathan Abadie [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=153.84s)]
*  in a class-action lawsuit on behalf of a dozen Rikers inmates. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=158.72s)]
*  The number of facial fractures, of traumatic brain injury, of broken bones, of serious [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=162.6s)]
*  physical injury is just out of control. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=169.24s)]
*  Compounding the problems at Rikers is that increase in the number of mentally ill inmates. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  And that just complicates issues relating to violence and issues relating to care and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  issues relating to discipline. So it's a problem. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=182.84s)]
*  What was captured on this video obtained by 60 Minutes helps illustrate what U.S. attorney [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=186.48s)]
*  Bharara is talking about. It has not been seen in public before. Bradley Ballard, who [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=191.4s)]
*  was schizophrenic and diabetic, was brought to Rikers in 2013 on charges of violating [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=197.2s)]
*  parole for an assault conviction. In the video, he was observed twisting his shirt into a [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=203.56s)]
*  phallic symbol and making lewd gestures, and then was taken back to his cell according [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=210.0s)]
*  to an investigation by the New York State Commission of Correction. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=215.66s)]
*  He was placed in the functional equivalent of solitary confinement. They put him in a [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=219.68s)]
*  cell. They locked the cell and they basically threw away the key. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=224.16s)]
*  Abidy represents Ballard's family in a pending wrongful death suit against the city. The [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=228.16s)]
*  commission's report found that Ballard was locked in his cell for six days prior to his [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=233.6s)]
*  death and was denied access to his life-supporting prescription medications and that day after [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=238.6s)]
*  day officers, supervisors and clinicians walked by, observed his deteriorating state, but [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=244.5s)]
*  failed to help him. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=251.0s)]
*  After repeated floodings of Ballard's toilet, a maintenance worker turned off the water [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=253.88s)]
*  running into Ballard's cell. The report found that Ballard was lying in his own waste. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  He's spraying a deodorizer? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=264.84s)]
*  Yes. The reports are that corrections officers were bringing aerosol cans from home because [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=266.84s)]
*  the stench was so bad coming from that cell. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=273.8s)]
*  Here an inmate who delivered a food tray pulled his shirt up over his nose. The report found [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=277.36s)]
*  the video tape indicated Ballard's cell was grossly unsanitary. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=283.44s)]
*  Finally, on the sixth day, medical workers were called. According to the report, an officer [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=288.44s)]
*  asked Ballard if he could get up on his own. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=295.44s)]
*  I need help, Ballard said. Inmate workers carried him out of his cell and put him on [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=298.32s)]
*  a gurney. Records show Ballard went into cardiac arrest soon after. He died hours later. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=303.56s)]
*  They watched him languish for seven days as he died, and they did nothing. It was the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=310.88s)]
*  functional equivalent of torture. They killed him. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=319.32s)]
*  The city's medical examiner declared Ballard's death a homicide, according to the commission [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=323.2s)]
*  report. It called Ballard's medical and custodial treatment from the time he entered Rikers [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=328.32s)]
*  so incompetent and inadequate as to shock the conscience. The Department of Correction [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=333.68s)]
*  issued a statement that it adjusted its practices to ensure that a similar tragedy doesn't happen [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=339.44s)]
*  again. But to this day, no criminal charges have been filed against any of the officers, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  supervisors or health workers involved. It's impossible to know if anyone stepped forward, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=351.56s)]
*  but if they did, it wasn't enough to help Bradley Ballard. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=357.96s)]
*  That's inhumane, in my opinion. That should never have happened. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=361.79999999999995s)]
*  Norman Seabrook is president of the union that represents the correction officers, but [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=366.76s)]
*  not the higher ranking supervisors. We showed him the Ballard video. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=371.24s)]
*  Who's responsible? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=376.12s)]
*  The supervisor. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=377.24s)]
*  What about your officers? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=378.32s)]
*  The officers followed the instructions of the supervisor. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=379.56s)]
*  In another incident captured on surveillance video, inmate Jose Bautista tried to hang [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=383.03999999999996s)]
*  himself. He had been arrested on domestic charges and was awaiting trial. He couldn't [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=388.52s)]
*  post the $250 bail. When he jumped up suddenly, officers beat him so severely he suffered a [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=393.8s)]
*  perforated bowel and needed emergency surgery, according to case records. Bautista's case was [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=401.44s)]
*  one of 129 serious injuries over an 11-month period documented in a revealing report by the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=407.84s)]
*  New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene that was intended for internal use only, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=415.28s)]
*  but 60 Minutes managed to get a copy. The report found 77% of the injuries involved mentally ill [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=420.88s)]
*  inmates and their injuries were severe enough to require care beyond the capacity of jail medical [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=428.8s)]
*  doctors. You could take a third of the 77% and say that, okay, it was the inmate who was just [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=434.64s)]
*  being violent and needed to be subdued, but 77% is, I think, tells the story. It's a problem. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=440.32s)]
*  Dr. Daniel Selling, who is now in private practice, was the executive director of mental [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=448.72s)]
*  health at Rikers for five years until he left in 2014. Is it fair to say that Rikers is a [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=454.16s)]
*  mental institution? Sure, it's by one of the largest mental institutions in the nation, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=462.88000000000005s)]
*  if not the largest. Can you tell me about the case of Bradley Ballard? What does that say [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=467.36s)]
*  about how things work on Rikers? It's probably the worst case that I've experienced, been a part of. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=474.4s)]
*  That was a case in which all systems failed. Selling said the staff of the private medical [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=485.76s)]
*  contractor failed to do the required daily rounds and never informed him about Ballard's [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=493.52s)]
*  deteriorating condition. The city's contract with the private medical firm was not renewed. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=499.04s)]
*  Bradley Ballard is not the only mentally ill inmate to have died in custody in recent years. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=505.20000000000005s)]
*  In 2014, U.S. attorney Preet Bharara filed the first criminal civil rights case in a decade [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=510.56s)]
*  against a Rikers officer or supervisor in connection with the poisoning of mentally [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=517.12s)]
*  ill inmate Jason Echeverria, who died after ingesting toxic soap while in solitary confinement. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=521.9200000000001s)]
*  As seen in this video that was entered into evidence, Echeverria, a robbery suspect who was [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=529.28s)]
*  also awaiting trial, was escorted to a cell where he swallowed the toxic soap that was given to him [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=534.88s)]
*  for cleaning his cell. His father Ramon told us he believes he ate the soap in a desperate effort [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=541.12s)]
*  to get out of solitary confinement. My son was screaming because he was burning up inside. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=547.92s)]
*  He's dying. He's dying. A few hours later, according to court documents, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=553.28s)]
*  correction officer Raymond Castro alerted unit supervisor Captain Terrence Pendergrass [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=558.0s)]
*  that Echeverria needed medical attention. According to Castro's testimony, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=563.68s)]
*  Captain Pendergrass said, Don't call me if you have live breathing bodies. Only call me [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=568.8s)]
*  if you need a cell extraction or if you have a dead body. Another correction officer, Angel [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=575.04s)]
*  Lazarte, testified as to what happened next. A pharmacy technician on her rounds said Echeverria [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=580.96s)]
*  could die. He then approached Pendergrass, and Pendergrass told him to write an injury report. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=587.52s)]
*  You can see on the tape Pendergrass then went to look into Echeverria's cell himself. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=593.9200000000001s)]
*  He returned and interrupted the writing of the report. Pendergrass led Lazarte away from the [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=599.6800000000001s)]
*  desk. After they talked, Lazarte pocketed the report. According to court records, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=605.92s)]
*  the report was never filed. Echeverria was discovered dead the next morning. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=612.0799999999999s)]
*  The medical examiner ruled his death a homicide due to neglect and denial of medical care. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=618.3199999999999s)]
*  He saw him. He was in pain and everything. Why couldn't you just call an ambulance for him? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=625.12s)]
*  Okay, he's a prisoner. He's an inmate. He's a human being. He's a human being. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=630.1600000000001s)]
*  It both breaks your heart and it makes your blood boil because you're thinking to yourself, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=635.84s)]
*  here's somebody who had responsibility for making sure that peace was enforced, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=639.84s)]
*  but also responsible for the safety and protection of those under his charge. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=645.12s)]
*  And that report was never filed. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=649.2800000000001s)]
*  One of the conclusions we found in our investigation was that in case after case after case, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=652.72s)]
*  sometimes you would have individuals who would witness things and they would get together and [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=658.16s)]
*  they would coach each other into what their response should be, which makes it very difficult [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=662.0s)]
*  to hold anyone accountable. That culture you're describing seems so entrenched that [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=667.2s)]
*  the officers felt almost comfortable behaving like that even with the cameras running. What [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=673.76s)]
*  does that say to you about that culture? It says that the culture is broken. It says that [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=681.0400000000001s)]
*  the institution is broken. Captain Pendergrass was convicted in December 2014. A jury found that [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=686.16s)]
*  Pendergrass violated Jason Echeverria's constitutional rights by deliberately ignoring [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=693.12s)]
*  his pleas for help and depriving him of urgent medical care, leaving Echeverria to die alone [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=698.8s)]
*  in his cell. Pendergrass was sentenced to five years in prison. Officers Castro and Lazarte [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=705.12s)]
*  have since been fired. Union President Norman Seabrook said his officers don't have the training [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=711.6s)]
*  to deal with mentally ill inmates like Jason Echeverria and Bradley Ballard. Your men are not [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=717.2s)]
*  trained? And women? No, they're not trained. Your men and women are not trained to deal with mental [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=722.4s)]
*  illness? Not at all. We asked Norman Seabrook about the internal report showing the vast majority of [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=727.44s)]
*  excessive force cases involving mentally ill inmates. At the end of the day, shouldn't the question be [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=734.48s)]
*  why didn't these individuals receive their medication so they wouldn't attack a correction [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=739.6s)]
*  officer? If you're talking about an inmate that has a mental health problem, then certainly [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=744.0s)]
*  something set this person off. Seabrook says it's not just an issue of the mentally ill. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=748.24s)]
*  Rikers is a dangerous place and many of his officers are assaulted every year. Seabrook [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=753.44s)]
*  wanted to show us the conditions his officers have to contend with, but when he took us out to Rikers, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=760.1600000000001s)]
*  Department of Corrections staffers stopped us from going inside with our cameras to see the [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=765.76s)]
*  problem Seabrook is talking about. This is as far as we got, walking around the perimeter of one of [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=770.4799999999999s)]
*  the buildings with him. We wanted to talk to the Commissioner of the Correction Department about [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=776.7199999999999s)]
*  the problems at Rikers, but our three scheduled interviews all were postponed. The city recently [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=781.52s)]
*  initiated a number of policy changes, like installing more cameras and reducing the use [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=788.4799999999999s)]
*  of solitary confinement. A federal monitor was appointed to ensure the reforms are implemented. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=794.0s)]
*  U.S. Attorney Barrara is going to hold the city to it. Is there a decrease in violence? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=800.24s)]
*  You know, it remains to be seen how much that decrease will be over time. I think [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=806.0s)]
*  the training will take some time and is happening as we speak. It's taken some time to build up this [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=809.92s)]
*  culture of violence. Yes, it has. How long do you think it will take to unravel it? I'm not going [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=814.64s)]
*  to put a clock on it, but I will say that we're impatient people and we'd like to see results. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=819.84s)]
*  That's why we got involved in the first place. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=825.9200000000001s)]
*  The [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=835.92s)]
*  There may be no greater miscarriage of justice than to wrongfully convict a person of murder [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=847.68s)]
*  and sentence him to death. But that's exactly what happened to Glenn Fogg. He spent nearly [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=852.8s)]
*  30 years on death row in solitary confinement in Louisiana's notorious Angola prison until new [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=858.16s)]
*  evidence revealed he did not commit the murder. He was one of 149 inmates freed from death row [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=864.88s)]
*  since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976. In all those exonerations, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=872.32s)]
*  you have likely never heard a prosecutor admit his role and apologize for his mistakes in sending [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=878.96s)]
*  an innocent man to death row. But tonight, a prosecutor's confession. Marty Stroud speaks of [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=885.2s)]
*  an injustice he calls so great it destroyed two lives, Glenn Ford's and his own. I ended up [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=891.84s)]
*  without anybody else's help putting a man on death row who didn't belong there. I mean, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=902.24s)]
*  at the end of the day, beginning, end, middle, whatever you want to call it, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=908.32s)]
*  I did something that was very, very bad. It was 1983 Shreveport, Louisiana, and 32-year-old [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=912.64s)]
*  prosecutor Marty Stroud was assigned his first death penalty case. A local jeweler, Isadora [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=923.92s)]
*  Roseman, had been robbed and murdered. Quickly, Stroud zeroed in on Glenn Ford. Ford had done [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=929.68s)]
*  yard work for Roseman and was known to be a petty thief, and he admitted he had pawned some [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=936.24s)]
*  of the stolen jewelry. All that was enough to make him the primary suspect. Stroud knew a conviction [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=942.16s)]
*  would boost his career. I was arrogant, narcissistic, caught up in the culture of winning. Win regardless [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=949.28s)]
*  of the facts, the truth. Looking back on it, yes, there was a question about other people's [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=961.12s)]
*  involvement. I should have followed up on that. I didn't do that. Why didn't you? I think my [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=966.4000000000001s)]
*  failure to say something can only be described as cowardness. I was a coward. Stroud now admits the [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=972.88s)]
*  cards and the system were stacked against Ford from the beginning. His court-appointed lawyers [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=982.0s)]
*  had never practiced criminal law. What kind of law did they practice? One individual had general [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=987.76s)]
*  civil practice and another one did succession, wills and estates. In a murder trial in Louisiana [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=992.4s)]
*  where a man was on trial for his life. And at the time, I saw nothing wrong with that. In fact, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=999.68s)]
*  I snickered from time to time saying that, you know, this was going to be, we want to get through [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1006.88s)]
*  this case pretty quickly. Stroud's case wasn't strong. There was no physical evidence linking [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1011.76s)]
*  Ford to the crime. The main witness incriminating Ford admitted in court she'd been coerced by police [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1017.92s)]
*  to make up her testimony. But what was more important to Marty Stroud was the composition [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1024.4s)]
*  of the jury. There were no African Americans on the jury. Was that by design? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1030.16s)]
*  At the time of the case, we excluded African Americans because we've, I felt that they would [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1034.8s)]
*  not consider a death penalty where you had a black defendant and a white victim. I was a person [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1048.8s)]
*  that made the final call on the case with respect to jurors. And I was, I was wrong. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1055.92s)]
*  Caddo Parish, Louisiana is predominantly white, yet 77% of those given the death penalty here [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1066.16s)]
*  in the last 40 years have been black. So when Glenn Ford walks into that courtroom, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1074.72s)]
*  he's got a count of O and two against him and a fastball's coming right at his head for strike [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1080.32s)]
*  three. It took the jury less than three hours to find Glenn Ford guilty. Afterward, Stroud and his [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1085.84s)]
*  legal team went out and celebrated sending Ford to death row. I had drinks. I slapped people on the [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1092.1599999999999s)]
*  back. We sang songs. That was utterly disgusting. You know, you see Mother Justice sometimes, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1098.3999999999999s)]
*  a statute and she has a blindfold over her eyes. She was crying that night because that wasn't [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1106.64s)]
*  justice. That wasn't justice at all. Ford was put in solitary confinement in one of the most [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1114.3200000000002s)]
*  infamous lockups in America, Angola. The maximum security prison has a well-earned reputation for [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1124.16s)]
*  harsh penalties and harsher conditions. Summer temperatures on death row commonly exceed 104 [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1130.64s)]
*  degrees. Death row, you have maybe a five by seven foot cell. You're in there every day. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1137.5200000000002s)]
*  You get out one hour a day to walk around and then you come back in. You do that day after day, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1146.3200000000002s)]
*  year after year and that's it. He was basically thrown into a cell and forgotten. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1153.1200000000001s)]
*  Ford would become one of the country's longest serving death row inmates. Stroud went on to a [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1162.4s)]
*  successful legal career, but all that changed when one of the initial suspects, a man named [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1167.5200000000002s)]
*  Jake Robinson, told a police informant he had killed the jeweler three decades earlier. Robinson [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1173.3600000000001s)]
*  is now in prison for another murder. A court review of the new information found there was [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1180.3999999999999s)]
*  credible evidence Glenn Ford was neither present at nor a participant in the robbery and murder of [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1185.9199999999998s)]
*  Isidore Roseman. Stroud's reaction when he was told Ford was innocent? I thought I was gonna throw up, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1192.6399999999999s)]
*  nauseous as it and I felt my face was just turning like a fever, but then the horror of [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1200.72s)]
*  knowing that yours truly had caused him all this pain. Last year Ford was exonerated and released [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1209.6000000000001s)]
*  from Angola. Pictures of his first free moments captured a rainbow in the sky and a smile on his [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1218.4s)]
*  face. What was it like to step outside the walls of that prison? Like stepping in a brand new world, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1224.72s)]
*  like breathing fresh air for the first time. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1230.5600000000002s)]
*  I felt good. But that good feeling didn't last. Shortly after being released Ford learned he had [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1235.3600000000001s)]
*  stage four lung cancer. Doctors told him he only had a few months to live. When we met Glenn Ford, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1242.5600000000002s)]
*  he was living in New Orleans in a home for released prisoners. And that hurts. Just to swallow water. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1249.0400000000002s)]
*  Felt like a flame. You were on death row for 30 years. Yes. Did you ever come close [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1256.64s)]
*  to an execution date? Came within a week because the judge said he was retiring [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1263.76s)]
*  and he wanted to put a death date on me. Did Mr. Ford get justice in this case? I think he has [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1270.5600000000002s)]
*  gotten delayed justice. Dale Cox, the acting district attorney of Caddo Parish, got Glenn [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1278.24s)]
*  Ford released after receiving the informants information. As he sees it, the justice system [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1284.16s)]
*  worked and no one, including Marty Stroud, did anything wrong. I don't know what it is he's [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1290.0s)]
*  apologizing for. I think he's wrong in that the system did not fail, Mr. Ford. It did not. It did [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1295.68s)]
*  not. In fact, the system- How can you say that? Because he's not on death row and that's how I [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1303.2s)]
*  can say it. Getting out of prison after 30 years is justice? Well, it's better than dying there [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1310.24s)]
*  and it's better than being executed. There may be no more controversial prosecutor in the U.S. than [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1316.32s)]
*  Dale Cox. Between 2010 and 2014, his Caddo Parish office put more people on death row per capita [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1322.88s)]
*  than anywhere else in the country. I think society should be employing the death penalty more rather [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1331.76s)]
*  than less. But there have been 10 other inmates on death row in Louisiana who have been exonerated. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1338.72s)]
*  Clearly, the system is not flawless. Are you sure that you've gotten it right all the time? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1348.4s)]
*  I'm reasonably confident that I've gotten it right. Reasonably confident? Am I arrogant enough? Am I [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1355.52s)]
*  narcissistic enough to say I couldn't make a mistake? Of course not. But until this information [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1362.72s)]
*  came out, the state was convinced that Mr. Ford was guilty. Yes. He could have been killed. Yes. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1368.16s)]
*  And it would have been a mistake. Yes. It sounds like you're saying that's just a risk we have to take. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1376.8000000000002s)]
*  Yes. If I had gotten this information too late, all of us would have been aggrieved beyond description. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1384.72s)]
*  We don't want to do this to people who are not guilty of the crime they're charged with. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1394.4s)]
*  According to Louisiana law, Glenn Ford was entitled to $330,000, about $11,000 for every [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1401.76s)]
*  year of wrongful imprisonment. But the state is denying him the money. Why? In the original trial, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1409.28s)]
*  prosecutors said Ford knew a robbery of Roseman's jewelry shop was going to take place, but he [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1416.8s)]
*  didn't report it. Ford was never charged with that crime, but the state says that's reason enough [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1422.32s)]
*  to deny him. Do you believe he should be compensated for the time he spent in prison? No. I think we [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1428.96s)]
*  need to follow the law. And the statute does not require that you be charged or convicted or arrested [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1434.8799999999999s)]
*  for any of these other crimes. The statute only requires that Mr. Ford prove he didn't do these [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1443.12s)]
*  other crimes. So he's guilty until proven innocent in this case? No, because it's not a question of [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1449.68s)]
*  guilt or innocence. It's a question of whether he's entitled to money, taxpayer money. But you say he [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1456.88s)]
*  has to prove that he's innocent of these other charges, these other crimes for which he's never [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1461.92s)]
*  been charged, for which he's never been tried. That's correct. He has to prove that he's innocent [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1467.52s)]
*  of them in order to get the compensation. That's correct. I'm trying to understand. He was punished [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1471.68s)]
*  for something that he might have done that doesn't seem fair. You want fairness. Isn't the law [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1477.92s)]
*  supposed to provide fairness? It is supposed to provide justice. You don't think he deserves [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1486.4s)]
*  compensation? I think that the law must be followed. What law is this? I've never heard of such a law [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1494.16s)]
*  where it says it's okay to do what they did to me without any type of compensation. There was some [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1503.92s)]
*  compensation. Glenn Ford was given a $20 gift card the day he left Angola prison. He gave me a card [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1512.0800000000002s)]
*  for $20 and said, wish you luck. How long did that last you? One meal. I had some fried chicken, tea, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1519.3600000000001s)]
*  and the french fries came with it. I had $4 in change left. After 30 years in prison. Right. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1530.32s)]
*  30 years on death row in solitary confinement and the state of Louisiana releases Mr. Ford with a [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1541.12s)]
*  $20 gift card. You're trying to portray the state of Louisiana as some kind of monster. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1547.12s)]
*  I got him out of jail as quickly as I could. That's what the obligation of the state is. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1556.1599999999999s)]
*  And that's the end of the state's obligation. As far as I'm concerned. What about compassion? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1561.52s)]
*  Have you no compassion for what Mr. Ford has been through? Well, you don't know me at all, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1568.32s)]
*  do you? But you have no problem asking that question. No, I'm asking because I'm seeking an [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1576.56s)]
*  answer. I'm not in the compassion business. None of us as prosecutors or defense lawyers are in the [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1581.68s)]
*  compassion business. I think the ministry is in the compassion business. We're in the legal business. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1589.2s)]
*  So to suggest that somehow what has happened to Glenn Ford is abhorrent. Yes, it's unfair, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1597.44s)]
*  but it's not illegal. And it's not even immoral. It just doesn't fit your perception of fairness. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1604.3999999999999s)]
*  I would say in this case, many, many, many people would see this as unfair. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1614.8s)]
*  I agree. I can't disagree with that. For his part, Marty Stroud says Glenn [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1621.84s)]
*  Ford deserves every penny owed him. He went to see Ford to apologize. How do you apologize [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1629.84s)]
*  to someone for taking 30 years of his life from him? Well, there's no books you can read to do [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1636.8s)]
*  that. I just went in and apologized. Do you forgive him? No. He didn't only take from me, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1643.28s)]
*  he took from my whole family. So it sounds like you don't think you could ever forgive him. Why I don't? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1652.24s)]
*  But I'm still trying though. Do you think you deserve his forgiveness? No. If somebody had done [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1660.8s)]
*  that to me, I don't know if I could forgive them. You say you destroyed his life. Sounds like this [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1668.32s)]
*  incident destroyed your life too. I've got a hole in me through which the North wind blows. It's a [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1674.56s)]
*  sense of coldness. It's a sense of just disgust. There's just nothing out there that can fill in [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1682.4s)]
*  that hole. It says it's all right. Well, it's not all right. It's not all right. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1691.3600000000001s)]
*  Keep your eyes on the prize. Hold on. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1697.52s)]
*  Three weeks after we met him, Glen Ford died, penniless. His final months he lived off charity. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1706.08s)]
*  Donations covered the cost of his funeral. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1713.2s)]
*  There was a tragic outcome and these tragic outcomes happen all the time in life. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1719.6000000000001s)]
*  It's not like the Glen Ford case is the only tragedy you'll ever see or I'll ever see in our [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1726.96s)]
*  lifetime. The question is, was there anything illegally done, improperly done that led to this? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1734.4s)]
*  And I can comfortably say based on the review of the record, no, there was not. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1743.3600000000001s)]
*  In Glen Ford's will, he directs that any state money he might receive go to his 10 grandchildren [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1748.64s)]
*  so they can have a better chance than he did. And Marty Stroud, he has asked the Louisiana Bar [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1755.12s)]
*  Association to discipline him for his role in the Ford case. It was a train to injustice and I was [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1761.6799999999998s)]
*  the engineer. Glen Ford will be a part of me until the day I die. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1768.32s)]
*  It's a cliche of courtroom dramas. That moment when the eyewitness is asked, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1775.6s)]
*  do you see the person who committed the crime here in this courtroom before you? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1781.04s)]
*  Well, it happens in real courtrooms all the time. And it's a very, very, very, very, very, very [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1785.68s)]
*  very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1793.04s)]
*  And to jurors, that point of the finger by a confident witness is about as damning as evidence can get. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1800.32s)]
*  But there is one type of evidence that's even more persuasive, and that of course is DNA. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1813.84s)]
*  There have been 233 people exonerated by DNA in this country, and now a stunning pattern has emerged. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1819.6799999999998s)]
*  More than three quarters of them were sent to prison, at least in part, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1828.0s)]
*  because an eyewitness pointed a finger. An eyewitness who we now know was wrong. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1831.92s)]
*  It was hot and humid in Burlington, North Carolina on the night of July 28, 1984. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1841.52s)]
*  Jennifer Thompson, then a 22-year-old college student, had gone to bed early in her off-campus [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1849.12s)]
*  apartment. As she slept, a man shattered the light bulb near her back door, cut her phone line, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1855.2s)]
*  and broke in. I remember kind of waking up and turning my head to the side and saying, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1862.88s)]
*  who's there, who is it? And I saw the top of someone's head kind of sliding beside my mattress, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1867.76s)]
*  and I screamed, and I felt a blade go to my throat. A knife? A knife. And he told me to shut up or he [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1874.8s)]
*  was going to kill me. Her first thought was to offer him anything she had to go away. You can [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1881.36s)]
*  have my credit card, you can have my wallet, you can have anything in the apartment, you can have [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1887.52s)]
*  my car. And he looked at me and said, I don't want your money. And I knew what was getting ready to [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1891.76s)]
*  happen. She vowed to stay alert and study him so that if she lived, she could help put him away [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1897.84s)]
*  What is his voice? Does he have an accent? Does he have a scar? Is there a tattoo? He's raping you, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1906.48s)]
*  and you're studying his face. It was just trying to pay attention to a detail that if I survived, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1912.24s)]
*  and that was my plan, I'd be able to help the police catch him. After about half an hour, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1918.8s)]
*  Jennifer tricked the rapist into letting her get up and fix him a drink, and she ran out the back [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1924.72s)]
*  door. He fled and raped a second woman half a mile away. Detective Mike Galdon met Jennifer [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1930.8s)]
*  at the hospital. The first comment I remember her making was that I'm going to get this guy that [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1938.1599999999999s)]
*  did this to me. She said I took the time to look at him. I will be able to identify him if I'm [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1942.96s)]
*  given an opportunity. Detective Galdon worked with Jennifer to make a composite sketch, pouring over [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1949.6s)]
*  eyes, noses, ears, lips, trying to recreate the face she had seen that night. The sketch went out [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1955.6s)]
*  and tips started coming in. One of those tips was about a young man named Ronald Cotton, who worked [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1963.04s)]
*  at a restaurant near the scene of both rapes and had a record, a guilty plea to breaking and entering [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1969.52s)]
*  and as a teenager to sexual assault. Three days after the rape, Mike Galdon called Jennifer in to [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1976.24s)]
*  do a photo lineup. He laid these six pictures down on the table, said the perpetrator may or may not [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1983.2s)]
*  be one of them, and told her to take her time. Does she say immediately that's him? No, she studied [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1990.48s)]
*  each photograph. I can remember almost feeling like I was at an SAT test. You know, we start [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=1999.92s)]
*  narrowing down your choices. You can discount A and B. Oh, like multiple choice. Exactly. According [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2005.8400000000001s)]
*  to the police report, Jennifer studied the pictures for five minutes. She picked up Ron's [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2011.44s)]
*  photograph and said, thanks, the man who raped me. And you must have said, are you sure? And she said, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2016.88s)]
*  yes. Oh, yes, certainly. Ronald Cotton heard the news from his mother's boyfriend. He told me, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2021.68s)]
*  sir, Ron, he said, the police are looking for you. And I said, for what? He told me, for rape, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2027.3600000000001s)]
*  I smacked and commit such a crime like that. Did you panic? I didn't panic. I'm trying to figure out, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2034.3200000000002s)]
*  why. He comes in and gives me a very detailed account of where he was, who he was with that [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2039.36s)]
*  night. As it turns out, that was a false alibi. I realized later that I had got my weekends confused, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2046.72s)]
*  and so therefore, that gave him the reason to think that I was lying. This was August 1st, 1984. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2055.2s)]
*  Right. You go in to clear yourself. When did you actually leave? I didn't. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2061.2799999999997s)]
*  And he was locked up and days later put in a physical lineup. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2066.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm number five. You scared? I was very scared, nervous. I was so nervous. I was trembling. I [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2072.8799999999997s)]
*  felt my body just shaking. They were asked to step forward, speak, and step back. I can remember [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2079.04s)]
*  looking to the detective and saying, it's between four and five. Can I have them do it again? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2086.56s)]
*  And then she knew. It was number five, Ronald Cotton. Did you feel absolutely certain? Absolutely [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2091.36s)]
*  certain. Did anybody say to you, good job? Well, what was said to me afterwards was, that's the [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2098.0s)]
*  same person you picked out in the photo lineup. So in my mind, I thought, bingo, I did it right. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2103.92s)]
*  I did it right. In a week-long trial, the jury heard about Ronald Cotton's faulty alibi, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2112.6400000000003s)]
*  his clothing that matched Jennifer's description, and a piece of foam found on her floor that seemed [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2119.44s)]
*  to come from one of his shoes. And most powerfully, they heard from Jennifer. When they ask you, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2125.84s)]
*  do you recognize the man who did this to you? Did you point to him? It was Ronald Cotton. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2132.88s)]
*  It was Ronald Cotton. She called my name point of finger, and that's all it takes, it seemed like. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2138.64s)]
*  What did that feel like? It felt like someone pushing a knife through me. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2145.2s)]
*  It took the jury just 40 minutes. The verdict? Guilty on all counts. He was sentenced to life [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2149.44s)]
*  in 50 years, and it was for me that moment that you know the justice system works, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2156.56s)]
*  because I am the victim, and he's a horrible person, and he will never ever be free again. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2164.64s)]
*  Ronald Cotton was handcuffed, shackled, and taken to North Carolina's Central Prison. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2170.7200000000003s)]
*  He was 22 years old. You know, they say grown men don't cry, but that's a lot. You know, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2176.48s)]
*  I grabbed my pillow many times and hugged it. I was hugging my mom, my dad, sister, brother. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2181.84s)]
*  I wish it didn't have to be this way. He started working in the prison kitchen, singing in the choir, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2187.2000000000003s)]
*  and writing letter after letter to his attorneys, hoping to get a new trial. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2195.28s)]
*  Then one day, as he watched a new inmate being brought in, he had a strange feeling. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2201.36s)]
*  I said, excuse me. I said, I said, you look familiar? I said, where are you from? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2207.6800000000003s)]
*  He said, I'm from Burlington. I said, I am too. I said, you kind of resemble the drawing of a [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2212.0s)]
*  suspect in a crime in which I'm falsely in prison. Did you commit this crime? And he told me no, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2215.76s)]
*  he did not. Wait a sec. You saw him and thought of that composite drawing? His name was Bobby Poole, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2220.0s)]
*  and he was in for rape. He started working in the prison kitchen too. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2228.24s)]
*  The stewardess were calling me Poole instead of Cotton. They were calling you by his name? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2233.04s)]
*  Yes. In other words, people were mistaking the two of you. Yes, exactly. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2237.76s)]
*  Then a fellow inmate told him that he'd heard Bobby Poole admit to raping Jennifer and the [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2242.08s)]
*  other woman that night. Ronald Cotton won a new trial, and his lawyers called Bobby Poole to the [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2248.0s)]
*  stand with Jennifer sitting right there. It was the moment Ronald Cotton had been hoping for. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2254.96s)]
*  Bobby Poole is in the courtroom. You look over there. What happens inside you? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2260.88s)]
*  Nothing. Nothing? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2267.6s)]
*  Nothing. As a matter of fact, the strongest emotion I felt was anger at the defense [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2269.68s)]
*  because I thought, how dare you? How dare you question me? How dare you try to paint me as [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2275.36s)]
*  someone who could possibly have forgotten what my rapist looked like? I mean, the one person [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2280.96s)]
*  you would never forget? How dare you? Ronald Cotton was convicted again, this time given [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2286.88s)]
*  two life sentences. Back in prison, seven years later, he and everyone else was riveted by a big [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2294.1600000000003s)]
*  news story, the trial of O.J. Simpson. I would get my radio, put my earplugs, and go outside, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2301.44s)]
*  sit in a corner. And listen to the trial? Yes. He was intrigued by something he had never heard of, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2307.52s)]
*  DNA. He wrote to his new attorney, law professor Rich Rosen. Rosen warned him that there probably [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2314.08s)]
*  wasn't any evidence left to test, and if there was, DNA could cut both ways. Understand, if the DNA [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2321.12s)]
*  comes back and shows that you did this crime, whatever legal issues we have don't make any bit [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2330.48s)]
*  of difference. You're going to spend the rest of your life in prison. He warned you that if it comes [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2337.6s)]
*  up positive, you're sunk. I told him to put his foot down and go with it. Packed away on the shelves [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2343.04s)]
*  of the Burlington Police Department was 10-year-old evidence from the two rapes that night. Inside one [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2348.48s)]
*  of the rape kits was a fragment of a single sperm with viable DNA. It proved what Ronald [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2355.04s)]
*  Cotton had been saying all along. He was innocent, and the rapist was Bobby Poole. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2362.16s)]
*  Within days, Ronald Cotton was back in court. You're walking out here today as free man. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2371.12s)]
*  This time to be released. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2377.44s)]
*  So not only do you find out that Ron didn't do the crime, you find out Bobby Poole did. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2381.44s)]
*  It was just utter shock really, disbelief. I mean, by this time, this is 11 years later, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2387.68s)]
*  and you know, I know that I've been involved in a case of a man who's lost 11 years of his life, and [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2395.44s)]
*  I just, I was so sad for him and his family. In the years since Ronald Cotton's conviction, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2404.2400000000002s)]
*  Jennifer had married and had children. Are you the one that tells her? Yes. Her reaction, no, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2410.48s)]
*  it can't be true. It's not possible, you know. I know Ronald Cotton raped me. There's no question [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2415.92s)]
*  in my mind. It was like someone had just taken my life and like turned it upside down. She cried? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2421.84s)]
*  Oh, she cried. She broke down. I mean, she took it all on herself, you know, the guilt. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2427.52s)]
*  You know, I did this to that man. Shame? Shame, terrible shame, suffocating, debilitating shame. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2434.96s)]
*  But when she thought or dreamed about that night, it was still Ronald Cotton's face she saw. To get [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2444.8s)]
*  past it, she asked if he would meet with her at a local church. I remember him walking into [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2451.7599999999998s)]
*  the church, and I physically could not stand up. She was nervous, scared. I started to cry [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2458.3199999999997s)]
*  immediately, and I looked at him and I said, Ron, if I spent every second of every minute, every [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2465.6s)]
*  hour for the rest of my life telling you how sorry I am, it wouldn't come close to how my heart feels. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2474.0s)]
*  I'm so sorry. And Ronald just leaned down. He took my hands. Oh, gosh. And he looked at me. He said, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2479.6s)]
*  I forgive you. I told her, I said, Jennifer, I forgive you. I don't want you to look over your [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2486.32s)]
*  shoulder. I just want us to be happy and move on in life. The minute he forgave me, it's like my heart [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2494.24s)]
*  physically started to heal. And I thought, this is what grace and mercy is all about. This is what [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2502.7200000000003s)]
*  they teach you in church that none of us ever get. And here was this man that I had hated. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2511.0400000000004s)]
*  I mean, I used to pray every day of my life during those 11 years that he would die, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2518.0800000000004s)]
*  that he would be raped in prison and someone would kill him in prison. That was my prayer to God. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2524.8s)]
*  And here was this man who, with grace and mercy, just forgave me. That is overwhelming. It's [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2531.28s)]
*  overwhelming how wrong I was and how good he is. How is it that Jennifer could have studied her [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2540.0800000000004s)]
*  rapist so carefully and still made this mistake? And how could she have failed to recognize Bobby [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2548.32s)]
*  Poole, the actual rapist, when he sat right in front of her in the courtroom three years later? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2554.48s)]
*  That part of the story when we come back. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2560.48s)]
*  Now that DNA has exonerated more than 230 men, mostly in sex crimes and murder cases, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2574.0s)]
*  criminologists have been able to go back and study what went wrong in those investigations. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2580.7200000000003s)]
*  What they've honed in on is faulty eyewitness testimony. Over 75 percent of these innocent men [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2586.48s)]
*  were convicted in part because an eyewitness fingered the wrong person. At the heart of the [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2593.28s)]
*  problem is the fragility of memory. As one researcher told us, we now know that memory is [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2599.1200000000003s)]
*  not like a videotape recorder. You don't just record an event and play it back. Instead, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2605.44s)]
*  memory is malleable, full of holes, easily contaminated and susceptible to suggestion, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2612.16s)]
*  as in the case of Jennifer Thompson and Ronald Cotton. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2618.48s)]
*  Before this case, did you think that there were a lot of innocent people put away? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2622.7999999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2628.7999999999997s)]
*  You didn't? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2629.52s)]
*  No, I didn't. Innocent people aren't convicted of crimes they didn't commit. I believed that. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2630.08s)]
*  What do you think now? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2637.2s)]
*  Oh, I know better. I mean, well over 200 cases nationally. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2638.0s)]
*  We've had a half dozen in this state alone. The first, of course, was my case. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2641.68s)]
*  And as these innocent men have been freed in one state after the next, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2649.28s)]
*  we've learned something else. That in all the cases where eyewitnesses were wrong, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2653.76s)]
*  the real perpetrator was not in the initial lineup. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2658.72s)]
*  When you're sitting in front of a photo lineup, you just assume [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2662.96s)]
*  one of these guys is the suspect. It's my job to find it. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2666.8s)]
*  And Jennifer did her job. She found the suspect's photo. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2671.28s)]
*  Problem is, the suspect, Ronald Cotton, was not the rapist. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2675.92s)]
*  Bobby Poole's photograph was not in the photo lineup. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2680.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2683.28s)]
*  He was not in the physical lineup. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2683.68s)]
*  When the real perpetrator is not in the set, is none of them, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2685.44s)]
*  witnesses have a very difficult time being able to recognize that. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2689.92s)]
*  Gary Wells, a professor of psychology at Iowa State University, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2693.6s)]
*  has been studying eyewitness memory for 30 years. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2698.0s)]
*  He says when the real guy isn't there, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2701.52s)]
*  witnesses tend to pick the person who looks most like him. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2704.08s)]
*  I think that Ronald Cotton and Bobby Poole look very much alike. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2707.7599999999998s)]
*  They have very similar lips, shape of their eyes, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2712.7999999999997s)]
*  their eyebrows kind of go up in a look of surprise. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2716.0s)]
*  Without him in the lineup, Ronald Cotton was the one who was in jeopardy. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2719.92s)]
*  Wells says eyewitness testimony has two key properties. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2724.8s)]
*  One, it's often unreliable, and two, it is highly persuasive to jurors. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2728.7200000000003s)]
*  I can see why it's so persuasive. Someone says, I was there. You'd believe that person. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2734.6400000000003s)]
*  You believe that person because they have no reason to lie. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2739.92s)]
*  The legal system is set up to kind of sort between liars and truth-tellers, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2742.7200000000003s)]
*  and it's actually pretty good at that. But when someone is genuinely mistaken, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2746.64s)]
*  the legal system doesn't really know how to deal with that, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2750.96s)]
*  and we're talking about a genuine error here. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2754.24s)]
*  He walked us through what went wrong, some of it counterintuitive. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2756.48s)]
*  When Jennifer spent five minutes studying the photographs, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2761.12s)]
*  she and Detective Galden thought she was being careful. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2764.72s)]
*  I didn't want to come across, I don't think, as somebody who was like, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2768.24s)]
*  that's the one. I really wanted to be sure. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2771.68s)]
*  Wells says no good. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2774.48s)]
*  Recognition memory is actually quite rapid. So we find in our studies, for example, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2776.32s)]
*  that if somebody's taking longer than 10, 15 seconds, it's quite likely that they're doing [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2781.84s)]
*  something other than just using reliable recognition memory. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2786.88s)]
*  So you're saying if she really recognized a guy, it would have been almost instantaneous. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2790.7200000000003s)]
*  Quite quick, yes. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2795.76s)]
*  He says a better way would have been to show Jennifer line up photos or people one at a time [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2797.1200000000003s)]
*  so that she would compare each one directly to her memory rather than to one another. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2802.96s)]
*  Wells showed me a study in which more than 300 subjects were shown deliberately shaky [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2808.7200000000003s)]
*  videotape of a simulated crime. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2813.44s)]
*  You look out a window and you see some suspicious behavior. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2815.84s)]
*  What happens is we tell them later than this person that you saw right there, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2819.84s)]
*  put a bomb down the air shaft there. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2825.28s)]
*  Then subjects are shown a line up and asked to identify the bomber. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2828.7200000000003s)]
*  That would be so hard. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2833.12s)]
*  Very difficult. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2835.84s)]
*  And of course, you're particularly cautious right now. You know now after we've talked, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2837.2s)]
*  probably not to pick anyone. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2843.2s)]
*  No, no, actually, I know I actually know who it is because if I had come upon that, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2844.7200000000003s)]
*  I think it's this guy. Am I wrong? Am I wrong? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2851.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2854.4s)]
*  I'm wrong? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2854.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2855.44s)]
*  Okay, so there you go. And I'm already saying how hard it is. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2855.92s)]
*  It's none of them. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2861.12s)]
*  It's not. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2862.56s)]
*  And it's so, it's so, and you know about it. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2862.96s)]
*  Isn't that bizarre. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2866.0s)]
*  You know about this. We've talked about this. So this is the difficult, this is what makes it so [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2866.6400000000003s)]
*  difficult. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2872.1600000000003s)]
*  Look what you just did to me. I'm mortified. I feel like Jennifer. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2872.2400000000002s)]
*  Wells says in real life, the mistake is often compounded by what happens next. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2876.96s)]
*  Remember the seemingly innocent information Jennifer says she got from police after she [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2882.0s)]
*  picked Ronald Cotton out of the physical line up? [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2887.28s)]
*  That's the same person you picked out in the photo line up. So in my mind, I thought, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2889.76s)]
*  bingo, I did it right. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2896.0s)]
*  Wells studied what that reinforcement does. After half his subjects did what I did, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2898.8s)]
*  picked an innocent person from this line up, he told them nothing. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2904.5600000000004s)]
*  Then asked them questions about what they had seen. Very few felt highly confident about their [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2909.36s)]
*  choice. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2915.6000000000004s)]
*  Only about 4% are saying they had a great view, which is good because we gave them a lousy view. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2916.24s)]
*  Only about 3% are saying they make out details of the face. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2921.6s)]
*  That also is good because they really couldn't. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2924.72s)]
*  But he told a second group of subjects after they made the same incorrect choices, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2927.68s)]
*  good, you pick the suspect. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2932.8799999999997s)]
*  Now what happens is almost 45% of witnesses now report that they were positive or nearly positive. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2935.2s)]
*  Notice that over one fourth of them now say they had a great view. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2943.44s)]
*  This is really what happened to Jennifer. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2947.6s)]
*  It is what happened with Jennifer. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2949.68s)]
*  What this seems to be saying is that a reinforcement alters memory. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2951.2000000000003s)]
*  It does. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2957.28s)]
*  Dramatically. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2958.4s)]
*  It does. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2959.2000000000003s)]
*  He says the solution is to have someone independent administer the line up, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2959.84s)]
*  someone who doesn't even know who the suspect is, and certainly not the detective on the case. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2964.48s)]
*  You shouldn't have been there. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2970.4s)]
*  I shouldn't have been there. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2971.52s)]
*  But nobody did anything wrong. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2972.56s)]
*  That was a common practice then. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2974.64s)]
*  It was the tradition. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2976.16s)]
*  It was how it was done then. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2978.0s)]
*  Law enforcement wasn't schooled in memory. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2980.88s)]
*  We weren't schooled in protecting memory, treating it like a crime scene [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2985.2799999999997s)]
*  where you're very careful and methodical about what you do and how you use it. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2990.96s)]
*  We weren't taught that in those days. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2996.64s)]
*  But none of these errors explains perhaps the most puzzling part of this story. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=2998.8s)]
*  How it is that Jennifer could see Bobby Poole in the courtroom and not realize her mistake. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3004.0s)]
*  You're looking into the face of the man who raped you whose face you had studied so intently. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3010.0s)]
*  There's no flicker, nothing between you and Bobby Poole. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3016.6400000000003s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3020.48s)]
*  I have gone back there many times trying to think, was there ever a moment? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3022.8s)]
*  Did I ever look at him and think, and I didn't. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3028.24s)]
*  Elizabeth Loftus is a professor of psychology and law at the University of California Irvine [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3032.24s)]
*  and an expert in memory. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3038.3999999999996s)]
*  She showed me an experiment she says might help explain Jennifer's mistake. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3040.64s)]
*  She asked me to study these faces. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3046.0s)]
*  Then after a few minutes, she gave me a memory test. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3051.52s)]
*  Which of these two faces do you recognize? [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3055.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3058.56s)]
*  Okay, you picked right. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3059.52s)]
*  Left. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3063.04s)]
*  You picked left. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3064.0s)]
*  I said left, but I wasn't 100% sure. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3065.68s)]
*  And then the tricky part. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3068.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3070.4799999999996s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you why I'm stymied. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3074.7999999999997s)]
*  Because I just picked this one on the left two seconds ago. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3076.7999999999997s)]
*  But now I'm not sure. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3081.7599999999998s)]
*  Because those two look very much alike to me. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3083.3599999999997s)]
*  But I'm going to tell you the left. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3086.7200000000003s)]
*  But I was wrong. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3088.32s)]
*  It was the one on the right. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3089.6000000000004s)]
*  Loftus explained how I had been duped. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3091.6800000000003s)]
*  You saw this face. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3094.88s)]
*  Then I gave you a test where I presented you with an altered face. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3097.36s)]
*  Along with a novel one. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3102.4s)]
*  So I pretty much induced you to pick a wrong face. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3103.84s)]
*  Because I don't even have the real guy there. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3107.6000000000004s)]
*  It's an altered version. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3110.48s)]
*  And later on, when you now have a choice between the altered one and the real one. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3112.16s)]
*  You stuck with your altered left choice. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3118.64s)]
*  This is exactly what happened to Jennifer. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3121.92s)]
*  This can help us understand why Jennifer can be sitting in a courtroom. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3124.7999999999997s)]
*  And be looking at Bobby Poole, the original rapist. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3129.68s)]
*  And looking at Ronald Cotton and saying, no, it's not Poole. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3132.96s)]
*  It's Cotton. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3137.8399999999997s)]
*  Because she has been picking him. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3139.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3141.6s)]
*  All along. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3142.0s)]
*  I begin to wonder whether there should ever be eyewitness testimony in trials. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3143.12s)]
*  Because of the tricks that memory plays. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3148.72s)]
*  I think what's important though is to understand that. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3151.52s)]
*  Know that. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3155.04s)]
*  Know it as a police officer, as an investigator, as attorneys. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3156.16s)]
*  We need eyewitnesses. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3159.92s)]
*  I mean, if we couldn't convict based on an eyewitness. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3161.2s)]
*  That's giving a lot of comfort to criminals. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3165.84s)]
*  We have no choice. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3168.8s)]
*  We have to find ways to make this evidence better. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3170.32s)]
*  And that's something Jennifer has tried to do ever since. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3175.04s)]
*  By telling her story to prosecutors, police, defense attorneys. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3178.48s)]
*  And she's had some success. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3183.2000000000003s)]
*  Her state, North Carolina, was the first in the country to mandate reforms by law. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3185.36s)]
*  Showing victims line up photos one at a time. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3191.84s)]
*  And emphasizing that the right answer may be none of the above. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3194.88s)]
*  Having lineups conducted by a person who doesn't know who the suspect is. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3199.2s)]
*  Or not by a person at all. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3204.32s)]
*  The person who committed the crime may or may not be included. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3206.72s)]
*  One system now used in a handful of cities is computer software Mike [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3211.6s)]
*  Galden helped develop to have a laptop conduct photo lineups. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3216.24s)]
*  Does this person look familiar to you? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3220.7999999999997s)]
*  But law professor Rich Rosen says that in the vast majority of places, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3223.6s)]
*  there's been no reform and that needs to change. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3227.44s)]
*  This is something that police officers can and should be in favor of. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3230.88s)]
*  Because you're not getting the real guy off the street. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3235.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3238.32s)]
*  Bobby Poole raped other women because they went after Ron Cotton. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3238.88s)]
*  So Ron is not the only person who suffered from this mistake. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3243.6s)]
*  Ronald Cotton, now 47 years old, has worked hard to rebuild his life. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3249.04s)]
*  He works the late shift in a factory. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3254.88s)]
*  He's been married for 12 years and has a 10-year-old daughter. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3257.44s)]
*  They live in a house paid for with money North Carolina paid him in restitution. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3261.6s)]
*  $10,000 for each of the 11 years he spent in prison. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3266.56s)]
*  When he can, he joins Jennifer in her campaign for reforms. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3271.28s)]
*  One of the most amazing things to have come out of this miscarriage of justice [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3275.52s)]
*  is the most unlikely of friendships. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3280.2400000000002s)]
*  Jennifer and Ron say they speak on the phone about once a week. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3283.36s)]
*  They're families of friends. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3287.04s)]
*  They say they have a shared bond that is hard for most people to fathom. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3288.96s)]
*  Have people ever met you for the first time when you're together [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3293.84s)]
*  and said kind of cheerily, hey, how did you two meet? [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3298.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3300.64s)]
*  They had. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3301.6s)]
*  We did it on the airplane a lot. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3301.92s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3303.12s)]
*  We're traveling. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3303.6s)]
*  And I usually just go, you tell them. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3304.64s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3307.12s)]
*  We would look at each other and laugh, you know, and finally we go ahead and. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3308.32s)]
*  And tell them. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3312.32s)]
*  And they have recently co-authored a book in hopes that their story [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3313.36s)]
*  can inform and inspire others. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3317.12s)]
*  Today, when you think about what happened to you that night when you were 22 years old, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3319.76s)]
*  whose face is there? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3325.6800000000003s)]
*  Nobody's. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3327.28s)]
*  Oh, my. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3328.32s)]
*  That to me is one of the most beautiful things is I don't have a face. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3329.76s)]
*  Bobby Poole's dead. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3335.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't ever have to worry about him ever hurt another woman. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3336.96s)]
*  He died in prison. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3339.6800000000003s)]
*  And Ronald Cotton is my friend. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYLWtFKR0xk&t=3340.56s)]
