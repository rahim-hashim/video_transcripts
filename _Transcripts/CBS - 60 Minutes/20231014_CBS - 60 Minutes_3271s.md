# Jailhouse Snitches; Questionable Informants; Cook County Jail | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [October 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg)
*  Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=0.0s)]
*  Orange County, California, an hour south of Los Angeles, is best known for its wealthy, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=13.52s)]
*  sprawling suburbs, Tony Beach communities, and Disneyland. But lately it has drawn unwanted [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=19.12s)]
*  attention from the California Attorney General and the U.S. Department of Justice for the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=25.48s)]
*  way its prosecutors use informants in its jails. Used correctly, informants can be valuable [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=30.48s)]
*  assets to law enforcement to help bolster their cases. Misuse, their work can backfire, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  upsetting the scales of justice, reversing convictions, and freeing guilty criminals. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=43.64s)]
*  That's what's happening in Orange County. This is a story of two snitches, one who remains in jail, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=50.04s)]
*  the other is back on the streets, but now he's snitching on the prosecutors he once loyally served. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=57.04s)]
*  How many times were you arrested? Numerous, numerous, numerous. Five, ten, fifteen? Over a hundred, let's say over a hundred. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  Mark Cleveland is a career criminal. A life of drug addiction etches his face and gave him a rap sheet [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=73.04s)]
*  nearly as textured. Forty years of petty crimes, burglaries, a hit and run. How are you out? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=80.04s)]
*  Because I'm extremely good at providing information to the Sheriff's Department and the District Attorney's Office [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=87.04s)]
*  Cleveland was a jailhouse informant, a snitch. He ratted on other inmates in exchange for time off his sentence. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=97.04s)]
*  You were able to knock how much off your sentence? Well, forty, forty years. Because you were such a good informant? Yeah. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=106.04s)]
*  We met Cleveland at a hotel. He keeps a low profile these days, fearful that former jailmates may seek retribution for betraying them. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=113.04s)]
*  During his decades behind bars, Cleveland said he was willing to do almost anything law enforcement asked of him because he wanted out. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=123.04s)]
*  The problem is the desperation to get out and the willingness of the District Attorney to use us and the propensity for unreliability is huge. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=132.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, we want out of jail willing to do anything. And willing to say anything. And say anything, right. Snitches will lie. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=140.04000000000002s)]
*  Y'all snitches do lie every opportunity. If they need to, they will. It's about getting out of jail. What do I have to do to get out of jail? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=146.04s)]
*  That's the end game for everybody. Sure as hell has been. Did you, Mark Cleveland, ever lie about information that you got from another inmate? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=153.04s)]
*  Give wrong information. Give wrong information. Not another inmate. No, I'm sure that a lot of my information was probably maybe tainted. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=164.04s)]
*  Cleveland explains he was part of a sophisticated secret network of informants tightly organized and directed by law enforcement inside the Orange County jails. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=175.04s)]
*  He says it worked like this. Jail deputies would plant snitches like him near high profile targets. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=186.04s)]
*  Then the deputies guided the snitches to fish for information that might help bolster the prosecutor's cases. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=194.04s)]
*  Cleveland recalls one deputy asked him to target a member of the Mexican mafia, a notorious gang that rules much of the prison turf in California. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=201.04s)]
*  He said, we want him on a murder. And if you could give us any information on that, I'll personally walk you out of the jails. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=210.04s)]
*  He told you he'd walk you out of the jail? Yeah. And I said, well, I'm not in there with him. He said, well, just move you and we'll put you right there with him. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=219.04s)]
*  For the most part, the people that you were informing on, was it a coincidence that you heard what they said or were you placed there? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=227.04s)]
*  I was placed there. It's something that they do. He indicated it was something they do regularly. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=233.04s)]
*  What Cleveland is describing is unconstitutional. The integrity of the justice system is based on everybody following the rules. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=238.04s)]
*  If an inmate just happens to hear and pass on incriminating information to prosecutors, that's OK. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=247.04s)]
*  But inmates cannot be planted and directed to gather information from someone who's already been charged with a crime. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=253.04s)]
*  If they do that, they are illegally acting as agents of law enforcement, which is exactly how Mark Cleveland saw himself. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  What you see here in this briefcase is full of documents and copies of documents and notes and evidence of everything that I've done. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=270.04s)]
*  Cleveland showed us some of the meticulous handwritten copies of notes he sent to prosecutors, hundreds of pages on dozens of cases. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=279.04s)]
*  And he said whenever he needed to, he could call the district attorney's office to report on his jailmates. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=289.04s)]
*  You had a direct line to the DA's office. I could get on the phone anytime I want, night or day. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=296.04s)]
*  I thought you were limited on how many phone calls you could make. Oh, you are, unless you're Mark Cleveland. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=302.04s)]
*  It sounds like you were working for the district attorney's office. I was. I was working right there with Tony. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=307.04s)]
*  I would call him up and he loved it. Every time I'd call him, oh, you know, this is great. We really appreciate it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=312.04s)]
*  Tony is Tony Rokakis, the Orange County District Attorney. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=320.04s)]
*  Mark Cleveland, do you know who he is? Does that ring a bell? I do know who he is. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=324.04s)]
*  I remember him having been an informant many years ago in a case or two. My memory on that actually is not that clear. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=328.04s)]
*  Rokakis is a former judge and a veteran prosecutor who has been re-elected four times as district attorney. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=337.04s)]
*  He commands an office of 275 lawyers who handle 15,000 felony cases a year. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=344.04s)]
*  His office is now under investigation by both state and federal authorities for the way it uses and misuses informants in the county jails. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=352.04s)]
*  How should we take Mr. Cleveland's statements that he made to us about all this? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=362.04s)]
*  I think you should assume you're talking to an informant and that if he's talking, he's probably lying. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=367.04s)]
*  But this idea that, you know, he was part of this informant program and that he could just pick up the phone whenever he wanted and call the district attorney's office, you're saying is not true. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=371.04s)]
*  It's fantasy. He told us that he was deliberately placed by deputies in the jail next to inmates to get information. Is that true? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=381.04s)]
*  No, it is not true. They deny, deny, deny. They basically say, we don't have an informant program. There's no organized informant program. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=391.04s)]
*  This is just conspiracy theory on the part of the defense. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=398.04s)]
*  Assistant public defender Scott Sanders first uncovered the existence of a secret jailhouse informant program in Orange County. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=402.04s)]
*  His suspicions peaked back in 2011 after one of the worst days in county history. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=410.04s)]
*  California Highway Patrol. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=417.04s)]
*  Hey, we've got some shootings over here in Still Beach. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=419.04s)]
*  On a sparkling October afternoon, 41-year-old Scott Evans DeCry walked into a beauty salon and shot to death his ex-wife and seven others. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=422.04s)]
*  Minutes later, DeCry was arrested and quickly admitted his crime. D.A. Rikakis called a press conference. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=432.04s)]
*  The only thing that might even approach justice in a case like this is for us to seek the death penalty. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=440.04s)]
*  Sanders, an assistant public defender for decades, was appointed to represent accused killer Scott DeCry. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=445.04s)]
*  A tough job made even tougher when he learned his client had confessed to another snitch in the Orange County jail. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=452.04s)]
*  Named only as Inmate F, the prosecutors tried to keep the informant's true identity hidden, arguing they needed to protect him. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=459.04s)]
*  After months of relentless digging, Sanders finally learned Inmate F was Fernando Perez, a well-documented prolific snitch. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=468.04s)]
*  The representations they made was that Fernando Perez was just a good citizen who was looking for nothing in return, didn't want anything, and was just basically doing this out of the goodness of his heart. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=477.04s)]
*  And you found out he was a Mexican mafia gang leader and had three strikes against him and was desperate to reduce time off of his sentence. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=487.04s)]
*  He had already been convicted. He was looking at a 25-to-life sentence. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=495.04s)]
*  So he had all the incentive in the world to do every last thing he could do to gain favor with the prosecution. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=500.04s)]
*  Something Sanders had seen before. Another one of his clients, also accused of murder, also facing the death penalty, also just happened to confess to Fernando Perez. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=506.04s)]
*  I was stunned. I mean, it was one of those moments where you kind of just look up and go, what's going on here? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=519.04s)]
*  And that's really kind of the starting point. That realization was kind of what propelled us forward. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=524.04s)]
*  In voluminous court documents, Sanders, a zealous opponent of the death penalty, accused the district attorney's office and sheriff's department of illegally planting Perez in the cell next to Decry, then trying to cover it up. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=529.04s)]
*  They hid Perez's long resume as an informant. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=545.04s)]
*  Was Fernando Perez deliberately placed next to Decry in a jail cell? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=549.04s)]
*  Fernando Perez was not deliberately placed next to Decry in the Orange County Jail. Decry was put there on a nurse's order, and Fernando Perez had already been there. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=553.04s)]
*  It seems from the outside like a hell of a coincidence that this guy who's a well-known and valuable informant is placed next to this high-profile target. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=561.04s)]
*  But you're saying it was just that. It was just a coincidence. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=571.04s)]
*  It was just a coincidence. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=575.04s)]
*  Scott Sanders says an amazing coincidence in a jail with 6,000 inmates. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=577.04s)]
*  D.A. Rikakis insisted there was no jailhouse informant program. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=583.04s)]
*  When Mark Cleveland heard that, he called assistant public defender Scott Sanders and went back to his old job of snitching. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=588.04s)]
*  But this time, he began informing on the prosecutors he once served. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=597.04s)]
*  What did he tell you about how the jailhouse informant program works? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=602.04s)]
*  He said we were on to something really bad, and then he started to describe things in details, and the details made sense. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=605.04s)]
*  What did he tell you that you didn't know? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=611.04s)]
*  We were really looking at a relatively small time period. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=613.04s)]
*  Here comes Mark Cleveland and says, no, no, it's been going on for years. Let me take you back to the cases. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=616.04s)]
*  It's simply not the case. That's just not who we are. We prosecute cases in a fair and ethical manner. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=621.04s)]
*  How often does your office use jailhouse informants? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=626.04s)]
*  Not very often. The informants are not the most reliable people around. They're in fact unreliable, and everybody knows that. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=629.04s)]
*  Which is why Cleveland says he and many other inmates gathering information were rarely called to testify. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=636.04s)]
*  So if you weren't testifying, what were they doing with all the information? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=644.04s)]
*  They were getting plea bargains on them. They'd rather than have them put me on the stand. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=647.04s)]
*  They didn't want to put you on the stand? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=652.04s)]
*  No, they didn't want to put me on the stand. They don't want to put any informant on the stand. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=654.04s)]
*  Tony Rokakis argued his prosecutors never intended to put Fernando Perez on the stand either, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=658.04s)]
*  but they did want to hear what Scott Dacry told Perez about the murders. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=664.04s)]
*  Prosecutors worried Dacry might plead insanity to avoid the death penalty, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=670.04s)]
*  so they placed a bug in his cell and started recording as Perez pumped him for details. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=675.04s)]
*  It's not a bad thing to get evidence that would tend to rebut an insanity defense, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=681.04s)]
*  so that a jury could hear him describing the murders and why he did it and what he did. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=685.04s)]
*  But the judge threw out the confession. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=691.04s)]
*  He said Perez was acting as an agent of law enforcement when he egged on Dacry to tell him about the killings, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=694.04s)]
*  a failed ploy that has delayed justice for the families of Scott Dacry's victims for years [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=701.04s)]
*  in what should have been a slam dunk case. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=707.04s)]
*  You had a great case with Dacry. You had confessions, you had witnesses, you had motive. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=710.04s)]
*  Why risk it and use somebody like Fernando Perez as part of your case? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=715.04s)]
*  Well, look, we had a really good case, no question about it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=720.04s)]
*  When you listened to what it was that he had to say to Perez, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=723.04s)]
*  it was a very clear statement of what it was he was doing, his intent, his malice, his reasons. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=726.04s)]
*  Under mounting public and political pressure, the district attorney appointed a blue ribbon panel to look into what happened. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=733.04s)]
*  They described the office as a must-win mentality. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=741.04s)]
*  They described your office as a ship without a rudder. They said there's been a failure of leadership. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=744.04s)]
*  You know, it's interesting they did say those things, and they put that in the writing. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=749.04s)]
*  But I talked to them personally, and they really didn't have that to say personally. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=753.04s)]
*  It's getting around that there's some kind of a conspiracy or there's some kind of willingness to violate people's rights [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=758.04s)]
*  or to not give people a fair trial. That's a false narrative. That's simply not true. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=763.04s)]
*  Okay, so clarify it for me. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=768.04s)]
*  So the public defender made a lot of allegations of all kinds of criminal conduct, of terrible things. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=770.04s)]
*  And believe me, if those things were true, we should be in jail, frankly. If those things were true, that would be very bad. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=776.04s)]
*  But what about the allegations that the office withheld evidence? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=783.04s)]
*  The office did not withhold evidence. We have not withheld any evidence. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=786.04s)]
*  He told us that even after the judge disagreed. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=789.04s)]
*  The judge ruled jail deputies working for the DA's office intentionally lied or willfully withheld material evidence about the secret informant program. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=792.04s)]
*  The judge went on to say that even if the prosecutors didn't know the deputies were hiding evidence, they should have. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=803.04s)]
*  And then the judge went even further. Convinced DeCry could not get a fair trial from Orange County prosecutors, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=810.04s)]
*  he kicked the entire office, all 275 of them, off the case. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=817.04s)]
*  DeCry still hasn't been sentenced, and the informant debacle has led to the unraveling of a half dozen cases, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=822.04s)]
*  putting murders and thugs back on the street. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=830.04s)]
*  As for Fernando Perez, inmate F, his snitching paid off. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=833.04s)]
*  Instead of a life in prison, a judge sentenced him to spend another few years in protective custody, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=837.04s)]
*  and then he'll be released as a reward for all his snitching. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=843.04s)]
*  When many of us hear the term confidential informants, or as law enforcement calls them, CIs, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=848.04s)]
*  we think of mobsters wearing a wire to ensnare their bosses and get themselves a better deal. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=864.04s)]
*  But there's another kind of confidential informant out there that doesn't quite fit the Hollywood image, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=870.04s)]
*  and in reality may be far more common. Young people, many of them college students, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=876.04s)]
*  caught selling small amounts of marijuana who are recruited by law enforcement to wear a wire [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=881.04s)]
*  and make undercover drug buys in exchange for having their charges reduced or dropped altogether. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=887.04s)]
*  It's a practice, we discovered, that's going on across the country, largely under the radar, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=894.04s)]
*  and in some cases with tragic consequences. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=900.04s)]
*  How's it going today? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=905.04s)]
*  Alright. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=906.04s)]
*  It's your birthday today? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=907.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=908.04s)]
*  I don't know what you want to be doing on your birthday, huh? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=909.04s)]
*  What you're looking at is police footage of the making of a confidential informant. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=913.04s)]
*  Narcotics officer Jason Weber is recruiting a college student who'd been caught making two small marijuana sales to become a CI. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=918.04s)]
*  Alright, well you expressed interest that you probably want to help yourself out. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=927.04s)]
*  We're always trying to go up the chain, and so what we want to go is have them buy from their supplier or suppliers. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=930.04s)]
*  Weber is the chief of a four county drug task force in eastern North Dakota and western Minnesota. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=937.04s)]
*  How important do you think confidential informants are to your task? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=944.04s)]
*  Yeah, confidential informants are really important to law enforcement across the country. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=949.04s)]
*  They make our jobs easier just because they are already the ones that are out there that know who the drug dealers are, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=953.04s)]
*  and rely on them. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=959.04s)]
*  Most of the kids that you're recruiting are caught for marijuana sales? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=962.04s)]
*  The big majority, yeah. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=967.04s)]
*  Weber's jurisdiction includes the campus of the North Dakota State College of Science with some 3,000 students. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=969.04s)]
*  Marijuana is now legal in four states and the District of Columbia, but not in North Dakota, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=976.04s)]
*  where selling even a small amount on a campus is a Class A felony with a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=983.04s)]
*  a fine of $20,000 or both. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=990.04s)]
*  This young man, Andrew Sadek, was caught on tape by another confidential informant making two sales for a total of $80. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=994.04s)]
*  Weber has called Sadek in before charging him to present a choice. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1003.04s)]
*  Agree to work as a CI, wear a wire, and make undercover drug buys from three people twice each, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1008.04s)]
*  or be charged with two Class A felonies. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1015.04s)]
*  Potentially, the max is 40 years in prison, $40,000 fine. You understand that? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1018.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1023.04s)]
*  Obviously, you're probably not going to get 40 years, but is it a good possibility that you're going to get some prison time? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1024.04s)]
*  If you don't help yourself out, yeah, there it is. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1031.04s)]
*  Okay. That's probably not a way to start off your young adult life and your career, right? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1034.04s)]
*  Sadek took the deal Weber told us most students do. Part of the agreement he signed? Keep the whole thing strictly to himself. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1039.04s)]
*  You can't tell anybody you're working for me, for obvious reasons. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1048.04s)]
*  An award-winning student of electrical technology, Andrew Sadek did as he was told. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1051.04s)]
*  Never told any of his close friends about being an informant, never called a lawyer, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1057.04s)]
*  and didn't breathe a word to his parents, Tammy and John Sadek. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1062.04s)]
*  The Sadeks are a ranching family still struggling with the death of their older son in a train accident years earlier, leaving Andrew an only child. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1067.04s)]
*  If Andrew had told you that he was thinking of becoming a confidential informant, what do you think your reaction would have been? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1077.04s)]
*  Oh, we'd have gotten him a lawyer and told him no. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1086.04s)]
*  We've never heard of such a thing, you know, using college students for snitches or whatever you want to call them, stool pigeons, or I don't know, what do you call them, you know. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1090.04s)]
*  There's no parent that I know of who would allow their child or want their child to serve as a confidential informant. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1099.04s)]
*  To set up a drug deal. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1106.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's too dangerous. I wouldn't want my child to do it. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1107.04s)]
*  Lance Block is an attorney in Tallahassee, Florida, who opposes using young people caught for relatively minor offenses as confidential informants. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1112.04s)]
*  These kids are being recruited to do the most dangerous type of police work. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1121.04s)]
*  They're going undercover with no background, training, or experience. They haven't been to the police academy. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1126.04s)]
*  So they are basically doing the same work as a trained undercover cop? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1133.04s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1138.04s)]
*  Block says he was unaware police were using young people as confidential informants until he was hired seven years ago by the family of Rachel Hoffman, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1139.04s)]
*  a recent college graduate who was caught with a large stash of marijuana and a few Valium and ecstasy pills. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1149.04s)]
*  It was her second marijuana arrest. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1157.04s)]
*  She was caught by the Tallahassee Police Department and told that if she didn't become a confidential informant, she was looking at four years in prison. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1159.04s)]
*  She signed up and a few weeks later was sent out to make her first undercover drug buy. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1169.04s)]
*  It was to be one of the biggest in Tallahassee's recent history. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1175.04s)]
*  Fifteen hundred ecstasy pills, an ounce and a half of cocaine, and a gun. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1179.04s)]
*  Had she ever dealt in any of those things? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1185.04s)]
*  No. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1188.04s)]
*  A gun? Had she ever fired a gun? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1189.04s)]
*  No. Rachel was a pothead and Rachel sold marijuana to her friends out of her home. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1190.04s)]
*  But Rachel wasn't dealing in ecstasy or cocaine, much less, of course, not weapons. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1199.04s)]
*  Rachel drove her car alone to meet the dealers in this park with $13,000 cash from the police and a wire in her purse. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1205.04s)]
*  She was to be monitored by some 20 officers. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1214.04s)]
*  But then the dealers changed the location of the deal. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1217.04s)]
*  So Rachel drove away from the police staging area. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1221.04s)]
*  And that's when things went terribly wrong. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1224.04s)]
*  The drug dealers have her out on this road. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1227.04s)]
*  One drug dealer gets into the car with her. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1230.04s)]
*  And the 20 cops who were nearby? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1234.04s)]
*  They lost her. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1237.04s)]
*  Hoffman is 5'7", 135 pounds. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1238.04s)]
*  Hoffman was seen Wednesday night at about 7 o'clock near Forest Meadows Park. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1241.04s)]
*  They shot her five times when they found the wire in her purse and dumped her body in a ditch 50 miles away. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1245.04s)]
*  Rachel Hoffman's tragic death turned block into an advocate. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1252.04s)]
*  He sued the city of Tallahassee and won a $2.8 million settlement for Rachel's parents. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1256.04s)]
*  And he has argued for more openness and greater protection for confidential informants ever since. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1262.04s)]
*  Do you have any sense of how many confidential informants there are? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1269.04s)]
*  Law enforcement is loaded with statistics. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1274.04s)]
*  But you cannot find out any information about the number of confidential informants that are being used across this country, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1278.04s)]
*  much less the number of people who are being killed or injured. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1286.04s)]
*  No one's keeping statistics. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1290.04s)]
*  No one. It's a shadowy underworld is what it is. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1292.04s)]
*  We want to make more cases. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1295.04s)]
*  We want to make better cases that can get prosecuted. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1297.04s)]
*  Informants can do that. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1300.04s)]
*  Brian Sully is a longtime undercover narcotics officer who believes a shadowy underworld is exactly what working with C.I. should be. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1301.04s)]
*  Shadowy to protect informants' identities and underworld because that's where cops like him want informants to take them. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1310.04s)]
*  Who knows the most about the dope trade? Is it us working narcotics? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1318.04s)]
*  No. Who is it? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1322.04s)]
*  The sellers, the dopers. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1325.04s)]
*  Sully says he's worked with hundreds of informants and now trains police officers around the country on how best to use them. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1326.04s)]
*  If you had not been able personally to use confidential informants, would you have been as effective? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1334.04s)]
*  Nowhere near as effective. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1341.04s)]
*  You really feel you need this? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1342.04s)]
*  Oh, I know I would not. I may have to watch a house for days or weeks to establish probable cause. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1343.04s)]
*  My informant goes in and makes a buyout of it, and I have my probable cause in five minutes. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1350.04s)]
*  You can get into cases quicker, easier, in some respects safer. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1354.04s)]
*  I'm surprised you say safer because we've heard about kids who've been killed doing these operations. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1359.04s)]
*  It's a dangerous trade that they're involved in. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1367.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1370.04s)]
*  They are in that drug trade. They've always been facing that potential danger. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1371.04s)]
*  Any informant... [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1375.04s)]
*  Sully estimates there could be as many as 100,000 confidential informants working with police across the country. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1377.04s)]
*  And he says with just a few tragic exceptions, it's a win-win. A win for society and a win for the CI. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1384.04s)]
*  They have agreed to do what they are doing in exchange for something. That's the bottom line. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1392.04s)]
*  When somebody comes to work for me as an informant, it's their decision. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1399.04s)]
*  Police tell us that this is completely voluntary, and they want to do this to get rid of the charges. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1403.04s)]
*  It's not something that college kids are standing up saying, I want to be a CI. It's not voluntary. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1409.04s)]
*  They're being told they're looking at prison time unless they agree to do deals for the police department. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1416.04s)]
*  And there are some important things they're not being told. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1423.04s)]
*  So what if you catch me selling $60 worth of marijuana? What do you say to me to become an informant? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1426.04s)]
*  I'll say, this is the charge. This is a felony. Do you want to help yourself out? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1432.04s)]
*  Do you tell me that I have a right to talk to a lawyer? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1438.04s)]
*  No, I do not. I tell you you have a right to talk to a lawyer if I'm going to ask you incriminating questions. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1441.04s)]
*  If we're talking about you becoming an informant, I don't have to tell you that you have a right to a lawyer. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1447.04s)]
*  That's because, since police often recruit confidential informants before charging them and without arresting them, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1452.04s)]
*  they're not obligated by law to read them their rights. And Weber didn't with Andrew Sadek. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1460.04s)]
*  He told us Sadek made three successful undercover drug buys as a CI. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1466.04s)]
*  Half the number he'd been told was required of him. But then he stopped. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1472.04s)]
*  Weber says Sadek was warned he would soon be charged if he didn't continue. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1477.04s)]
*  Then one night, a few weeks shy of graduation, security cameras snapped these pictures of Sadek [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1482.04s)]
*  walking out of his dorm at 2 a.m. on a Thursday morning. A day and a half later, he had not come back. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1489.04s)]
*  We got a call from the campus at about noon on Friday. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1496.04s)]
*  Still completely unaware of their son's work as a confidential informant, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1501.04s)]
*  Andrew's parents were soon on campus making a public plea for his return. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1505.04s)]
*  We love you and we want you. We need you to come home. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1511.04s)]
*  Everything will be OK. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1517.04s)]
*  There were searches, prayer vigils. And then two months later, the worst news possible. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1520.04s)]
*  Andrew's body was discovered in a river near the campus. His backpack weighted down with rocks. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1528.04s)]
*  Its straps tied together across his chest. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1535.04s)]
*  Did they tell you what the cause of death was? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1538.04s)]
*  Gunshot to the head. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1541.04s)]
*  A year and a half later, that's about all the Sadeks have been told. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1545.04s)]
*  No one has been charged in Andrew's death, and the gun that killed him has not been found. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1549.04s)]
*  Police deny he was involved in any CI operation the night he disappeared [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1555.04s)]
*  and have suggested to his parents that he may have shot himself. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1560.04s)]
*  A possibility, they say, is inconceivable. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1564.04s)]
*  They're convinced their son was murdered as a result of his work as an informant, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1568.04s)]
*  and they want the confidential recruitment of young offenders as CIs to stop. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1572.04s)]
*  It's ridiculous. Ridiculous. Stop doing it. Slap their hands, fine them, put them in jail, expel them. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1577.04s)]
*  I don't care. Stop using our kids to do your jobs. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1587.04s)]
*  Andrew Sadek's death is still an open investigation, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1593.04s)]
*  so neither the state agencies in charge of the case nor Jason Weber would talk about it. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1597.04s)]
*  But we did ask about putting these kids at risk. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1603.04s)]
*  Andrew Sadek was caught selling $80 worth of marijuana. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1606.04s)]
*  People have said to us, it's just not worth it, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1610.04s)]
*  and it's not worth putting the kid in any kind of risky situation for that little. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1613.04s)]
*  You know, a drug dealer's a drug dealer where you smell a big amount or a small amount, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1618.04s)]
*  whether you do it once or if you do it a hundred times. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1623.04s)]
*  While it's still against the law, part of our duties as law enforcement is to get the drugs off the streets [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1625.04s)]
*  and to get the drug dealers off the streets. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1630.04s)]
*  So how successful is what you're doing? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1632.04s)]
*  Well, I think it goes back to the point if we don't try something or if we don't do that, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1635.04s)]
*  then we're truly losing the war on drugs. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1640.04s)]
*  Isn't it more important to go after heroin, meth, cocaine? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1643.04s)]
*  Yeah, our agency goes after all of them. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1648.04s)]
*  I'm still trying to get at the equation. You know what I mean? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1650.04s)]
*  Is it worth it for marijuana? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1653.04s)]
*  Yeah, there again, I've got to go back to, you know, as long as it's a crime, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1656.04s)]
*  it is my duty as a police officer to enforce criminal law. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1660.04s)]
*  We've spoken to college students who talk about how they were pressured into becoming confidential informants. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1664.04s)]
*  I felt like I had a gun in my head. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1671.04s)]
*  That part of the story when we come back. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1673.04s)]
*  We wanted to know what the law is across the country about the use of young people as confidential informants. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1683.04s)]
*  And we were surprised to discover that in all but a handful of states, there is no law. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1690.04s)]
*  No age limits on who can become a CI, no rules about how or even whether informants must be trained, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1696.04s)]
*  no guidelines on their protection. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1704.04s)]
*  Policies are typically left up to the individual police departments that recruit and use the informants. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1707.04s)]
*  And that, critics say, can and has resulted in overly aggressive recruitment tactics, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1713.04s)]
*  traumatized and even suicidal CIs, and situations where kids are given incentives to entrap other kids. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1719.04s)]
*  We looked at a case, a narcotics unit, where those charges have been lifted. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1728.04s)]
*  It's in one of the country's best known college towns, with the university itself an involved partner and funder. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1733.04s)]
*  The University of Mississippi in Oxford, famously called Old Mist, is known for its football, its school spirit, and its southern charm. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1740.04s)]
*  But less than a mile from campus, housed in this municipal building, is a drug task force focused on the darker side of life here. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1753.04s)]
*  It's called Metro Narcotics, and one of its confidential informants was an Ole Miss student, Will Call Greg, who agreed to speak with us in disguise. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1762.04s)]
*  I was finishing up with school one day. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1772.04s)]
*  His life as a CI began in the late 80s. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1774.04s)]
*  I was met halfway there by men in bulletproof vests, guns, and badges around their necks. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1778.04s)]
*  My initial reaction was just, keep going. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1785.04s)]
*  This is no way involved with me. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1787.04s)]
*  And then until they held up a piece of paper with my name on it saying I'd sold LSD, and I thought, what on earth? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1789.04s)]
*  I had nothing to do with this. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1798.04s)]
*  Greg, who was a former student of the University of Mississippi, was a former student of the University of Mississippi, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1800.04s)]
*  and I had nothing to do with this. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1806.04s)]
*  Greg, who had no criminal record, insists his only encounter with LSD was when a friend asked to leave some at his apartment. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1807.04s)]
*  Then he says another acquaintance stopped by, wearing a wire, it turns out, and picked the LSD up. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1815.04s)]
*  I was just on the couch watching TV, and he was like, oh, thanks, and I just said, I have nothing to do with this. Don't thank me. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1822.04s)]
*  But at the metro office, Greg says two agents threatened him with more than 20 years in prison and a felony on his record for life, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1829.04s)]
*  unless he agreed to become an informant and make drug buys wearing a wire from 10 people who he had to find himself. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1837.04s)]
*  It felt like I had a gun to my head. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1846.04s)]
*  Have you told them yet that you had nothing to do with this? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1848.04s)]
*  They almost convinced you that you're guilty. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1852.04s)]
*  I was just so scared. I was just putty in their hands. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1856.04s)]
*  Did you think about the idea that you'd become a snitch? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1860.04s)]
*  I mean, I knew what I was signing, and I hated it, absolutely. It just made me sick. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1864.04s)]
*  But what made me more sick was the thought of spending 20 years in prison. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1869.04s)]
*  Did you know 10 people you could buy drugs from when you signed that paper? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1873.04s)]
*  Absolutely not. But you don't care at the time. When you sign it, it's like, sure, you know, please don't ruin my life. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1878.04s)]
*  10 buys, it sounds like a lot. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1885.04s)]
*  It's virtually impossible. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1887.04s)]
*  Ken Coughlin is a defense attorney in Oxford who has represented many Ole Miss students who became confidential informants. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1889.04s)]
*  He says that because there are no standardized rules, cops can ask for any number of buys, like Metro's 10, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1897.04s)]
*  which he says is so high it creates a perverse incentive for kids to entice other kids to break the law. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1905.04s)]
*  He told us he has seen it again and again. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1913.04s)]
*  They don't know 10 drug dealers, and they're so desperate. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1916.04s)]
*  They will go to their friend or their roommate or their frat brother, and they know this person smokes marijuana. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1919.04s)]
*  And they'll say, I'm out of weed. Can I get $10 worth of weed from you? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1925.04s)]
*  Your personal stuff. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1931.04s)]
*  That's entrapment, and that's not allowed under the law. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1933.04s)]
*  Entrapment, because that frat brother with his own marijuana was only guilty of possession, a misdemeanor under Mississippi law. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1937.04s)]
*  But if he says yes and sells a little to his buddy, he's now become a dealer, a felon facing possible prison time. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1946.04s)]
*  And at that point, we're not catching criminals, we're creating criminals. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1954.04s)]
*  Did you ever get the feeling that you were asking someone else to commit a crime that they wouldn't otherwise have committed? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1960.04s)]
*  Yes. I just knew somebody who would provide me with an amount who wasn't selling, but I just knew that they would because we knew each other. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1968.04s)]
*  And you did that? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1976.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1977.04s)]
*  So when you say they're creating felons, this is what you mean. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1978.04s)]
*  I don't think the cops say go out and talk somebody into doing it that wouldn't otherwise do it. It's just what the kids do. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1982.04s)]
*  And look, there are some hard drugs around, but the vast, vast majority of cases are sale of two grams of marijuana, three grams of marijuana. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=1988.04s)]
*  But those small sales can add up to big numbers of arrests. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2000.04s)]
*  And numbers, says Tallahassee attorney Lance Block, help drug task forces get grants. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2004.04s)]
*  If they want to drive up their arrest numbers. And it doesn't matter whether they're going after a college kid with a couple of joints in his pocket or whether they're going after a drug kingpin. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2010.04s)]
*  And the more arrests, the more money? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2021.04s)]
*  The rest numbers, the higher they go, the better the funding. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2023.04s)]
*  I mean, law enforcement is addicted to the drug war money as the crack addict is on the street to his drugs. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2028.04s)]
*  It's a strong charge. We put it to undercover narcotics agent and instructor Brian Salih. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2036.04s)]
*  What they say is that police are in this to lift their arrest statistics to justify the grants and money that they're getting. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2042.04s)]
*  I'm in it to do what is best for my community. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2051.04s)]
*  And if having higher stats gets me more money and allows me to do more cases to then impact the drug trade in my community, then that's also a benefit. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2056.04s)]
*  Metro Narcotics got nearly fifty five thousand dollars in federal grants last year. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2066.04s)]
*  But most of their budget comes from the city police, the county sheriff's department and Ole Miss. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2071.04s)]
*  A hundred thousand dollars each. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2078.04s)]
*  The head of Metro Narcotics for the last five years has been Keith Davis, seen here on an Ole Miss student newscast defending his unit's work with students as informants. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2080.04s)]
*  These are adults. These are 18, 19, 20 year olds. Yes, I get it. They have young minds, whatever. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2092.04s)]
*  They're out here creating felonies and hurting our communities. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2097.04s)]
*  We requested our own interview with Davis or any representative of Metro Narcotics, but they declined. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2102.04s)]
*  One thing we wanted to ask Davis about were charges that he and other agents in the unit were abusive to the C.I.s. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2108.04s)]
*  They call you and in these calls they're very aggressive and threatening and saying, well, we're going to come pick you up and you're going to go to prison. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2116.04s)]
*  To the point where I was just terrified whenever my phone rang. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2124.04s)]
*  We heard similar claims from another Ole Miss student who became a confidential informant after Metro Narcotics accused him of selling marijuana. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2128.04s)]
*  They say your life is over as you know it. If you don't if you tell anybody if you don't help us. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2137.04s)]
*  Did they specifically say you can't call your parents? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2142.04s)]
*  They said if you call your parents, we'll take you to jail. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2145.04s)]
*  Once he agreed, he says one of the first things the agent asked him was whether he could buy meth or heroin. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2149.04s)]
*  He told him he couldn't. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2156.04s)]
*  The first eight months or so he called every single day around the same time. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2158.04s)]
*  He called you every day for eight months? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2162.04s)]
*  Every day. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2164.04s)]
*  We had heard repeated accusations about the aggressive tone of the Metro agents and then got to listen for ourselves. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2165.04s)]
*  When we obtained a tape recording of Keith Davis and another Metro agent yelling at a C.I. recruit, they heard had made a threat to find out where they lived. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2173.04s)]
*  The first voice is that of agent Tommy Knight. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2183.04s)]
*  I don't give a f***. Where you at? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2186.04s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2187.04s)]
*  I'll turn this s*** in and I'll come beat the f*** out you. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2188.04s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2190.04s)]
*  Get that in your head. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2191.04s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2192.04s)]
*  The tape was made surreptitiously by the C.I. recruit who brought it to Ken Coughlin. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2193.04s)]
*  We listened with him as Keith Davis made his own threat if the kid ever went to his house. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2198.04s)]
*  Call me. You'll be the last f***ing place you ever go in your life. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2205.04s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2207.04s)]
*  You feel me? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2208.04s)]
*  100%. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2209.04s)]
*  He took all I had and I came to see you last night. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2210.04s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2212.04s)]
*  To hunt you down. But I'm trying to calm him down. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2213.04s)]
*  Keith Davis is the chief of this narcotics unit and he is making a death threat. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2217.04s)]
*  You know, I'm just going to let the tape speak for itself. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2222.04s)]
*  Coughlin sent the tape and a letter to the chancellor and attorney of Ole Miss more than two years ago thinking that as a funder of Metro Narcotics, they should know how the unit was treating its students. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2226.04s)]
*  He got no reply and we could find no evidence that changes were made to the program at that time. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2238.04s)]
*  You know, go to the store. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2244.04s)]
*  Greg told us that as he continued making undercover buys, he became anxious and paranoid. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2246.04s)]
*  I would have to conceal that I was shaking because first of all, I completely detested what I was doing. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2252.04s)]
*  I didn't want to get anybody in trouble. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2258.04s)]
*  Do you feel ashamed? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2260.04s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2261.04s)]
*  Because of turning in other kids? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2263.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2266.04s)]
*  But Keith Davis told the Ole Miss campus reporter that these kids don't deserve that much sympathy. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2267.04s)]
*  Let's be clear here. These people are not these innocent little college kids, plain and simple. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2274.04s)]
*  The ones that are selling dope are not innocent people. They're selling poison. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2280.04s)]
*  That may be true for many confidential informants, but it turns out not Greg. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2285.04s)]
*  After a year and a half, and he says making six of the 10 required buys, Greg was charged and arrested anyway. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2290.04s)]
*  That's when his parents found out and hired Coughlin, who researched the original evidence against Greg [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2298.04s)]
*  and came to the conclusion that the friend who brought the LSD to Greg's house in the first place had been a CI. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2305.04s)]
*  So a CI brought the drugs and a CI bought the drugs. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2312.04s)]
*  That's the way I understood it to be. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2316.04s)]
*  Coughlin says after he brought the situation to the attention of the district attorney, the charges against Greg were dismissed. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2319.04s)]
*  All the charges were just thrown out. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2326.04s)]
*  Completely. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2329.04s)]
*  It's really important that the public have an understanding of what's going on because it's perverted justice. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2330.04s)]
*  I've been told that a lot of these kids are not really looking at jail time. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2336.04s)]
*  In the vast majority of cases, these kids would be diverted into a drug court program. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2340.04s)]
*  They'd be on probation for six months to a year. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2346.04s)]
*  And at the end, if they've done everything successfully, then the cases are dismissed. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2348.04s)]
*  Lance Block has been advocating for laws to regulate the recruitment and use of confidential informants across the country. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2353.04s)]
*  But he says law enforcement lobbies have opposed the reforms. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2361.04s)]
*  They want to keep the CI system as it is. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2366.04s)]
*  Law enforcement people have told us we see it as a win-win. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2368.04s)]
*  The kids get it reduced or charges completely expunged and we get to arrest drug dealers. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2372.04s)]
*  But they're kids that are being killed and they're arresting small-time possessors. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2379.04s)]
*  That's a lose-lose. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2387.04s)]
*  We asked Old Miss for an on-camera interview while we were reporting our story. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2391.04s)]
*  Our request was declined. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2396.04s)]
*  We did get a letter months later saying, quote, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2398.04s)]
*  In whether to become a confidential informant and a change in leadership. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2428.04s)]
*  At the end of September, Keith Davis resigned as head of the unit. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2433.04s)]
*  He now works for the Sheriff's Department. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2437.04s)]
*  Chicago, with the largest number of murders last year of any major city in the country, has one of the largest jails in the country. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2458.04s)]
*  An average of 70,000 men and women pass through Cook County Jail each year, many more than once. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2466.04s)]
*  And as with other big city jails, most of the inmates who cycle through are either poor or illiterate. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2473.04s)]
*  Cook County is leading the way, almost by necessity, with a new approach to help break the cycle. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2480.04s)]
*  The County Sheriff, Tom Dart, is getting a lot of the credit. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2487.04s)]
*  A lot of the credit goes to the county sheriff, Tom. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2492.04s)]
*  He's a very good friend of mine. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2496.04s)]
*  He's a very good friend of mine. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2498.04s)]
*  He's a very good friend of mine. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2500.04s)]
*  He's a very good friend of mine. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2502.04s)]
*  He's a very good friend of mine. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2504.04s)]
*  Cook County Sheriff, Tom Dart, is getting a lot of the credit. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2506.04s)]
*  A former prosecutor who's been elected and reelected sheriff since 2006, Dart, as you'll see, is unconventional. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2510.04s)]
*  It was a cold day at Cook County Jail when we met Tom Dart. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2521.04s)]
*  He has redefined the role of sheriff. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2526.04s)]
*  He sees the job as not just keeping people in jail, but helping some of them get out. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2529.04s)]
*  He says many behind bars shouldn't be there. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2535.04s)]
*  How you guys doing? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2538.04s)]
*  Good. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2540.04s)]
*  Several times a month, Dart mingles with the men in the jail's minimum security division, all of whom have been charged with low-level, nonviolent crimes. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2541.04s)]
*  What's your charge? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2550.04s)]
*  I had a violation of probation. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2551.04s)]
*  I was on probation for driving while licensed, revoked. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2553.04s)]
*  Dart says the jail, with a population today of about 7,500, has become a dumping ground for the poor and mentally ill. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2556.04s)]
*  What percent do you think here really shouldn't be here? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2565.04s)]
*  I would suggest conservatively that half of the people here in the jail shouldn't be here. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2569.04s)]
*  Half? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2576.04s)]
*  They don't pose a danger to anybody. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2577.04s)]
*  The people in most jails, and 95% of the people in this jail, are waiting on a trial. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2579.04s)]
*  So everybody here are people who haven't been convicted yet. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2584.04s)]
*  So you say to yourself, all right, they're presumed innocent. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2588.04s)]
*  Who is so dangerous that we need to hold them here while we're waiting on a trial? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2590.04s)]
*  You had some violence a long time ago? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2594.04s)]
*  Nothing, a long time ago. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2596.04s)]
*  So you're nothing. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2598.04s)]
*  As he makes the rounds, he sounds less like an incarcerator than a defense attorney. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2599.04s)]
*  I'm not promising you guys anything, because I never know what the hell they're going to do, but I promise you we will push out. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2604.04s)]
*  The biggest problem for most of the inmates, he says, is they simply don't have enough money to make bail. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2610.04s)]
*  I'm trying to find out why my bond is so high. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2616.04s)]
*  How many percentage-wise people are really poor and can't afford bail? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2619.04s)]
*  On any given day, we have probably 200 to 300 people that if they came up with $500, they would leave here. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2623.04s)]
*  But we find that if you have access to money, wherever it may come from, and frequently it's coming from your gang. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2631.04s)]
*  And if you happen to be the guy in your gang who is the guy who does most of the shootings, you're a very valuable person. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2637.04s)]
*  They want you back out on the street. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2643.04s)]
*  But you have some individual who's in here who's never been a danger to anybody. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2645.04s)]
*  He can't come up with $100. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2649.04s)]
*  He's sitting, the guy with the gun, he's out the door. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2651.04s)]
*  Next guy is possession of cannabis. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2654.04s)]
*  He usually turns his notes over to his top advisor, Kara Smith, who runs what you might call a you-shouldn't-be-here squad. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2657.04s)]
*  And what do you charge them? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2665.04s)]
*  Retail dough. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2666.04s)]
*  And what they say you're trying to steal? [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2667.04s)]
*  Some Red Bulls. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2669.04s)]
*  Some Red Bull drinks? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2670.04s)]
*  Smith and her staff hold office hours, looking for inmates they can help. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2672.04s)]
*  What we need to work on is trying to get your bond reduced so that you can bond out, so that you can get out of here. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2677.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2681.04s)]
*  Okay? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2682.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2683.04s)]
*  Okay, good luck. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2684.04s)]
*  All right, you too. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2685.04s)]
*  We'll be in touch. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2686.04s)]
*  Combing through cases, Kara Smith discovered something disturbing. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2687.04s)]
*  They call them dead days. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2689.04s)]
*  We made up the term, but we call them dead days because people spend so much time pre-trial here at the Cook County Jail that once they're sentenced to prison, they've already served their term. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2691.04s)]
*  They probably spent more time here than the sentence in some cases. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2704.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2707.04s)]
*  So last year alone, we had 1,024 people who spent their entire prison term here in the Cook County Jail. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2708.04s)]
*  But the more incredible statistic is that same group of people spent an extra 222 years of custody here in the Cook County Jail. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2715.04s)]
*  Lengths of stay run from a week or less to eight or nine years. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2726.04s)]
*  Some of the people who spend years here are the mentally ill who make up about a third of the population and are the jail's biggest cost. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2732.04s)]
*  And do you know what your charge is today? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2741.04s)]
*  Retail debt. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2743.04s)]
*  Retail debt? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2744.04s)]
*  $70 worth of ground beef. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2745.04s)]
*  $70 worth of ground beef. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2748.04s)]
*  Every inmate is screened for mental illness when they first arrive. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2750.04s)]
*  I was diagnosed with schizophrenia when I was in group home. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2754.04s)]
*  In group home? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2759.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2760.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2761.04s)]
*  We're going to make sure that you get help today. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2762.04s)]
*  If I don't get the medication that I need, I know it's going to go wrong. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2763.04s)]
*  This man, who also has a history of mental illness, has been in and out of the jail 37 times. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2767.04s)]
*  I understand. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2773.04s)]
*  How does that happen? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2774.04s)]
*  How does someone come back to a jail 37 times? [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2775.04s)]
*  What in God's name do you expect to happen with that person? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2778.04s)]
*  Okay, so this person's got a serious mental illness. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2782.04s)]
*  He's not being treated. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2784.04s)]
*  His family and him have been disconnected for years. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2785.04s)]
*  He obviously doesn't have a job. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2788.04s)]
*  He has nowhere to live. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2789.04s)]
*  What do you think is going to happen? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2790.04s)]
*  I'll tell you what's going to happen. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2792.04s)]
*  He will come in contact with law enforcement either because he's trying to find a place to sleep or he's trying to find something to eat, and he'll be back in here. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2793.04s)]
*  It's not because he walked out of here saying, listen, I want to go and commit horrific crimes. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2799.04s)]
*  It's like he's trying to survive. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2803.04s)]
*  In many ways, society has turned jails and prisons into mental health clinics, and you're actually running one here. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2805.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2813.04s)]
*  I said, okay, if they're going to make it so that I am going to be the largest mental health provider, we're going to be the best ones. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2814.04s)]
*  We're going to treat them as a patient while they're here. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2820.04s)]
*  It's like we are going to think differently. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2822.04s)]
*  Cook County Jail was already one of the largest mental health facilities in the country in 2012 when Chicago closed down half its mental health clinics. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2824.04s)]
*  These men, the high functioning mentally ill, are bussed five days a week to a program that is now a model for other jails across the country. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2834.04s)]
*  They get medication, visits with psychiatrists and group therapy. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2844.04s)]
*  So today I want us to continue to move forward, and you're going to have to have some things that's going to take you to another level. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2849.04s)]
*  About 60% of all the jails corrections officers have advanced mental health training, and DART has moved new people over to the medical facilities. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2856.04s)]
*  What I did is redefine job positions, and where it would have been a law enforcement position, I changed it into a doctor position or a mental health position. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2866.04s)]
*  And so we've been bringing on a lot of doctors, counselors, therapists. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2875.04s)]
*  Are you running a jail? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2882.04s)]
*  Sometimes I wonder. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2884.04s)]
*  Nothing exemplifies his new direction more than who he chose to run the jail. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2886.04s)]
*  Not someone with a law enforcement background. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2891.04s)]
*  He named a psychologist to be the warden, 39-year-old Dr. Nika Jones-Tappiah. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2894.04s)]
*  I'm going to go sell the cell. Who should I talk to? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2901.04s)]
*  She started as an intern at Cook County Jail almost 10 years ago and worked her way up. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2904.04s)]
*  As warden, she tries to infuse more humanity into a pretty heartless place, the Maximum Security Wing, where she offers some tough love therapy. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2910.04s)]
*  People wouldn't let the officers handcuff them. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2921.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2923.04s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2924.04s)]
*  They had to take them to the ground and cuff them. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2925.04s)]
*  Are you going to keep getting into it with sad? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2927.04s)]
*  If they keep denying my right. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2929.04s)]
*  Okay, so you have the wrong attitude. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2932.04s)]
*  I ain't got the wrong attitude. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2934.04s)]
*  Because I'm trying to help you, but you're still telling me that you're going to have issues with the staff, and I can't have that. So it's up to you. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2936.04s)]
*  We filmed you doing rounds like a doctor in a hospital, but you talked to every single inmate that you passed. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2943.04s)]
*  Yes. It's because we understand the person is a person. They're not what they're, they're not, they're charged. They're not their crime. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2951.04s)]
*  And so we want to give that individual attention to as many people as we can. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2960.04s)]
*  Sorry, gentlemen. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2965.04s)]
*  On a walk through a medium security cell block, she works on attitude adjustment, trying to change their way of thinking so they don't come back here. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2966.04s)]
*  All of you guys with tattoos, you might want to think about having those removed. You need to. Because how are you going to get a job when you get out? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2976.04s)]
*  I mean, the first impression is everything. You can't do that. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2984.04s)]
*  How many of you guys have kids? Oh, my. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2988.04s)]
*  So it's not just you that's impacted by you being here, but your families, your children. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=2993.04s)]
*  To reach out to their families, she's listed her phone number on the jail's Web site. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3000.04s)]
*  Dart and his methods have come under intense criticism. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3006.04s)]
*  He's too soft on the inmates, say some of the corrections officers. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3010.04s)]
*  Their antagonism grew into outright hostility last year when Dart, intending to be transparent about life behind the walls, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3015.04s)]
*  released videos to the public showing guards brutally beating up inmates. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3024.04s)]
*  Dennis Andrews, the business agent at Teamsters Local 700 that represents the corrections officers, says his members were furious. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3030.04s)]
*  The anger was he didn't release the videos of the detainees attacking the officers. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3039.04s)]
*  You can't release a small segment of something happening without releasing the tape of how you got from point A to point B. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3046.04s)]
*  Does the public have a right to see those men beating the prisoners? [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3055.04s)]
*  If we aren't releasing that information, then it furthers the public's feeling that law enforcement is covering things up and that we are hiding things. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3060.04s)]
*  And we don't have anything to hide. We have good people here is the majority, but we have some people that don't. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3068.04s)]
*  And we can't shy from that because it's what poisons the well of the public. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3074.04s)]
*  After the criticism, Sheriff Dart did release videos of inmates attacking staff. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3077.04s)]
*  But Dennis Andrews says that didn't improve morale. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3083.04s)]
*  He doesn't address the situations of his own staff at the jail who are being attacked daily by detainees. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3087.04s)]
*  He presumes them innocent, but he doesn't presume his staff innocent. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3096.04s)]
*  He presumes his staff guilty? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3100.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3102.04s)]
*  It can't be good if they think that you're not on their side. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3103.04s)]
*  You know, I become puzzled when they think I'm not on their side. It is the most difficult job. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3107.04s)]
*  And you start with that, and then you're dealing with mentally ill folks. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3111.04s)]
*  So they've been asked to do all sorts of things that they didn't sign up for. And I am outrageously sympathetic to that. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3116.04s)]
*  What Sheriff Dart can't tell us yet is whether recidivism rates are coming down. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3122.04s)]
*  On any given day, he says he releases roughly 200 people to the streets, but he accepts another 200, some still the old familiar faces. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3127.04s)]
*  To improve the chances they won't return again, he's introduced activities like chess lessons. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3138.04s)]
*  People said, you know, your chess program, how does that work? [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3145.04s)]
*  I said, you know what? One of the major issues we have with the people here is they don't think about consequences. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3148.04s)]
*  They just think the very first move. They're playing checkers. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3154.04s)]
*  Chess makes you think four, five, six moves out. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3158.04s)]
*  I can't tell you how many guys in chess program has told me they never thought like that in their life, that their way of thinking has changed. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3161.04s)]
*  There's more than chess. Dart has enlisted volunteers to offer all kinds of classes you rarely see in a jail. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3167.04s)]
*  And you can always move in closer if you want. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3175.04s)]
*  A photographer teaches inmates how to find new ways to look at the world and themselves. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3177.04s)]
*  Musicians provide therapy through rhythm and sound. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3183.04s)]
*  Ah, well, we're going to put a little rosemary. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3187.04s)]
*  Italian chef Bruno Abbate gives cooking lessons. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3191.04s)]
*  I'm not here just to make food. I'm here to change the way you think. So don't come back in this place anymore. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3195.04s)]
*  We say, you know, we touch the bottom now. We can only go up, right? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3202.04s)]
*  What about your corrections officers? Do they look at you and say, wait a minute, this is all upside down here? [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3207.04s)]

*  You know, Sheriff Goofy is out giving pizza to all the inmates now because he loves it. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3218.04s)]
*  Sheriff Goofy. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3223.04s)]

*  But when it comes to just blindly and truly out of indifference, just saying there's segments of our society that we will treat this horrifically callous way, I'm not going to be party for that. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3242.04s)]
*  And if that upsets people, that's fine. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH34BP27reg&t=3253.04s)]
