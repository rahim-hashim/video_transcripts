# "Havana Syndrome" | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [March 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc)
*  In 2016 and 17, 25 Americans, including CIA agents who worked in the U.S. Embassy in Cuba, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=0.0s)]
*  suffered serious brain injuries, causing impaired vision and memory loss, among other persistent [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=19.88s)]
*  symptoms. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=25.96s)]
*  Now we've learned that at least 15 American officials in China suffered unexplained brain [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=26.96s)]
*  trauma soon after. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=33.4s)]
*  The FBI is now investigating whether these Americans were attacked by a mysterious weapon [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=35.44s)]
*  that leaves no trace. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=41.04s)]
*  Over many months, we have been collecting evidence of what appears to be a hostile foreign [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=43.46s)]
*  government's plan to target Americans serving abroad and their families. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=48.2s)]
*  For me it was November of 2017 when I started to feel lightheaded a lot. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=54.76s)]
*  I was getting more headaches. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=59.92s)]
*  My wife was getting headaches too. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=61.22s)]
*  Mark Lindsay is a State Department security officer who worked in the U.S. Consulate in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=62.92s)]
*  Guangzhou, China. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=67.92s)]
*  He says that he and his wife began to suffer after hearing strange sounds in their apartment. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=70.72s)]
*  Picture holding a marble. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=77.88s)]
*  Picture if you had like a six foot in diameter funnel, metal funnel, the sound that marble [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=80.52s)]
*  would make as it goes around and it progressively gets faster as it goes down towards the hole [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  at the end. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=91.32s)]
*  It's a sound like I've never heard before. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=92.32s)]
*  Was this subtle? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  Like did I hear that? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=96.44s)]
*  No, it was actually somewhat loud. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=97.88s)]
*  I heard it about three or four times, always in the same spot, always over my son's crib [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=100.44s)]
*  and always right before we would go to bed. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  Lindsay wears prescribed glasses because sensitivity to light is among his persistent symptoms. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=107.08s)]
*  The symptoms were progressively getting worse with me. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=113.48s)]
*  My headaches were getting worse. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=116.48s)]
*  The most concerning symptom for me was memory loss, especially short-term memory loss. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=118.16s)]
*  Mark Lindsay believes he was targeted because of his work. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=123.12s)]
*  He uses top secret equipment to analyze electronic threats to diplomatic missions. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=126.7s)]
*  There is no shadow of a doubt in my mind that this was a directed attack against my neighbor [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=132.6s)]
*  and I. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=138.64s)]
*  His neighbor was Catherine Werner, who lived one floor up. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=139.64s)]
*  She's a U.S. Commerce Department trade officer who promoted American business from the Guancho [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=143.84s)]
*  Consulate. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  I woke up in the middle of the night and I could feel the sound in my head. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=150.56s)]
*  It was intense pressure on both of my temples at the same time I heard this low humming [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=158.32s)]
*  sound and it was oscillating. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=165.44s)]
*  And I remember looking around for where this sound was coming from because it was painful. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=168.32s)]
*  When did you first notice that you weren't feeling well? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=173.76s)]
*  October of 2017, I started to get hives all over my body, really bad hives. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=178.32s)]
*  I woke up with headaches every day. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=187.0s)]
*  I started to feel tired. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  The simplest things would just make me very, very tired. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=194.76000000000002s)]
*  Were these symptoms growing worse over time? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=197.84s)]
*  They were, yes. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=200.24s)]
*  My symptoms would get so bad that I would throw up or I would wake up with nosebleeds. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=202.24s)]
*  She says even her dogs were throwing up blood. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  Werner assumed her illness was connected to China's toxic smog. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=212.24s)]
*  She didn't know it at the time, but her symptoms were the same that American officials in Havana [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=219.12s)]
*  had suffered since 2016. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=224.4s)]
*  The U.S. Embassy there is all but closed as a result. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=226.28s)]
*  We hadn't heard about what happened in Cuba. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  There were headlines in the news about hearing loss and attacks to our diplomats, but we [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  didn't know the details. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=242.0s)]
*  Catherine Werner became so ill, her mother traveled from the U.S. to live with her. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=244.2s)]
*  She spent almost three months with me. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=249.52s)]
*  During that time, she also got very ill, and she and I shared the same symptoms. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=252.24s)]
*  What sort of symptoms did your mother have? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=259.48s)]
*  Headaches and ringing in our ears. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=262.64s)]
*  We also started to both have difficulty recalling words. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=268.3s)]
*  After reporting her experiences, Werner was medically evacuated to the U.S. for treatment. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=276.6s)]
*  U.S. agencies are investigating, but Mark Lindsay has a theory. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=282.18s)]
*  This was a directed standoff attack against my apartment. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=287.5s)]
*  It was a weapon. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=291.94s)]
*  Of course it was a weapon. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=292.94s)]
*  An energy weapon. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=294.1s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=295.5s)]
*  What sort of energy is this that we're talking about? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=296.5s)]
*  I believe it's RF, radio frequency energy, in the microwave range. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=299.82s)]
*  A clue that supports that theory was revealed by the National Security Agency in 2014. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=303.66s)]
*  This NSA statement describes such a weapon as a high-powered microwave system weapon [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=311.36s)]
*  that may have the ability to weaken, intimidate, or kill an enemy over time without leaving [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=318.22s)]
*  evidence. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=325.06s)]
*  The statement goes on to say, this weapon is designed to bay the target's living quarters [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=326.18s)]
*  in microwaves. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=331.96s)]
*  The NSA disclosed this in a workers' compensation case filed by former NSA employee Mike Beck. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=333.92s)]
*  When you look back across your career, is there any incident that leads you to believe [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=341.8s)]
*  that it could be responsible for your Parkinson's disease? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=349.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=352.5s)]
*  In the 1990s, Beck and an NSA coworker were on assignment overseas. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=353.86s)]
*  Years later, he says, they developed Parkinson's disease at the same time. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=359.3s)]
*  In 1996, a colleague of mine, Chuck Bett, and I traveled to a hostile country and worked [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=364.26s)]
*  there for about a week. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=372.86s)]
*  And I can't say with a hostile country the identity of it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=375.26s)]
*  Because it's still classified. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=380.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=381.98s)]
*  It was not Cuba or China. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=382.98s)]
*  You believe that you and Chuck Bett were attacked with this microwave weapon? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=385.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=392.74s)]
*  I had a pretty good working knowledge of the hostile country's intelligence services, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=393.74s)]
*  what they do to people, what they have done, what their modus operandi is. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=399.54s)]
*  Mike Beck says more intelligence has come in recently, which he shared in a classified [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=405.42s)]
*  with congressional investigators. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=410.94s)]
*  Mike, you can't discuss any of these details because they're all classified. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=412.42s)]
*  But in your opinion, does the new information that you brief the House and Senate Intelligence [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=417.46000000000004s)]
*  Committee staff on in any way relate to what happened in Cuba and China? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=424.62s)]
*  It's relevant to the Cuba and China cases. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=431.3s)]
*  No one has officially confirmed that what Beck says happened to him is related to at [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=434.74s)]
*  least 40 Americans injured in China and Cuba. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=440.02s)]
*  While Beck suffers from Parkinson's, the recent patients are being treated for the same kind [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=444.34s)]
*  of symptoms that doctors would expect from a concussion. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=450.53999999999996s)]
*  So follow my fingers. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=453.7s)]
*  Dr. Tina Schetti is Mark Lindsay's neurologist. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=455.7s)]
*  So Mark initially came to me reporting symptoms of headache, memory loss, sleep difficulties, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=459.18s)]
*  emotionality and irritability. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=465.14s)]
*  What did you make of that in the early days? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=467.94s)]
*  I was very surprised. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=470.65999999999997s)]
*  He did not have any history of any trauma or blow to his head. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=472.3s)]
*  But he reported a constellation of neurologic symptoms, which are characteristic of mild [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=476.58s)]
*  traumatic brain injury without any history of associated head trauma. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=481.97999999999996s)]
*  I still notice it, but that has improved. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=485.9s)]
*  Exactly how their brains were injured is the subject of a study at the University of Pennsylvania [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=488.21999999999997s)]
*  Center for Brain Injury and Repair. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=494.46s)]
*  Dr. Schetti is not part of that study, but her patient, Mark Lindsay, is. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=498.14000000000004s)]
*  The presumption is that something happened which caused a functional brain injury of [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=503.54s)]
*  widespread brain networks because he has symptoms to reflect a multitude of brain networks. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=509.74s)]
*  What Dr. Schetti describes mirrors the findings published so far by the University of Pennsylvania's [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=514.94s)]
*  study. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=521.22s)]
*  They have said that our symptoms are exactly what they saw in Cuba and that we have the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=522.22s)]
*  full suite of findings that they had there. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=529.6600000000001s)]
*  Robin and Britta Garfield are among the 40 patients enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=534.1800000000001s)]
*  study. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=540.22s)]
*  Like Catherine Werner, Robin Garfield is a trade officer with the Commerce Department. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=541.22s)]
*  He was posted with his wife and two young children in Shanghai. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=546.38s)]
*  I don't know when the sound started. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=551.3s)]
*  I do know that it was for months on end. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=554.38s)]
*  I was sitting next to Robin and something I felt like hit me from the left side and [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=557.22s)]
*  at first it felt like an electric shock and then it paralyzed me so I was not able to [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=563.14s)]
*  move or speak. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=571.46s)]
*  It hit you so hard you felt like you were in danger in the room. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=573.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=577.38s)]
*  They say the children suffered blurred vision and loss of balance. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=578.5s)]
*  Your daughter was literally falling down? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=582.98s)]
*  Yes, she fell down multiple times that day. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=585.42s)]
*  We went on a walk and she just fell on her face. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=588.06s)]
*  It was very abnormal. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=593.18s)]
*  She never does that and then a second time she completely lost her balance and just fell [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=595.68s)]
*  to the side. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=600.54s)]
*  Last spring, the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed the case of Catherine Werner. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=602.42s)]
*  The state's new pen found her brain injuries matched the Cuba victims. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=607.98s)]
*  We had an incident in Guangzhou that the medical indications are very similar and entirely [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=612.5s)]
*  consistent with the medical indications that have taken place to Americans working in Cuba. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=620.02s)]

*  14 China cases. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=631.1800000000001s)]
*  The State Department's medical office sent Mark Lindsay this note that says, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=632.94s)]
*  We have reached the decision that your symptoms and findings do not correlate with the Havana [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=637.7s)]
*  cohort. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=643.62s)]
*  They tried to deny it, they tried to cover it up, they tried to minimize it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=644.7600000000001s)]
*  Why would the State Department minimize this? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=647.5400000000001s)]
*  Because it's China, because we have such a large trade relationship with them. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=650.1800000000001s)]
*  You can push around Cuba, trade relations are minimal. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=653.5s)]
*  With China that's a different beast, right? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=657.46s)]
*  State Department doctors told Robin Garfield his illness stems from a baseball injury 17 [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=659.58s)]

*  It is a very complicated geopolitical relationship between the U.S. and China. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=670.86s)]
*  So that to me feels like why this determination is being made. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=675.34s)]
*  What does it mean for your benefits today that the State Department is refusing to call [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=680.84s)]
*  this an attack? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=686.34s)]
*  It has significant impact on our life, our finances, my career as well, likely. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=687.88s)]
*  I have not been afforded time for my rehabilitation. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=697.4s)]
*  Being classified as pre-existing injury means that I don't have access to paid leave. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=702.66s)]
*  It also means that after one year my medical bills will not be covered currently. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=711.48s)]

*  The State Department declined an interview, but in a statement to 60 Minutes it said, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=733.46s)]
*  We will continue to provide our colleagues the care they need, regardless of their diagnosis [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=738.6s)]

*  A State Department official told us that the Cuba patients are victims of an attack, but [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=748.32s)]
*  State hasn't made the same determination for the China patients. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=754.12s)]
*  The Department has asked the National Academies of Science to assist in the medical investigation. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=758.88s)]
*  The FBI is also investigating. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=765.78s)]
*  Intelligence sources told us that in addition to Cuba and China, Russia is a suspect. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=769.1s)]

*  Olivia Troy was Homeland Security and counterterrorism advisor to Vice President Mike Pence. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=896.38s)]
*  She had served in the Pentagon, deployed to Iraq, served in the Defense Intelligence [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=904.08s)]
*  Agency and the National Counterterrorism Center. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=909.22s)]
*  At the White House, she worked in the 19th century Eisenhower Executive Office building [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=913.7s)]
*  beside the West Wing. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=919.94s)]
*  In the summer of 2019, she was descending these stairs toward the White House when she felt [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=922.24s)]
*  she had been physically struck. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=928.98s)]
*  But it was like this piercing feeling on the side of my head. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=931.48s)]
*  I remember it was on the right side of my head and I got vertigo. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=936.72s)]
*  I was unsteady. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=942.2s)]
*  I felt nauseous. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=944.0s)]
*  I was somewhat disoriented and I was just, I remember thinking, okay, you gotta, if you [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=947.92s)]
*  don't fall down the stairs, you've gotta find your ground again and steady yourself. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=952.04s)]
*  She steadied herself on a railing, but the piercing feeling continued as she passed by [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=957.12s)]
*  this entrance to the West Wing. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=963.1s)]
*  It was almost like I couldn't really process. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=965.58s)]
*  It was like a paralyzing panic attack. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=967.18s)]
*  I've never had that. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=969.78s)]
*  I've never felt anything like that. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=971.98s)]
*  And so I, you know, I thought to myself, I mean, do I have a brain tumor out of the blue? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=973.74s)]
*  Is this what happened? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=979.02s)]
*  Am I having a stroke? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=980.02s)]
*  Olivia Troy was inside the security perimeter, headed to her car. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=981.46s)]
*  She went down the steps, past the West Wing, and down the closed parking lot used by presidents [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=986.84s)]
*  called West Executive Avenue. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=993.9200000000001s)]
*  Then she passed through the Secret Service gate and out to the staff parking in the Ellipse, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=996.88s)]
*  south of the White House. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1003.02s)]
*  Did you ever experience anything like this again? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1004.84s)]
*  So not immediately, but I did again about a year later. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1007.5600000000001s)]
*  It didn't happen on the steps. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1014.6s)]
*  It happened a couple times walking to my car on the Ellipse. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1016.2s)]
*  Tell me about those times. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1021.24s)]
*  It was a similar sensation, but this time it was very much the feeling of vertigo and [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1023.3000000000001s)]
*  dizziness. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1030.64s)]
*  And I felt like I couldn't really walk. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1032.44s)]
*  There was sort of a, it was like I had a depth perception issue where I couldn't figure out [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1035.66s)]
*  where the ground was. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1040.82s)]
*  And I would start walking and I felt like I was just going to fall right into the ground. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1042.76s)]
*  Troy says she didn't report the episodes because she didn't want to believe she was seriously [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1048.08s)]
*  ill, and she worried what it would mean to her security clearance and career. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1053.58s)]
*  After this interview, she reported for the first time. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1059.92s)]
*  There is a human aspect of it, of shame, and do you really want to admit you're sick? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1063.6s)]
*  Do you want to come forward and tell someone that, especially as a member of the intelligence [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1069.0s)]
*  community? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1073.28s)]

*  like me who felt this. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1078.2s)]
*  It appears there are several. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1081.28s)]
*  A senior member of the National Security Council says he was stricken in November 2020 on the [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1083.16s)]

*  name him, but he described the incident to a close colleague, John Bolton, former national [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1098.72s)]
*  security adviser. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1105.1200000000001s)]
*  They had disorientation and ringing in their ears and just a general inability to function. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1106.64s)]
*  Bolton told us the official said he couldn't speak or think clearly. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1114.96s)]
*  He was taken to an emergency room. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1119.84s)]
*  The former official sent us this note saying that more than a year later, I'm still recovering [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1122.56s)]
*  and suffering from headaches and other symptoms and have been diagnosed with two other medical [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1129.3799999999999s)]

*  That was a very debilitating attack and similar to what others have reported. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1145.24s)]
*  Those others include Miles Taylor, also speaking for the first time. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1153.16s)]

*  in a range of missions from aviation security to border security to cyber security. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1173.26s)]
*  Taylor told us he was hit with the same symptoms described by Olivia Troy. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1179.18s)]
*  It was late one night in April 2018. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1184.54s)]

*  a really strange sound. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1201.48s)]
*  The sound that woke Miles Taylor is a common experience reported by dozens of Americans [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1203.74s)]
*  stricken overseas. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1211.4s)]
*  It was sort of a chirping, somewhere between what you would think is a cricket or sort [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1213.04s)]
*  of a digital sound. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1217.7s)]
*  I didn't know what it was, but it was enough to wake me up. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1219.02s)]
*  What was really strange about it is I went to the window, opened up my window, looked [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1221.06s)]
*  down at the street. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1224.3600000000001s)]
*  And keep in mind, Scott, this is probably 3, 3.30 in the morning and I see a white van [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1225.3600000000001s)]
*  and the van's brake lights turned on and it pulled off and it sped away. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1229.92s)]
*  How long did it last? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1234.56s)]
*  This whole episode only lasted about 7 to 10 minutes. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1236.02s)]
*  How did you feel the next day? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1239.64s)]
*  Off, off, not ready to go to work, you know, kind of wanting to take the day off, you know, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1241.36s)]
*  sick. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1247.96s)]
*  Then about five weeks later, Taylor says it happened again. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1248.96s)]
*  I remember the next day feeling off balance, feeling just out of it. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1254.36s)]
*  Again, those sort of concussion-like symptoms you would have from, you know, getting knocked [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1258.9599999999998s)]
*  pretty hard in a sport. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1263.8799999999999s)]
*  That incident stood out to me because I was actually just getting ready to leave to go [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1266.4399999999998s)]
*  to Israel on a congressional delegation. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1272.12s)]
*  We were going to meet the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, have some sensitive conversations [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1274.0s)]
*  with the Israelis on important cybersecurity issues. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1278.7199999999998s)]
*  And I remember because I got to the airplane at Andrews Air Force Base to take off and [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1282.08s)]
*  thought, I'm already nauseous. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1285.9199999999998s)]
*  I don't know if I can do this flight. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1288.04s)]
*  Both Miles Taylor and Olivia Troy became critics of the Trump administration, but they told [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1291.6s)]
*  us that has nothing to do with what they see as a potential threat to national security. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1297.6s)]
*  Taylor says he became alarmed by that threat in 2018 after he heard of another case like [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1304.04s)]
*  his in the Washington area. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1311.0s)]
*  I became aware of a U.S. government official more senior than me who'd experienced similar [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1313.68s)]
*  episodes at their place of residence. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1320.24s)]
*  You say more senior than you. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1323.3600000000001s)]
*  Are you talking about a cabinet-level secretary? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1325.04s)]
*  This was an individual that, yes, was roughly at the cabinet level in the Trump administration [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1328.56s)]
*  who had had similar episodes occur. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1334.52s)]
*  That to me as a Homeland Security professional was a big blinking red light. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1337.92s)]
*  To me this said five alarm fire. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1342.3600000000001s)]
*  We may have ongoing activity targeting U.S. government officials here in our country. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1344.78s)]
*  Who was it? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1350.5600000000002s)]
*  I can't say the individual. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1351.5600000000002s)]
*  Out of respect for their privacy, I'll leave it at that. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1354.48s)]
*  But someone senior enough to say this is more than just a fluke. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1359.0800000000002s)]
*  More than a fluke, a pattern across two administrations. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1364.68s)]
*  Recent injuries among U.S. officials were reported in Vienna, Austria, ahead of a trip [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1369.64s)]
*  by the vice president to Vietnam, and in India during a visit by the director of the CIA. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1375.24s)]
*  In 2019, during a visit by President Trump to London, two members of John Bolton's national [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1382.24s)]
*  security staff became ill in a hotel. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1388.8400000000001s)]
*  That it was on the floor where it was completely taken up with personnel from the White House [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1393.48s)]
*  and White House agencies struck me as being pretty good evidence of a deliberate attack. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1399.76s)]
*  You believe it was an attack? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1405.8400000000001s)]
*  I don't think there's any other hypothesis when you begin to look at the number and the [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1407.64s)]
*  pattern that we've experienced. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1412.4s)]
*  Bolton says months later, one of those staff members hurt in London said she was overcome [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1415.24s)]
*  again, walking her dog in the Washington area. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1421.84s)]
*  We have found she is not the only one who says they were attacked abroad and later at home. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1426.48s)]
*  You must have thought that when you were home in America that you were safe. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1433.6799999999998s)]
*  I'll tell you, when I landed from China, I literally was kissing the ground. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1439.6s)]
*  We met Robin Garfield in 2019. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1445.08s)]
*  He's a Commerce Department official who told us that he, his wife and two children were [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1448.44s)]
*  repeatedly hit in China. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1453.92s)]
*  Your daughter was literally falling down? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1456.44s)]
*  Yes, she fell down multiple times that day. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1458.8s)]
*  They were evacuated and enrolled in a State Department treatment program at the University [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1461.44s)]
*  of Pennsylvania. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1466.56s)]
*  Recently, Garfield told us his family was hit again during their year of treatment in [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1468.0s)]
*  Philadelphia. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1475.2s)]
*  My wife catapulted out of bed and sprinted down the hallway to check the children without [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1476.68s)]
*  any word. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1483.6000000000001s)]
*  She came back and she told me that an extremely loud, painful sound had woken her up. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1484.72s)]
*  So they moved to a hotel where Garfield says it happened again. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1492.96s)]
*  We woke up around, I believe, 2 a.m. with strange vibrations in our bodies and a sound. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1498.6s)]
*  Which led Garfield to check on his children in another room. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1508.6399999999999s)]
*  I saw an extremely eerie scene where both were thrashing in their beds asleep, but both [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1512.4399999999998s)]
*  kicking and moving pretty aggressively. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1520.9599999999998s)]
*  I went over to my daughter and I put my head down next to her head and I heard a very distinct [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1526.64s)]
*  sound just right there, sort of like water rushing. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1533.48s)]
*  So I picked her up, took her in, put her with my wife and came back and I checked my son. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1537.5600000000002s)]
*  Same sound just right next to his head. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1542.1200000000001s)]
*  So I picked him up, put him on my shoulder, walked over to my wife and I said, we're getting [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1543.88s)]
*  out of here. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1549.3600000000001s)]
*  Garfield reported this to the FBI. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1551.0s)]
*  Today, his family is posted abroad where they continue to work to improve balance, eyesight [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1553.76s)]
*  and memory. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1561.28s)]
*  This is the most difficult aspect of this whole issue for me, are the children who have [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1562.7199999999998s)]
*  been impacted, both mine as well as many others. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1568.9599999999998s)]
*  I personally know the parents of, I believe, 8 other children. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1573.84s)]
*  I can tell you I've personally seen balance issues in children that have never had that, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1578.96s)]
*  trouble with finding their words, stuttering, and then continuing challenges around vision. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1585.72s)]
*  One of the things that we have heard from some parents is that these are manifesting [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1592.44s)]
*  in the classroom in real, tangible ways. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1596.4s)]
*  Persistent neurological symptoms are not the only fight these Americans have faced. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1600.68s)]
*  Some of their early reports were dismissed as psychosomatic or illnesses connected to [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1606.32s)]
*  an infection or exposure to pesticides. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1613.2s)]
*  Some were told that they were suffering the effects of old sports injuries. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1617.04s)]
*  One theory had it that the sound these victims heard during the incidents was actually a [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1622.1399999999999s)]
*  particular species of cicada. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1627.96s)]
*  It was rough. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1631.76s)]
*  It was rough in the beginning. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1632.76s)]
*  It was a dark place to be. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1634.26s)]
*  We were kind of shoved aside and they wanted it to go away. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1635.32s)]
*  This man is among those who fought for recognition. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1638.5s)]
*  He's one of the first cases from 2016. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1642.12s)]
*  Americans assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Cuba say they and their families were struck [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1646.1599999999999s)]
*  at home frequently in the night. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1651.0s)]
*  He remembers the first time. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1653.96s)]
*  And that night, all the dogs started kicking off in the neighborhood, barking, which is [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1656.04s)]
*  very unusual for them all to go and chorus. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1660.0s)]
*  And then this just loud sound just absolutely filled my room. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1662.76s)]
*  I felt like my head was slowly starting to get crushed. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1666.48s)]
*  We agreed not to use his name. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1669.58s)]
*  He is not allowed to say what federal agency he worked for. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1671.86s)]
*  And then the ear, severe ear pain started. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1676.68s)]
*  So I liken it to if you put a Q-tip too far and you bounce off your eardrum, well, imagine [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1679.9s)]
*  taking a sharp pencil and just kind of poke in that. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1683.68s)]
*  It was very jarring and painful. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1685.96s)]
*  And eventually I started blacking out. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1690.1599999999999s)]
*  With the first public reports coming from Cuba, the affliction became known as Havana [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1693.7199999999998s)]
*  Syndrome. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1699.3999999999999s)]
*  More than two dozen embassy officials reported injury, but an early FBI report speculated [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1700.6s)]
*  it was all mass hysteria. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1707.28s)]
*  His brain injuries left him disabled, essentially retired, at the age of 36. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1710.8s)]
*  A weighted vest helps him balance. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1716.94s)]
*  His service dog helps with walking and his loss of vision. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1720.04s)]
*  Legally blind in one eye. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1725.38s)]
*  Correct, yeah. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1727.38s)]
*  What have the doctors told you? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1729.3400000000001s)]
*  It's not the eye, it's the wiring. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1731.26s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1733.3s)]
*  That the eye function as itself is completely correct and appropriate. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1734.78s)]
*  It's the signal that comes out the back of the eye into the brain is where the problems [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1740.68s)]
*  are and no one really knows how to fix that. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1746.26s)]
*  He is speaking tonight for the first time to put an end to doubt. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1748.4599999999998s)]
*  You have not wanted to do this interview. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1753.4599999999998s)]
*  This is probably one of my worst nightmares. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1757.3799999999999s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1760.1799999999998s)]
*  I didn't do my job because I want to be known. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1761.74s)]
*  I did my job because I love my country and I was good at it. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1765.4199999999998s)]
*  God, and I miss my job. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1767.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm here because I'm tired of the gaslighting that keeps happening from the US government. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1770.5s)]
*  I'm tired of this yo-yoing because I'm watching new colleagues and friends that I've trained [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1776.1000000000001s)]
*  with and friends that I've known for years that are being sent to these countries and [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1780.5s)]
*  coming back a shell of their former selves. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1784.14s)]
*  We need to help them and we need to stop this. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1787.22s)]
*  But who is it that must be stopped? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1790.8200000000002s)]
*  When we come back, we'll ask the director of the CIA about his investigation and we'll [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1793.94s)]
*  look at the kind of device capable of inflicting brain injury without a trace. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1799.2s)]
*  Brain injuries suffered by US officials in Washington and abroad are the focus of an [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1816.64s)]
*  intense investigation. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1822.24s)]
*  After starting with around 1,000 possible cases, a CIA task force has zeroed in on about [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1824.44s)]
*  two dozen that cannot be explained. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1831.48s)]
*  The task force, which includes the FBI, is led by a CIA officer who helped find Osama [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1834.92s)]
*  Bin Laden. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1841.44s)]
*  The new director of the CIA, William Burns, told us one thing is already clear. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1842.8400000000001s)]
*  Under early disbelief, these injured Americans can no longer be doubted. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1848.88s)]
*  In my first week as director, I began what have become dozens and dozens of meetings [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1855.64s)]
*  with affected officers and family members and I've found their stories to be powerful [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1860.8000000000002s)]
*  and compelling and sometimes heartbreaking. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1866.24s)]
*  Bill Burns had heard those stories from CIA officers who reported injuries since 2016, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1869.0800000000002s)]
*  but this past fall, while on an official visit to India, a member of his staff was stricken [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1876.1999999999998s)]
*  in their hotel. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1882.8s)]
*  Later, Burns personally escorted that staff member to medical evaluations. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1884.4399999999998s)]
*  It seems that the Delhi incident might have been intended to send you a message. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1890.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't know and as I said, I can't comment on individual cases here as well. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1896.32s)]
*  All I can tell you is that each story I've heard, each officer I've met with who's been [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1901.96s)]
*  affected by this, just redoubles my commitment and my determination on this issue. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1906.12s)]
*  Bill Burns served five presidents at the State Department, rising to the highest rank in [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1913.28s)]
*  the Foreign Service. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1918.12s)]
*  He took over CIA for President Biden last spring. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1919.72s)]
*  Early on, I tripled the number of full-time medical personnel working on this issue. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1924.0s)]
*  We streamlined access to Walter Reed, established new partnerships with other world-class medical [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1929.1599999999999s)]
*  providers, increased the number of case managers, and we're also making progress on the investigative [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1934.32s)]
*  side as well. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1940.28s)]
*  Progress on the investigative side came this month with a report on the nature of the brain [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1942.6399999999999s)]
*  injury. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1948.32s)]
*  What we're hearing about now is... [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1949.32s)]
*  Dr. David Relman helped lead two government panels that investigated the injuries. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1950.6399999999999s)]
*  He's a professor of medicine at Stanford University. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1956.8799999999999s)]
*  What we found was, we thought, clear evidence of an injury to the auditory and vestibular [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1960.0s)]
*  system of the brain. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1967.4399999999998s)]
*  Everything starting with the inner ear, where humans perceive sound and sense balance and [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1969.52s)]
*  then translate those perceptions into brain electrical signals. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1978.8s)]
*  Dr. Relman's committees focused on one subset of patients whose experiences seemed inexplicable. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1985.8s)]
*  This subset of cases had a very unusual, so-called acute sensory event, an experience that consisted [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=1993.04s)]
*  of the abrupt onset of intense pressure or vibration in the face or head, sometimes with [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2001.72s)]
*  the abrupt onset of sound. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2011.28s)]
*  This is a sound like that described by the officials who spoke to us. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2014.3600000000001s)]
*  And then this just loud sound just absolutely filled my room. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2018.4s)]
*  This former official, who we agreed not to name, recorded the sound at his home in Havana. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2022.3600000000001s)]
*  Before we play it, understand that the sound does not cause the injury. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2029.16s)]
*  It is a byproduct, like the sound of a gun, which is not what does the harm. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2035.0s)]
*  The injured officials we spoke with said the sound, or a feeling of pressure, came [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2041.36s)]
*  from one direction and focused in one location. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2054.7999999999997s)]
*  It was a continuous sound and one that only changed based on my location. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2058.72s)]
*  They left, it dissipated. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2066.14s)]
*  They returned, it recurred. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2068.2s)]
*  That to us was something that we had never heard of, we could not explain by known medical [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2070.6s)]
*  or environmental conditions, and to us deserved our special attention in an effort to understand [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2076.12s)]
*  what might be the plausible mechanism. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2083.3199999999997s)]
*  That mechanism, Dr. Railman's committees concluded, was most likely pulsed electromagnetic energy. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2085.6s)]
*  In other words, a focused beam of microwaves fired from a distance. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2094.16s)]
*  I think the best explanation, most plausible, is that it's a high-power microwave weapon. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2100.32s)]
*  James Binford is a physicist and leading authority on microwaves. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2105.8s)]
*  He was not part of the government's studies, but he co-wrote the book on microwave transmission. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2110.1600000000003s)]
*  These are portable microwave transmitters of the kind that could damage the tissues of the brain. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2116.6400000000003s)]
*  There are many kinds, and they can go anywhere in size, from a suitcase all the way up to [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2123.92s)]
*  a large tractor trailer unit. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2130.16s)]
*  And the bigger the device, the longer the range. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2133.44s)]
*  This would be able to transmit its microwave energy through the wall of a van, the wall [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2136.12s)]
*  of a home, something like that? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2142.3599999999997s)]
*  Vans have windows. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2144.96s)]
*  Microwaves go through glass. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2146.8799999999997s)]
*  They go through brick. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2148.68s)]
*  They go through practically everything. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2150.2s)]
*  The technology, Binford told us, has been studied more than 50 years. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2152.0s)]
*  It's been developed widely in perhaps a dozen countries. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2156.96s)]
*  The primary countries are the United States, Russia, and China. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2161.12s)]
*  The implications of a mechanism like that suggest something different about the world [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2164.96s)]
*  now involving the loss of norms. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2171.76s)]
*  Humans were affected in a serious fashion, and for that very reason alone, we have to [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2176.2400000000002s)]
*  understand this better. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2181.2400000000002s)]
*  The investigation is also trying to understand who could be behind this and their motive. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2183.36s)]
*  Microwaves can be a tool for spies. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2190.04s)]
*  Some devices are capable of collecting data remotely from phones and computers. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2192.8s)]
*  Whatever is causing the brain injuries, a CIA interim report last month said there is [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2199.36s)]
*  no evidence of a massive global campaign to attack Americans. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2205.56s)]
*  The interim CIA report last month said, we assess it unlikely that a foreign actor, including [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2210.76s)]
*  Russia, is conducting a sustained worldwide campaign harming U.S. personnel with a weapon [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2218.28s)]
*  or a mechanism. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2225.7200000000003s)]
*  Do you mean to say that no one was harmed by a hostile actor? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2227.2000000000003s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2232.4s)]
*  The intelligence community assesses now that there's not a single cause that it would explain [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2233.4s)]
*  the more than a thousand incidents that have been reported since Havana in 2016. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2238.64s)]
*  We've also not yet been able to link a foreign state actor or an external device or mechanism [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2245.0s)]
*  to any of those cases. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2251.44s)]
*  This is the world's preeminent intelligence agency. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2253.4s)]
*  Why is this so hard to figure out? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2258.52s)]
*  It's a very complicated issue, dealing with a whole range of incidents which have different [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2260.12s)]
*  kinds of explanations for them as well. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2267.8s)]
*  It's a very charged issue emotionally as well. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2270.16s)]
*  I understand that very clearly. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2273.12s)]
*  That's what makes me even more determined, not only to ensure people get the care that [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2275.36s)]
*  they deserve, but also that we get to the bottom of this. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2280.16s)]
*  Former National Security Advisor John Bolton fears there is a threat to the highest levels [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2283.36s)]
*  of government, given the two national security officials who say they were overcome on West [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2288.36s)]
*  Executive Avenue by the West Wing inside the White House gates. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2294.74s)]
*  If we were at war and an adversary could disable the president and his top advisors or commanders [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2300.02s)]
*  in the field, it could render us extraordinarily vulnerable. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2306.62s)]
*  We don't know that that's the threat we're facing, but I would much rather focus on finding [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2310.8799999999997s)]
*  out the answer now rather than finding out later when it may be too late. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2316.12s)]
*  Former Homeland Security Chief of Staff Miles Taylor says he believes he was targeted in [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2322.1s)]
*  two mysterious incidents at his Washington home. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2328.1s)]
*  Someone is trying to send us a message that they can strike blows against us and we can't [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2331.98s)]
*  strike back. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2337.44s)]
*  That line being crossed into the United States takes this, in some ways, just shy of the [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2339.2599999999998s)]
*  realm of warfare. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2347.2999999999997s)]
*  Is the national security structure in danger of being incapacitated during a time of crisis? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2349.04s)]
*  No, I don't think that's the case. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2356.04s)]
*  But if people are being overcome on West Executive Avenue, is that an indication that the White [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2358.48s)]
*  House and its grounds are no longer safe? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2363.68s)]
*  No, I don't believe that's the case. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2365.72s)]
*  What it is an indication of is that we need to take each of these reported incidents very [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2367.84s)]
*  seriously, and as a government, and this is a government-wide effort, to pour the very [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2371.96s)]
*  best resources we have into this. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2377.64s)]
*  What line is crossed if a hostile actor is doing this in Washington, D.C.? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2380.06s)]
*  Oh, that would be a pretty profound line to be crossed if, in fact, that were the case, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2385.7999999999997s)]
*  if we were ever able to develop concrete evidence that that were the case. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2390.56s)]
*  But we do not have evidence of that at this point. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2395.16s)]
*  You understand how frustrating your comments must be to some of these people who believe [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2397.8799999999997s)]
*  they know exactly what happened to them on what day and at what time and what happened [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2404.0s)]
*  to their children. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2409.7200000000003s)]
*  And yet the director of the CIA is saying, we can't connect the dots. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2411.32s)]
*  We don't know enough yet. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2415.62s)]

*  dots. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2422.7200000000003s)]
*  But as I said, we're not done yet. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2423.7200000000003s)]
*  We still have a lot of work to do. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2425.48s)]
*  And what I've said directly to a number of those officers is my promise is that I am [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2427.16s)]
*  absolutely committed to exhausting every alternative so that we can provide the kind [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2432.72s)]
*  of answers that we owe them. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2438.3999999999996s)]
*  This past summer in Geneva, President Biden raised the issue with Russian President Putin. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2440.68s)]
*  The Russians deny they're involved. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2446.8199999999997s)]
*  The Secret Service declined to comment on White House security. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2449.72s)]
*  The iron gates of West Executive Avenue by the West Wing went up in 1951 after the attempted [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2455.2s)]
*  assassination of Harry Truman. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2462.56s)]
*  Seventy years later, there is evidence the gates may have been breached by an invisible [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2465.2s)]
*  threat. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2471.7999999999997s)]
*  Sixty Minutes Overtime. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2480.12s)]
*  The story this week is one that we've been working on for years now, and it has to do [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2483.48s)]
*  Strange neurological symptoms that U.S. officials and their family members have been suffering [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2488.56s)]
*  overseas since about 2016, the first cases being reported among U.S. diplomats and officials [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2493.88s)]
*  in Havana, Cuba. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2501.44s)]
*  Loud sound just absolutely filled my room. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2503.4s)]
*  I felt like my head was slowly starting to get crushed and then severe ear pain started. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2506.36s)]
*  I liken it to if you put a Q-tip too far and you bounce off your eardrum, well imagine [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2511.14s)]
*  taking a sharp pencil and just kind of poke in that. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2514.64s)]
*  It was very jarring and painful. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2517.36s)]
*  And eventually I started blacking out. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2521.08s)]
*  One theory is that these officials have been hit with some kind of a microwave device, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2523.34s)]
*  perhaps even a weapon, that was designed to incapacitate them. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2529.16s)]
*  In our original reporting in 2019, we found that there were also people who believed that [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2534.62s)]
*  they had been injured in China. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2539.92s)]
*  Mark Lindsay was a U.S. official in Guangzhou, China. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2542.28s)]
*  It's a sound like I've never heard before. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2547.3199999999997s)]
*  Was this subtle? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2548.3199999999997s)]
*  Like did I hear that? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2550.0s)]
*  No, it was actually somewhat loud. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2551.48s)]
*  I heard it about three or four times, always in the same spot, always over my son's crib [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2553.8199999999997s)]
*  and always right before we would go to bed. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2558.24s)]
*  Almost all of these diplomats and intelligence officers told us that they were attacked in [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2560.54s)]
*  the homes that they were living in while overseas. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2566.08s)]
*  And so it involved their spouse, it involved their children. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2570.56s)]
*  And some of what they have told us about what happened to their children is particularly disturbing. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2575.36s)]
*  My daughter, who's very athletic, went for a run. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2581.24s)]
*  She lost all of her right side eyesight. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2586.06s)]
*  She couldn't see anything to her right. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2591.76s)]
*  And she's asking me if she's going blind. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2594.54s)]
*  These events were happening not just to U.S. officials, but also Canadian officials at [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2597.02s)]
*  the Canadian Embassy in Havana, Cuba. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2602.36s)]
*  We spoke to several of them. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2605.7200000000003s)]
*  They didn't want to be identified because they were concerned that they didn't know [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2607.8s)]
*  who or what had done this to them and they didn't want to make themselves targets again. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2612.26s)]
*  Something woke me up. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2617.9s)]
*  It was 10 after 3. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2619.32s)]
*  I looked at the clock and I heard this noise. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2620.32s)]
*  And it was loud, metallic, screeching noise. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2623.5400000000004s)]
*  And at the end of it, it died out. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2627.6800000000003s)]
*  It went... [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2630.34s)]
*  And as soon as it went below where I could hear it, I just thought I was going to throw [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2632.5s)]
*  up. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2637.06s)]
*  My daughter woke up in the middle of the night gushing blood. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2638.06s)]
*  Not once, not twice, but three times. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2643.0s)]
*  From her nose? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2645.5s)]
*  From her nose. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2646.6600000000003s)]
*  There was a whole trail of blood between her bed and the actual bathroom. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2647.7400000000002s)]
*  Her hands were filled up. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2653.6000000000004s)]
*  She went back to bed. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2655.56s)]
*  Happened a second time and a third time. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2656.98s)]
*  And I mean soaked in blood. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2659.6s)]
*  One of the problems that the Canadians and American officials had back in 2016, 2017, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2662.14s)]
*  when this was just beginning to happen, was that people in Washington and in the Canadians' [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2669.06s)]
*  case, Ottawa, were just not taking them seriously. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2674.42s)]
*  My oldest son had massive nosebleeds that came out of nowhere. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2677.78s)]
*  My youngest son was passing out for no reason. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2684.38s)]
*  I contacted the embassy to arrange to have them flown straight to Ottawa, and they denied [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2687.7599999999998s)]
*  that request. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2693.3199999999997s)]
*  They said if there's any chance they can get a concussion in Canada, the same chance they [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2694.3199999999997s)]
*  can get a concussion in Cuba. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2703.16s)]
*  So that was the first real kick in the gut for me that they weren't going to take care [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2704.8799999999997s)]
*  of us. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2712.54s)]
*  My son was younger and therefore a little bit more oblivious to his symptoms. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2713.54s)]
*  And he'd tell me, Mom, you mean it's not normal that when I go in the play yard, everything [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2719.54s)]
*  spins? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2725.94s)]
*  Everybody doesn't have that. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2728.04s)]
*  You know, it's one thing if some foreign government didn't like what I was doing for a job, but [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2730.14s)]
*  to hit my entire house and affect my wife and kids, that's just not right. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2737.56s)]
*  Robin Garfield is an official with the U.S. Commerce Department. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2742.58s)]
*  He was stationed in China with his wife and his two children. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2747.2999999999997s)]
*  They told us that they were attacked in their homes with severe impacts that caused them [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2752.4s)]
*  to be medically evacuated back to the United States and then were attacked again after [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2758.64s)]
*  they returned to the United States. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2764.7999999999997s)]
*  You believe that someone in the room above you was using some kind of a weapon to attack [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2766.7599999999998s)]
*  your family in the hotel room below? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2772.34s)]
*  I do. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2775.38s)]
*  And that they specifically targeted your children in their beds? [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2776.38s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2780.6200000000003s)]
*  If these are actual attacks, the cases of the children being wounded is an indication [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2782.44s)]
*  of just how callous this is about people who are being attacked in their residences, in [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2787.94s)]
*  their homes abroad. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2792.94s)]
*  And there seems to be no concern about the indiscriminate nature of this, that spouses [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2795.6200000000003s)]
*  are being injured, that little children are being injured. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2801.62s)]
*  This is the most difficult aspect of this whole issue for me, are the children who have [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2805.3s)]
*  been impacted, both mine as well as many others. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2811.66s)]
*  I personally know the parents of, I believe, eight other children. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2816.7s)]
*  I can tell you I've personally seen balance issues in children that have never had that [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2821.38s)]
*  trouble with finding their words, stuttering, and then continuing challenges around vision. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2828.14s)]
*  Our children are the forgotten victims of the Havana syndrome. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2835.3399999999997s)]
*  Their illness is real, and we don't want this to be what they're associated with for the [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2841.22s)]
*  rest of their lives. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWTBEl1rRc&t=2846.7s)]
