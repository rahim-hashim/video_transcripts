# Stories About Blindness | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [February 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68)
*  At age 45, Chris Downey had pretty much constructed the life he'd always wanted. An architect [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=0.0s)]
*  with a good job at a small housing firm outside San Francisco, he was happily married with [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=20.6s)]
*  a 10-year-old son. He was an assistant little league coach and avid cyclist. And then doctors [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=26.16s)]
*  discovered a tumor in his brain. He had surgery and the tumor was safely gone, but Downey was [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=33.36s)]
*  left completely blind. What he has done in the 10 years since losing his sight as a person and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=40.8s)]
*  as an architect can only be described as a different kind of vision. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=48.199999999999996s)]
*  Several mornings a week as the sun rises over the Oakland Estuary in California, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=53.44s)]
*  an amateur rowing team works the water. It's hard to tell which one of them is blind, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=61.48s)]
*  and Chris Downey thinks that's just fine. It's really exciting to be in a sport where [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=68.56s)]
*  nobody looks in the direction they're going. You're faced this way in the boat, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=74.72s)]
*  you're going that way. So, okay, even Stephen. We were just talking about that whole exterior. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=78.84s)]
*  It's not exactly even Stephen in this design meeting where Downey is collaborating with [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=85.8s)]
*  sighted architects on a new hospital building. But he hasn't let that stop him. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=91.4s)]
*  Here you are in a profession that basically requires you to read designs and draw designs. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=98.48s)]
*  You must have thought in your head that is insurmountable. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=106.4s)]
*  Lots of people, friends that were architects, and anybody else would say, oh my God, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=113.84s)]
*  it's the worst thing imaginable to be an architect and to lose your sight. I can't imagine anything [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=118.56s)]
*  worse. But I quickly came to realize that the creative process is an intellectual process. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=124.16s)]
*  It's how you think. So it just needed new tools. New tools? Downey found a printer that could [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=129.76s)]
*  emboss architectural drawings so that he could read and understand through touch. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=137.84s)]
*  They look like normal prints, normal drawings on the computer, but then they just come out in [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=143.92s)]
*  tactile form. So it is like Braille, isn't it? Right. And he came up with a way to sketch his [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=149.04s)]
*  ideas onto the plans using a simple children's toy, malleable wax sticks that he shapes to show [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  his modifications to others. And he says something surprising started to happen. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=162.56s)]
*  He could no longer see buildings and spaces, but he began hearing them. The sounds, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=169.2s)]
*  the textures, and the sound changes because there's a canopy overhead. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=176.0s)]
*  You can sense that we're under a canopy? Yes. It's all a matter of how the sound works from [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=180.24s)]
*  the tip of the cane. I was fascinated walking through buildings that I knew sighted, but I was [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=185.12s)]
*  experiencing them in a different way. I was hearing the architecture. I was feeling the space. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=192.4s)]
*  It sounds as if you began almost enjoying, in a way, being the blind architect. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=198.88s)]
*  Sort of this excitement of, I'm a kid again. I'm relearning so much of architecture. It wasn't [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=206.16s)]
*  about what I'm missing in architecture. It was about what I had been missing in architecture. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=214.24s)]
*  Is that sufficiently different? Oh, yeah. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=220.0s)]
*  Chris Downey's upbeat attitude doesn't mean that he didn't go through one of the most frightening [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  experiences imaginable and struggle. He and his wife Rosa were living in this same home [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=228.08s)]
*  with their son Renzo, then 10, when Downey first noticed a problem while playing catch with Renzo. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=235.12s)]
*  The ball kept coming in and out of sight. The cause turned out to be a tumor near his optic nerve. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=242.56s)]
*  Surgery to remove it lasted nine and a half hours. He says his surgeon had told him there was a [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  slight risk of total sight loss, but that he'd never had it happen. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=256.32s)]
*  When he first came out of surgery, he was able to see. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=261.2s)]
*  But then things started to go wrong. The next day, half his field of vision disappeared, and then... [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=265.92s)]
*  The next time I woke up, it was all gone. It was just black. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=273.44s)]
*  It's complete and total darkness. No light. You can't see anything. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=277.76s)]
*  No light. It's dark. It's all dark. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=282.24s)]
*  After days of frantic testing, a surgeon told him it was permanent, irreversible, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=286.08s)]
*  and sent in a social worker. She said, oh, and I see from your chart, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=293.12s)]
*  you're an architect, so we can talk about career alternatives. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  Career alternatives. Yeah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=300.88s)]
*  Right away. I'd been told I was officially blind for 24 hours. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=302.88s)]
*  And she's saying you can't be an architect anymore. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=306.96s)]
*  And she's saying we can talk about career alternatives. I felt like these walls were being [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  built up around me. Just like, yeah, you're getting boxed in. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=313.44000000000005s)]
*  Alone that night in his room, Downey did some serious thinking about his son and about his [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=318.16s)]
*  own father, who had died from complications after surgery when Downey was seven years old. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=324.32000000000005s)]
*  I could quickly appreciate the wonder, the joy of, I'm still here. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  It was actually joy? Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=337.68s)]
*  It's like, I'm still here with my family. My son still has his dad. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=339.84s)]
*  You know, your eyes are tearing up. You know that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=344.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Sorry. I always have a hard time talking through that. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=346.88s)]
*  He knew that how he handled this would send a strong message to Renzo. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=351.91999999999996s)]
*  I had been talking with him about the need to really apply himself. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=356.79999999999995s)]
*  At the age of 10, it's that point where if you want something, you really have to work at it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=360.79999999999995s)]
*  And here I am, facing this great challenge. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  So motivated to set an example, he headed back to work only one month later. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=369.04s)]
*  This was the most healthy thing about Chris. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=375.04s)]
*  Brian Bashan is executive director of the non-profit Lighthouse for the Blind and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=377.44s)]
*  Visually Impaired in San Francisco and is blind himself. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=382.56s)]
*  He waited a few days until the stitches were out of his skull. And 30 days after brain surgery, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=386.88s)]
*  he was back in the office thinking, OK, there's got to be a way to figure this out. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=393.12s)]
*  And I'm going to figure it out. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=398.24s)]
*  Bashan's organization, the Lighthouse, helps people new to vision loss learn how to figure [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  things out. Let's try the first line. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  When someone becomes blind, the odds are 99 percent they've never met another blind person. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=408.16s)]
*  Is that right? Yeah, that really is true. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=413.76s)]
*  Blind people need those role models. How to be blind, how to hold down a job, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  how to live an independent life. Specifically, how to work in the kitchen safely. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=421.36s)]
*  Morning. How to navigate public transportation. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=427.44000000000005s)]
*  How to use screen reading software to listen to emails as quickly as the rest of us read them. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=432.08000000000004s)]
*  Did you understand that? Yes. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  No. And most critically, how to get around in the world alone. Downey learned that at the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=442.72s)]
*  Lighthouse. When you first crossed a big street like this on your own, was it terrifying? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=450.0s)]
*  Absolutely terrifying. I can totally imagine. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  I remember that day that stepping off the curb, you would have thought I was stepping into raging [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=460.4s)]
*  waters. Take a deep breath and go for it. You've got to push through it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=465.76s)]
*  Within a few months, he was traveling the streets on his own and getting back to normalcy with his [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  son. The first Father's Day came up. Rosa was like, so what do you want to do? You want to go on a [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  picnic, go on a nice lunch? I want to play baseball with Renzo. Renzo was like, he popped up. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=482.32s)]
*  I could just, I could feel him like jump to the edge of his chair. Baseball, you want to play [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=489.44s)]
*  baseball? So Dad would throw to me and I'd play like I was playing first base. How could he throw [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=493.52s)]
*  the ball to you? I'd just call out, I'm over here. Yeah, there you go. And he'd point and I'd say, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=499.36s)]
*  yeah, that's right. And then he'd throw it at me. But that's something I really loved about our [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=505.28s)]
*  relationships. He quickly was looking for possibilities. He wasn't seeing you can't do [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=510.08s)]
*  that. He was like, well, why not? All right, here we go. Downey seems to have a knack for finding [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=515.92s)]
*  windows when doors slam shut. Just nine months after going blind, the recession hit and he lost [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=522.0799999999999s)]
*  his job. But he got word that a nearby firm was designing a rehabilitation center for veterans [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=529.36s)]
*  with sight loss. They were eager to meet a blind architect. What are the chances? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=535.76s)]
*  You had to believe that God's hand came down. It took my disability and turned it upside down. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=542.96s)]
*  All of a sudden, it defined unique, unusual value that virtually nobody else had to offer. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=550.56s)]
*  Nobody? Yeah. Starting with that job, Downey developed a specialty, making spaces [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=558.72s)]
*  accessible to the blind. He helped design a new eye center at Duke University Hospital, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=565.36s)]
*  consulted on a job from Microsoft and signed on to help the visually impaired find their way [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=571.6800000000001s)]
*  in San Francisco's new and now delayed four block long Transbay Transit Center, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=578.08s)]
*  which we visited during construction. If you're blind, you don't drive. All right. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=584.72s)]
*  They don't like it when we drive. So, you know, we're committed transit users. So the question was [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=590.08s)]
*  how on earth do you navigate this size of facility if you're blind? His solution? Grooves set into the [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=595.76s)]
*  concrete running the entire length of the platform. Now we'll just follow this, following those grooves. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=604.48s)]
*  With a subtle change from smooth to textured concrete to signal where to turn to get to the [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=611.76s)]
*  escalators. Would you like to give it a try? Okay. I know to go straight because of this line and I feel, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=618.16s)]
*  oh my, oh my, so it's pretty obvious. I can hear the difference from here. It's something sighted [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  people may never notice, and that's precisely the point. Downey believes in what's called universal [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=632.0799999999999s)]
*  design that accommodates people with disabilities but is just as appealing to people without them. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=638.9599999999999s)]
*  It's the approach he used for his biggest project yet, consulting on the total renovation of a new [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=645.52s)]
*  three-story office space for his old training ground, the lighthouse for the blind. Coming into [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=653.52s)]
*  blindness need not be some dreary social service experience, but rather more like coming into an [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=659.68s)]
*  Apple store, thinking that there might be something fun around the corner. One of Downey's ideas was [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=666.0s)]
*  to break through and link the three floors with an internal staircase that sighted people can see [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=671.52s)]
*  and the blind can hear. In blindness, it's so wonderful to be on the ninth floor and hear a [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=678.96s)]
*  burst of laughter up on the 11th floor or to hear somebody playing the piano on the 10th floor. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=685.52s)]
*  For the hallways, Downey chose polished concrete because of the acoustics. I can hear the special [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=691.68s)]
*  tap of somebody's cane or the click of a guide dog's toenails. Click of a dog's toenail? Yeah. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=698.96s)]
*  Well, is that good or bad? That's great. It's like you're seeing somebody coming down the hall. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=706.24s)]
*  I know the sound of individual people who work here by the way they use their cane or the kind [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=711.76s)]
*  of walk they have. You can really distinguish between people by how they tap their cane. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=717.6s)]
*  Absolutely. If you hadn't had Chris working on this building, a blind architect, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=723.68s)]
*  it wouldn't have been as rich or so subtle for sure. Last spring marked the 10-year [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=730.2399999999999s)]
*  anniversary of Downey losing his sight. So what did he do? He threw a party, a fundraiser for the [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=735.5999999999999s)]
*  lighthouse where he's been student, architect, and now president of the board. Maybe a slightly [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=743.04s)]
*  bizarre thing, celebrating my 10-year blind birthday. But when you're 55 and you have a [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=749.76s)]
*  chance to be 10 again, you take it. I get the feeling that you actually think you're a better [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=756.72s)]
*  architect today. I'm absolutely convinced I'm a better architect today than I was excited. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=763.4399999999999s)]
*  If you could see tomorrow, would you still want to be able to feel the design? If I were to get my [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=770.88s)]
*  sight back, it would be... I don't know. I would be afraid that I'd sort of lose what I've really [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=776.88s)]
*  been working on. I don't really think about having my sight restored. There's be some logistical [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=785.12s)]
*  liberation to it, but will it make my life better? I don't think so. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=790.72s)]
*  In the world of skiing, there are two kinds of skiers. Those who like to stay on groomed runs [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=806.96s)]
*  and be guided gently around obstacles, and those who like to ski the whole mountain and ski towards [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=812.16s)]
*  the obstacles. That is called freeriding. Man-made jumps, rails, and half-pipes are rejected in favor [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=817.84s)]
*  of the drops, jagged cliffs, and deep chutes created by Mother Nature. The sport of freeriding [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=825.6s)]
*  took off in the 1990s and is now one of the fastest growing disciplines in skiing. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=832.0s)]
*  Given the risks inherent with the terrain, it attracts some of the bravest and most adventurous [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=837.44s)]
*  skiers in the world. But even among that group, 15-year-old Jacob Smith stands out. We thought you [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=842.88s)]
*  should see what he does, because he cannot. This is Big Sky, Montana, home to some of the steepest [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=850.32s)]
*  and most challenging ski slopes in the country. And that is Jacob Smith, who is blind. Three years [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=860.24s)]
*  ago, he was just 12 years old as he made his way to the top of the 11,000-foot-high Lone Peak [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=867.92s)]
*  to ski down it. Watch this. Dropping in three, two, one. Jacob drops into the Big Cool R, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=875.36s)]
*  a narrow, rock-walled 1,400-foot chute. That dot is him, making his way turn by turn. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=884.08s)]
*  A wrong move can be catastrophic. The run has a 50-degree slope, which means if you slip down the [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=892.48s)]
*  Cool R, there's little chance you can stop yourself. When you're standing at the top, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=899.44s)]
*  you feel like if you move, you're going to die. And that's the moment most people would say, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=904.24s)]
*  you know what, maybe not a good idea. Yeah, but I'm kind of just like, well, I'm already up here, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=908.24s)]
*  so I got to make it down somehow. He did and became the only legally blind athlete to ski [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=912.08s)]
*  the legendary run. You did it. That was awesome. History just has been made. Forever. How'd you feel [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=919.6s)]
*  when you made it to the bottom? Excited that I did it. I didn't crash. I thought it was awesome. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=927.76s)]
*  Well, I guess we made it four more times, so I just wanted to do it again. You were testing your luck [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=933.0400000000001s)]
*  that day. Yeah. We got Jacob Smith on course. Jacob is still testing his luck and good sense. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=937.6s)]
*  We met him in January at a junior regional freeride tournament in Big Sky. That's him, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=944.32s)]
*  now 15 years old, competing against 40 other teenage daredevils, all of whom can see perfectly [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=950.24s)]
*  well. Coming right off the top of that. Finding pretty good landing. This time, the background for [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=957.6s)]
*  all the competitors' spectacular experiment with gravity was another triple diamond shoot, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=964.64s)]
*  appropriately named DTM. DTM stands for? Don't Tell Mama. It is an insane run, like a 45 degree [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=970.96s)]
*  slope. Yeah. Do the judges give you any slack for being blind? No, zero. Do you think they should? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=981.6s)]
*  No, I don't. I want to be treated normal so I compete with other sighted skiers. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=988.88s)]
*  It's not an insignificant difference. We worked with his doctors and our graphic artists to show [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=994.96s)]
*  roughly what Jacob can see on a run. He has extreme tunnel vision and no depth perception. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1001.28s)]
*  On top of that, it's blurry. His visual acuity is rated 2,800, four times the level of legal [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1007.36s)]
*  blindness. Think of the biggie on the eye chart. He would need it to be blown up four times in [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1014.96s)]
*  order to see it from 20 feet away. Fantastic ski technique. You wouldn't be able to tell he's [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1021.52s)]
*  visually impaired. So how does Jacob ski like this? His family keeps him on course. Go up with your [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1027.2s)]
*  right feet really far. On competition days, his little brother Preston patiently helps him hike [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1034.88s)]
*  to the top of the venue. It's so high the lifts won't take you there. First down, down, perfect, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1040.16s)]
*  perfect, keep going. Then his father Nathan helps him get down. Nice turns, nice turns. Jacob has [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1047.2s)]
*  a two-way radio turned up high in his pocket. His dad is on the other end at the base somehow calmly [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1055.0400000000002s)]
*  guiding him down. Okay, right, right, right. It's on me to make sure I don't let him down, that I get [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1063.68s)]
*  him in trouble, you know, that I have to guide him through narrower chutes or not go off a cliff. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1069.12s)]
*  You have to be his eyes. Yeah. And there can't be a delay. He can't say, you're sure, Dad? No. Have [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1075.04s)]
*  you ever missed it? Have you ever said, oh gosh, I forgot to tell him about that or I didn't see that? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1081.28s)]
*  Oh yeah, all the time. But his adaptation is pretty amazing. How much do you trust him? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1085.52s)]
*  Well, I mean enough to turn right when he tells me. Jacob's just putting his all into my dad's [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1091.36s)]
*  voice. It's crazy skiing, just listening to someone turn there, turn there. Could you ski [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1096.88s)]
*  like that? It's like closing your eyes basically. It would be so hard. Jacob's siblings are all [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1102.5600000000002s)]
*  competitive skiers. That's Andrew who's 17 doing a 360. Preston is 14 and Julia is 12. Do the other [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1108.88s)]
*  competitors know that he's blind? Some do, but they always like announce it over the intercom that [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1118.24s)]
*  blind skier Jacob coming down the hill. He is the only ever, I have to say blind skier. That's when [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1125.3600000000001s)]
*  everyone turns and looks. Oh, it's a miracle. Look at him. Would you know if you didn't know? He's such [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1132.72s)]
*  a good skier for legally blind. Everybody's like no. They just get mad at him if he's in the way. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1138.24s)]
*  If we tell anybody that he's legally blind, then nobody believes us. They just give us a bad look. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1142.32s)]
*  Jacob was born with vision. Soon after he learned to walk, he was on skis. Family vacations were [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1147.84s)]
*  spent bombing down the trails and big sky with his family. But it was back home at their ranch [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1155.76s)]
*  in North Dakota that an unexpected obstacle changed Jacob's life. He started getting headaches and [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1161.68s)]
*  began bumping into things. He was eight years old. I like ran into a wall or something that my mom [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1168.8799999999999s)]
*  saw. And then it was like two days after I went to the eye doctor and he took one look at my eyes, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1174.88s)]
*  looked at my mom and then just asked like which hospital you want because my octave [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1182.3200000000002s)]
*  nerve was swelling and bleeding. Did you have any sense that things were going wrong up until that [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1187.2800000000002s)]
*  point? No. That day, Jacob was flown here to the Masonic Children's Hospital in Minneapolis, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1193.5200000000002s)]
*  where he underwent an emergency 12-hour surgery after an MRI revealed a cancerous brain tumor [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1200.72s)]
*  the size of a softball that was crushing his optic nerve. It's the scariest thing I've ever seen in my [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1208.48s)]
*  life. It looked like half his brain was a tumor. So at that point you're not thinking I'm worried [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1214.4s)]
*  he's going to lose his vision. You're thinking I'm losing my child. You're gonna lose your child. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1220.0s)]
*  I'm gonna bury a kid. In that first surgery, doctors removed enough of the tumor to relieve [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1224.08s)]
*  the pressure on Jacob's optic nerve to stop his vision from continuing to deteriorate. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1230.96s)]
*  Here he is leaving a message for his siblings a few days later. I miss you all a lot. I really, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1236.96s)]
*  too. Getting my visions getting better. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1245.84s)]
*  I'm coming home. I'm really excited. But Jacob would need three more major brain surgeries over [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1254.9599999999998s)]
*  the next three years, all before he was 12 years old. My head feels okay. Each time with an extensive [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1262.6399999999999s)]
*  rehabilitation. Did you ever get down about it? Like I did, but at the same time I just [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1270.64s)]
*  prayed a lot. When you were praying about it, were you praying this will be over? Were you praying [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1280.0800000000002s)]
*  I want to get my vision back? Or were you praying I'll stay alive? That I'll stay alive and that'll [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1285.2800000000002s)]
*  get through it. And that's what happened. Finally in 2017, a course of radiation eradicated the [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1290.64s)]
*  cancer and Jacob got a clean scan. But his doctor said the radiation increased his lifetime risk [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1297.76s)]
*  of another brain tumor by up to 30%. Right now, the tumor that we originally targeted [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1305.52s)]
*  is gone. You know, so far so good. It doesn't sound like you've exhaled. I don't think you ever [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1313.68s)]
*  exhale. Because? Because there's always the what if. You know, when you get put into that situation [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1320.8s)]
*  that you never felt you ever should have been or expected, I don't think you're ever going to exhale [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1327.76s)]
*  and go, we're done. Whose idea was it to return to skiing? Well, my dad's. Turn and go straight [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1332.16s)]
*  through it. So we came out here and we kind of just tried it out. Everywhere I went skiing for [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1340.32s)]
*  probably the first year or two was with either my dad or a coach. You've taught your kids to ski, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1346.4s)]
*  but you've never taught a blind child to ski? No. So you did not know what you were doing? No. So [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1352.4s)]
*  tell me about those early days. Well, at first everyone said get a rope and a sign and he's [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1357.6000000000001s)]
*  gonna be a blind skier and you're gonna guide him. Like I'm like, nope, that's not an option. We're [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1362.48s)]
*  not gonna do it that way. Because why? Because I'm not gonna let that define him. Father and son [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1366.3200000000002s)]
*  admit they're trying to carve their own path, sort of figuring it out as they go. Jacob says [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1373.6s)]
*  he's learned to listen for danger, other skiers, the churning of a lift or icy conditions underfoot. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1380.24s)]
*  Andy says he remembers many of the runs from when he could see. Can you feel your way down a run you [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1388.8799999999999s)]
*  didn't go on before you lost your vision? I mean, yeah, I can and I've done it. And how does it work [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1395.76s)]
*  out? It's pretty scary and sometimes takes me a little minute. That's got to be terrifying. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1402.32s)]
*  You get used to it. How many crashes were there in those early days? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1411.52s)]
*  I don't even think I didn't count that high. When Jacob was 10, he shattered his femur in 60 places [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1416.3999999999999s)]
*  when he skied into a tree. Are you not nervous that there's gonna be a catastrophic accident, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1423.6s)]
*  that he could die doing this? It's not the way I've like vision life. I don't look for the reasons [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1429.44s)]
*  not to do things. I'm not going to put him in something that I'm not going through first, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1435.1200000000001s)]
*  that the consequences of falling are not going to be life threatening. What are you fearful of? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1439.6000000000001s)]
*  The only big fear I have is not succeeding. You're more afraid of not succeeding than you are [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1446.3200000000002s)]
*  getting hurt. Yes. Why is that? Because I've already lost my vision. So a couple broken bones [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1453.6s)]
*  and a couple more mishaps, I guess, isn't a big deal to me at all. Clearly he's fearless. As a parent, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1461.4399999999998s)]
*  are you not fearful? He's not reckless. He knows his limitations. I think he has the ability to ski [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1469.84s)]
*  anything on the mountain, but he's not going to go try to do it by himself. Like he wants to be with [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1477.36s)]
*  somebody he wants to trust. He won't ski with people he doesn't trust. Nathan said Jacob is [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1482.08s)]
*  cautious about skiing and competing on low visibility days when he can see even less than [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1487.9199999999998s)]
*  usual. Still, he finds a way of keeping up with his siblings. They are an enviable pack on the [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1493.6799999999998s)]
*  mountain. Do you see him being like super plugged into everything else, right? To the sounds. He was [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1500.96s)]
*  saying he like hears the lift, the snow. Yeah. What do you see? His hearing is very like he chooses [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1506.72s)]
*  what he wants to hear. So what do you mean? There's times at home where he'll be like you could say his [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1512.48s)]
*  name a thousand times and he'll pretend like he didn't hear one word, but then skiing it's like [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1519.28s)]
*  you could like flick and he'll like just turn, you know. On competition day, Jacob suits up and sends [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1524.96s)]
*  it. Dad dropping three, two, one. Finishing 19th out of 41 competitors. For Jacob, success isn't [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1531.92s)]
*  about the trophy. It's about freedom, showing others how to negotiate obstacles even when you [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1542.3200000000002s)]
*  can't see them coming. Coming to the finish line. There you go. Honestly, no matter what gets thrown [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1549.2s)]
*  in front of you, what kind of comes out of nowhere and strikes you, takes you off guard a little bit, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1555.04s)]
*  there is always a way to conquer it, to adapt, to make it happen and still do what you want to do. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1560.88s)]
*  Blindness and partial blindness are not epidemic here in the U.S., [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1581.68s)]
*  but they are in certain parts of the world. Our story is about two doctors who decided to do [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1586.0s)]
*  something about it and incredibly to date they have restored sight to more than 150,000 people. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1592.4s)]
*  Doctors they've trained have restored sight to four million more. Their partnership seems improbable. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1599.84s)]
*  One is a hard-charging Ivy League American adrenaline junkie. The other, a serene Buddhist [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1606.48s)]
*  surgeon from the remote mountains of Nepal. We join them on one of their most challenging missions [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1613.2s)]
*  in the isolated country of Burma. Their goal? To lead Burma out of darkness one patient at a time. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1619.52s)]
*  One by one the patches are peeled away and the world comes back into focus. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1629.76s)]
*  You're witnessing the moment when the people in this room [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1635.92s)]
*  realize they can see for the first time in years. Can you see my fingers? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1639.28s)]
*  Their eyes and their faces begin to light up with a quiet sort of joy and wonder at the gift of sight. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1644.72s)]
*  As they look around they see who changed their world with an operation the day before that took [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1653.68s)]
*  just minutes. Beautiful. Doctors Jeff Tabin and Sanduk Ruwit are eye surgeons and now they are [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1659.76s)]
*  lifesavers. To hear doctors Ruwit and Tabin speak they are the beneficiaries. What's it like when [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1666.8s)]
*  that bandage is taken off and that person sees for the first time sees you? I may have seen it [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1674.72s)]
*  thousands of times but every time there's a new tickle there and I feel like my battery is being [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1681.36s)]
*  recharged. I still get such a thrill when people don't expect or realize they're going to have [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1687.76s)]
*  their sight restored and then the transformation when they see and that sort of moment of hesitation [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1692.64s)]
*  what are they seeing and then the smile. Good. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1701.2800000000002s)]
*  Who meant who hadn't seen for two years until this moment? Thank you, thank you. You're welcome. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1706.4s)]
*  Others here had been blind for decades. They all had cataracts a milky white build-up of protein [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1713.0400000000002s)]
*  that clouds the lens of the eye. In the U.S. they mainly afflict the elderly removing them [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1719.92s)]
*  a routine operation but here in Burma also known as Myanmar cataracts go untreated and blindness [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1726.0s)]
*  is a way of life. It's a Buddhist population they're very fatalistic they're very accepting [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1733.6000000000001s)]
*  and there's almost an acceptance that you get old your hair turns white your eye turns white and then [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1740.5600000000002s)]
*  you die and the idea that you can actually have your sight restored has not really permeated all [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1746.8s)]
*  levels of Myanmar society. What does that tell you about the state of eye care here? Well it's a place [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1753.44s)]
*  we can make a difference. Burma is one of the poorest countries in Asia slowly emerging from [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1759.76s)]
*  the darkness of decades of dictatorship. After years of trying Tabin and Ruweet finally were [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1767.44s)]
*  permitted to bring their treatment here. We met them in Tanji in central Burma where the lack of [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1774.32s)]
*  care has led to some of the highest rates of cataracts in the world. Through radio and pamphlets [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1781.6799999999998s)]
*  and conversation word of the doctor's visits spread. Hundreds of Burmese who'd lost their sight [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1787.6799999999998s)]
*  found their way to Tanji's hospital with the help of caregivers many trekking for days. Here cataracts [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1793.9199999999998s)]
*  are not just a malady of old age they take the sight of the very young too caused by infections [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1800.96s)]
*  and malnutrition. I think it's better to redo it. By the time the doctors scrubbed in the corridors [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1807.04s)]
*  were choked with people hoping to have their sight restored. Is it ever daunting I mean you look out [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1813.3600000000001s)]
*  there and you see that line of people all who need this surgery? It's daunting on a worldwide [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1820.8s)]
*  basis there may be a long line but this individual person I'm going to give the very best care I can. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1828.88s)]
*  Dr. Ruweet set a rapid pace he repaired an eye the patient got up the next patient was ready on an [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1835.8400000000001s)]
*  adjoining table just minutes an eye then on to the next. Hey Cam are they both blocked? Dr. Tabin [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1843.2s)]
*  performed the delicate surgery just feet away. Want to take a look see how nice and clear that is I don't [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1849.5200000000002s)]
*  know what that was maybe four or five minutes and it's going from total blindness to great vision. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1854.96s)]
*  Wow. They kept up this pace until seven in the evening. It's almost like an assembly line yeah [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1860.32s)]
*  but assembly line sounds too mechanical I mean this is people's eyes. Well the people's lives [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1866.48s)]
*  know once someone goes blind in the developing world their life expectancy is about one third [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1874.24s)]
*  that an age and health match appears and for a blind child the life expectancy is five years and [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1880.32s)]
*  also in the developing world it takes often a person out of the workforce or a child out of school [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1887.04s)]
*  to care for the blind person so when we restore sight to a blind person we're freeing up their [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1893.6s)]
*  family and restoring their life. Among the throng waiting to have their lives restored we found [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1899.52s)]
*  Kanchi. Her son a farmer had been her eyes and devoted caretaker since cataracts took her sight. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1907.76s)]
*  15 year old Yanu had been blind since age seven he was overwhelmed but grateful. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1917.52s)]
*  Thank you he said. Doctors Ruwit and Tabin heard that a lot. In four days in Tanji with the help of [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1925.2s)]
*  local doctors they were training they performed 503 cataract surgeries. Her eyes now bandaged [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1934.0s)]
*  Kanchi waited with her son. We were going to be performing as many cataract surgeries as the [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1941.76s)]
*  hospital does normally in a year. We are basically here to ignite fire ignite fire of the possibility [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1948.32s)]
*  of doing high quality high volume cataract surgery it is still possible. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1957.2s)]
*  You want to ignite a fire here. As long as he can remember Sanduk Ruwit has been burning to [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1963.92s)]
*  change the world around him. He grew up desperately poor in this village with no electricity or running [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1971.1200000000001s)]
*  water high in the Himalayas of Nepal. The nearest school was a 15 day walk away. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1978.8s)]
*  Ruwit's illiterate parents saw education as the way out for their children but the grip of poverty [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1986.56s)]
*  and poor health was too strong to escape. His younger sister with whom he was very close [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1992.72s)]
*  died of tuberculosis. I saw her pass away in front of me and then there's a very strong [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=1999.6s)]
*  determination from inside that maybe this is the profession that I should take and make health care [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2009.84s)]
*  available for my countrymen. That determination took him to medical school in India. He came [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2017.52s)]
*  back to Nepal an eye doctor committed to bringing modern care to remote mountain villages. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2023.76s)]
*  The documentary Out of the Darkness showed them carrying equipment on their backs. His team hiked [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2030.16s)]
*  for days. His goal as revolutionary as it was simple to cure blindness in the third world with [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2036.72s)]
*  a quick cheap technique to remove cataracts. Soon the medical world took notice and so did [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2046.72s)]
*  a young Jeff Taven. I imposed myself on Sanduk and came to work in Nepal. What did you think of him [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2054.7200000000003s)]
*  when he first showed up? You know I was a bit scared in the beginning you know. He had tremendous [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2066.32s)]
*  energy. He would never get tired. Energy in working, energy in eating, energy in drinking, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2070.64s)]
*  energy in talking you know. It was like being hit by a human avalanche. Fitting since Jeff [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2077.04s)]
*  Taven's passion was mountaineering more than medicine. He'd raced through Yale, Oxford and [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2083.6s)]
*  Harvard Medical School but he had made his name as one of the first people to climb the highest [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2090.0s)]
*  peak on every continent. He met Dr. Ruwit and thought he'd found his next challenge. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2096.0s)]
*  Ruwit was skeptical. This frenetic young man had the same dedication to ophthalmology he had to [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2102.72s)]
*  adventure. I sent him to a hospital in eastern part of Nepal in the middle of summer and I said he's [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2109.12s)]
*  not going to survive there. During the summer in the monsoon it's quite oppressive. It's sort of [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2116.64s)]
*  100 degrees, 105 with 99 percent humidity and lots of mosquitoes. Wait a minute you sent him to a [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2123.04s)]
*  difficult place on purpose? Difficult place, difficult place, definitely. Did you know that [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2131.84s)]
*  he was testing you? No I thought he sent me there because there was so much need. I scratched my [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2136.16s)]
*  mosquito bites and was excited to go to work that there were all of these blind people [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2142.4s)]
*  that you know I could make a difference in their life. He won you over? Yes, yes definitely. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2148.64s)]
*  Their relationship has grown from teacher-student to collaborators and friends. Like Yin and Yang, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2155.6s)]
*  these opposites complement each other. They created the Himalayan Cataract Project, started [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2162.16s)]
*  here at Telganga, Ruwit's hospital in Kathmandu. They perfected the procedure called small incision [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2168.3999999999996s)]
*  cataract surgery. Just one small splice, the cataract comes out, a new man-made lens goes in, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2175.44s)]
*  no stitches required. It's quick and costs about $20. How does the quality of care you're providing [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2182.7200000000003s)]
*  here compare to the quality of care you'd be able to provide in the US? For these advanced cataracts [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2189.92s)]
*  I'm performing the same quality of surgery that I would be doing in America. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2198.16s)]
*  Dr. Tabin spends most of his year at the University of Utah where cataract surgery costs a couple [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2202.88s)]
*  thousand dollars an eye. He might do four or five a day. Here he does that many in a half hour, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2209.2000000000003s)]
*  removing cataracts he'd never see in the US because they'd never go untreated so long. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2218.0s)]
*  Their project is funded by donations and grants. They're able to keep costs down because they don't [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2224.08s)]
*  use expensive equipment and they make their own lenses at their factory in Nepal. The lenses are [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2230.96s)]
*  crucial to the process. They're a permanent implant. Each costs about $4. In the US, because [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2237.6800000000003s)]
*  of strict safety requirements, they can cost 50 times more. Comparable quality? Very comparable. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2245.36s)]
*  I put that in my mother's eyes. So far they've operated in two dozen countries, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2252.8s)]
*  including North Korea, Ethiopia, and now Burma. So tell me what you think of this. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2260.4s)]
*  Okay. They've brought hundreds of doctors, including the Burmese doctors working with them [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2265.28s)]
*  to Tilganga for training and everywhere they go, they train other doctors to carry on their work [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2269.92s)]
*  once they've moved on. How many fingers? We saw the immediate benefit the morning after surgery. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2275.92s)]
*  How many? One. The patients gathered in a Buddhist monastery. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2283.6800000000003s)]
*  As the bandages came off, first wonder, then smiles and celebration. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2290.7200000000003s)]
*  Remember U-Mint-U, blind for two years? His family sent us this picture. He can read again [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2306.08s)]
*  his favorite pastime. 15-year-old Yanu, blind half his life, seemed somewhat bewildered by [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2313.6800000000003s)]
*  this new world of sight. For Kanchi, the wait was over. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2322.32s)]
*  Her son was overcome when she saw his face for the first time in years. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2336.64s)]
*  Then there was this woman. This is the first time she's been able to see in months? [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2346.96s)]
*  Yes, sir. She called doctors Ruweed and Taben gods. They assured her they are not, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2351.12s)]
*  but in this room it certainly seemed they had performed miracles. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2358.96s)]
*  Hallelujah. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2366.4s)]
*  The doctors recently got more good news. The Himalayan Cataract Project is one of eight [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2370.8s)]
*  semi-finalists for a hundred million dollar grant from the MacArthur Foundation. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2376.64s)]
*  Most of us take for granted that we can instantly recognize people we know by looking at their [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2382.56s)]
*  faces. It's so automatic it almost sounds silly to even say it. Friends can put on a hat, cut [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2399.52s)]
*  their hair, and still we know them by their face. We can do this for thousands upon thousands of [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2406.32s)]
*  faces without ever giving it a moment's thought. But imagine for a second what life would be like [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2412.56s)]
*  if you couldn't. If your wife or husband looked like a stranger. You couldn't tell your kids apart. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2418.56s)]
*  Couldn't recognize yourself in a mirror. Well, that's what life is like for people who suffer [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2425.52s)]
*  from a mysterious condition called face blindness or prosopagnosia that can make it nearly impossible [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2431.2s)]
*  to recognize or identify faces. If you've never heard of face blindness, you're not alone. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2438.56s)]
*  Chances are your doctor hasn't either. It's been unknown to most of the medical world until very [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2445.3599999999997s)]
*  recently. Hearing about it can feel a little like entering the twilight zone, but for people who are [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2451.68s)]
*  face blind, the condition is very real. Jacob Hodes is one of them. He's 31 years old. He has [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2458.48s)]
*  a college degree, has had great jobs, and he seems perfectly normal. Just don't ask him to identify [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2468.32s)]
*  any faces. We're going to put up the first one. Even very famous ones. No idea. We showed Jacob [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2475.52s)]
*  faces without hair. A pure test of facial recognition. No. Nope. Can't say if I've ever [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2485.44s)]
*  seen that person. He has seen Jimmy Carter plenty of times and knows Michael Jordan too. Oh lord. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2496.0s)]
*  He just can't recognize their faces. Now that's just impossible. I mean, can you describe my face? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2504.7200000000003s)]
*  You're staring right at it. High cheekbones, light eyes. Clearly Jacob could see my face, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2510.96s)]
*  but he says if we happen to run into each other in a few days, he wouldn't know me from any other [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2518.2400000000002s)]
*  woman with short blonde hair. They meet somebody, they have a good time with them, they have a nice [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2523.6s)]
*  relationship. Then a week later they walk past them. Brad Duchesne is a professor at Dartmouth [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2528.16s)]
*  College who's been studying face blindness for nearly 15 years. He says the hardest thing to [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2533.76s)]
*  understand is how people can see a familiar face but not recognize it. So he created a demonstration [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2539.52s)]
*  to give me a little taste. Faces turned upside down. So here are some famous faces. You're going to be [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2548.08s)]
*  tempted to twist your head, but don't do it. Okay. Can you identify any of these people? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2555.52s)]
*  I was completely at a loss. You think I'd know all of these people? You've seen them all a lot. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2561.36s)]
*  I can't, I don't know any of these people. I really don't. Do you want to see them upright? Sure. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2567.68s)]
*  It was astonishing. With just that click, they became recognizable people before my eyes. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2575.7599999999998s)]
*  I know John Travolta, I know Morley. And there was Denzel Washington, Jennifer Aniston, Sandra Bullock, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2582.3199999999997s)]
*  but the one that really got me was the young woman on the lower right, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2589.92s)]
*  my daughter. I didn't know my own daughter? Yeah. I didn't know my own daughter. So there she is. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2594.3999999999996s)]
*  Wow. So is this, am I getting a feeling for what people with face blindness have? This is, when you [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2601.52s)]
*  look at that, there's clearly, there's a face there. Oh yeah. There are parts, there are eyes, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2609.04s)]
*  there's mouth, but you just can't put it together. Wow. That's stunning. I feel terrible for them now. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2612.48s)]
*  It's really difficult. And largely unknown. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2619.28s)]
*  Prozopagnosia only got its name in the 1940s when a couple of soldiers came back from World War II [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2624.2400000000002s)]
*  with head injuries and couldn't recognize their wife or parents. And it took another 50 years [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2630.88s)]
*  for science to discover that people could be born face blind, like Jacob Hodes. And Joe Livingston, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2636.88s)]
*  a retired teacher, Ben Dabrowski, a software products designer, and Meg Navotny, a doctor. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2643.6s)]
*  If I were your patient, you'd spend a long time with me discussing a problem. I come back the [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2652.24s)]
*  next time. Oh, no, no, no. You walk out to the window at the front and start checking out. And [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2657.7599999999998s)]
*  I walk out of the room and I don't know who you are. Come on. She relies on patient charts, she [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2662.16s)]
*  told us. But there aren't any of those in Ben's office where lunch in the cafeteria can be tricky. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2668.0s)]
*  Sitting down at lunch having a discussion with someone about one of my projects and the guy [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2674.08s)]
*  across the table gets up from lunch and says, God, that's really interesting. When you have [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2677.92s)]
*  that meeting, can you invite me? Thanks. See ya. Who is it? I don't know. Who is it? I have no idea. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2681.36s)]
*  Is it a memory issue? What is it? The memory is never created. The face doesn't get, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2689.28s)]
*  it doesn't get filed. So they have to rely on other strategies to identify people. Hair, body [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2695.92s)]
*  shape, the way people walk, their voice, even style of dress. But Jacob told us that it can all fall [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2702.48s)]
*  apart when someone changes their hair, like a colleague named Sylvia, who he couldn't find one [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2709.76s)]
*  day until she started putting her hair into her usual ponytail. And she like put it into the [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2715.6800000000003s)]
*  ponytail and once it was in place, that was Sylvia. It clicked. And she took her hair back [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2721.52s)]
*  out of that ponytail. And then in there? Yep. She just put it in and then took it out. So she went [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2727.36s)]
*  from Sylvia, not Sylvia, Sylvia, not Sylvia? She disappeared. Come on. Yeah. To him, it was as though [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2732.4s)]
*  her face had changed into someone else's before his eyes. So now I'm confronted with the situation [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2736.96s)]
*  that got weird because I knew this person was Sylvia, but it didn't feel like Sylvia. Faces [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2742.96s)]
*  mean so much to us. Identity, beauty, character, a place to hang all our memories about a person. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2749.84s)]
*  Faces have captivated artists forever. So it may surprise you to learn that the man who painted [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2757.6800000000003s)]
*  these faces, renowned portraitist Chuck Close, is also face blind and severely so. Let's say you [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2763.36s)]
*  went out to have dinner with somebody and then you saw her the next day. I wouldn't remember. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2771.2000000000003s)]
*  And yet he has spent his career, even after a collapsed spinal artery left him mostly paralyzed, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2776.56s)]
*  painting, well... Faces. Yes. Chuck Close has face blindness and he paints faces. Right. The reason I [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2782.88s)]
*  think I was driven to it was to take images of people that matter to me and commit them to memory [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2790.64s)]
*  in the best way I can, which is to slow the whole process down, break it down into lots of little [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2798.4s)]
*  memorable pieces. Which is exactly how he creates these works. He can't make sense of a whole face, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2804.56s)]
*  so he works from a photograph with a grid on it and translates what he sees square by square onto [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2812.24s)]
*  his canvas. Well guess what we've done? I don't know. We've put together a quiz for you. We brought [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2819.52s)]
*  some of our famous faces along to show him. From the chin I think it's Leno. And we're surprised [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2825.2s)]
*  that he did pretty darn well. Well from the lips I think it's Tiger Woods. Yeah, well you're pretty [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2833.36s)]
*  good. But of course not perfect. I don't have a clue. That's Tom Cruise. Right now my guts are tied [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2838.56s)]
*  in knots because this very activity is the thing that makes me most nervous. Oh now I have to figure [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2849.6s)]
*  out who this person is. Because he isn't recognizing these faces the way most of us do. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2858.0s)]
*  Every face is a puzzle he has to solve. What I'm thinking, you don't see too many people with just [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2863.44s)]
*  a mustache anymore. So that means it's probably somebody who's not alive. So if it's an African [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2869.12s)]
*  American of a certain age with a mustache it might be Martin Luther King. You're amazing. You deduce, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2876.56s)]
*  you're like Sherlock Holmes here. Yeah, this is how I get through life. Of course he knew we were [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2885.6000000000004s)]
*  showing him famous faces. With our group we threw in a trick one, a photo of Joe's daughter. Does [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2890.32s)]
*  anybody know who that is? No way. Joe, work on it because it's somebody that Joe knows. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2898.0800000000004s)]
*  Well it may be but nothing's coming. It's someone in your family. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2909.6800000000003s)]
*  But still she didn't get it. It's your daughter. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2915.76s)]
*  Now can you see it? Is it clear now? It is believable now. We were baffled that a condition [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2922.2400000000002s)]
*  so extreme it could keep people from recognizing their own children could have been almost [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2928.1600000000003s)]
*  completely unknown until very recently. World renowned neurologist and writer Dr. Oliver Sachs. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2933.44s)]
*  We asked Dr. Oliver Sachs, the famous chronicler of fascinating and bizarre neurological conditions, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2939.28s)]
*  who wrote about face blindness in his latest book, The Mind's Eye. It is with our faces that we face [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2945.92s)]
*  the world. How do you explain that the medical world did not identify this problem? It is not [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2952.32s)]
*  usually a complaint of people. People do not bring it up. Many people who are colorblind do not know [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2958.7200000000003s)]
*  of it until they take an army medical. One sort of assumes that other people are the way one is. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2965.84s)]
*  It never ever ever in my life occurred to me that people would look at a face and just get it like [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2973.36s)]
*  that. I believe that I was not good with people but I had no idea of the reason. I just thought I was [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2979.28s)]
*  stupid. Joe only learned there was such a thing as face blindness when she stumbled across this [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2985.04s)]
*  article and came in to be tested in Duchenne's lab. A few hours after her second visit, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2991.36s)]
*  in a bizarre coincidence, she and Duchenne ended up attending the same event. I kept placing my face [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=2999.04s)]
*  in a position where she could see it. I realized that one of the group was [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3005.92s)]
*  staring at me in a way that people don't normally. And so finally at one point I said, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3010.1600000000003s)]
*  you know, do you know who I am? And she put it all together. Duchenne had seen face blindness in [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3014.88s)]
*  action. Joe had seen the misconnections of her life. If that had been anybody else, they would [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3021.28s)]
*  have been presumably furious, would not have spoken to me, and would probably never have spoken to me [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3027.52s)]
*  again. But I would never have known they were there. Yeah. It made me realize how many times [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3032.4s)]
*  have I done this? Right. How many friends have you offended? How many people aren't talking to you [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3036.88s)]
*  and you don't know why? And we'll never know. Yeah. People do think you may be snobbing them or [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3043.36s)]
*  stupid or mad or inattentive. That's why it's so important to recognize what one has and to [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3051.28s)]
*  admit it. Which is exactly what Sachs himself has just done, written about the fact that he too [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3058.88s)]
*  is face blind. I have had difficulty recognizing faces for as long as I can remember. My problem [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3066.0s)]
*  extends not only to my nearest and dearest, but also to myself. I've sometimes had the experience [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3072.24s)]
*  of apologizing to someone and realizing it's a mirror. No. I have indeed. No. Because you [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3078.08s)]
*  didn't know it was you. I could see that it was a large clumsy man with a beard. Now I've now found [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3085.52s)]
*  a way of dealing with this. I have one special feature. I have rather large ears. And if the [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3092.0s)]
*  large clumsy man with a beard has extra large ears, it's probably me. I shouldn't be smiling, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3098.96s)]
*  but it's funny. Well, it is fair. I mean, these things are both comic and serious. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3105.76s)]
*  And surprisingly common. Recent studies show as many as one in 50 people may be face blind. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3112.2400000000002s)]
*  And the search is on for clues inside their brains. We'll show you what the research is [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3119.28s)]
*  finding. Plus, would you believe super recognizers? I would say Mike Wallace. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3124.96s)]
*  That is Mike Wallace, who never forget a face. I don't even know how to get rid of people. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3130.48s)]
*  When we come back. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3136.56s)]
*  No one knows what causes lifelong face blindness. It was discovered so recently [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3148.7200000000003s)]
*  scientists are just beginning to unravel its secrets. And some of the clues are coming from [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3154.0s)]
*  people who once had normal face recognition, but lost it after suffering damage to part of the brain. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3159.12s)]
*  And in an interesting twist, those people are also offering insight into the way the [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3166.48s)]
*  rest of us recognize faces. Imagine waking up after a trauma and not being able to recognize [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3171.2s)]
*  the people closest to you. That's what happened to Colleen Castaldo up until the fall of 2009. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3178.32s)]
*  Did you have any trouble recognizing faces at all? No, not at all. Like everybody else. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3186.4s)]
*  Like everybody else. Yeah. That all changed late one night when Colleen had a seizure [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3191.92s)]
*  and was rushed to the hospital. Her doctors found a brain tumor and did surgery to remove it. But as [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3198.1600000000003s)]
*  she recovered, she started noticing that something wasn't right. The nurses, I thought that I was [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3204.8s)]
*  meeting them each for the first time. And then I would, you know, listen to them and think, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3211.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't know, they were acting like they knew me already. Oh, disorienting. She figured it was the [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3217.6000000000004s)]
*  medication until her close friend Doreen came to visit wearing white. And Colleen assumed she was [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3223.1200000000003s)]
*  part of the medical staff. I looked at her smile and I turned back to my husband and started to [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3229.84s)]
*  talk to him and he stood up and said Doreen. And I looked, I thought Doreen. And then it hit me. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3234.4s)]
*  I knew right then and there this is the problem I had been having. Faces. Yeah, faces. Now, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3242.4s)]
*  even faces she knew well before. No. Okay, well that's George Clooney. Oh, wow. No, I wouldn't [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3247.84s)]
*  know that. Are a mystery to her. No, I don't know who that is. Who is it? The president. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3254.8s)]
*  No. So this is the right hemisphere here. Brad Duchenne showed me an MRI scan of Colleen's brain. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3260.72s)]
*  Is that a hole in her brain? That's right. It's in the right temporal lobe. So back here. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3267.68s)]
*  That's right. And the location of that hole where the tumor had been was a clue. If removing that [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3272.3199999999997s)]
*  area caused the loss of face recognition, could that be where all our brains process faces? [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3278.64s)]
*  It turns out that neuroscientists have been trying to figure out how it is that our brains [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3285.52s)]
*  recognize faces for decades. Face recognition is a very difficult problem because all faces [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3290.32s)]
*  are basically the same. MIT neuroscientist Nancy Kanwisher. There are these two roundish things [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3296.56s)]
*  here. There's this thing there. There's this thing there. They're all the same. And so discriminating [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3302.6400000000003s)]
*  one face from another is a very computationally difficult thing because it's those subtle [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3307.28s)]
*  differences in the same basic structure that distinguish one thing from another. And it is [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3311.76s)]
*  exactly those subtle differences face blind people like Jo Livingston miss. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3317.28s)]
*  I could describe anything that I can put into words. Eye color, general overall shape, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3322.88s)]
*  whether your ears stick out. But those things would bring it down perhaps from the population [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3328.88s)]
*  of the world to a few million. So she could say this person has dark eyes, high cheekbones, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3334.0800000000004s)]
*  an oval face, which would allow Jo to distinguish her from this person. But this face [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3340.0s)]
*  and this face impossible. I can say what I can see, but I cannot say the micro measurements [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3346.72s)]
*  that are what tell a normal person that it's you and not somebody of the same specification. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3355.2s)]
*  But how is it that the rest of us can perceive these two people as distinct individuals despite [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3360.64s)]
*  the similarities? An important clue comes from what we can't distinguish. As we saw earlier, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3366.3199999999997s)]
*  faces upside down like these two do Shane showed me, which looked very similar. Maybe you don't [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3372.64s)]
*  even see that there's any difference. Something different in the lower lip. Eyes are a little [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3379.44s)]
*  different. I'm a little different. But then if I show them to you upright. So here's the one that [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3383.12s)]
*  you saw on the left there. It looks perfectly normal. And then here's the one you saw on the [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3388.24s)]
*  right. You saw upside down. The eyes and mouth and the photo on the right had been turned upside down [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3393.92s)]
*  and now the face looks really grotesque. Yeah, but upside down upside down. It's really hard to see [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3400.0s)]
*  that. If you look at a face upside down, you're very bad at recognizing it. If you look at a word [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3406.0s)]
*  or an object or a scene, you can recognize it fine upside down. So what did that tell you? It tells [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3411.28s)]
*  you that there's something very special about face recognition. It works in a very different way [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3416.72s)]
*  from recognition of everything else. And that got can wish you're wondering if there might be a part [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3421.2s)]
*  of the brain responsible just for seeing faces. She started putting people with normal face [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3426.0s)]
*  recognition into MRI scanners and watching what happens in their brains as they looked at different [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3432.16s)]
*  images. Is this what she's saying? This is what she's saying. She's saying faces exactly. Okay. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3438.4s)]
*  And now she's seeing objects because we want to know not just what parts of the brain are active [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3443.04s)]
*  when you see faces, but what parts are more active when you see faces than when you see objects. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3447.04s)]
*  Can wish you're discovered that there was indeed a place in the brain that becomes very active [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3451.76s)]
*  when we look at faces and every subject. Boom, there was this nice big response there. It was [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3456.6400000000003s)]
*  very exciting. And it was right in the same area where Colleen's tumor had been. It's called the [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3462.1600000000003s)]
*  fusiform face area. So could that be what's missing in people with lifelong face blindness? Like Jacob [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3468.0800000000004s)]
*  Pose can wish her put him in the scanner to find out. I really did not expect to see a fusiform [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3475.6s)]
*  face area. So you thought there'd be nothing there, like as if instead of having a bullet go through [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3481.92s)]
*  it, he was just born without it. That's right. That's right. And he looked at the data and his [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3487.2799999999997s)]
*  face area was beautiful. It's textbook. She scanned Joe, Ben and Meg as well. And they had fusiform [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3492.16s)]
*  face areas too. So what does that say to you? It tells us that the problem is not that this thing [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3501.44s)]
*  doesn't exist. There it is. But see, that's the fun of science. It's fun to be told you're just [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3506.88s)]
*  completely and totally wrong because now you have to go back and think anew. And one thing she and [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3511.44s)]
*  other researchers are thinking about is a phenomenon as mystifying as face blindness. Thank you. Have a [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3518.08s)]
*  good day. It's polar opposite super recognizers like Jennifer Jarrett, who say they recognize [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3524.32s)]
*  almost every face they have ever seen. Waiters? Yes. Salespeople? Yes. Oh, like, of course. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3531.04s)]
*  Yes. I'll be walking down the street and I'll see someone and I'll think, oh, retail. And then I'll [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3539.68s)]
*  remember, oh, okay, that person works at a whatever store. And that's where I, they used to work at [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3545.6s)]
*  that store 10 years ago. And then I remember. 10 years ago? Yes. Yeah. So there, it doesn't matter [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3551.2s)]
*  how far back you saw these people. So as long as you look at a person and take notice, they're in [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3557.6s)]
*  there. I don't even know how to get rid of people. Only a handful of super recognizers have been [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3562.96s)]
*  discovered so far. And Duchenne and his colleagues had to come up with a whole new way to test them. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3568.72s)]
*  So here are three faces here, which you're familiar with. I am? It's called the before [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3574.72s)]
*  they were famous test because super recognizers can also recognize faces as they change through [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3580.4s)]
*  time. Does that help at all? You no longer have hair. You sure I know that person? Hair, yeah. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3586.64s)]
*  That's Dick Cheney. Oh my God. That's Dick Cheney? Yeah. He told me the top right was Richard Gere [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3591.6s)]
*  and the bottom Nancy Pelosi. Those three people have changed dramatically. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3600.4s)]
*  He even gave me a hint with this one. He's now an actor. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3605.7599999999998s)]
*  And I'm supposed to know this actor? Clearly, I am not a super recognizer. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3610.96s)]
*  That's George Clooney. Man, and these super recognizers just know this. The supers are [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3615.84s)]
*  really good at recognizing these faces. George Clooney. How could you tell I was George Clooney? [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3621.52s)]
*  It just looked like George Clooney to me. Isn't it? Oh, Prince Charles. Oh, Madonna. Michael Jordan. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3629.36s)]
*  Oh, that's Cato Kaelin. The O.J. Simpson trial. Wow, you are good. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3639.28s)]
*  But we thought we had finally stumped her with this one. She said she only had a guess. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3648.7200000000003s)]
*  If I were to guess, I would say Mike Wallace. That is Mike Wallace. She recognized Mike Wallace [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3653.6000000000004s)]
*  as a six-year-old. I don't even understand how you do that. I can't fathom it. As people age, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3659.52s)]
*  I guess the aging process somehow in my brain just seems very sort of superficial. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3666.64s)]
*  And, you know, as if someone gets a haircut, you can still recognize them. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3671.7599999999998s)]
*  Still the same face to me. It's just the adult version. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3676.16s)]
*  So why is 60 years like a haircut to her while face-blind people can't recognize someone they [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3680.08s)]
*  just saw? A team of scientists at Harvard has begun scanning the brains of super recognizers, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3686.08s)]
*  too, to see if they might yield any clues. The science of facial recognition is in its infancy, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3692.24s)]
*  but new discoveries can't come fast enough for one last person we'd like you to meet, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3699.3599999999997s)]
*  13-year-old Tim McDonough from Boston, who is severely face-blind. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3704.56s)]
*  So can you describe what it feels like when someone comes up, you know you're supposed to [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3709.2799999999997s)]
*  know who they are? I usually just say, you know, hi, nice to see you. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3716.08s)]
*  So you sometimes pretend? Yeah. You fake it? I fake it, yeah. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3719.92s)]
*  You think that's not your mom? Yeah. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3724.7200000000003s)]
*  Okay. So that actually was your mom. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3726.32s)]
*  Tim is working with the Harvard team to see if they can help him learn to recognize his mother's [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3729.6800000000003s)]
*  face. Is this one your mom or not? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3734.8s)]
*  I guess we can start at the top. We could do eyebrows, eyes, nose. You could even use the [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3739.28s)]
*  cheeks there. It's part of a pilot program to see if face blindness might someday be treatable. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3744.16s)]
*  It's a little bit harder. So far, it's not. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3750.96s)]
*  I don't know. I just hope that nobody tries to talk to me because if they do, they... [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3754.8799999999997s)]
*  They want to talk about something you've done with them. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3764.08s)]
*  Yeah. And I don't know who they are. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3766.56s)]
*  So it must be really hard to make friends. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3770.96s)]
*  Takes me a while to make friends. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3774.96s)]
*  It turns out making friends can be tricky at both ends of the face recognition spectrum. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3778.24s)]
*  Super recognizers can seem like stalkers. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3784.16s)]
*  I would see someone, you know, weeks or months later at a party and people would say, oh, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3787.68s)]
*  do you know each other? And I'd say yes. And the other person would say no. And I'd say, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3792.24s)]
*  no, don't you remember the first week of classes? You were walking to English class with someone. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3795.44s)]
*  And people would look at me really strangely and sort of uncomfortably, I think, a lot. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3801.6s)]
*  Jennifer says she's now learned to take cues from others, ironically, just as face blind people do. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3807.2799999999997s)]
*  I'll play this eye contact game where I'll wait. I'm not going to really look at you, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3813.8399999999997s)]
*  but I'll wait to see if you look at me. And then, oh, you look at me. Oh, hi. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3818.24s)]
*  So you're always waiting for a cue from them. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3821.92s)]
*  Yeah. So I'll hang back a little bit, which I don't want to do. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3824.7999999999997s)]
*  In any social situation, are you always a little anxious? [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3828.8s)]
*  I'm more than a little anxious. And I tend to keep my mouth closed before I make some awful [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3832.72s)]
*  blunder. Of course, another tactic or strategy is to smile at everybody. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3840.56s)]
*  That's what Chuck Close told us he does. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3847.28s)]
*  You have to be really charming. If you are going to insult them by not remembering them, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3849.68s)]
*  you just have to be extremely charming so that people don't hold this stuff against you. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3855.6s)]
*  Do you feel now that you're missing out on something? [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3861.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3866.08s)]
*  I notice a loss. I understand someone by an abstraction. I put together a set of [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3867.7599999999998s)]
*  information that to me means mother or means Leslie. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3873.44s)]
*  But it's not a visualization of a face. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3876.96s)]
*  And the question, the thing that I wonder next, you know, is how does it affect even things like [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3880.08s)]
*  love? How does it? [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3885.84s)]
*  When people talk about love, they say, I carry the person with me. I carry their image with me. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3887.92s)]
*  I don't carry their image. Does that mean I experience it differently? [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3894.16s)]
*  And how would I ever know? I don't know. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3898.3199999999997s)]
*  There's a long tale of stuff that happens that you're missing, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3900.72s)]
*  connections you're not making. Still. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3904.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3906.08s)]
*  At least now we understand why. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3908.16s)]
*  And it's therapeutic, but it doesn't fix it. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vrE-2oN68&t=3910.72s)]
