# The Cost of College; The SEED School; Hard Times Generation | 60 Minutes Full Episode
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [July 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js)
*  America, built on the dream of upward mobility, has become a country of deepening divide between [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=0.0s)]
*  rich and poor. The surest way to narrow the wealth gap is to earn a college degree. Now, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=19.68s)]
*  Major universities like Princeton are working to lower the price of admission through a [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=26.16s)]
*  new kind of affirmative action, not based on race, but on low-income status. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=31.44s)]
*  It began with two of America's wealthiest parents, Bill and Melinda Gates. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=37.68s)]
*  They spent more than a billion dollars putting low-income minority students through college. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=42.96s)]
*  Before they tell you what they learned, come meet some of the Gates Millennium Scholars. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=48.28s)]
*  Imagine having a couple of billionaires walk into your life and make the seemingly impossible, possible. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=53.36s)]
*  That's what Bill and Melinda Gates did for these students at the University of Central Florida. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=63.6s)]
*  They're among 20,000 nationwide whose tuition and expenses were paid in full. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=70.68s)]
*  When you were notified that you received the scholarship, was that a letter, an email, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=76.08s)]
*  a phone call, how did that come to you? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=82.08s)]
*  A letter. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=83.96s)]
*  Came as a letter, snail mail? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=84.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=86.52s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=87.52s)]
*  I think it was priority. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=88.52s)]
*  The founder of Microsoft and you got a snail mail acceptance letter. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=89.52s)]
*  When you got that letter, what did you think? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=96.96s)]
*  My mom, she opened my mail and then that's when she broke the news to me that I got this [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  scholarship. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=106.24s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=107.24s)]
*  Nearly 70% of Americans don't have a degree and Kyra Kelly was destined to be one of them. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=115.44s)]
*  She grew up in poverty and even today she wastes nothing because as a child she often [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  had only one meal a day, the free lunch at school. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=128.24s)]
*  I guess I never really dreamed of going to college. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=131.88s)]
*  I just knew I just had to do what I could do to make sure that my family and I could [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=135.44s)]
*  survive. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  When you started the scholarship, what were the big questions that you wanted to answer? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=140.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, one was whether a group of minority students could have very high achievement, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  go to the toughest universities if there was no financial constraint. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=152.84s)]
*  You assume that minority students would do as well in higher education, but what you [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=158.52s)]
*  were looking for was data, hard facts. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=163.4s)]
*  You bet. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=166.20000000000002s)]
*  What's proven itself out now with the scholarship programs, you remove that barrier, they not [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  only do as well as their white peers no matter what zip code they're from, they often actually [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=171.0s)]
*  do better. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=174.44s)]
*  The Gates program looked for good students but not necessarily the top of their class. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=175.6s)]
*  The results have been remarkable. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=180.84s)]
*  Nearly 90% of the Gates scholars have earned a degree and that's life changing because [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=182.88s)]
*  on average, graduates earn a million dollars more in their lifetimes. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=188.56s)]
*  Now it's Kyra Kelly who's doing the teaching after earning a bachelor's and master's degree [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=195.44s)]
*  in education with her Gates scholarship. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=200.48s)]
*  As college becomes more expensive and student debt rises, what's at stake for America? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=203.76s)]
*  Well, it's a huge problem. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=210.68s)]
*  You'll have a two class society where the richer families are able to support the scholarship [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=213.04s)]
*  and you'll have an inner city, mostly minority group that's no longer going to those elite [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=220.16s)]
*  colleges and therefore a lot of the high paying professions are out of their reach. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=226.64s)]
*  So that's really bad at an individual level. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=231.28s)]
*  It's also very bad for the country and our basic founding credo of equal opportunity [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=233.72s)]
*  and our economic strength. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=239.42s)]
*  Bill Gates' warning echoes on the quad of Princeton University. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=241.84s)]
*  We have to be a place where people can come together from lots of different backgrounds. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  President Christopher Eisgruber is leading the nearly 300 year old school through a radical [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=251.32s)]
*  transformation. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=256.8s)]
*  You know, the 20th century activist Upton Sinclair described Princeton as quote, the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=257.8s)]
*  most perfect school for snobbery in America. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  We look back and we see those kinds of quotations about us and we have been working to produce [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=267.72s)]
*  a very different Princeton and this commitment we have to be a real leader on socioeconomic [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=273.78000000000003s)]
*  diversity is a big part of taking the next step for us and making the right kind of difference [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=278.28000000000003s)]
*  in the world. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=282.44000000000005s)]
*  To make his point, Eisgruber showed us yearbooks going back a hundred years. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=283.44000000000005s)]
*  This one's from way back in 1915. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=289.06s)]
*  You can see obviously we're all male and we're all white. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=292.36s)]
*  68 years later, Eisgruber graduated from Princeton. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=295.64000000000004s)]
*  So we've run the clock forward pretty rapidly. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  Now we have women. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=303.16s)]
*  Now we have women. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  And here's an African American student. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=305.40000000000003s)]
*  But only occasionally in 1983. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=307.06s)]
*  Over the next 30 years, minority representation more than doubled to 40 percent. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=310.72s)]
*  But it wasn't enough. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=316.12s)]
*  60 percent of its students were still from the top 10 percent income bracket. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=318.24s)]
*  So Princeton decided to start recruiting students based on socioeconomic status. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=323.56s)]
*  We realized we had to train our readers in the admissions office to look for different [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=329.52s)]
*  things in these applications. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=333.56s)]
*  A kid who's working two jobs to help bring money home and achieving great grades isn't [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=335.36s)]
*  going to have the same kind of extracurriculars as a kid from an elite private school in New [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=340.32s)]
*  York. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=344.56s)]
*  But if two applicants with the same test scores, the same GPA apply, are you going to prefer [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=345.56s)]
*  the first generation low income student? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  We do think those students supply something special on this campus. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=354.0s)]
*  So yes, we're looking for that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=358.0s)]
*  It's a new kind of affirmative action it sounds like. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=359.5s)]
*  Yes, it's a new way of making sure that we have the diversity on our campus to deliver [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=362.28000000000003s)]
*  on the kind of education that we care about and that the world needs. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=367.2s)]
*  Last fall, we met some of Princeton's chosen ones. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=371.2s)]
*  Royene, Mason, Kelton, Jackson and Jalen are first in their family to go to college. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=374.52s)]
*  With Chris and Tyler, they're considered low income. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=381.68s)]
*  At Princeton, that means household income of less than $65,000 a year. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=385.28s)]
*  Be honest, how many of you stepped onto the Princeton campus for the first time and thought [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=390.59999999999997s)]
*  to yourselves, I may not make it? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=394.4s)]
*  Almost immediately, like two seconds in, there it was. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=398.79999999999995s)]
*  What intimidated you? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=402.2s)]
*  The school looked like Hogwarts. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=404.36s)]
*  And I had never been in an institution that looked so expensive and old in my life. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=408.32s)]
*  It just seemed like everyone was so much more capable and it made me feel very small. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=415.2s)]
*  But Jalen figures she's part of a new community, the Flys, that short for first generation [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=421.42s)]
*  low income. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  You're sitting here wearing a Fly is Fly t-shirt. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=428.8s)]
*  What does the shirt mean? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=432.88s)]
*  So Fly is Fly is a campaign educating Princeton students on the resources available to first [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=434.2s)]
*  generation low income students and also working to destigmatize this sort of first generation [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=440.12s)]
*  low income, low socioeconomic status. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=445.56s)]
*  Princeton helps these students succeed with summer programs and seminars on public speaking, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=448.64s)]
*  resume writing and networking. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=454.03999999999996s)]
*  We really want to develop your fluency in what's essentially relationship building, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=456.2s)]
*  right? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=460.2s)]
*  I think a lot of our peers knew from the jump how to navigate college. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=461.2s)]
*  Their parents were like, you need to do this, you need to do this. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=465.92s)]
*  And a lot of us did not have that privilege. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=468.47999999999996s)]
*  And then it felt like they already had a leg up and that we're struggling to catch up. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=471.0s)]
*  I was having this discussion and it's like, oh, we're going to go to New York for the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=475.71999999999997s)]
*  weekend. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=480.24s)]
*  Let's all go to New York. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=481.24s)]
*  It's like, I can't go to New York. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=482.24s)]
*  I got to stay here. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=483.24s)]
*  I have to do my job. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=484.24s)]
*  This is literally my job. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=485.96s)]
*  This year, 28% of Princeton's freshmen are first generation or low income. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=489.16s)]
*  60% of the student body receives financial aid. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=495.72s)]
*  Your student body isn't infinite by accepting some of these first generation low income [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=499.76000000000005s)]
*  students. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=506.16s)]
*  You must be turning down some highly qualified kids, maybe kids who have Princeton in their [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=507.16s)]

*  Now, did you have the confidence before you got here? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=988.5s)]
*  No. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=990.9000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=991.9000000000001s)]

*  The teachers. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=995.1800000000001s)]
*  So on the board, things that impressed you or a question you have or something? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=996.4200000000001s)]
*  Teachers put extra emphasis on the basics. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1001.1s)]
*  Unlike most schools, there are two periods of English and two periods of math per day [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1003.4200000000001s)]
*  in middle school. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1007.98s)]
*  Upper classmen are required to read 45 minutes a day in addition to their homework. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1009.7s)]
*  Classes are small, with 10 to 15 students. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1015.42s)]
*  Clearly, you see that there's a lot of DNA inside of these strawberries. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1017.86s)]
*  Teachers like Joanne Harris know every student personally, their strengths and weaknesses. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1022.9s)]

*  Last week, I sent out an email saying five o'clock until they get it. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1034.7s)]
*  What time did they finally get it? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1038.68s)]
*  I would say my last student was in here probably until about 1045. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1040.58s)]
*  1045? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1044.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1045.98s)]
*  What public school teacher in D.C. works until 1045? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1046.98s)]
*  I have no idea, but I know that when I leave this building, I'm walking past my principal's [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1049.5s)]
*  office who's in her office talking to another student, and there's another teacher still [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1054.8600000000001s)]
*  in their office, so it happens often. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1059.22s)]
*  That kind of dedication and personalized instruction has paid off. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1063.14s)]
*  I'm awesome! [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1067.58s)]
*  Youth graders at SEED score 40% higher in reading and 34% higher in math compared to [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1071.82s)]
*  other minority students in their area. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1077.82s)]
*  But SEED isn't just about academics. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1082.1s)]
*  There's a life skills curriculum taught in the evenings. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1084.46s)]
*  The core values are respect, responsibility, integrity, self-discipline and compassion. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1087.54s)]
*  Students learn social skills like self-discipline and etiquette. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1093.86s)]
*  Can anybody raise their hand and tell me why the skill of public speaking is important? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1097.1s)]
*  Does it help your self-confidence? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1101.78s)]
*  Definitely helps your self-confidence. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1103.98s)]
*  Good one. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1104.98s)]
*  How's class going? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1105.98s)]
*  Administrator Leslie Poole has been at SEED from the start. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1107.98s)]
*  No one has pulled themselves up by their own bootstraps, right? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1111.94s)]
*  Everyone has a story about somebody who helped them. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1116.86s)]
*  And you're letting them hold onto your bootstraps and you're helping to pull them up? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1120.58s)]
*  I'm giving them everything I have. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1124.3799999999999s)]
*  To get the sense, SEED is more of a calling than a job for people like Poole. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1127.02s)]
*  They don't simply have to raise a kid's test scores. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1132.06s)]
*  They have to change their values. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1134.58s)]
*  I think the average middle school student comes into SEED and says, I have to do two [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1136.66s)]
*  hours of homework? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1140.02s)]
*  Really? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1141.58s)]
*  I have to tuck my shirt in all the time? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1142.58s)]
*  Really? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1145.7s)]
*  I have to go to bed at 9 o'clock at night? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1146.7s)]
*  I need to get 8 hours sleep? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1148.58s)]
*  Does it really take all of that just to be successful in school? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1150.42s)]
*  It takes all of that. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1155.22s)]
*  Middle schoolers Francis Blackman and Melvin Brown have learned that. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1157.26s)]
*  They're both in the seventh grade. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1161.02s)]
*  Are you guys happy, glad that you decided to come to SEED? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1162.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1166.1000000000001s)]
*  Do you think you'll stay here until you graduate? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1167.1000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1168.74s)]
*  You're certain of that? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1169.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1170.74s)]
*  Why are you so certain? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1171.74s)]
*  Because I know this is where I want to be and this is where my future is going to start. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1172.74s)]
*  A whole new beginning of life. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1177.18s)]
*  That's what SEED is for you. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1180.3s)]
*  You guys have long school days, right? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1182.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1184.58s)]
*  We get out at 4 o'clock. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1185.58s)]
*  Do you mind being in school that long? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1186.58s)]
*  No. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1188.18s)]
*  No. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1189.18s)]
*  I'm getting more education into my brain. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1190.18s)]
*  More education into your brain? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1192.06s)]
*  When you're in class and you don't understand something, the teachers will take time out [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1193.06s)]
*  of school and during school to try and help you and they show compassion for you. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1197.5s)]
*  Compassion for you. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1202.72s)]
*  Do you guys have any doubt that you're going to be successful? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1203.72s)]
*  No. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1206.26s)]
*  No. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1207.26s)]
*  And what does success look like? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1208.26s)]
*  You always want to believe in yourself. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1209.26s)]
*  You believe in yourself? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1211.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1212.46s)]
*  What I think success is, it's kind of what you're like. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1213.94s)]
*  You're smart, intelligent, you're a nice reporter. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1217.38s)]
*  You dress nice, your shoes are pretty and it is that knowing that you're going to be [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1220.98s)]
*  something in life. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1226.58s)]
*  You're going to make it? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1227.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1229.58s)]
*  And then there are students like 17-year-old sophomore, Roger Ball, who may not make it. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1231.58s)]
*  He came here to escape his old neighborhood where guns and gang violence are common. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1237.22s)]
*  Last year in one turf battle, Roger was shot in the leg. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1242.26s)]
*  Weeks later, he was shot at again. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1245.86s)]
*  But at SEED, he says, he feels safe. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1248.7s)]
*  When I come here, I feel as though I can just be laid back without worrying about nobody [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1251.58s)]
*  having to attack me or say something wrong to me. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1258.06s)]
*  But it's like… [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1261.66s)]
*  Someone could hurt you in that world. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1262.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1264.02s)]
*  Someone could kill you in that world. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1265.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1266.02s)]
*  Roger Ball. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1267.02s)]
*  At SEED, Roger is an athlete. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1268.02s)]
*  He's a B student. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1270.5s)]
*  Roger says he's not a troublemaker. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1272.4599999999998s)]
*  Yet his loyalty to his old neighborhood, his old friends, runs deep. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1274.1799999999998s)]
*  How many close friends do you have back in the neighborhood, number-wise? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1279.3s)]
*  Around like 10. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1282.78s)]
*  How many of those guys are going to college? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1284.1s)]
*  I say, none. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1286.5s)]
*  A lot of people in your life feel like you're on the fence. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1288.6599999999999s)]
*  That you could go this way and be successful, go to college, or you could go this way and [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1292.6599999999999s)]
*  end up someplace else. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1299.4599999999998s)]
*  Do you feel that at all? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1300.8600000000001s)]
*  Well, I always feel as though, like, I'm going to graduate from college. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1301.8600000000001s)]
*  When I come to SEED, I'm in this world where as though I'm comfortable enough to focus [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1305.46s)]
*  in class, do my homework every day, like, and I'm prepared for college. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1310.78s)]
*  But I'm just trying to escape that world, like my outside world, but it's something [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1317.3400000000001s)]
*  that's right there that's just, like, holding me up, holding me back. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1321.38s)]
*  Can't let it go. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1325.18s)]
*  I just can't. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1326.18s)]
*  Like a magnet, it pulls you back. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1328.04s)]
*  Mm-hmm, just like a magnet. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1329.62s)]
*  You think Roger will graduate from here? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1331.86s)]
*  Oh, I do. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1333.42s)]
*  Oh, come on, I do. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1334.42s)]
*  And he will go to college? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1336.78s)]
*  I do. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1337.78s)]
*  What makes you think Roger can be successful? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1339.02s)]
*  This is a kid who's been shot, shot at. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1341.6599999999999s)]
*  I don't think it's in me to not think they can be successful. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1345.54s)]
*  He has some capacity building in front of him, but Roger still has hope and he still [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1350.06s)]
*  has potential. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1355.62s)]
*  And so I just assume not give up on him until, you know, until he makes it and he can believe [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1357.16s)]

*  The longevity of homelessness continues to rise. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1860.76s)]
*  So people are running out of resources. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1865.36s)]
*  The unemployment runs out, their savings run out, the family that lent them money does [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1868.16s)]
*  not have it anymore because they're looking at economic hardship. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1874.64s)]
*  And before you know it, they find themselves living in their car because they just ran [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1877.8799999999999s)]
*  out of all options. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1882.62s)]
*  Earlier this year, when folks heard about the homeless students in central Florida, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1885.32s)]
*  four million dollars in donations poured in. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1889.68s)]
*  Beth Davalos set up food banks in 41 Seminole County schools. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1892.48s)]
*  They gathered up clothing for the kids and shelled out cash for motel rooms. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1897.04s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1901.6000000000001s)]
*  Four million is a lot of money. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1904.04s)]
*  But think of this, of all the families without shelter in America, one-third are in Florida. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1906.22s)]
*  At Castleberry School, we sat down with the Coats family. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1913.96s)]
*  We ended up doing three meals a day, we ended up doing two meals a day, and then there was [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1918.1999999999998s)]
*  this one day where we didn't have any more money and that's how we ended up in the car. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1922.6399999999999s)]
*  Last year, the Coats left Washington, D.C. for a new life in Florida, but the jobs dried [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1930.0s)]
*  up. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1935.3999999999999s)]
*  When the savings went, Victoria and DeAngelo learned how to be homeless. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1936.3999999999999s)]
*  They found out there's a checklist for living in a car. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1941.32s)]
*  You want security, lighting, a place where you might be welcome or at least a place busy [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1944.82s)]
*  enough to hide in. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1950.82s)]
*  Wal-Mart lots can be good, it depends on the manager. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1952.5s)]
*  YMCAs mostly look the other way. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1956.3s)]
*  DeAngelo settled outside a hospital emergency room. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1959.7s)]
*  And we knew that through being there, we could at least brush our teeth in the morning, go [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1964.1s)]
*  to the bathroom if we need to in the middle of the night. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1969.02s)]
*  And I'm sitting on a cooler in between our vehicle and another vehicle just to make sure [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1971.82s)]
*  they're okay. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1977.6599999999999s)]
*  Standing guard all night. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1979.02s)]
*  DeAngelo, what does a man think about sitting on a cooler all night with his family in the [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1981.62s)]
*  car next to him? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1990.34s)]
*  At that moment, I guess I feel less than a dad, I guess I can say, or as a husband because [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=1992.26s)]
*  I'm not able to provide for my family. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2000.8999999999999s)]
*  Going into that car really did something to me. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2005.1s)]
*  I felt helpless, I felt like I couldn't help my children. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2012.2199999999998s)]
*  I am willing to bet that the whole time you were in the car, you didn't cry once, did you? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2017.54s)]
*  Not in front of these guys. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2024.9399999999998s)]
*  When it came time to put the girls in school, the school must have asked you for an address. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2029.02s)]
*  That okay, well, you have these boxes to choose and you had one that said shelter. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2035.46s)]
*  You checked the shelter box? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2040.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2042.1s)]
*  There was no box for car? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2043.34s)]
*  No. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2044.94s)]
*  So you lied to them? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2045.94s)]
*  Basically. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2047.34s)]
*  You do what you have to do? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2048.78s)]
*  There was not an option to take my girls away. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2049.78s)]
*  I wonder if some of these families are hiding from the system, hiding from you. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2054.02s)]
*  Because as one woman put it to us today, she said, I was afraid that if they found out [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2061.2599999999998s)]
*  we were living in the car, the state would take my children away from me. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2065.98s)]
*  Yeah, they're scared. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2070.06s)]
*  They're very scared and the reality is, if the state found them in a car, they could, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2071.62s)]
*  the children could be taken away and put someplace safe for now. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2078.22s)]
*  When we find them, we can put them someplace safe. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2082.06s)]
*  The Coats tried to go someplace safe. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2085.6s)]
*  They called every shelter in the area, but they were all full. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2087.7799999999997s)]
*  After 10 days in the car, the only thing in the bottom of the cooler was an orange. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2091.74s)]
*  So Victoria started calling again. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2097.34s)]
*  We called each and every one of them and then I got to the last one, which was Orlando Rescue [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2100.14s)]
*  Mission and I called and the lady said, we have programs for your entire family. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2105.82s)]
*  You must have thought you weren't hearing right. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2112.5s)]
*  How close did you come to running out of gas on the way to the rescue mission? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2116.3s)]
*  We had like maybe a quarter tank before the E. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2120.2400000000002s)]
*  So really all you had to your names at that point was a quarter of a tank and an orange. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2122.6000000000004s)]
*  That's right. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2127.1800000000003s)]
*  It wasn't long after the family made it into the shelter that D'Angelo found a job. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2129.52s)]
*  He's manhandling garbage cans and proud to have the work. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2135.68s)]
*  The hard work is good for you. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2140.24s)]
*  I'm thankful to have a job. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2143.24s)]
*  With help from his employer, they hope to get Jamie, Jamia and Jayla in a home of their [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2145.3999999999996s)]
*  own by Christmas. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2150.2799999999997s)]
*  What do you know now that you didn't know before you lived in the car? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2152.3199999999997s)]
*  I know to be grateful that you have your family and that my mom is really, really, really [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2157.08s)]
*  protective. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2165.48s)]
*  Protective because there is a ferocity that comes with being a parent on the street. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2167.64s)]
*  Hiding the kids from cops and criminals, watching options grow shorter, the days longer and [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2172.92s)]
*  the nights. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2178.84s)]
*  The nights are just stubborn, sitting on a cooler, waiting for the sun. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2180.2s)]
*  One threat to a family out here is idleness. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2186.4s)]
*  So the folks that we met fill the days with every free and normal thing. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2190.1s)]
*  After school, the Metzger's drive their truck to the library. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2196.52s)]
*  Because they've got the computers that we can use and light and all that. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2200.62s)]
*  I wonder what education means to you too. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2204.94s)]
*  I mean, it is everything to us. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2207.74s)]
*  I plan to be a child defense lawyer. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2210.58s)]
*  If I focus on my studies, I have that opportunity. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2213.04s)]
*  The American dream is durable and there is something about growing up in a truck that [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2217.16s)]
*  makes you believe in it all the more. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2221.7799999999997s)]
*  As we tagged along with the Metzger's, they told us they like the truck better than a [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2224.66s)]
*  motel and they wanted to show us something they've been doing in the evenings. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2228.92s)]
*  They're acting in a community theater, a free and normal thing. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2234.2s)]
*  On stage they had a chance to be somebody else but what struck us most was that they [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2239.6s)]
*  were just as happy in their roles as the Metzger's. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2244.94s)]
*  Canberra USA [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2248.2400000000002s)]
*  Before the truck, I always saw all these homeless people and I would feel so bad for them. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2253.38s)]
*  And then as soon as we started living in the truck ourselves, I've seen even more and I [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2258.18s)]
*  just feel so bad. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2262.7400000000002s)]
*  And even though I'm homeless myself, I want to do as much as I can to help them get back [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2263.7400000000002s)]
*  up on their feet. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2269.52s)]
*  You sound very adult to me. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2270.96s)]
*  She likes to take over. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2272.46s)]
*  And you too a little bit, Austin. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2274.46s)]
*  You had to grow up pretty fast. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2276.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2278.42s)]
*  Every time I see a teenager or any other kid fighting with their parents or arguing with [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2280.86s)]
*  them and not doing what they're told, it really hurts me because they could be in my shoes [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2286.94s)]
*  and of course I don't want them to be in my shoes. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2293.6600000000003s)]
*  But they need to learn to appreciate what they have and who they have in their life [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2295.94s)]
*  because it may be the last day they might have it. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2299.7400000000002s)]
*  At the end of this day, when the play was over and the kids were ready for bed, Tom [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2303.16s)]
*  Metzger judged the lighting behind the theater and decided this was as good a spot as any [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2309.3999999999996s)]
*  in Seminole County to make a home for the night. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE6p0wg-Js&t=2314.7999999999997s)]
