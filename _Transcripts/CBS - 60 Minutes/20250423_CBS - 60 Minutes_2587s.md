# Bird Flu; Demis Hassabis; Flight of the Monarchs | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E)
*  Bird flu has ripped through America's poultry flocks and dairy herds. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=0.0s)]
*  It has also infected humans. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=11.6s)]
*  How big a threat does it pose? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=14.42s)]
*  We asked the doctors and veterinarians on the front lines of the battle against bird [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=16.7s)]
*  flu. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  At present, we're given a stick and they put a blindfold on us and we're sent into a gunfight. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=22.580000000000002s)]
*  And we're losing. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=30.06s)]
*  We are losing. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=32.1s)]
*  It's moving incredibly fast. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=35.54s)]
*  Few understand the speed of artificial intelligence like Dimas Hasabas. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=36.94s)]
*  He won a Nobel Prize and showed us what's coming next. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=42.260000000000005s)]
*  It's reasoning. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=48.3s)]
*  Yeah, definitely, yes. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=49.3s)]
*  AI, he told us, promises a future of wonder. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=51.46s)]
*  The end of disease? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=56.82s)]
*  I think that's within reach. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=58.36s)]
*  Maybe within the next decade or so. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=59.92s)]
*  I don't see why not. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=61.96s)]
*  It's not easy to get to and it's not easy to see at first. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=67.12s)]
*  But then one of the most amazing migration stories in nature reveals itself. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=72.0s)]
*  Towers of monarch butterflies. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=80.08s)]
*  Orange twisting. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=83.0s)]
*  Soaring in one of the most remarkable things we've ever seen. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=85.36s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=94.16s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=95.64s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=96.96s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=98.2s)]

*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=100.88s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=102.2s)]
*  Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=103.64s)]
*  Bird flu has been circling the globe for decades. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=110.08s)]
*  So the discovery in 2024 that the deadly pathogen had jumped from a wild bird to a cow came [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=117.36s)]
*  as a shock to virus watchers. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=124.2s)]
*  Now in just over a year, the virus has ripped through America's dairy herds and poultry [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=126.6s)]
*  flocks. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=132.28s)]
*  It has jumped to other mammals, including humans. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=133.28s)]
*  70 Americans have caught the virus. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=136.2s)]
*  One has died. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=138.92s)]
*  Long feared as a possible pandemic, doctors and veterinarians fighting the virus told [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=140.88s)]
*  us Biden's government was slow to act, while the Trump administration has now laid off [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=146.16s)]
*  more than a hundred key scientists, all as the virus keeps spreading. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=151.88s)]
*  At present, we're given a stick and they put a blindfold on us and we're sent into [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=157.6s)]
*  a gunfight and we're losing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=164.27999999999997s)]
*  Veterinarian Dr. Kay Russo told us we are running out of time to stop bird flu. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=168.08s)]
*  She was called in when the virus H5N1 hit this dairy herd in Colorado last summer. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=177.4s)]
*  It cost the farm about $400,000 to treat its sick cattle. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=184.28s)]
*  Most recovered. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=189.8s)]
*  Some protective gear. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=190.8s)]
*  But as an added precaution, we suited up to ensure we didn't bring anything onto the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=192.52s)]
*  farm ourselves. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  There's no front or back. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  There's no front or back. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  It's high fashion. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  It's real high fashion. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  It's not clear how bird flu is spread from cow to cow, but milking equipment is a prime [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=203.88s)]
*  suspect. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=209.72s)]
*  The virus is thought to linger on the auto milker, waiting for the next cow. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  Workers here in milking parlors have also fallen sick. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=216.72s)]
*  What concerns you the most? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=220.6s)]
*  The pandemic potential for a virus like this one. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=223.28s)]
*  And that is the worst case scenario, right? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=226.92s)]
*  And ultimately one we want to avoid. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=229.72s)]
*  I can't say that that's going to happen, but we don't want to play with fire. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=231.64s)]
*  It started in Texas. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=236.24s)]
*  In early 2024, cows were suffering from a mysterious disease. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=238.24s)]
*  Their fevers spiked, their milk dried up. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=243.4s)]
*  They were coughing, drooling, lethargic. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=246.44s)]
*  Soon there were more sick cattle in neighboring states. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=249.52s)]
*  Kay Russo joined a conference call of worried vets to try to figure it out. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=253.08s)]
*  I started asking questions. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=258.2s)]
*  What are the birds doing on the farm? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=260.08s)]
*  And one of the veterinarians replied, well, they're all dead. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=262.08s)]
*  So they're seeing dead birds on the farms. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=265.56s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=268.68s)]
*  We started to see the cats that were demonstrating, neurologic symptoms. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=269.68s)]
*  And more alarmingly, the workers were complaining of flu-like symptoms. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  Tests confirmed Russo's worst fears. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  H5N1 had jumped to cattle for the first time. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=283.6s)]
*  In past outbreaks, bird flu has often been deadly in people. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=287.52s)]
*  If you look at cases worldwide of H5 influenza, the mortality rate's 50%. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=292.2s)]
*  And so we're all kind of talking to each other, what does this mean? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=298.48s)]
*  And that was a scary space to be in. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=303.32s)]
*  Despite the urgency, Russo and other vets told us the Biden administration was slow to act. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=306.84s)]
*  It was a month before the U.S. Department of Agriculture required cows to be tested [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=313.52s)]
*  before interstate travel and 10 months before a raw milk testing program was launched. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  Today, some states test weekly, some hardly at all. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=324.88s)]
*  Do we have enough information about how this virus is spreading? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=329.76s)]
*  I would say today no. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=334.8s)]
*  And that comes down to boots on the ground where you have a strike force that comes in [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=336.92s)]
*  the middle of an outbreak and just starts collecting data. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=343.56s)]
*  Russo told us at the moment the virus has the upper hand. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=349.52s)]
*  I think it's a numbers game. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=353.96000000000004s)]
*  And the more we let it move unchecked, the more likely we're going to have even a bigger [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=356.28s)]
*  mess on our hands. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=361.91999999999996s)]
*  Poultry farmers have had to kill tens of millions of birds, removing them with trailers and [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=363.71999999999997s)]
*  driving egg prices sky high. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=369.15999999999997s)]
*  Now a new strain of bird flu has been discovered in cattle. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=371.79999999999995s)]
*  It has led to more severe disease in some people. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=376.03999999999996s)]
*  This is a threat that is very significant and very real. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=379.71999999999997s)]
*  And I recognize also this is a moment where it's easy to sound like an alarmist. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=384.08s)]
*  What I'm here to tell you is this is a very serious threat to humanity. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=388.35999999999996s)]
*  And the longer we let this persist, the greater the risks are going to be. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=393.52s)]
*  Dr. Cameron Khan is an infectious disease physician in Toronto. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=398.4s)]
*  His company, Blue Dot, was among the first to flag the virus in China that became the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=403.26s)]
*  COVID pandemic. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=408.28s)]
*  Khan told us bird flu is just as concerning. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=410.47999999999996s)]
*  He showed us how fast the virus has spread among dairy cattle. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=414.08000000000004s)]
*  It seems like almost a wildfire to me. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=418.6s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=421.20000000000005s)]
*  Now add in poultry outbreaks. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=422.72s)]
*  So this is virtually the whole country. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=425.40000000000003s)]
*  Pretty much. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=427.36s)]
*  Next, Dr. Cameron Khan showed us a map of all the confirmed human cases of bird flu in the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=428.36s)]
*  last five years. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=434.52000000000004s)]
*  Most have been in Asia until now. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=436.8s)]
*  What you start to see around 2024 is you start to see a case in Texas and then you [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=440.04s)]
*  start to see this sudden rapid increase in cases across the country. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=444.96000000000004s)]
*  All over the place. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  What's happening here is wild birds have infected cows who have then infected other cows who [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=451.24s)]
*  have then infected humans. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=458.20000000000005s)]
*  And so there's this complex web of all of these different animal species now passing [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=459.76s)]
*  the virus in different directions. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=465.08000000000004s)]
*  Is this one of those things you have never seen before? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=466.84000000000003s)]
*  The world has never seen this kind of situation. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=469.36s)]
*  And it's showing us that the virus is capable of adaptation. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=473.16s)]
*  If you allow it, it will just get better and better at infecting other mammals, including [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=476.68s)]
*  potentially humans. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=482.44s)]
*  Most of the confirmed cases in the U.S. have been farm workers. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=484.68s)]
*  Most had mild symptoms. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=488.68s)]
*  The one person who died had underlying health conditions. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=490.44s)]
*  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the virus still poses a low risk to the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=494.52s)]
*  general public. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=500.12s)]
*  But Khan told us many cases are going undetected. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=501.5s)]
*  Why do you say that? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=504.68s)]
*  So in a recent study of dairy workers, their blood was tested for antibodies to H5N1, not [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=507.28s)]
*  looking for the virus, but looking for the immune system's memory of this virus. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=514.88s)]
*  And it turns out that 7% of them, one out of roughly every 15 workers, actually had [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=519.94s)]
*  antibodies to H5N1. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=525.98s)]
*  People are not generally getting very sick from this. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=528.3800000000001s)]
*  So what's the reason for all the alarm? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=532.6600000000001s)]
*  Influenza is a particularly formidable virus. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=535.5s)]
*  It is constantly changing. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=538.74s)]
*  And the more that we allow it to evolve and adapt by infecting people, I mean, this is [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=541.74s)]
*  kind of Darwinian evolution here, right? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=546.22s)]
*  It can change in ways that actually make it even more deadly or more easily transmissible [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=549.26s)]
*  or even resist against some of the antiviral medications that we have. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=553.74s)]
*  Khan told us every new infection increases the odds bird flu could lead to severe disease, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=559.06s)]
*  as we saw during COVID. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=565.22s)]
*  In North America, six people now have ended up in the hospital with bird flu. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=567.22s)]
*  More worrying, five people had no known exposure to sick animals. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=572.66s)]
*  One girl in Mexico died two weeks ago. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=577.66s)]
*  We are really at risk of this virus evolving into one that has pandemic potential. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=580.9s)]
*  And the reality is none of us know whether this is next week or next year or never. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=588.14s)]
*  I don't think it's never. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=592.78s)]
*  But it may be here far sooner than any of us would like. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=595.6999999999999s)]
*  Many scientists told us vaccines could be our best defense. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=599.66s)]
*  There is a vaccine for bird flu, but it has not been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=603.78s)]
*  Moderna has a new one, but the Trump administration has paused its final funding. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=609.74s)]
*  There are vaccines for poultry, too. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=615.02s)]
*  But they haven't been used because many of America's trading partners will not import [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=617.5799999999999s)]
*  vaccinated birds. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=622.5s)]
*  A glimmer of hope? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=624.26s)]
*  The USDA's milk testing program. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=625.74s)]
*  This is repurposed from COVID testing from three or four years ago. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=628.78s)]
*  Dr. Keith Paulson is director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Lab, part of the USDA's [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=633.6999999999999s)]
*  plan to test raw milk for H5N1. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=639.98s)]
*  Pasteurization kills the virus, but raw milk can be loaded with it. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=643.9399999999999s)]
*  Is this where you would identify the virus? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=649.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and it can detect even just one positive cow in a group of a thousand. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=651.78s)]
*  Forty-five states are now doing some form of testing. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=658.54s)]
*  Paulson told us it's helped to slow the spread of the virus in some states. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=662.38s)]
*  When you see the outbreak curve level off or start to decline, do you go like, whew, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=667.02s)]
*  we dodged one? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=673.7800000000001s)]
*  I don't think we go whew until we're deactivated, our lab. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=674.7800000000001s)]
*  We're still in outbreak response mode, and while we may have fewer detections, we know [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=679.62s)]
*  that there are still viruses circulating based on all the data from the virologists that [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=684.7s)]
*  and we want to make sure that we catch it fast. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=690.82s)]
*  The CDC is trying to ramp up its testing, but there's another problem. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=693.82s)]
*  Almost half of farm workers are undocumented and may be reluctant to be tested. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=699.22s)]
*  If we're not testing people, if we're not looking for people who might get it, if we're [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=705.38s)]
*  not looking for evidence of an early cluster of human-to-human transmission, then we're [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=710.1s)]
*  going to miss it. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=715.98s)]
*  Dr. Angela Rasmussen is an American virologist working in Canada. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=717.82s)]
*  Rasmussen told us it's not just the number of human cases that is alarming, but that [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=722.5s)]
*  the virus is jumping to more mammals. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=727.62s)]
*  Every new spillover gives the virus another chance to evolve and potentially spread person-to-person. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=730.6600000000001s)]
*  So we are now seeing the viruses spread from birds to cattle and now to foxes, goats, pigs, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=738.58s)]
*  rats, cats, raccoons. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=747.66s)]
*  The fact that this virus can infect so many different types of mammals is a huge concern [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=750.42s)]
*  in terms of its ability to infect people. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=756.26s)]
*  One of your colleagues told us that if this should spiral into a pandemic, this flu could [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=759.36s)]
*  make COVID look like a walk in the park. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=767.06s)]
*  I agree. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=770.06s)]
*  You're scaring me. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=771.06s)]
*  I'm scared about it myself. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=773.3399999999999s)]
*  I don't sleep very much these days, Bill. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=775.0200000000001s)]
*  Rasmussen was among the scientists given expert briefings by the Biden administration in 2024. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=778.3000000000001s)]
*  She told us Biden's team miscalculated the threat at first. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=785.2600000000001s)]
*  It was some gambling and some wishful thinking, thinking this isn't actually going to be that [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=789.82s)]
*  big of a deal. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=794.62s)]
*  And it turns out it was a very big deal. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=796.0600000000001s)]
*  Has the Trump administration gotten its arms around this problem? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=798.0600000000001s)]
*  No, I would say is the short answer. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=802.38s)]
*  But the longer answer is that I don't actually entirely know what is going on. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=805.26s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=812.2199999999999s)]
*  Many of the people who are working on this, at least at CDC, have been fired from the [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=813.42s)]
*  federal government. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=818.78s)]
*  So the influenza division at CDC has been decimated. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=820.3s)]
*  And in fact, there is a communications ban that has been put on these federal workers. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=823.0999999999999s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=828.66s)]
*  I think it's insane actually that I have to have conversations on encrypted messaging [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=830.22s)]
*  apps with my colleagues who I would normally just send emails to. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=834.7s)]
*  Hundreds of federal scientists and health workers who track bird flu have been laid [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=838.7s)]
*  off. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=843.5s)]
*  Some may be rehired. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=844.5400000000001s)]
*  The CDC declined to answer our questions, saying it continues to respond to the H5N1 [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=846.38s)]
*  bird flu outbreak. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=852.94s)]
*  Colorado vet Kay Russo and others told us they feel stymied. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=854.62s)]
*  The current distrust of science and vaccines is hurting their fight to try to prevent the [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=859.58s)]
*  next pandemic. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=865.1800000000001s)]
*  I would scorch the earth if this ends up in children deaths. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=866.7s)]
*  And so as a mother, as a veterinarian, as a scientist, I'm just asking you trust us [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=872.7800000000001s)]
*  because I will do everything in my power and there's plenty folks behind me that will [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=879.9000000000001s)]
*  do the same to keep this from getting to that point. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=885.1s)]
*  When Demis Hassabis won the Nobel Prize last year, he celebrated by playing poker with [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=889.58s)]
*  a world champion of chess. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=903.26s)]
*  Hassabis loves a game, which is how he became a pioneer of artificial intelligence. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=906.0600000000001s)]

*  DeepMind. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=919.7s)]
*  We met two years ago when chatbots announced a new age. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=921.14s)]
*  Now Hassabis and others are chasing what's called artificial general intelligence, a [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=925.72s)]
*  silicon intellect as versatile as a human but with superhuman speed and knowledge. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=931.82s)]

*  What's always guided me and the passion I've always had is understanding the world around [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=950.4s)]
*  us. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=955.28s)]
*  I've always been, since I was a kid, fascinated by the biggest questions, you know, the meaning [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=956.28s)]
*  of life, the nature of consciousness, the nature of reality itself. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=961.72s)]
*  I've loved reading about all the great scientists who worked on these problems and the philosophers [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=966.56s)]
*  and I wanted to see if we could advance human knowledge. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=971.5999999999999s)]
*  And for me, my expression of doing that was to build what I think is the ultimate tool [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=975.7199999999999s)]
*  for advancing human knowledge, which is AI. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=980.1199999999999s)]
*  We sat down in this room two years ago and I wonder if AI is moving faster today than [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=983.14s)]
*  you imagined. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=990.9599999999999s)]
*  It's moving incredibly fast. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=992.8399999999999s)]
*  I think we are on some kind of exponential curve of improvement. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=994.88s)]
*  Of course, the success of the field in the last few years has attracted even more attention, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=998.64s)]
*  more resources, more talent. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1003.6800000000001s)]
*  So that's adding to this exponential progress. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1005.44s)]
*  Exponential curve, in other words, straight up. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1010.1s)]

*  That painting is Automat by Edward Hopper. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1067.5s)]
*  The person in the painting, what emotion is she exhibiting? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1070.4s)]
*  The subject in the painting appears pensive and contemplative, her expression suggesting [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1076.02s)]
*  a sense of solitude. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1080.3799999999999s)]
*  Can you create a story around this picture? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1082.46s)]
*  It's a chilly evening in the city, a Tuesday perhaps. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1086.9s)]
*  The woman, perhaps named Eleanor, sits alone in the diner. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1089.94s)]
*  She is feeling melancholy due to the uncertainty of her future and the weight of unfulfilled [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1092.78s)]
*  dreams. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1097.1s)]
*  The scene freezes in time, only the flow of ideas moving onward. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1098.1s)]
*  That line, only the flow of ideas moving onward? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1102.82s)]
*  I wish I'd written that. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1107.22s)]
*  And did we hear a limit to Astra's patience? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1109.54s)]
*  What was that fictional conversation about? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1113.9399999999998s)]
*  Ah, in the story I imagined, Eleanor and her friend talked about their shared dreams and [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1116.4199999999998s)]
*  the challenges of pursuing them. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1121.7s)]
*  Something about the way you said ah made me wonder if you were getting bored. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1124.0s)]
*  I apologize if my tone came across that way. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1128.1s)]
*  My aim is always to engage thoughtfully. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1130.9s)]
*  And she said well I'm sorry if you don't like my tone. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1134.26s)]
*  Wow, well you see. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1137.5400000000002s)]
*  What's happening there? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1139.38s)]
*  Well that's interesting. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1140.38s)]
*  That's again a challenge with these systems as they act in the moment with the context [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1141.38s)]
*  that's around them and that may have never been tested before. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1145.9s)]
*  He's often surprised because AI programs are sent out on the internet to learn for themselves. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1149.02s)]
*  They can return later with unexpected skills. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1156.66s)]
*  So we have theories about what kinds of capabilities these systems will have. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1160.6s)]
*  That's obviously what we try to build into the architectures. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1165.08s)]
*  But at the end of the day, how it learns, what it picks up from the data is part of [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1167.76s)]
*  the training of these systems. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1172.56s)]
*  We don't program that in. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1174.1599999999999s)]
*  It learns like a human being would learn. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1175.62s)]
*  So new capabilities or properties can emerge from that training situation. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1179.04s)]
*  You understand how that would worry people. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1184.4399999999998s)]
*  Of course. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1186.7199999999998s)]
*  The duality of these types of systems. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1187.92s)]
*  They're able to do incredible things, go beyond the things that we're able to design ourselves [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1190.1200000000001s)]
*  or understand ourselves. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1196.72s)]
*  But of course the challenge is making sure that the knowledge databases they create, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1198.68s)]
*  we understand what's in them. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1204.28s)]
*  Now DeepMind is training its AI model called Gemini to not just reveal the world but to [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1206.2s)]
*  act in it, like booking tickets and shopping online. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1213.32s)]
*  It's a step toward AGI, artificial general intelligence, with the versatility of a human [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1219.36s)]
*  mind. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1226.72s)]
*  On track for AGI? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1228.2s)]
*  In the next five to ten years, I think. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1229.2s)]
*  And in 2030 you will have what? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1232.2s)]
*  Well, we'll have a system that really understands everything around you in very nuanced and [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1234.12s)]
*  deep ways and kind of embedded in your everyday life. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1241.32s)]
*  Embedded like Astra in eyeglasses. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1246.0s)]
*  What can you tell me about this building I'm looking at? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1249.08s)]
*  This is the Cole Drops Yard, a shopping and dining district. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1252.08s)]
*  She sees what I see. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1255.3999999999999s)]
*  There's a speaker in the earpiece only I can hear. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1257.1599999999999s)]
*  What was it originally before it became shops? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1260.46s)]
*  The Cole Drops Yard was originally a set of Victorian coal warehouses used to receive [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1263.6399999999999s)]
*  and distribute coal across London. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1268.04s)]
*  Was coal ever a problem for the environment in London? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1270.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1274.1s)]
*  Coal was a significant source of air pollution in London, particularly during the Industrial [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1275.1s)]
*  Revolution. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1279.4599999999998s)]
*  It occurred to us that the only thing we contributed to this relationship were legs, which will [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1280.4599999999998s)]
*  also soon be engineered. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1286.8999999999999s)]
*  I also think another big area will be robotics. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1289.62s)]
*  I think it will have a breakthrough moment in the next couple of years where we'll have [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1292.1799999999998s)]
*  maybe humanoid robots or other types of robots that can start really doing useful things. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1297.1s)]
*  For example, researchers Alex Lee and Giulia Vasani showed us a robot that understands [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1303.58s)]
*  what it sees and reasons its way through vague instructions. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1311.3799999999999s)]
*  Put the blocks whose color is the combination of yellow and blue into the matching color [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1317.78s)]
*  ball. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1324.2199999999998s)]
*  The combination of yellow and blue is green and it figured that out. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1325.22s)]
*  It's reasoning. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1333.22s)]
*  Yep, definitely, yes. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1334.22s)]
*  The toys of Demis Hisabis' childhood weren't blocks but chess pieces. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1335.98s)]
*  At 12 he was the number two champion in the world for his age. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1342.54s)]
*  This passion led to computer chess, video games and finally, thinking machines. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1347.44s)]
*  He was born to a Greek Cypriot father and Singaporean mother. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1353.94s)]
*  Cambridge, MIT, Harvard. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1358.38s)]
*  He's a computer scientist with a PhD in neuroscience. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1361.1000000000001s)]
*  Because he reasoned, he had to understand the human brain first. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1366.5s)]
*  Are you working on a system today that would be self-aware? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1371.24s)]
*  I don't think any of today's systems to me feel self-aware or conscious in any way. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1375.9s)]
*  Obviously everyone needs to make their own decisions by interacting with these chatbots. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1381.98s)]
*  I think theoretically it's possible. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1386.46s)]
*  But is self-awareness a goal of yours? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1388.3799999999999s)]
*  Not explicitly, but it may happen implicitly. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1391.4199999999998s)]
*  These systems might acquire some feeling of self-awareness, that is possible. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1393.82s)]
*  I think it's important for these systems to understand you, self and other and that's [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1398.4199999999998s)]
*  probably the beginning of something like self-awareness. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1403.8999999999999s)]
*  But he says if a machine becomes self-aware, we may not recognize it. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1408.08s)]
*  I think there's two reasons we regard each other as conscious. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1414.12s)]
*  One is that you're exhibiting the behavior of a conscious being, very similar to my behavior. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1417.6399999999999s)]
*  But the second thing is you're running on the same substrate. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1423.08s)]
*  We're made of the same carbon matter with our squishy brains. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1425.84s)]
*  Now obviously with machines, they're running on silicon. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1429.6s)]
*  So even if they exhibit the same behaviors and even if they say the same things, it doesn't [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1432.32s)]
*  necessarily mean that this sensation of consciousness that we have is the same thing they will have. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1437.32s)]
*  Has an AI engine ever asked a question that was unanticipated? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1444.0s)]
*  Not so far that I've experienced. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1449.04s)]
*  And I think that's getting at the idea of what's still missing from these systems. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1451.12s)]
*  They still can't really yet go beyond asking a new novel question or a new novel conjecture [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1455.3999999999999s)]
*  or coming up with a new hypothesis that has not been thought of before. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1462.1599999999999s)]
*  They don't have curiosity. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1467.24s)]
*  No, they don't have curiosity and they're probably lacking a little bit in what we would call imagination and intuition. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1468.52s)]
*  But they will have greater imagination, he says, and soon. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1474.6s)]
*  I think actually in the next maybe five to ten years, I think we'll have systems that [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1478.88s)]
*  are capable of not only solving a important problem or conjecture in science, but coming [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1483.1200000000001s)]
*  up with it in the first place. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1489.56s)]
*  Solving an important problem won Hasabas a Nobel Prize last year. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1492.16s)]
*  He and colleague John Jumper created an AI model that deciphered the structure of proteins. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1497.5800000000002s)]
*  Proteins are the basic building blocks of life. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1505.6000000000001s)]
*  So everything in biology, everything in your body depends on proteins. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1508.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, your neurons firing, your muscle fibers twitching. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1511.3200000000002s)]
*  It's all mediated by proteins. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1514.2s)]
*  But 3D protein structures like this are so complex, less than 1% were known. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1516.8s)]
*  Mapping each one used to take years. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1523.6399999999999s)]
*  DeepMind's AI model did 200 million in one year. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1527.44s)]
*  Now Hasabas has AI blazing through solutions to drug development. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1532.68s)]
*  So on average, it takes, you know, ten years and billions of dollars to design just one [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1539.12s)]
*  drug. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1543.6399999999999s)]
*  Maybe we reduce that down from years to maybe months or maybe even weeks, which sounds incredible [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1544.64s)]
*  today, but that's also what people used to think about protein structures. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1549.16s)]
*  It would revolutionize human health. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1552.5600000000002s)]
*  And I think one day maybe we can cure all disease with the help of AI. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1554.3600000000001s)]
*  The end of disease? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1559.0800000000002s)]
*  I think that's within reach. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1560.94s)]
*  Maybe within the next decade or so. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1562.72s)]
*  I don't see why not. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1564.6000000000001s)]
*  Demis Hasabas told us AI could lead to what he calls radical abundance, the elimination [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1566.2s)]
*  of scarcity. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1573.28s)]
*  But he also worries about risk. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1574.88s)]
*  There's two worries that I worry about. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1577.4s)]
*  One is that bad actors, human users of these systems, repurpose these systems for harmful [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1579.0s)]
*  ends. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1586.24s)]
*  Then the second thing is the AI systems themselves, as they become more autonomous and more powerful, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1587.24s)]
*  can we make sure that we can keep control of the systems, that they're aligned with [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1591.3600000000001s)]
*  our values, they're doing what we want that benefits society, and they stay on guardrails. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1594.76s)]
*  These are safety limits built into the system. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1601.4s)]
*  And I wonder if the race for AI dominance is a race to the bottom for safety. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1604.48s)]
*  So that's one of my big worries, actually, is that, of course, all of this energy and [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1610.52s)]
*  racing and resources is great for progress, but it might incentivize certain actors in [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1615.68s)]
*  that to cut corners. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1621.44s)]
*  And one of the corners that can be shortcut would be safety and responsibility. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1624.0400000000002s)]
*  So the question is, how can we coordinate more as leading players, but also nation-states [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1628.16s)]
*  even? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1635.16s)]
*  I think this is an international thing. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1636.16s)]
*  AI is going to affect every country, everybody in the world. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1637.4s)]
*  So I think it's really important that the world and the international community has [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1641.0800000000002s)]
*  a say in this. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1644.94s)]
*  Can you teach an AI agent morality? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1646.28s)]
*  I think you can. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1650.0s)]
*  They learn by demonstration. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1651.2s)]
*  They learn by teaching. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1653.0s)]
*  And I think that's one of the things we have to do with these systems is to give them a [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1655.4s)]
*  value system and a guidance and some guardrails around that, much in the way that you would [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1659.6000000000001s)]
*  teach a child. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1664.44s)]
*  Google DeepMind is in a race with dozens of others striving for artificial general intelligence, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1666.44s)]
*  so human that you can't tell the difference, which made us think about Demis Hasaba's [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1673.48s)]
*  signing the Nobel Book of Laureates. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1680.3600000000001s)]
*  When does a machine sign for the first time? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1683.0s)]
*  And after that, will humans ever sign it again? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1686.8000000000002s)]
*  I think in the next steps, it's going to be these amazing tools that enhance our almost [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1691.0800000000002s)]
*  every endeavor we do as humans. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1695.72s)]
*  And then beyond that, when AGI arrives, I think it's going to change pretty much everything [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1699.38s)]
*  about the way we do things. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1704.78s)]
*  And it's almost, you know, I think we need new great philosophers to come about, hopefully [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1706.96s)]
*  in the next five, ten years, to understand the implications of this. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1711.08s)]
*  Creating 3D worlds from images. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1719.24s)]

*  At 60minutesovertime.com. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1725.24s)]
*  One of the most remarkable and mysterious migrations in the natural world is happening [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1727.24s)]
*  right now from Mexico to the United States. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1739.6s)]
*  Tens of millions of monarch butterflies are on an epic aerial journey home. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1743.1200000000001s)]
*  They've spent the winter hanging out in trees in a forest on a remote mountain in Mexico, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1747.32s)]
*  resting up after flying all the way from Canada in the northern U.S. where they were [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1752.68s)]
*  born. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1756.92s)]
*  It's believed monarchs have been making this journey for thousands of years, but there's [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1757.92s)]
*  a lot fewer of them than there used to be. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1762.52s)]
*  The population of Mexico has declined 70% in the last 30 years. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1765.0s)]
*  We arrived there in February, just in time to watch the monarchs emerge from their slumber [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1770.1200000000001s)]
*  and begin to take flight. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1775.04s)]
*  The monarchs come to these mountains in Michoacan in central Mexico, starting in late October. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1779.92s)]
*  Do you still get excited going up to see them? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1787.1200000000001s)]
*  Every time, there's no substitute. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1790.04s)]
*  One of our guides, Jorge Ricards, is the director of the nonprofit World Wildlife Fund in Mexico. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1792.8000000000002s)]
*  We're going to leave the horses, walk a little bit, very, very carefully and very quietly [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1800.52s)]
*  so we won't disturb the butterflies. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1806.76s)]
*  The monarchs roost in patches of fir and pine trees 11,000 feet up. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1810.56s)]
*  There are some 66 million of them here, but it's hard to see them at first. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1817.4s)]
*  There are what appear to be clumps of dead leaves hanging from sagging branches. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1822.76s)]
*  But those are butterflies, tens of thousands of them, clustered together in trees all around. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1828.32s)]
*  There are so many of them on the branches of the trees, the branches are all pointing toward the ground. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1835.92s)]
*  Imagine the likeness of a butterfly, and there are so many of them here that they actually bend the trees. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1840.04s)]
*  And they like the firs because they have so many little leaves or spicules, so there's lots of surface to cling onto. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1847.72s)]
*  The monarchs earn a kind of hibernation. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1854.8000000000002s)]
*  On the way here, they've faddened up on nectar, which helps them survive and rest through the long winter months. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1857.3200000000002s)]
*  The climate on this mountain is ideal. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1864.6399999999999s)]
*  The canopy of trees protects the butterflies from storms, and though the air is cool, it's relatively humid, so they stay hydrated. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1867.52s)]
*  The clusters are so drab when you're looking at them because they have their wings closed. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1875.8s)]
*  In many butterflies, the underside is drab or less lightly colored, and that happens in nature a lot. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1880.24s)]
*  So it's not very inviting. It wouldn't be inviting to a predator. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1886.4399999999998s)]
*  Why are we whispering? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1890.56s)]
*  They are very sensitive to sound. They are also sensitive to CO2. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1891.96s)]
*  So the less we talk, the better. They relate that with a predator. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1897.32s)]
*  As other mammals. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1902.72s)]
*  So they can sense like a mouse breathing or a bird breathing. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1904.16s)]
*  That is right. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1908.92s)]
*  On the forest floor all around us, monarchs litter the ground. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1911.2s)]
*  But most are not dead. They've just fallen from trees during the night, and their muscles are too cold for them to fly. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1915.24s)]
*  Cup them in your hands. You can revive them with your breath. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1924.84s)]
*  They need a certain temperature to get their wing muscles back. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1929.44s)]
*  They are very, very vulnerable when they're on the floor, and the birds know that, and the mice know that. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1933.84s)]
*  That's almost ready. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1939.96s)]
*  There you go. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1941.44s)]
*  Come on, little buddy. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1943.44s)]
*  Maybe a little more. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1945.24s)]
*  There you go. He likes you. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1950.24s)]
*  When the sun begins to hit the trees, flashes of orange appear. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1955.24s)]
*  The monarchs are warming and slowly opening their wings. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1959.24s)]
*  Really as the day warms up, we're going to see more activity. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1964.24s)]
*  Court Whalen has been bringing tour groups here and photographing monarchs for more than 20 years. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1968.04s)]
*  He shows us a spot where some butterflies have taken flight. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1977.04s)]
*  Then, after a few minutes, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1980.04s)]
*  suddenly the air is filled with them. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1985.04s)]
*  This is extraordinary. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1990.04s)]
*  This is it. This is what it's all about. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1992.04s)]
*  Nature knows when to put on a show, and how to put on a show. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1994.84s)]
*  Why have they all now just suddenly taken off? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=1998.84s)]
*  It's a warm day. We're getting a lot of sunlight. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2000.84s)]
*  We're just ramping up, ramping up. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2003.84s)]
*  What's insane is it's not just over here. It's over there. It's over there. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2005.84s)]
*  It's extraordinary. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2012.84s)]
*  It's all the heat. It's all the sun. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2013.84s)]
*  You can actually hear the sound of butterfly wings. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2015.84s)]
*  Let's just be quiet for a second. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2019.84s)]
*  Look at that. Look at that up there. Oh my gosh. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2024.04s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2028.04s)]
*  This is about as good as it possibly gets. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2029.04s)]
*  It's like a snow globe of monarchs. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2035.04s)]
*  You got a butterfly on you. Oh, there we go. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2037.04s)]
*  It's a butterfly. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2042.04s)]
*  It's a butterfly. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2043.04s)]
*  It's a butterfly. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2045.04s)]
*  It's a butterfly. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2047.04s)]
*  It's a butterfly. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2049.04s)]
*  Oh, there we go. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2051.04s)]
*  It's still something of a mystery how these monarchs manage to get here. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2054.04s)]
*  Most only live about a month. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2058.04s)]
*  They spend their short lives eating and mating, and females lay eggs. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2060.04s)]
*  But in late summer and early fall, what's called a super generation of monarchs appear. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2065.04s)]
*  Hatched as caterpillars, they transform into chrysalises. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2070.04s)]
*  And then, after a week or two, emerge as butterflies. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2074.04s)]
*  And that's when they do something extraordinary. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2077.04s)]
*  With winter coming, they sense the shorter days and changing temperatures [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2081.04s)]
*  and suppress a key reproductive hormone, a process called diapause, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2085.04s)]
*  which helps them conserve their energy and live up to nine months, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2090.04s)]
*  nine times longer than most monarchs. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2095.04s)]
*  It's crazy that there's this super generation of monarchs that can make it all the way, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2098.04s)]
*  and then the rest would die off after a month. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2103.04s)]
*  What is amazing is how they detonate this process of not developing sexual organs, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2105.04s)]
*  but using that energy for the flight. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2112.04s)]
*  Monarchs born west of the Rockies stay there and migrate shorter distances. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2116.04s)]
*  It's this super generation, born in Canada and east of the Rockies in the northern United States, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2121.04s)]
*  that flies to Mexico. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2127.04s)]
*  Hundreds of millions of them join up on a journey of some 3,000 miles, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2129.04s)]
*  which can take them three months or longer. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2134.04s)]
*  To help them find their way, monarchs have circadian clocks in their antennae [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2137.04s)]
*  and navigate using internal compasses that respond to the position of the sun [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2142.04s)]
*  and the Earth's magnetic field. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2147.04s)]
*  Why are they coming here? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2149.04s)]
*  Well, that's a big mystery. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2151.04s)]
*  Maybe it's a prehistoric route. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2153.04s)]
*  Maybe it was determined by geographical conditions in terms of topography. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2158.04s)]
*  Maybe it had to do with climate. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2164.04s)]
*  You're talking about multiple generations who all have this exact same instinct [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2166.04s)]
*  and know where to go and all go to the exact same spot. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2172.04s)]
*  That's one of the most magical things that can happen in the natural world. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2175.04s)]
*  How do they know? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2180.04s)]
*  The monarchs were discovered by researchers on this mountain range in 1975, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2182.04s)]
*  and the Mexican government declared the area a Federal Reserve 11 years later. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2187.04s)]
*  But for decades, illegal logging threatened the butterflies' roosting spots, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2192.04s)]
*  which once covered as much as 45 acres. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2197.04s)]
*  It's now down to four and a half. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2200.04s)]
*  World Wildlife Fund has spent years trying to combat the destruction, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2203.04s)]
*  assessing the health of the forest, measuring the size of butterfly colonies, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2207.04s)]
*  and planting trees. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2212.04s)]
*  They've also worked with local communities and indigenous groups [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2214.04s)]
*  to protect the land and help them profit from tourism. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2217.04s)]
*  The good news is the forest is rebounding. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2221.04s)]
*  Because it's just so unusual to see this. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2225.04s)]
*  It's like almost an optical illusion because everything's beating at this weird frequency. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2228.04s)]
*  It's like the whole world is kind of pulsing. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2232.04s)]
*  So what are they doing here? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2236.04s)]
*  Yeah, so this is kind of a classic mud puddling of monarch butterflies. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2239.04s)]
*  Mud puddling? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2244.04s)]
*  Yeah, mud puddling. It's a real scientific term. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2245.04s)]
*  So they're mainly after hydration, but butterflies are known to need some trace elements like salts and whatnot. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2248.04s)]
*  And it doesn't look like much, but just this little bit of water in this mud puddle [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2255.04s)]
*  is enough for them to get some water, and then what will happen is they'll return to the roost before evening. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2259.04s)]
*  After about four months in Mexico, this super generation of monarchs are near the end of their long life cycle. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2265.04s)]
*  They're finally ready to mate and migrate north to lay their eggs. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2271.04s)]
*  They'll die before they can make it back to where they were born, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2276.04s)]
*  and their offspring might not live long enough to get there either. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2279.04s)]
*  But future generations will, and there's an army of people trying to help them. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2283.04s)]
*  In Kansas, volunteers come out to catch and tag monarchs so scientists can track their migration. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2288.04s)]
*  Good job, man. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2296.04s)]
*  They're recruited by Chip Taylor, an 87-year-old ecologist who's been fascinated by monarchs since he was a child. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2298.04s)]
*  There's over 100,000 species of butterflies and moths, but pretty much the only one people know are monarchs. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2306.04s)]
*  What is it about monarch butterflies? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2312.04s)]
*  Well, monarchs have got charisma. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2315.04s)]
*  Wait a minute. Monarch butterflies have charisma? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2318.04s)]
*  Well, yeah, they have charisma because they are accessible, they're large, they're beautiful, they're slow. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2321.04s)]
*  You can catch them. It involves Canada, it involves Mexico. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2326.04s)]
*  Taylor founded a nonprofit called Monarch Watch at the University of Kansas 30 years ago. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2330.04s)]
*  Nice. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2336.04s)]
*  And so far, it's helped tag more than two million of them. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2337.04s)]
*  How do you get to the bottom of this? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2340.04s)]
*  How do you tag a butterfly that's so delicate? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2344.04s)]
*  This is a rough butterfly, and it has to go thousands of miles, so it's a pretty tough butterfly. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2347.04s)]
*  It's resilient. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2353.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's resilient. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2354.04s)]
*  But that resilience is being tested. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2355.04s)]
*  Monarchs returning to the U.S. need milkweed plants to lay their eggs on. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2358.04s)]
*  It's the only source of food their newly born caterpillars will eat. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2362.04s)]
*  But milkweed is now hard to find. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2366.04s)]
*  It's been virtually eradicated on agricultural land because of genetically modified corn and soybean crops [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2369.04s)]
*  that allow for mass spraying of herbicides. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2375.04s)]
*  Monarch Watch encourages people to plant milkweed in their gardens and on public land, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2380.04s)]
*  creating what they call Monarch Way Stations. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2385.04s)]
*  50,000 of them have been planted so far. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2388.04s)]
*  In Mexico, those efforts have gotten noticed. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2392.04s)]
*  Eduardo Rendon, head of World Wildlife Fund's Monarch Butterfly Program, showed us a tag he recently found. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2395.04s)]
*  So this is one of the tags from Monarch Watch from Chip Taylor? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2401.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2405.04s)]
*  I find maybe 12 meters from over here. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2406.04s)]
*  Yeah, I was measuring the colony, and then I see the ground, and I find this tag. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2409.04s)]
*  But it's the only way that we can prove that Monarch from the United States is a good butterfly. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2415.04s)]
*  And to prove that Monarch from the United States and Canada come here to overwinter. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2422.04s)]
*  Less than 20% of the monarchs that head out on this miraculous migration actually make it to the mountains of Michoacan. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2429.04s)]
*  Scientists say worsening storms and rising temperatures kill off many, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2437.04s)]
*  though this past year the number of monarchs that survived the trip nearly doubled. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2442.04s)]
*  It was particularly welcome news in Mexico, where the butterflies' arrival in late October [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2447.04s)]
*  coincides with a deeply spiritual celebration, what's known as the Day of the Dead. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2452.04s)]
*  That's when many here believe the souls of family and friends who died returned to visit their loved ones. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2459.04s)]
*  And so that's why the butterflies are returning as well. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2466.04s)]
*  Local people believe that the monarchs are the returning spirits of... [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2471.04s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2475.04s)]
*  ...of the dead. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2476.04s)]
*  That is correct, yes. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2477.04s)]
*  So who knows, maybe we are actually, you are reviving, you're helping someone's ancestor fly back. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2478.04s)]
*  Yes indeed, so it's very magical. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2487.04s)]
*  Now, the last minute of 60 minutes. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2499.04s)]
*  Today in Paris, Easter Sunday Mass was celebrated in the Cathedral of Notre Dame for the first time in six years. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2502.04s)]
*  It was just five days before Easter, 2019, that a devastating fire swept through the Great Church. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2512.04s)]
*  French President Emmanuel Macron pledged the next day to have Notre Dame restored and reopened within five years. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2519.04s)]
*  And when we got a sneak peek inside last November, just days before Macron kept that promise, we witnessed a true resurrection. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2527.04s)]
*  In the first month after Notre Dame's bells began to ring again, 800 people gathered in the cathedral. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2540.04s)]
*  Over 100,000 visitors came through, and they keep coming to see this modern miracle. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2549.04s)]
*  An average of 29,000 people are visiting every day. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2556.04s)]
*  That's about 5,000 more than came before the fire. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2560.04s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. We'll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2566.04s)]
*  Happy Easter and Passover. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1fdqvOZ8E&t=2571.04s)]
