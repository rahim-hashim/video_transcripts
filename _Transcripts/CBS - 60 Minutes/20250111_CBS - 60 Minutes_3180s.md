# Art and Fashion | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [January 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M)
*  In Greek mythology, Hermes, the son of Zeus, was imagined with winged sandals and a winged [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=0.0s)]
*  hat, symbols of his celebrated speed. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=17.66s)]
*  Today, the French fashion house Hermes that shares his name is also known for its accessories. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=20.96s)]
*  Elegant scarves, ties and handbags all meticulously made, but at a glacial pace. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=27.68s)]
*  It can take years for moneyed customers to get their hands in certain Hermes handbags, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  a process steeped in more mythology than even the Greeks could have imagined. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=40.04s)]
*  The craft and culture behind the brand has been preserved for nearly 200 years by one [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=44.84s)]
*  family and is seldom seen by outsiders. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  But this spring, we were invited to Paris to spend some time behind the silk curtains [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  of the house of Hermes. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  On a rainy afternoon, we watched as Pierre-Alexis Dumas, the artistic director of Hermes, turned [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=63.72s)]
*  his discerning eye to dozens of potential scarf designs. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=69.76s)]
*  Colours and patterns displayed on what looked like the world's chicest clothesline. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  These scarves are screened and stitched by hand, some designs two years in the making. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=80.84s)]
*  The only part of the process that happens quickly is this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=87.44s)]
*  Dumas chose the colours for next season's scarves in less than an hour. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=91.2s)]
*  I'm a happy man. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=95.36s)]
*  Bravo. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=97.76s)]
*  Merci Pierre-Alexis. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=98.76s)]
*  Voilà. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=99.76s)]
*  Look at the disaster. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=100.76s)]
*  A mountain of hope reduced to ashes. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=102.36s)]
*  The house of Hermes wasn't built on silk, but rather saddles. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=107.32s)]
*  In 1837, Thierry Hermes began selling bespoke harnesses in Paris. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=111.56s)]
*  That led to luggage and eventually handbags. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=117.08s)]
*  More than a century later, Hermes is a more than $200 billion luxury brand with a catalogue [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=120.66s)]
*  that includes everything from ready-to-wear to jewelry and furniture. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=127.7s)]
*  Pierre-Alexis Dumas is the sixth generation of his family to take the reins. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=132.74s)]
*  I think it's a wonderful way to enter the store. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=137.82s)]
*  He took us through a tunnel of orange boxes into 24 Faux Brots in Paris, Hermes' flagship [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=140.22s)]
*  and heart for more than a century. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=146.72s)]
*  My grandfather worked here and then my father worked here. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=148.94s)]
*  When I was a child, his office was just on the first floor. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=152.5s)]
*  Now it's the jewelry section. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=155.62s)]
*  The store is like the Louvre of luxury goods, complete with reminders to look but don't [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=157.74s)]
*  touch. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=163.3s)]
*  The brand's masterpieces include this $48,000 purse and, if you have money left over, this [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=164.7s)]
*  $272,000 pool table. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=171.06s)]
*  Do you ever make a decision based on cost, budget? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=174.78s)]
*  This will be less expensive if we do it this way. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=180.16s)]
*  I can't work like that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=182.38s)]
*  I've always heard that Hermes is very costly. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=184.1s)]
*  It's not expensive. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=188.68s)]
*  It's costly. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=190.18s)]
*  What's the difference? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=191.18s)]
*  The cost is the actual price of making an object properly with the required level of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=192.18s)]
*  attention so that you have an object of quality. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=200.74s)]
*  The price of a product which is not delivering what it's supposed to deliver, but you've [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=204.73999999999998s)]
*  paid quite a large amount of money for it and then it betrays you. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=211.54s)]
*  That's expensive. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=215.98s)]
*  A distinctly French philosophy stitched into the DNA of Hermes. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=216.98s)]
*  Dumont says the company has never had a marketing department. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=222.94s)]
*  It's allure, he says, comes from a century of superb craftsmanship and serendipity. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=226.57999999999998s)]
*  Like this trapezoid-shaped purse, in 1935 Dumont's grandfather designed the bag. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=233.5s)]
*  It wasn't a hit. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=239.34s)]
*  But as legend has it, 20 years later, in expecting Grace Kelly used the bag to hide her belly [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=240.34s)]
*  from peering paparazzi. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=246.76s)]
*  Soon, women fled at Hermes, asking for what was eventually renamed the Kelly bag. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=248.9s)]
*  Hermes scarves have been favored by American royalty and actual royalty for decades, the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=254.94s)]
*  kind of product placement money can't buy. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=260.66s)]
*  Even the brand's famous citrus-colored boxes, a color the company trademarked in the U.S., [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=264.02000000000004s)]
*  was a happy accident of the 1940s. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=269.58000000000004s)]
*  In 1946 there was shortage of everything. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=272.42s)]
*  And when my great uncle went to see his supplier of paper manufacturing boxes, the supplier [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=275.74s)]
*  said, I'm sorry, we don't have that beige paper anymore. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=281.70000000000005s)]
*  Because of the war? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=284.58000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, because of the war and short supplies. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=285.58000000000004s)]
*  And he said, I only have that stock of that roll of orange paper that nobody wants. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=287.62s)]
*  Eyes light up when they see that orange. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=293.66s)]
*  Serendipity. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=295.38s)]
*  And it was serendipity that led to the pièce de résistance at Hermes, the Birkin, designed [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=296.38s)]
*  in 1984 by Dumont's father after he was seated next to British actress Jane Birkin on a flight [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=302.82s)]
*  to London. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=309.62s)]
*  And she told him, well, let me tell you, I'm not happy about my bag. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=311.04s)]
*  I want something more loose with bigger handles and always open when I carry it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=315.53999999999996s)]
*  And as she was talking, my father was very good at sketching. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=321.97999999999996s)]
*  He sketched it right there in that moment. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=325.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, but just an idea, you know, a bit something like that. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=327.09999999999997s)]
*  He said, yeah, that would be great. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=329.58s)]
*  It was. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  Today the Birkin is the most coveted and costly handbag in the world. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  A Birkin retails around $9,000 and at auction can fetch upwards of hundreds of thousands [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=337.7s)]
*  of dollars. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=343.86s)]
*  But here is the surreal twist of Hermes exclusivity. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=345.26s)]
*  Even if you can afford to buy a Birkin bag, chances are you can't. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=349.76s)]
*  The stores typically don't have any to sell. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=354.88s)]
*  Dumont says Hermes simply can't keep up with demand. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=358.3s)]
*  Somebody wants the bag. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=362.26s)]
*  How do they get the bag? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=363.48s)]
*  Well, you have to walk into an Hermes store and you have to be patient. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=364.48s)]
*  But you know the world we live in, right? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=369.02000000000004s)]
*  You know that if somebody has the funds and they want the bag, they want the bag now. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=370.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=377.42s)]
*  I have children too and I have desires too. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=379.1s)]
*  But I'm saying it's a long process. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=383.14s)]
*  You go to a store, you get an appointment, you meet a salesperson, you talk about what [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=385.42s)]
*  you want. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=389.34000000000003s)]
*  It's not available. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=390.34000000000003s)]
*  You'll have to wait. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=391.34000000000003s)]
*  It'll come back to you. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=392.34000000000003s)]
*  It takes a long time. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=394.3s)]
*  Eventually it's going to happen. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=395.3s)]
*  Store managers act as gatekeepers for disciples of the brand. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=397.42s)]
*  There are stories of years-long waiting lists for bags and waiting lists to get on the waiting [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=402.62s)]
*  list, along with whispers from Wall Street that the company is brilliantly gaming the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=407.46000000000004s)]
*  customer. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=413.78000000000003s)]
*  Hermes has been accused of creating this artificial scarcity to pump up demand. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=414.78000000000003s)]
*  How do you respond to that? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=422.6s)]
*  It makes me smile that this is a diabolical marketing idea that can only come out of people [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=423.76s)]
*  obsessed with marketing. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=436.2s)]
*  But we don't have a marketing department at Hermes. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=438.2s)]
*  So first of all, when I heard that, I was like, what? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=440.15999999999997s)]
*  Oh, okay, I get it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=443.32s)]
*  Yeah, well, no. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=446.03999999999996s)]
*  Whatever we have, we put on the shelf and it goes. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=448.52s)]
*  There's not a room where you guys are holding all the bags back and saying, let's see what [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=450.92s)]
*  happens. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=455.04s)]
*  Maybe we should. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=456.04s)]
*  The simple truth, Dumas says, is that Hermes doesn't have enough artisans to build the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=457.54s)]
*  bags, which for a century, he says, have been made from start to finish by a single craftsman. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  So I always like to say that Hermes is an old lady with startup issues because we've [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=469.40000000000003s)]
*  grown so fast in such a small period. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=475.62s)]
*  How can you grow so fast without changing what makes you strong? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=478.7s)]
*  How can you grow so fast without changing your values? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=484.38s)]
*  By training people, training a lot of people for a profession which will be their life [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=488.06s)]
*  profession. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=494.14s)]
*  They will finish their career at Hermes. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=495.7s)]
*  In 2021, the house opened a training center in Leatherwork where 400 graduates a year [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=498.5s)]
*  are schooled in the art of savoir-faire, or know-how of making things by hand. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=504.78s)]
*  That includes mastering Hermes' signature saddle stitch. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=510.5s)]
*  When you have a carriage which is pulled by five horses, you better make sure that all [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=514.6s)]
*  the equipment you're using is going to be strong. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=519.96s)]
*  So saddle stitching techniques were not about trying to be hidden. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=523.74s)]
*  They were about being strong and functional. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=530.06s)]
*  Today, it is a hallmark of the Hermes bags. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=532.7s)]
*  And here is a stitch. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=536.58s)]
*  Dumas learned to saddle stitch as a boy upstairs at the Faubourg in the workshop where they [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=538.58s)]
*  still build saddles today. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=543.62s)]
*  He thought it was the perfect place for a lesson. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=546.1400000000001s)]
*  You're going to hold by applying a gentle pressure with your legs. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=549.22s)]
*  With my thighs? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=553.1s)]
*  Yes, your thighs. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=554.1s)]
*  You're going to be able to hold that little piece of leather so that your hands are free [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=555.1s)]
*  to stitch. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=559.5400000000001s)]
*  With needles in both hands, you're supposed to pull a strong linen thread, coated in beeswax, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=561.22s)]
*  into precise loops. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=567.5400000000001s)]
*  So I have to have the hands of a heart surgeon and the thighs of a professional wrestler, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=569.62s)]
*  right? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=573.94s)]
*  That's a very extreme, but yes, if you manage to do that, you got a job. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=574.94s)]
*  Hermes says the crisscross of needles that make the knot can't be replicated by a machine [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=580.1800000000001s)]
*  and can take years to master. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=585.1800000000001s)]
*  But those who do are typically offered positions at one of 23 leather workshops that Hermes [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=587.5s)]
*  has built in villages and towns all over France. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=592.78s)]
*  This is one of them, in Torn, a three-hour drive from Paris in the French countryside. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=596.78s)]
*  The workshop is quiet. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=602.82s)]
*  There is no jamming of sewing machines, just artisans performing a silent dance with dueling [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=604.58s)]
*  needles. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=610.1s)]
*  The morning we visited, we met Amandine and watched as she put the finishing touches on [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=611.26s)]
*  a Kelly, the most difficult bag to build. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=616.3s)]
*  It starts with 30 distinct cuts of leather and can take 20 hours to complete, four hours [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=620.8599999999999s)]
*  for just the handle. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=626.8599999999999s)]
*  There are no manuals or cheat sheets. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=628.5999999999999s)]
*  Artisans rely on their training and muscle memory to make every bag. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=632.0999999999999s)]
*  Which bags do you know how to make? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=636.66s)]
*  The Kelly, the Birkin, the Lindy, the Gypsiere, the Schouder. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=638.4599999999999s)]
*  The one that you've memorized. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=646.22s)]
*  She told us she started making bags at Hermes 15 years ago and went through two years of [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=648.74s)]
*  training. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=653.78s)]
*  So you're able to talk to me and do a saddle stitch at the same time? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=654.78s)]
*  No one seems to be rushing at the workshop. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=660.78s)]
*  The pace is leisurely. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=663.38s)]
*  No looming clocks or quotas, just the slow pursuit of perfection. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=665.1s)]
*  And when the bag is completed... [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=670.5s)]
*  Do you have a special stamp you put in the bag? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=672.46s)]
*  Yes, we do, she said, but it's a secret. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=674.98s)]
*  A secret because that hidden mark of the artisan is how Hermes bags are authenticated. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=680.58s)]
*  By creating their own pipeline of craftsmen, Hermes says they've been able to produce more [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=687.9200000000001s)]
*  of their coveted handbags than ever. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=692.58s)]
*  Although they won't disclose the exact number, that too is a secret. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=694.62s)]
*  This year, some customers were so exasperated by all the mystery and their years-long odyssey [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=700.62s)]
*  to secure a Birkin, they've sued Hermes. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=705.82s)]
*  Pierre-Alexis Dumas says building something timeless takes time. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=709.34s)]
*  He urged patience while nearly losing it with us. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=713.76s)]
*  If I went to the Mercedes dealership and I said I would like that car and they said, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=717.58s)]
*  okay, you're going to have to wait five years, they'd be out of business. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=722.34s)]
*  You're talking about industrial production. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=726.1800000000001s)]
*  You're applying your thinking structure of industrial production to craft. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=728.58s)]
*  We're about craft. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=734.0200000000001s)]
*  We're not machines. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=735.26s)]
*  And we are not compromising on the quality of the way we make the bags. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=737.1800000000001s)]
*  So if the craftsperson is not at the level, his or her bag will not go into the store. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=744.1800000000001s)]
*  Even if they've invested that 20 or 30 hours making it. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=751.46s)]
*  There's no way of speeding it up and keeping it quality. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=755.38s)]
*  Speed is the structuring value of the 20th century. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=758.18s)]
*  We went from horse carriages to the internet. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=764.14s)]
*  Are we going to be so obsessed with speed and immediate satisfaction? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=768.3s)]
*  Maybe not. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=775.74s)]
*  Maybe there is another form of relation to the world, which is linked to patience, to [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=776.8199999999999s)]
*  taking the time of making things right. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=784.22s)]
*  You cannot compress time at one point without compromising on quality. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=787.82s)]
*  Jeff Koons is one of the most prominent and polarizing art stars in the world. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=801.02s)]
*  Perhaps you've seen one of his giant balloon dog sculptures or the stainless steel inflatable [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=805.74s)]
*  rabbit he made that resold for $91 million a few years ago, the highest price ever paid [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=810.58s)]
*  at auction for a work by a living artist. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=816.34s)]
*  I bought a much less expensive work of his at a charity auction about 10 years ago. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=818.98s)]
*  His creations may look simple, but they can take decades to make and often push the boundaries [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=823.82s)]
*  of technology and sometimes taste. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=828.7s)]
*  Critics may scoff at times, but that's nothing new. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=831.94s)]
*  Jeff Koons has been controversial since he first started showing his art more than 40 [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=834.94s)]
*  years ago. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=839.86s)]
*  You'll find the largest collection of Jeff Koons' work at the Broad Museum in Los Angeles. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=842.46s)]
*  Visiting it is like showing up at a strange children's party long after the kids have [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=847.58s)]
*  gone to bed. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=851.94s)]
*  There's a giant painting of a party hat, a porcelain Michael Jackson and his chimp bubbles, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=853.66s)]
*  a kind of pop culture pieta. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=858.1800000000001s)]
*  The Hulk even makes an appearance. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=860.66s)]
*  The star attraction, a 10-foot-tall stainless steel balloon dog sculpture. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=863.34s)]
*  Koons showed it to us after hours. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=869.38s)]
*  We had to make machines to make this work. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=871.62s)]
*  They didn't exist. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=873.78s)]
*  It may look like it's filled with air, but balloon dog weighs more than a ton and took [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=875.34s)]
*  Jeff Koons six years to make. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=879.86s)]
*  I started with a balloon and I blew it up. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=882.54s)]
*  I twisted a balloon dog. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=885.18s)]
*  Did you know how to make a balloon dog? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=887.18s)]
*  No, I just got a little book and I saw how you do it. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=888.42s)]
*  So I twisted up. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=892.14s)]
*  I probably made about 50 of them and I made a mold of it and then that was used to make [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=893.14s)]
*  the stainless steel pieces. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=898.22s)]
*  Originally when I made this piece, I thought that I could make it for about $300,000, which [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=901.02s)]
*  still that's a lot of money. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=905.58s)]
*  But it ended up, just to create the piece, ended up costing me 1.6. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=908.02s)]
*  And that was more than what I had sold the work for. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=913.22s)]
*  That's classic Koons. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=917.1s)]
*  He's famous for going over budget and his obsessive attention to detail is legendary. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=918.58s)]
*  He spent 20 years figuring out how to turn this massive aluminum into a 10-foot tall [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=924.3s)]
*  pile of Play-Doh. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=929.34s)]
*  To get these basketballs to appear suspended in air, he enlisted the help of a Nobel Prize [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=931.5s)]
*  winning physicist. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=936.22s)]
*  And he used more than 60,000 living flowers to create this 40-foot sculpture of a puppy. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=938.1s)]
*  Koons often takes famous characters or artworks and plays with them, adding a gazing ball [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=944.9s)]
*  to the Mona Lisa. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=949.66s)]
*  Or he elevates everyday things, making them larger, shinier or surreal versions of themselves. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=951.42s)]
*  The rabbit's from 86. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=958.42s)]
*  Like that rabbit resold a few years ago for $91 million. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=961.06s)]
*  He made four that look at first as if they're just plastic inflatables, but they're highly [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=965.02s)]
*  polished stainless steel and weigh about 150 pounds. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=969.54s)]
*  It's iconic because it can represent so many different things. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=973.8199999999999s)]
*  I can think of Easter. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=977.06s)]
*  I can think of a politician with a kind of a microphone, somebody making proclamations. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=978.4599999999999s)]
*  I can think of a Playboy rabbit. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=984.2199999999999s)]
*  But I think one of the most important things to me, the reason it's reflective and reflecting [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=986.6999999999999s)]
*  you, reflecting me, you know, the viewer finishes a work of art. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=992.78s)]
*  It's about your feelings, your experiences. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=997.5s)]
*  It's about your potential. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1000.7399999999999s)]
*  Maybe you're thinking Jeff Koons sounds like a phony self-help prophet. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1003.6600000000001s)]
*  Plenty of critics do. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1007.5s)]
*  But he does see art as something that can help people have a personal transformation. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1009.3000000000001s)]
*  Art can be anything. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1014.24s)]
*  I mean, it really can be. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1015.24s)]
*  My personal experience of art is that you just don't have to bring anything to it other [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1016.74s)]
*  than yourself. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1023.34s)]
*  So your message to people is you don't need to have a thesis in art history to interact [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1024.66s)]
*  with art and what you feel from it is valid. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1031.52s)]
*  It's as valid as anybody else could experience. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1035.6s)]
*  Why balloon dogs? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1038.6s)]
*  Why gazing balls? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1040.28s)]
*  Inflatable rabbit? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1042.48s)]
*  Memories. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1043.48s)]
*  You know, around Easter time, I would see a lot of inflatable rabbits in the yards. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1044.48s)]
*  I would see gazing balls in people's yards, in their gardens. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1050.28s)]
*  Our neighbors who do that, I mean, how generous they are for us that we're just driving by [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1055.52s)]
*  or walking by and we can look and we can have a little awe and wonderment just for that [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1060.6799999999998s)]
*  second. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1065.32s)]
*  To me, they're symbols of cultural history. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1067.1999999999998s)]
*  Koons grew up outside York, Pennsylvania in a rural community where you can still find [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1071.8799999999999s)]
*  gazing balls in people's yards. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1076.76s)]
*  He has eight children, six with his second wife Justine, to whom he's been married for [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1079.62s)]
*  21 years. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1084.08s)]
*  They still live part-time in Pennsylvania in Koons' grandparents' house, part of an [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1085.86s)]
*  800-acre farm where they raise horses and cows. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1090.58s)]
*  I think most people don't envision that this is the life you have as a world-famous artist. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1095.1799999999998s)]
*  You know, I'm very involved with my work, but on the weekends and summers, holidays, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1100.2199999999998s)]
*  it's a really important part of my life. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1106.86s)]
*  Koons has been drawing and painting since childhood. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1109.5s)]
*  In 1974, while studying art in college, his mother helped him meet one of his favorite [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1112.82s)]
*  surrealist painters. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1117.1399999999999s)]
*  My mother called me and she said, I just saw in a magazine that Salvador Dali spends half [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1118.86s)]
*  his year in New York City at the St. Regis Hotel. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1124.86s)]
*  And I thought, oh, okay, maybe, you know, I'll call. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1129.62s)]
*  Wait a minute, you just thought you'd call him? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1133.3799999999999s)]
*  I called the St. Regis. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1136.34s)]
*  I asked for Salvador Dali's room and they put me through. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1137.34s)]
*  You know, I was quite nervous, but I told him I was a fan and that I would enjoy very [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1141.5s)]
*  much to meet him. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1145.38s)]
*  And he said, can you come to New York this weekend on Saturday? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1147.14s)]
*  And I said, yes. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1151.94s)]
*  He said, be in the lobby at 12 o'clock and I'll meet you then. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1152.94s)]
*  And he was spectacular. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1157.76s)]
*  It would never have occurred to me to like just call Salvador Dali in his hotel room. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1159.0600000000002s)]
*  I had nothing to lose, you know. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1163.7s)]
*  Koons and Dali spent the afternoon together, and at the end of it, he asked the world-renowned [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1166.5800000000002s)]
*  artist to pose for this picture. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1171.7s)]
*  I remember he put his mustache up and he was telling me, you know, kid, hurry up. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1173.54s)]
*  I can't hold this pose all day. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1179.4199999999998s)]
*  But I left New York that evening feeling like I could do this. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1181.7s)]
*  After finishing school, he hitchhiked to New York and started making art in his Lower East [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1187.34s)]
*  Side apartment, buying cheap plastic inflatables and putting them on mirrors. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1191.5s)]
*  Koons had grand ambitions, but he needed cash to realize them. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1197.02s)]
*  So eventually I became licensed and registered to sell commodities and mutual funds. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1201.9s)]
*  And so, you know, that's what I started to do, to be able to make more money to make [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1206.98s)]
*  the works. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1210.82s)]
*  That's not a career move a lot of artists make. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1211.82s)]
*  Well, you know, I did it only that I could make enough money to make my vacuum cleaner [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1214.98s)]
*  pieces. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1220.5s)]
*  The vacuum cleaners he's talking about were what first got him noticed in 1980. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1221.66s)]
*  He bought about 20 brand new vacuums and displayed them in cases with fluorescent lights. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1226.24s)]
*  It was part of a series called The New. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1231.86s)]
*  I was showing them for their newness that this was a brand new object. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1234.4s)]
*  It was never used. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1239.0s)]
*  You can see that it's clean, it's pristine, its lungs are pure. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1241.2s)]
*  And there's also some sensual aspects to it too. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1245.52s)]
*  Sensual aspect? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1249.68s)]
*  Sensual, I mean, you have the handle and you have the bag right there. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1250.68s)]
*  It could be looked at as masculine or you could look at it and say, oh, you know, the [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1254.72s)]
*  bag is the womb. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1258.76s)]
*  Art definitely is in the eye of the beholder. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1261.24s)]
*  What did you think of Jeff Koons as an artist when he first sort of came on the scene? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1264.32s)]
*  I was interested in him and I also was kind of repulsed by him. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1268.64s)]
*  Robert Storr, former dean at the Yale School of Art, was a curator at the Museum of Modern [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1273.04s)]
*  Art in New York when it acquired some of Koons's vacuums in 1996. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1277.32s)]
*  I think some of the work is really unpleasant, but it doesn't mean it's not serious. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1282.1599999999999s)]
*  What's unpleasant about it? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1286.84s)]
*  The imagery is vulgar, okay? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1288.6s)]
*  Now vulgar means many things. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1290.6s)]
*  It means of the people rather than of the elites. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1292.76s)]
*  So it's taking an object which the New York elites might look at and think, oh, that's [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1295.52s)]
*  tacky, that's trashy, that's something you buy in a gift shop, and it's blowing it up [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1300.4399999999998s)]
*  and making it perfect and saying that this has value? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1306.84s)]
*  It has meaning, not necessarily value, but it has meaning. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1311.24s)]
*  What is the message of that? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1313.8000000000002s)]
*  The message is that it is there to be embraced, that it is not to be mocked, that one should [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1315.24s)]
*  not be smugly sure of one's own taste to the point of denying the possibility of other [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1319.96s)]
*  tastes. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1325.44s)]
*  And is he being honest about that? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1326.44s)]
*  I think he's being totally honest. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1327.96s)]
*  And I think that he has made all of that fair game in a way that we have not seen since Warhol. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1330.1200000000001s)]
*  Like Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons has a factory of sorts, with an assembly line of painters [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1338.0s)]
*  meticulously following his instructions, and dozens of digital assistants, sculptors, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1343.4s)]
*  and craftsmen all over the world helping make his complex pieces, which are often inspired [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1349.32s)]
*  by very simple things. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1354.68s)]
*  This is like a very modern grandmother's closet. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1356.68s)]
*  Turns out Koons was fascinated by his grandparents' porcelain figurines as a child and has collected [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1359.64s)]
*  hundreds of them. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1365.36s)]
*  Where did you find this? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1366.84s)]
*  I found it online. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1367.84s)]
*  He decided to make this $150 ballerina into a multimillion dollar, eight foot tall marble [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1370.32s)]
*  sculpture, but it wound up taking him 12 years. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1376.04s)]
*  First he used a CAT scan machine to digitally map every detail of the figurine inside and [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1379.9599999999998s)]
*  out. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1384.8s)]
*  Then it took him five years, and the help of MIT scientists, to begin translating all [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1386.08s)]
*  those details into instructions for machines to carve the sculpture. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1390.48s)]
*  The actual carving took another seven years. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1396.42s)]
*  Now the work will really progress quickly. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1399.94s)]
*  We went with Koons to a workshop in Pennsylvania to check on the progress and found Ayame Aoyama [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1403.02s)]
*  and her team carefully polishing the ballerina by hand. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1409.22s)]
*  Do you have a sense of how many hours of work is done on a piece? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1412.42s)]
*  33,000 hours. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1417.38s)]
*  33,000 hours. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1418.38s)]
*  Hours for just the hand work. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1419.38s)]
*  It must be exhausting. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1421.5s)]
*  I mean the level of detail and monotony and difficulty of it is incredible. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1422.98s)]
*  Yeah, it is like a really unique job I would say. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1428.1s)]
*  That looks like a sort of a dental tool. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1432.38s)]
*  What is this? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1433.74s)]
*  Yeah, that nail polisher that ladies actually use. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1434.74s)]
*  You'll notice Jeff Koons isn't doing the sculpting or painting. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1440.42s)]
*  He comes up with the ideas and sets the standards, but his artisans do the labor, which has led [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1443.98s)]
*  to criticism, including from our own Morley Safer. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1448.94s)]
*  So what do you say to the man? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1452.42s)]
*  30 years ago Morley did a story critiquing contemporary art and likened Koons to a PT [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1453.7s)]
*  Barnault selling to suckers. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1459.46s)]
*  He doesn't actually paint or sculpt. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1461.54s)]
*  He commissions craftsmen to do that or he goes shopping for basketballs and vacuum cleaners. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1464.02s)]
*  Is that a legitimate criticism? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1470.5s)]
*  It's a legitimate criticism if you look at art in a way that you kind of want everything [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1472.22s)]
*  to be done by the artists themselves, but it becomes very limited what you can do within [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1478.98s)]
*  one life if you're being responsible for everything. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1485.26s)]
*  It's like the production of this program right now. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1489.78s)]
*  Anderson, if you had to be responsible for the lighting, if you had to be responsible [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1492.82s)]
*  for editing. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1497.26s)]
*  If I was responsible for the lighting, we wouldn't see you or myself. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1498.26s)]
*  But if you'd have to be responsible for everything, I mean how many programs would you be able [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1502.18s)]

*  I've designed, worked on the systems so that the whole process at the end of the day, it's [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1508.6599999999999s)]
*  as if every mark was made by myself. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1514.9399999999998s)]
*  At 68 Koons has reached a level of commercial success few artists ever imagined. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1518.58s)]
*  He's helped design cars for BMW, an album cover for Lady Gaga, even a super yacht. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1524.8999999999999s)]
*  And later this year he hopes to create a permanent art exhibit on the moon. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1532.34s)]
*  He's made 125 small stainless steel moon sculptures and mounted them on a lunar lander that'll [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1537.1799999999998s)]
*  hitch a ride aboard a SpaceX rocket. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1543.2199999999998s)]
*  Is there something about the atmosphere on the moon that would affect the lifespan of [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1546.26s)]
*  a work? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1549.82s)]
*  Yeah, almost everything. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1550.82s)]
*  You know, you have tremendous radiation. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1553.1s)]
*  You have the temperature change, at least 250 degrees difference from night to day. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1555.6599999999999s)]
*  One of the most inhospitable environments that you could imagine for a work of art. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1562.06s)]
*  The moon sculptures are for sale, of course, along with an NFT, or non-fungible token, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1568.82s)]
*  which serves as digital proof your artwork is actually up there. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1574.46s)]
*  You'll also get one of these larger moons to show off here on Earth. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1578.86s)]
*  He won't say how much it'll cost you, but with Jeff Koons, it's a safe bet the price [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1583.1799999999998s)]
*  tag will be out of this world. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1587.78s)]
*  Laurie Anderson is an artist whose work defies any easy description. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1592.06s)]
*  She's a pioneer of the avant-garde, but as we learn, that doesn't begin to describe what [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1602.98s)]
*  she creates. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1607.74s)]
*  Her work isn't sold in galleries. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1609.1s)]
*  It's experienced by audiences who come to see her perform, singing, telling stories, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1611.06s)]
*  and playing strange violins of her own invention. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1616.46s)]
*  She won a Grammy for a chamber music album about Hurricane Sandy and remains one of America's [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1619.74s)]
*  most unusual and visionary artists. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1625.02s)]
*  We met at her largest ever US exhibition at the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum earlier [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1628.18s)]
*  this year. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1633.14s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, Laurie Anderson. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1634.46s)]
*  She's played electronic drums on her body and electric violins that sing and howl. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1641.74s)]
*  For nearly five decades now, she's blended the beautiful and the bizarre, challenging [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1652.94s)]
*  audiences with homilies and humor. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1659.26s)]
*  She blurs boundaries across music, theater, dance, and film. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1668.82s)]
*  This is my dream body. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1677.02s)]
*  It's not just audiences that have a hard time defining her work. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1678.6799999999998s)]
*  Laurie Anderson sometimes does as well. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1682.26s)]
*  I used to say multimedia artist, and that was ridiculous. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1684.98s)]
*  So, multimedia artist, so clumsy. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1688.06s)]
*  With a gun to my head, I say, I tell stories. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1691.36s)]
*  And those look like paintings sometimes. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1694.86s)]
*  They look like, you know, songs. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1696.5s)]
*  They look like films. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1699.1399999999999s)]
*  They're just stories. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1700.1399999999999s)]
*  What is a story? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1701.1399999999999s)]
*  What is its function? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1702.1399999999999s)]
*  How does it work? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1703.1399999999999s)]
*  Who's telling it? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1704.1399999999999s)]
*  To who? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1705.1399999999999s)]
*  If you've heard of Laurie Anderson at all, it may be because of this eight-minute long [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1706.1399999999999s)]
*  song she recorded back in 1980. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1716.86s)]
*  It's eerie and somewhat unsettling, and to her surprise, it became a hit. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1719.88s)]
*  This is a song about how basically technology cannot save you. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1728.1200000000001s)]
*  I first heard it when I was 14. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1732.48s)]
*  I just was like, what is this? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1734.0s)]
*  And I still listen to it. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1736.9s)]
*  It's about a lot of things, justice, safety, power. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1738.48s)]
*  She recorded Oh Superman herself in her apartment in downtown Manhattan. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1746.32s)]
*  I had a lot of equipment that would loop things, so I was making a lot of vocal loops. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1750.84s)]
*  Actually, you have to hit it right in the right spot. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1757.8s)]
*  So they'd hock it and do this. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1761.0s)]
*  You say, because when love is gone, there's always justice. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1763.32s)]
*  Here, you just, here you go. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1771.04s)]
*  You can use a vocoder. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1773.28s)]
*  Here we go, here we go. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1775.4s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1778.2s)]
*  And when justice is gone, there's always force. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1779.2s)]
*  And when force is gone, there's always mom. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1785.2s)]
*  Hi mom, I love you. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1792.0s)]
*  You do that very well. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1795.4s)]
*  I love listening to it. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1796.4s)]
*  You got the job. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1797.4s)]
*  The song led to her groundbreaking first album, Big Science. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1798.4s)]
*  Pitchfork said listening to Laurie Anderson's first album is like sitting down with a strange [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1803.4s)]
*  form of life that has been studying us for a long time. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1811.6000000000001s)]
*  I'd like to meet that writer. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1816.2s)]
*  I mean, everything is, when you actually break a town, bizarre and unlikely. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1817.4s)]
*  That's my lens, I think, unlikely. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1825.8000000000002s)]
*  Laurie Anderson grew up in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, where she was one of eight children. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1828.4s)]
*  Every weekend she played violin with the Chicago Youth Symphony and then walked across the street [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1833.8000000000002s)]
*  to the Art Institute to study painting. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1838.6000000000001s)]
*  And it didn't seem different to me to go like this or go like this. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1841.6000000000001s)]
*  It was the same thing. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1845.48s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1846.48s)]
*  I would just, is that, or is that, is it... [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1847.48s)]
*  Playing the violin or painting... [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1850.1200000000001s)]
*  Colorful enough, is it? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1851.1200000000001s)]
*  Cool enough, is it adventurous enough, is it right enough? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1853.1200000000001s)]
*  Is it, it's all, it's just the same exact thing, all the same questions. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1856.8s)]
*  And it was just what a hand is doing and what is making sound over here, it's making color [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1863.1999999999998s)]
*  over here. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1868.0s)]
*  She came to New York in 1966 and began experimenting with music and short films. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1869.24s)]
*  But after a while, she thought her work might be better received in Europe. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1875.08s)]
*  You wanted to tour in Europe. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1878.9199999999998s)]
*  I did, yeah. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1880.3999999999999s)]
*  I wrote to about maybe 500, let's say, art centers, saying, planning a tour in the fall. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1881.4s)]
*  I had no tour. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1890.6000000000001s)]
*  And would you like to be part of that? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1892.44s)]
*  With a couple responses, she took off for Italy. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1895.48s)]
*  That's her in 1975 playing a violin with a tape recorder inside, playing loops so she [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1898.6000000000001s)]
*  could duet with herself. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1904.92s)]
*  But then when is the concert over? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1906.88s)]
*  There's no end to a loop. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1908.64s)]
*  So I thought, I need a timing mechanism. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1910.12s)]
*  So I wore some ice skates with their blades frozen into blocks of ice. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1911.9599999999998s)]
*  So when at play until the ice started melting and cracking, and then when I began to lose [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1916.4799999999998s)]
*  my balance, I would just stop. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1922.28s)]
*  That was it. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1924.0s)]
*  That was the clock. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1925.0s)]
*  And you were doing this on the street? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1926.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1927.0s)]
*  Usually in the hottest part of town because it could take a long time to have these things, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1928.0s)]
*  the cubes, melt. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1932.28s)]
*  Every year she was a traveling troubadour, experimenting with sound, light and stories. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1934.28s)]
*  After the unlikely success of Oh, Superman, she got an eight record deal with Warner Brothers. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1945.52s)]
*  Suddenly the avant-garde artist was playing on MTV. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1954.2s)]
*  That must have been strange to have that kind of commercial success dangled before you. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1958.68s)]
*  I knew enough about the pop world to know it was extremely fickle. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1964.44s)]
*  So I said, OK, I'm not going to be tricked by this. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1968.0s)]
*  A chance meeting with a rock and roll legend she'd vaguely heard of changed her life. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1974.1200000000001s)]
*  His name was Lou Reed, and he asked her out. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1979.3200000000002s)]
*  And we went over to the AES convention at the Javits Center. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1982.72s)]
*  Super geeky thing to do. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1986.04s)]
*  We were looking at two microphones. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1987.08s)]
*  So for your first date, you went to the Acoustical Society Engineering Convention. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1988.76s)]
*  It doesn't sound very romantic. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1992.6399999999999s)]
*  I didn't think of it as romantic. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1995.28s)]
*  You didn't know it was a date? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1997.0s)]
*  No, I did not. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1998.0s)]
*  We said, let's go get a coffee. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=1999.0s)]
*  I said, OK. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2001.04s)]
*  And I was like, I kind of like this guy. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2003.6399999999999s)]
*  We were really apart for 21 years after that. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2007.1599999999999s)]

*  Five years later, Lou Reed died after a long battle with liver cancer. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2035.76s)]
*  He wrote about his death. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2041.64s)]
*  I've never seen an expression as full of wonder as Lou's as he died. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2043.2s)]
*  He wasn't afraid. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2047.4s)]
*  Had gotten to walk with him to the end of the world. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2049.0s)]
*  Life so beautiful, painful, and dazzling does not get better than that. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2051.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2056.12s)]
*  Lou was a person who had thought about this and had prepared himself for it and was 100% [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2057.12s)]
*  there. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2067.4s)]

*  day walks her dog, Little Will, to the studio she's had since the 1970s. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2073.4s)]
*  When we dropped in on her, she was rehearsing with cellist Ruben Codeli. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2077.96s)]
*  It's an opera she wrote about Amelia Earhart's doomed attempt to circumnavigate the globe. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2087.88s)]
*  She's on this crackly radio and she's going like, I can see you but I can't hear you and [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2093.52s)]
*  they're going, I can hear you but I can't see you. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2097.72s)]
*  She's in perpetual motion, playing with technology and images, fascinated by language and sound. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2101.2s)]
*  What was really fun about this? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2107.7599999999998s)]
*  She's working with an Australian university on an artificial intelligence program loaded [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2110.52s)]
*  with everything she's ever written, said, or sung. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2115.2s)]
*  You can ask it a question or give it a photograph and the algorithm creates an original poem [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2118.64s)]
*  in the words and speech pattern of Lori Anderson. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2124.0s)]
*  Half of it is really terrible poetry, a quarter of it is kind of interesting and a quarter [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2127.4s)]
*  of it is really kind of great. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2131.04s)]
*  To see how it works, we uploaded a photograph of my newborn son, Sebastian. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2133.04s)]
*  The mouth, the eye, the hand, the face, there's nowhere to go, no place to hide it, it's [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2137.56s)]
*  everywhere now that I'm here. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2142.2000000000003s)]

*  Who did this? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2145.04s)]
*  Who are these people? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2146.04s)]
*  Why are you here? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2147.04s)]
*  I'm like crying, I find this really emotional. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2148.04s)]
*  The thing is, it really shows us more how much of ourselves we put into language. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2151.76s)]
*  There's a story in an ancient play. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2157.6800000000003s)]
*  Last year Anderson delivered six virtual lectures as the Norden Professor of Poetry at Harvard. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2161.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, the best way to see the city is at night from the air. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2167.36s)]
*  Following in the footsteps of Robert Frost, Leonard Bernstein and Toni Morrison. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2171.36s)]
*  Not surprisingly, Anderson's lectures were very different. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2176.4s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2179.92s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2180.92s)]
*  That's it. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2181.92s)]
*  Oh, you're in the conga room. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2182.92s)]
*  Perhaps the closest anyone can get inside Laurie Anderson's mind is this virtual reality [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2184.84s)]
*  world she created with a collaborator in Taiwan. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2190.36s)]
*  It's a world that looks spatial, but it's made of words and drawings. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2193.7200000000003s)]
*  Whoa! [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2199.64s)]
*  It feels as though you're flying inside a work of art. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2200.64s)]
*  You've been working with technology for 40 years now. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2204.2000000000003s)]
*  Does it still fascinate you? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2207.6s)]
*  Yeah, it does. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2209.12s)]
*  I'm still geek. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2210.7599999999998s)]
*  I like it. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2213.64s)]
*  I don't think I worship it. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2214.64s)]
*  It's not the savior of that. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2216.52s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2218.2s)]
*  Some hope. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2219.2s)]
*  No. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2220.2s)]
*  And this was said to me by a cryptologist. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2221.2s)]
*  If you think technology is going to solve your problems, you don't understand technology [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2223.52s)]
*  and you don't understand your problems. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2227.84s)]
*  And I like that very much because people just go, oh yeah, that's going to fix it. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2230.48s)]
*  Really? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2235.7599999999998s)]
*  Laurie Anderson's largest ever U.S. exhibition is currently on display at the Smithsonian's [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2236.8s)]
*  Hirshhorn Museum on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2241.7200000000003s)]
*  It's an odyssey through her singular creative life. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2245.6400000000003s)]
*  This seems very ominous to me. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2250.7200000000003s)]
*  Good. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2252.6000000000004s)]
*  There's so much flag waving these days and it becomes quite mechanical in some ways. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2253.6000000000004s)]
*  And I guess I'm terrified of the rise of fascism around the world, frankly. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2259.36s)]
*  Wow. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2264.88s)]
*  In one room, she's painted words and images that seem to explode onto the walls and floor. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2266.88s)]
*  It's a kind of multi-dimensional sketchbook of her thoughts, dreams and stories. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2273.0s)]
*  Did you map this out before you did it? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2278.36s)]
*  No, I should have. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2280.1600000000003s)]
*  New ideas are built on older works. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2281.1600000000003s)]
*  She first came up with this concept in the 1970s. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2284.2000000000003s)]
*  This is called Citizens. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2287.2400000000002s)]
*  I've never seen anything like this. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2289.0s)]
*  Miniature clay figures with video of people projected onto them. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2291.1200000000003s)]

*  This one does. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2298.96s)]
*  They're all sharpening knives. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2299.96s)]
*  Because I think it's like, people like elves, right? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2300.96s)]
*  You know? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2304.7200000000003s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2305.7200000000003s)]
*  And fairies. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2306.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2307.7200000000003s)]

*  These are some badass fairies. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2311.0s)]
*  I mean... [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2312.6400000000003s)]
*  From miniatures to monuments. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2314.36s)]
*  We didn't see the sun. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2316.1200000000003s)]

*  In another room, another story. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2321.0s)]
*  This one told by a giant video projection of Mohammed El-Gharani, held for seven years [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2323.6s)]

*  What do you have to say? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2338.48s)]
*  It was, this is not about my opinions of what happened here. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2339.48s)]
*  This is Mohammed El-Gharani's story. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2342.92s)]
*  Laurie Anderson is 74 now and still conjuring up new stories and new ways to tell them. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2348.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm not an artist to make the world a better place. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2355.4s)]
*  This is not my goal, you know, at all. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2358.2799999999997s)]
*  Except like, secretly. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2362.0s)]
*  That's very quietly. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2363.56s)]
*  That's your goal? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2365.52s)]
*  Quietly. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2366.52s)]
*  Because I really love beautiful things. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2367.52s)]
*  Because it's thrilling to put your mind somewhere else and be somewhere that you could never [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2370.96s)]
*  have imagined and then suddenly you're imagining and then you're there. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2379.52s)]
*  It's magic. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2382.92s)]
*  Almost 20 years ago, we broadcast one of the most controversial stories in our 44 years [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2393.12s)]
*  on the air. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2398.96s)]
*  It was called Yes, But Is It Art? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2400.36s)]
*  I was accused of being a Philistine, someone lacking the aesthetic sensibility to appreciate [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2403.2000000000003s)]
*  the challenging nature of some contemporary art. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2409.0800000000004s)]
*  Art like Jeff Koons' Floating Basketballs or another artist's Dripping Faucet. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2412.8s)]
*  In those 20 years, works that I questioned worth hundreds of thousands of dollars are [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2418.6400000000003s)]
*  now worth hundreds of millions. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2424.0s)]
*  In fact, contemporary art has become a global commodity, just like oil or soybeans or pork [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2426.48s)]
*  bellies. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2432.92s)]
*  And there seems to be no shortage of people wanting to speculate in it and no shortage [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2433.92s)]
*  of billionaires willing to invest in it as a haven for their cash or love of art or as [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2439.2400000000002s)]
*  a status symbol. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2445.4s)]
*  And to feed those beasts, there are now art fairs virtually every weekend around the globe. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2447.16s)]
*  And in contemporary art, none are more important than the one we went to in December. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2453.08s)]
*  To Miami Beach, once a mere escape from the winter blues. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2462.3199999999997s)]
*  Now one of the great contemporary art capitals of the world. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2467.52s)]
*  The region hosts at least 30 art fairs annually, most important of which is Art Basel. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2471.84s)]
*  In Miami, the executive jets arrive by the swarm, more even than flit in for the Superbowl. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2478.56s)]
*  50,000 people turn up dressed up and dressed down. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2486.12s)]
*  You can't tell the billionaires from the wannabes, the gawkers from the gawk-dad, the exhibitionists [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2493.08s)]
*  from the exhibitions. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2499.56s)]
*  They come to celebrate the bonanza that contemporary art has become. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2503.52s)]
*  The art market sizzles while the stock market fizzles. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2508.6s)]
*  This is where big disposable income comes to be disposed. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2513.28s)]
*  Inside you'll find an upscale flea market, a shopping mall where prices start at the [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2521.2s)]
*  thousands and end in the stratosphere. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2526.04s)]
*  There's very little sense of an aesthetic experience here, not the silence or even the [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2529.76s)]
*  suppressed hush of a gallery or museum. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2534.84s)]
*  What you hear or imagine you hear is the cacophony of cash. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2538.1200000000003s)]
*  This fair seems to be about art as stuff or stuff as art, just so much merchandise without [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2545.8s)]
*  a price tag in sight. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2552.88s)]
*  There are some timeless gems maintaining a quiet elegance, but they're shouted off the [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2555.16s)]
*  walls by the kitsch, the cute, the clumsy and the incomprehensible. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2560.3399999999997s)]
*  From oversized headwear to art as performance and of course video art, an artist in the [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2564.92s)]
*  agonizing throes of creation. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2577.12s)]
*  And then there's the question you've been dying to ask. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2580.2s)]
*  How much is this stuff worth? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2583.24s)]
*  Rather, how much does it cost? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2585.64s)]
*  There's a price for you and there's a price for me and there's a price for somebody else. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2589.2s)]
*  Dennis Scholl and his wife Deborah are longtime collectors, familiar with the unwritten rules [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2592.9199999999996s)]
*  of the art bazaar. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2598.9199999999996s)]
*  It's really what a willing buyer will pay to a willing seller in the art world. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2600.8199999999997s)]
*  So when you go and look at a piece of art, the price is what you negotiate. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2605.12s)]
*  There's no fixed price per se. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2609.88s)]
*  And prices move up and prices move down very quickly in the art world, particularly with [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2613.12s)]
*  young artists. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2616.44s)]
*  And have you made some mistakes or have they all been pretty... [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2617.44s)]
*  Well, we've bought a thousand pieces of art in my life, so we've made plenty, plenty of [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2621.44s)]
*  mistakes. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2625.76s)]
*  I mean, we have, yes. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2626.76s)]
*  And you know what you do? [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2627.76s)]
*  You just bury them in the backyard and forget about them. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2628.76s)]
*  Two hundred and sixty-five dealers are invited and they're willing to spend up to a hundred [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2631.6s)]
*  and fifty thousand dollars for the privilege of showing their wares. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2637.04s)]
*  Am I, are we such Philistine slobs that we wonder about the value of some of this? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2641.6s)]
*  Is this art that dazzles the eye or makes us think? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2648.0s)]
*  Do baby blue translucent bathroom fixtures prick the imagination? [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2651.88s)]
*  Does that toilet seat raise our spirits or is it directing us to the men's room? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2657.08s)]
*  Or is this the biggest scam since Hans Christian Andersen trotted out the Emperor's new clothes? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2662.96s)]
*  One thing's for sure, it's no joke. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2670.08s)]
*  Look at this graph. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2673.48s)]
*  Contemporary art sales last year totaled about five and a half billion dollars and that only [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2675.08s)]
*  includes auction prices. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2681.04s)]
*  Private sales like these art fairs could be worth billions more. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2683.44s)]
*  Recession? [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2687.84s)]
*  What recession? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2689.2400000000002s)]
*  Good. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2690.2400000000002s)]
*  Deal. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2691.2400000000002s)]
*  Cool. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2692.3199999999997s)]
*  Great. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2693.3199999999997s)]
*  I'll bill you. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2694.3199999999997s)]
*  The real fundamental thing is we're here to sell a lot of art. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2695.3199999999997s)]
*  Tim Blum, a partner in Blum and Poe, a Los Angeles gallery renowned for discovering the [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2698.3999999999996s)]
*  sharpest of cutting edge art. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2704.9599999999996s)]
*  Some of the art that you sell probably could be described as difficult. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2707.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh absolutely, 100%. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2711.72s)]
*  I mean we kind of specialize in that. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2713.64s)]
*  You have to explain to a potential buyer why he or she might. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2715.08s)]
*  Learn to love this. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2723.08s)]
*  Often you do. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2724.52s)]
*  A lot of folks are just buying, it's more like we need one of these things because everybody's [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2725.52s)]
*  getting one. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2729.48s)]
*  Status. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2730.48s)]
*  It's a status symbol, it's a speculative mechanism. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2731.48s)]
*  Do you sometimes have to grit your teeth even when you're making a sale? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2734.64s)]
*  Yeah I mean, yeah. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2739.64s)]
*  We're very good at that. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2740.8799999999997s)]
*  We're from Hollywood, we're in the acting game. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2741.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's theater. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2744.7999999999997s)]
*  This is all theater. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2746.8399999999997s)]
*  Tim Blum knows all the A-list collectors. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2748.88s)]
*  There's people that are collecting art in a very beautiful organic autobiographical [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2752.76s)]
*  way where the art is a part of their lifeline. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2757.6s)]
*  And then there's the pure speculators and then there's the people that just have so [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2761.48s)]
*  much money and the art is the next thing on the queue. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2765.92s)]
*  You're appealing to the 1% as opposed to the 99%, correct? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2771.28s)]
*  1% under .0000001%. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2775.76s)]
*  Eli Broad, the one percenter of one percenters, the collector of thousands of artworks, builder [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2784.76s)]
*  of his own museum. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2791.5200000000004s)]
*  He's giddy with the thrill of having beaten the pack to a drawing by Kara Walker, a truly [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2793.5600000000004s)]
*  gifted young American artist. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2799.7200000000003s)]
*  Artists like Mr. Broad get first dibs on the really good stuff. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2803.0s)]
*  He moved on to pick up photographs by Cindy Sherman. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2807.36s)]
*  He was one of her first collectors. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2811.02s)]
*  I love Cindy, I love her work. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2812.88s)]
*  He has good reason to love Cindy. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2815.52s)]
*  He first bought her pictures back in 1982 for $250. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2818.02s)]
*  Today they go for nearly $4 million. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2823.6s)]
*  All of her subject matter is herself, in various guises. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2826.6s)]
*  Her current retrospective at New York's Museum of Modern Art gives her work even more value. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2832.04s)]
*  What are you looking for? [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2838.76s)]
*  For dealers, the gold standard is selling to a major museum. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2840.32s)]
*  So when Jennifer Stockman, on the right, president of the board of the Guggenheim Foundation, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2844.32s)]
*  along with a senior curator, Alexandra Munro, turns up, the water is part. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2849.88s)]
*  If you go into this concave... [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2855.64s)]
*  Let's walk in. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2857.08s)]
*  They, along with the dealer Barbara Gladstone, went ape over this sculpture by Anish Kapoor. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2858.2s)]
*  And then you also don't know, and you have no idea of death. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2865.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's very strange. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2869.24s)]
*  We moved on to an installation by Hege Yang, a Korean artist. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2871.48s)]
*  This tangle of extension cords, asking price? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2875.84s)]
*  $33,000. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2879.36s)]
*  We already are very committed to this artist, so I'm really excited to come and see new [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2881.56s)]
*  work by Hege. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2886.2s)]
*  She is a perfect example of a contemporary, peripatetic global artist. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2887.64s)]
*  I always find some sadness in your work. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2892.72s)]
*  Something's unstable, something's unfinished, something's like never complete. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2895.72s)]
*  It's always in the process. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2899.8399999999997s)]
*  And I think that's sort of how we live today. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2902.68s)]
*  ArtSpeak, the descriptive language of contemporary art, can seem as opaque as spilled alphabet [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2905.8399999999997s)]
*  soup. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2912.3199999999997s)]
*  And the art fair gives you a very good context for this. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2913.72s)]
*  But a language fully understood by Jeffrey Deitch, former dealer, now director of the [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2916.88s)]
*  Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2922.76s)]
*  He could not resist reminding us of our report of 1993 and who had the last laugh. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2926.28s)]
*  In the art world, we remember very well that famous program that you did 20 years ago where [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2933.6400000000003s)]
*  you was almost a send-up of the contemporary art market. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2940.4s)]
*  We had a little bit of fun with it. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2944.2000000000003s)]
*  Sure, but I think in terms of market value, the time that we were talking, Jeff Koons [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2946.64s)]
*  was very well sold at $250,000. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2952.8399999999997s)]
*  And as you know now, Jeff Koons' works have gone for $25 million and more. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2956.8399999999997s)]
*  And nearby, arguably the most powerful dealer in the art world, the famously reticent Larry [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2964.7599999999998s)]
*  Gagosian, owner of 11 galleries around the world. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2970.9199999999996s)]
*  He reluctantly graced us with a few words of wisdom. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2976.16s)]
*  At least say hello. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2979.16s)]
*  Hey, Morley. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2981.16s)]
*  How are you? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2982.16s)]
*  Good. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2983.16s)]
*  You're my student. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2984.16s)]
*  This place has become one of the places that someone like yourself have to show at. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2985.16s)]
*  Yeah, for me it's a place to sell art. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2993.16s)]
*  I mean, it's a place to make money. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2995.16s)]
*  You know, the art fair has become a huge part of our business. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2996.16s)]
*  How has China and Russia changed the art market? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=2999.16s)]
*  It's been a huge factor. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3002.64s)]
*  The wealth in Russia, the Middle East, Asia has changed it dramatically. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3004.64s)]
*  Just how dramatically can be seen in this graph. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3010.64s)]
*  In orange is the contemporary art market's performance compared to the gray, which is [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3013.64s)]
*  the S&P stock index. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3019.64s)]
*  Much of that dramatic rise is a result of those new billionaires from China and Russia [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3023.64s)]
*  parking their money in art. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3030.12s)]
*  You have to tell me a little more about this, Richter. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3032.12s)]
*  Maria Babakova, age 26, is interested in this dealer's Gerhard Richter, a German artist [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3035.12s)]
*  who is the current rage. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3042.12s)]
*  It's got a lot of wall power. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3044.12s)]
*  She's a Russian oligarch's daughter who's spending a fortune on contemporary art. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3046.12s)]
*  And my painting I'm selling it for $4.8 million, so you're getting a bargain with me today. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3051.12s)]
*  That's a real bargain. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3055.12s)]
*  I think so. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3056.12s)]
*  Certainly a bargain if your daddy's a billionaire and you're playing in a market where the rule [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3057.6s)]
*  is, there are no rules. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3063.6s)]
*  It's the Wild West. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3066.6s)]
*  This is not a normal retail business. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3067.6s)]
*  It's an unregulated, utterly bizarre place to conduct business. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3070.4s)]
*  The competition is great, yes? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3076.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3079.6s)]
*  It's literally a multi-billion dollar economy, the art world. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3080.6s)]
*  So the way the business is run and the competition between dealers, between artists, is often vicious. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3084.08s)]
*  This is where the art trade's carefully constructed mask of Olympian high culture begins to crack. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3092.08s)]
*  And the underside of a booming, cutthroat commodities market is revealed. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3099.08s)]
*  One without regulation or oversight, in which price fixing and control of supply to maintain [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3104.08s)]
*  demand, is both legal and commonplace. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3111.56s)]
*  How does this boom keep sustaining itself against all odds? [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3114.56s)]
*  It's inexplicable. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3120.56s)]
*  I mean it really is almost unexplainable. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3121.56s)]
*  When we bring it up and begin to talk about it, we sort of drop the subject because it [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3124.56s)]
*  almost feels like you should just let it keep rolling. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3129.56s)]
*  Because it's going against what's happening elsewhere in the economy. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3132.56s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely, 100%. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3135.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, the prices rise and the band plays on, and all's well in this wonderful world. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3137.04s)]
*  If the music stops and the bubble bursts, no big deal. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3146.04s)]
*  The collectors are bubble proof. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3150.04s)]
*  It's only their mad money they're spending anyway. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3152.04s)]
*  They'll still have the pleasure of their art, easier to look at than pork bellies. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3155.04s)]
*  Or maybe not. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3162.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxdyvWrt9M&t=3166.56s)]
