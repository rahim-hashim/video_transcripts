# Artists and Tastemakers | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [April 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI)
*  When a giant photograph of a child appeared looming over the U.S.-Mexico border near San [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=0.0s)]
*  Diego this fall, art aficionados knew right away it was the work of an artist who calls [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=18.34s)]
*  himself J.R. You may have never heard of J.R., but his giant photographs have appeared in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=24.1s)]
*  some 140 countries, sometimes in fancy art galleries, but more often than not pasted [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=29.5s)]
*  illegally on sidewalks and subways, buildings and rooftops. Plenty of famous artists like [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=35.78s)]
*  Basquiat and Keith Haring started out scrawling their work on the streets, often in the dead [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=41.82s)]
*  of night, but few have continually displayed their art in public spaces on the scale of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=47.06s)]
*  J.R. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=53.18s)]
*  This is the photograph that popped up in September along the U.S.-Mexico border, a 64-foot-tall [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=56.18s)]
*  picture of a Mexican child named Quito who lives just on the other side of the fence. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=62.1s)]
*  Built on scaffolding on Mexican soil, there was nothing U.S. Border Patrol agents could [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=68.34s)]
*  do about it. It was classic J.R., a person's picture pasted in a public place that made [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  everyone stop and stare. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=80.54s)]
*  J.R. has been doing this kind of thing all over the world for the past 14 years. He put [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=82.86s)]
*  the faces of Kenyans on rooftops in a Nairobi slum. In Cuba, where oversized images of Castro [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=89.34s)]
*  and Che are the norm, J.R. put up enormous pictures of everyday people. On New York's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=95.82000000000001s)]
*  sidewalks and Istanbul buildings, in Tunisia during the Arab Spring, an eluded police station, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=101.94000000000001s)]
*  J.R. has pasted his pictures, often without permission and at risk of being arrested. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=108.54s)]
*  We met up with J.R. in a suburb of Paris in front of a giant mural he'd made out of photographs [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=116.02000000000001s)]
*  of more than 700 local residents. We don't know his real name, and that's just how J.R. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=121.38000000000001s)]
*  wants it. In public, he never takes off his glasses or hat. There's a practical reason [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=128.38s)]
*  for it, but a little mystery also builds mystique in the world of art. What we do know is that [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=134.23999999999998s)]
*  J.R. is 35 years old and was born in France, the child of Tunisian immigrants. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't think I've ever done an interview for 60 minutes when I didn't actually know [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=146.0s)]
*  the name of the person I'm interviewing. You're not going to tell me your name. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=149.16s)]
*  We'd need help, you know. I mean, in a lot of countries... [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=154.04s)]
*  It would help me. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=156.64s)]
*  In countries where I got arrested... [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=158.0s)]
*  It's important for you to be anonymous. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=159.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, because unfortunately when I travel in a lot of other countries where what I do, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=161.24s)]
*  just paper and glue, is not considered as art, I get arrested, deported, put in jail. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=166.36s)]
*  What's art in one country is a jailable offense in another. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=171.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=174.8s)]
*  J.R. has been committing jailable offenses since he was a teenager. He says he was repeatedly [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=176.08s)]
*  kicked out of high school and would sneak out at night with friends spray painting graffiti [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=182.12s)]
*  in hard-to-reach areas. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=187.32s)]
*  Graffiti or tagging, what was the appeal of that? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=189.44s)]
*  We all have that sense of I want to exist. I want to show that I'm here, that I'm present. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=192.2s)]
*  Graffiting was saying, I am here. I am a person. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  Exactly. I'm here. I exist. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=201.04s)]
*  His foray into photography began, he says, by accident. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=203.6s)]
*  I found a camera in the subway. A tiny camera. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  You really just found it? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=210.2s)]
*  Yeah, no. It's true. And it's funny because a lot of friends tease me. Yeah, right. You [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=211.2s)]
*  started your career stealing a camera. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm not sure the police would believe that story. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  I know, but you know. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=217.92s)]
*  Some things are true. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=219.88s)]
*  Exactly. At some point I realized I was not the best in graffiti. I had the balls to climb [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=220.88s)]
*  any building you want, but I would not do the craziest piece. But I was with friends [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  who were amazing. Then I realized, wait, let me document the journey. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  The journey of it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=233.0s)]
*  Yeah. And so I went from I exist to they exist. Then I realized the power of that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=234.0s)]
*  Once photography got into the picture, it was about these other people exist. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=237.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=241.32s)]
*  They exist. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=242.32s)]
*  They exist. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=243.32s)]
*  Many of JR's friends in this Paris suburb, whom he began taking pictures of, felt they [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=245.32s)]
*  didn't exist in the eyes of French society. Most of those who live in this neighborhood [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=251.0s)]
*  are of African or Arab descent, first or second generation immigrants, and few wealthy Parisians [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  ever venture here. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=262.08s)]
*  In 2005, riots broke out in this neighborhood after two kids died while being chased by [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=264.08s)]
*  police. The violence spread across France. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=270.4s)]
*  JR saw how the young people in the suburb were being portrayed on television and decided [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=274.68s)]
*  to use his camera to tell a different story. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=279.92s)]
*  You would see the riots. Everyone had hoodies. And then so any kids coming from the suburb [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=283.32s)]
*  would look like a monster to you. So that's when I started photographing them from really [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=288.44s)]
*  close. And I said, I'm going to put your name, your age, your building number on the poster [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=292.4s)]
*  and I'm going to paste it in Paris where they see you as a monster. And actually you're [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  going to play your own caricature. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=299.56s)]
*  Why play your own caricature? Isn't that feeding a stereotype? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=301.36s)]
*  It's actually by feeding it, it breaks it. And I wanted them to be in control of their [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=304.4s)]
*  own image. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=308.84s)]
*  And you wanted people in Paris who maybe had never been to this neighborhood to understand [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=309.6s)]
*  what? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=314.72s)]
*  The humanity, when you look at those faces, makes you want to smile by playing the monster [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=315.24s)]
*  that don't look like a monster anymore. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=319.04s)]
*  JR enlarged the pictures and printed them out and with friends began pasting them up [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=321.24s)]
*  illegally at night around Paris. Most were immediately taken down. But the mayor of one [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=326.0s)]
*  Parisian district gave JR permission to paste them on a wall outside a museum. It was JR's [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=332.2s)]
*  first official public art exhibit. He was 23 years old. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=339.12s)]
*  The people from Paris would go in front of those pictures and take a photo of themselves [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=343.24s)]
*  with them. And people were trying to find who is who and get a photo with them where [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=347.4s)]
*  they're supposed to be the monsters that are about to invade Paris. So it kind of break [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=351.28s)]
*  the tension that there was. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  The idea of breaking tension through photography was a revelation to JR. In 2007, with money [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=358.64s)]
*  saved from odd jobs, he decided to head to Israel. It was after the second Intifada and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=365.34s)]
*  his plan was to paste photographs on the wall separating Palestinians and Israelis in the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  West Bank. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  So I started making a list of people doing the same job on each side, hairdresser, taxi [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=379.71999999999997s)]
*  driver, security guard, teacher, student. And then I would go and I would say, look, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=384.32s)]
*  I want to paste you playing your own caricature of how the other sees you, but I would paste [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=389.2s)]
*  you with the other taxi driver. Oh yeah, sure, yeah, take my photo. But the other guy, he's [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=394.12s)]
*  never going to accept. They're really close-minded. They're never going to accept. When I go there, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=399.4s)]
*  same thing. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=404.0s)]
*  Each person on each side said, I'll do it, but the person on the other side won't do [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=404.52s)]
*  it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=408.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=408.56s)]
*  Before he could begin pasting the photographs, JR and his team were arrested by Israeli authorities [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=409.4s)]
*  for not having a permit. They were loaded into the back of a wagon and hauled off to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=415.08s)]
*  jail. After some questioning, they were released and given 15 days to leave the country. Instead, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=420.52s)]
*  JR went to the Palestinian side of the wall and began to paste. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=428.2s)]
*  I paste a giant photo of the taxi driver and a second photo of the other taxi driver and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=432.47999999999996s)]
*  you know, a crowd of people, very quickly big crowds. And then first guy has a question, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=437.91999999999996s)]
*  but my friend, who is this people? I say, oh, one is Israeli and one is Palestinian. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=442.59999999999997s)]
*  And then you have a big silence on the crowd. And I say, so who is who? And they couldn't [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=449.32s)]
*  even recognize their enemy or their brother. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=454.2s)]
*  On the Israeli side, to ensure he wouldn't be arrested again, JR announced the day and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=459.91999999999996s)]
*  time he was going to put up his photographs. He says so many reporters and onlookers showed [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=464.56s)]
*  up to watch, the authorities decided to just let him go ahead with his project. The attention [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=469.79999999999995s)]
*  he got from his work in the Middle East and France led to some sales of his photographs, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=475.68s)]
*  which then allowed him to begin to travel further afield. Over the next few years in [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=480.96s)]
*  Kenya, Liberia and Sierra Leone, he focused his lens on women, heroes, he says, who are [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=486.15999999999997s)]
*  often treated as second class citizens. He photographed women's faces and placed them [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=492.32s)]
*  where they could no longer be ignored. A Kenyan woman named Elizabeth Kamanga asked JR to [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=497.64s)]
*  paste her picture for all the world to see. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=503.28s)]
*  The woman asked me, make my story travel. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=506.44s)]
*  Have my eyes, have my story travel around the world. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=508.91999999999996s)]
*  There was someone that they never heard of to hear, like sending a bottle in the water. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=512.12s)]
*  Her story did travel thousands of miles around the world. JR pasted her eyes onto a container [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=516.86s)]
*  ship called the Magellan that spent months at sea. In 2008, he ventured into Providencia, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=523.7s)]
*  the oldest favela in Rio, a slum perched on a hillside controlled by a well-armed gang [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=531.38s)]
*  of drug dealers. JR photographed an elderly woman whose grandson was murdered by a rival [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=537.1800000000001s)]
*  gang. She agreed to let him paste her image on the stairs leading into the neighborhood. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=543.02s)]
*  Did you have permission from the gangs? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=548.9s)]
*  From nobody. We start pasting the stairs like that, great vibe, kids playing, you know, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=551.78s)]
*  we're just pasting on the stairs. After 10 stairs, huge fights of gun. And it starts [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=556.3s)]
*  going from all over. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=563.38s)]
*  JR and his team were caught in crossfire between police and gang members. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=567.38s)]
*  We run and we hide, like it's the last day of my life. And the next day we came back [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=574.14s)]
*  and we kept on doing the stairs. And I think that's what made the people in the community [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=579.9399999999999s)]
*  realize that, okay, we're not just here for a minute. And that first time when that woman [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=586.4399999999999s)]
*  was pasted on the stairs, everybody in the community understood what the project was [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=592.22s)]
*  about. It was her, she was standing there straight and looking strong. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=595.86s)]
*  Her photo covered 80 steps. And after that, other residents allowed JR to post their faces [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=600.5s)]
*  and eyes on the sides of their homes. A display of strength and dignity, he says, that could [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=606.9s)]
*  be seen from the wealthier neighborhood below. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=613.02s)]
*  That word dignity to you is important. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=615.9s)]
*  You know, the people made me realize it's important in every single place. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=617.66s)]
*  Dignity is something that all of us want. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=622.64s)]
*  All of us. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=624.38s)]
*  Anywhere. Anywhere. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=624.9399999999999s)]
*  Anywhere. Anywhere in the background. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=625.9399999999999s)]
*  Why? Because the issues people are facing are life and death. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=626.9399999999999s)]
*  Of course. Dignity goes through the way we've been seen by the others, the way we portrayed [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=629.5799999999999s)]
*  ourselves. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=634.78s)]
*  I think some people hearing that are going to say, look, you're telling me that people [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=635.34s)]
*  who don't know where their next meal is coming from are struggling to survive care about [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=639.42s)]
*  art? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=643.74s)]
*  You know what? Yes. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=644.8199999999999s)]
*  If you're wondering how JR pays for all these projects, so were we. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=647.18s)]
*  He now has a team of about 16 people working for him out of studios in Paris and New York. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=652.34s)]
*  He doesn't like to give details of how much his projects cost, but some of the money comes [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=659.5s)]
*  from the sale of limited edition prints of his work. He doesn't accept any sponsorship [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=664.1s)]
*  from corporations, but he does have wealthy art patrons who help him out. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=669.86s)]
*  There's amazing people out there. There's people that support me. There's someone that [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=674.3000000000001s)]
*  gave me a building to put my studio that I don't pay rent so I don't have to look for [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=677.9399999999999s)]
*  sponsors. There are amazing people that I call the shadow philanthropists, the people [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=681.1s)]
*  who really want to change. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=686.38s)]
*  Shadow philanthropists. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=687.98s)]
*  Yeah. And that don't look for return. They don't get into philanthropy to get more credit. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=688.8199999999999s)]
*  JR's work may focus on other people, but it's also made him a celebrity in his own right. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=696.02s)]
*  He has more than a million followers on Instagram and routinely is seen in the company of rock [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=702.1s)]
*  stars and other artists. Last month, a documentary JR directed called Faces Places was nominated [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=706.9399999999999s)]
*  for an Oscar. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=713.66s)]
*  Fame has its benefits. JR doesn't always have to sneak around now. He's often allowed to [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=716.18s)]
*  display his work. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=721.86s)]
*  So when were you doing the work inside? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=723.22s)]
*  A few months ago on Ellis Island in New York Harbor, the National Park Service let him [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=725.06s)]
*  paste old photographs of immigrants at this abandoned hospital. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=729.4599999999999s)]
*  That's the leader girl. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=733.38s)]
*  And what does it mean? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=734.42s)]
*  You know, I just try to do art in places that it would raise questions right up to give [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=735.58s)]
*  answers. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=741.58s)]
*  JR is now encouraging others to raise questions by pasting their own photographs. He has a [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=743.38s)]
*  website where groups of people with an idea or a cause can send in their pictures. He [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=749.06s)]
*  says he'll enlarge and print them and ship them back. JR-inspired images have so far [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=754.66s)]
*  been pasted on walls in dozens of countries around the world. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=760.7s)]
*  Are you still an artist if you're not taking the photo and you're just printing stuff [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=765.38s)]
*  up and sending it out to people and they're putting it up? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=769.98s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, I am. As much as a printer, I'm a photographer, and I'm a wallpaper man. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=772.74s)]
*  You're a wallpaper man. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=778.74s)]
*  At the end of the day, I wallpaper buildings, you know. That's what I do. So that's why [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=780.74s)]
*  I think the title artist is the most prestigious title I'll ever get because, you know, the [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=785.54s)]
*  truth is I paste building. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=790.54s)]
*  Mark Bradford is widely considered one of the most important and influential artists [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=795.38s)]
*  in America today. His abstract canvases, which often deal with complex social and political [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=816.86s)]
*  issues, hang in major museums around the world and on the walls of big collectors and some [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=822.5400000000001s)]
*  small ones like me. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=828.1s)]
*  Bradford's art may look like paintings, but there's hardly any paint on them. They're [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=830.58s)]
*  made out of layers and layers of paper, which he tears, glues, power washes and sands in [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=834.6600000000001s)]
*  a style all his own. When he began making art in his 30s, Bradford couldn't afford [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=840.82s)]
*  expensive paint, so he started experimenting with end papers that are used for styling [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=846.26s)]
*  hair. He got the idea while working as a hair stylist in his mom's beauty shop in South [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=851.34s)]
*  Los Angeles. He was broke, struggling, and didn't sell his first painting until he was [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=857.02s)]
*  nearly 40. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=862.58s)]
*  I heard a story that when you sold your first artwork in 2001, you called up your mom. Do [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=865.02s)]
*  you remember what you said to her? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=870.14s)]
*  I said, girl, I think I found a way out of the beauty shop. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=871.78s)]
*  Girl, I think I found a way out of the beauty shop, yeah. Yeah, because I had no idea how [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=877.14s)]
*  I was going to stop being a hairstylist because that's really the only thing that I knew. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=881.14s)]
*  I didn't have a problem with being a hairstylist, but that's all I knew. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=885.02s)]
*  It's incredible to think that 2001 is when you first sold a work. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=889.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=893.14s)]
*  And now- [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=894.14s)]
*  I still sell works. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=895.14s)]
*  Yeah, you sure do. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=896.14s)]
*  I sure do. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=897.14s)]
*  This is the top. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=899.54s)]
*  No! [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=901.54s)]
*  His first painting sold for $5,000. Now they can sell for more than $10 million. This new [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=902.54s)]
*  one was bought by the Broad Museum in Los Angeles. They have nine other Bradfords in their collection. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=908.74s)]
*  One, two, three. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=914.14s)]
*  It's called Deep Blue. It's 12 feet high, 50 feet long, and took a full day to install. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=917.14s)]
*  That's all right. That is all right. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=923.74s)]
*  None of those colors you see are paint. It's all paper layered on canvas. It's abstract, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=927.54s)]
*  but not entirely. See those lines that form a grid? It's a street map of the Watts neighborhood [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=933.8399999999999s)]
*  in Los Angeles. The colored balls show where properties were damaged in 1965 after six [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=939.74s)]
*  days of violent civil unrest, protests over police brutality, and racial inequality. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=946.24s)]
*  We first saw the painting nearly a year ago when Bradford had just started working on [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=954.34s)]
*  it in his studio in South Los Angeles. He'd already made the map of Watts out of bathroom [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=959.08s)]
*  caulking. The following month, when we stopped by again, he'd laid down 14 layers of colored [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=964.64s)]
*  paper and covered it all up with a layer of black. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=971.12s)]
*  So there's a map underneath here? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=974.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=976.64s)]
*  Of Watts? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=977.64s)]
*  All these little points are what was looted, what was destroyed. So I kind of start from [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=978.64s)]
*  a map and then on top of it, I think I lay art history and my imagination, all three. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=984.56s)]
*  Bradford uses household tools to make his paintings. He likes to buy everything at [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=994.56s)]
*  Home Depot. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=999.54s)]
*  My motto is if Home Depot didn't have it, Mark Bradford didn't use it. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1000.96s)]
*  That's your motto. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1004.64s)]
*  That's my motto. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1005.64s)]
*  To this day, is that it? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1006.64s)]
*  To this day. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1007.64s)]
*  Building up the layers of paper on the canvas is just the beginning of his process. He then [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1008.64s)]
*  starts to peel, cut, and sand them down, which can take months. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1014.96s)]
*  It's like an archeological dig. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1020.4s)]
*  It is like an archeological dig. It's like history. I'm creating my own archeological [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1021.8s)]
*  or psychological digs. Sometimes when I'm digging on my own painting, I'm asking myself, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1026.24s)]
*  Exactly what are you digging for? Where are you? Where do you want to go, child? Oh, see, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1032.28s)]
*  look, look at that. See? Now see that? I like. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1038.44s)]
*  A lot of people get an abstract painting and think it's squiggles, it's torn paper. I don't [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1041.8799999999999s)]
*  understand it. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1046.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. But for me, those squiggles and torn paper gives me a space to kind of [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1047.96s)]
*  unpack things like the Watts Riots. I'm grappling with how I feel about that subject and that [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1057.0s)]
*  material. I do grapple with things. I grapple with things personally and, you know, racially [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1064.6s)]
*  and politically. What does it mean to be me? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1070.96s)]
*  Mark Bradford has been grappling with that question in his art for the last 18 years, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1074.32s)]
*  from making paintings out of street posters, like those offering predatory loans in low-income [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1079.68s)]
*  neighborhoods, to creating works that address HIV AIDS, racism, and the complexity of American [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1084.76s)]
*  history. He's 57 years old now and at six foot eight stands out in a crowd. He still [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1091.48s)]
*  lives in South Los Angeles where he grew up. When he was eight, he says he began to get [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1097.8s)]
*  bullied by neighborhood kids. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1102.96s)]
*  That was the first time I felt different. That was the first time I was aware of my [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1105.08s)]
*  That's the first time someone said, oh, you're a sissy. I definitely knew that I had to learn [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1110.2s)]
*  to navigate in a more cautious way so that I could survive. I just never had a problem [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1116.16s)]
*  being me. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1121.48s)]
*  So even though people, they were calling you a sissy, it didn't make you want to try to [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1122.48s)]
*  change yourself. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1125.32s)]
*  Not really. No, not really. I just didn't want to get my ass whooped. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1126.32s)]
*  He was raised by his mother, Janice Banks, who owned her own beauty salon. That's where [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1130.92s)]
*  Bradford would head every day after school. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1135.52s)]
*  I knew that I had to find a way to get across the schoolyard. I knew that my mother was [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1138.72s)]
*  always going to be there once I got across the schoolyard. And maybe, maybe I was in [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1143.4s)]
*  the hair salon every day watching women get across the schoolyard. I would hear their [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1148.76s)]
*  stories. I would watch them go through and I just thought if they can do it, I most certainly [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1154.3600000000001s)]
*  can do it. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1160.32s)]
*  Mark Bradford started working in the salon as a teenager, eventually becoming a hairstylist. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1161.72s)]
*  It was a safe place where he could be himself. But that feeling disappeared in 1981 when [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1167.52s)]
*  his friends began dying from AIDS. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1174.0s)]
*  I knew a storm was coming. I knew that. In the gut, I knew that. And people were just [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1176.56s)]
*  dying. That's what it felt like to me at 18 years old. I just was thinking, how are [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1182.2s)]
*  we going to make it through? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1187.12s)]
*  Did you think you would make it through? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1188.8799999999999s)]
*  No. No. I didn't think I'd make it through. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1190.48s)]
*  Knowing he didn't have a future, he didn't plan for one. But when he was nearly 30, he [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1194.24s)]
*  took art classes at a junior college and he says it clicked. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1198.72s)]
*  It was the reading and learning about different scholars and feminism and deconstructing modernism [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1203.1200000000001s)]
*  and all that. I was just, oh man, I'm really into this. I'm not exactly sure what it is. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1211.1200000000001s)]
*  But it just, yeah. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1216.8s)]
*  And you'd still work at the hair salon? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1219.0s)]
*  Oh, every day. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1220.24s)]
*  And so you'd be studying while at the hair salon? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1221.48s)]
*  Absolutely. I'd put the book in their lap and say, girl, read that back to me. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1223.5600000000002s)]
*  He won a scholarship to the California Institute of the Arts, but struggled to make money as [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1228.1200000000001s)]
*  an artist. When he was 39, he finally had a breakthrough. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1232.88s)]
*  I was working on a head. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1237.48s)]
*  Working on a head. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1238.48s)]
*  Working on a head. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1239.48s)]
*  At the beauty salon. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1240.48s)]
*  At the beauty salon, yeah. Because I was still working the hair salon. I told you that. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1241.48s)]
*  I just didn't know that terminology. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1244.6000000000001s)]
*  I was hooking it up. Late at night, I was tired as hell too. And it's just the end papers [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1246.76s)]
*  fell on the floor. And I looked down and said, oh, they're translucent. Oh. Oh, I could use [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1252.8s)]
*  these. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1258.6799999999998s)]
*  End papers are small, rectangular tissues used to make permanent waves in hair. Bradford [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1259.6799999999998s)]
*  began burning the paper's edges and lining them up into grids he glued onto bedsheets. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1265.52s)]
*  I knew I was onto something. I knew this was bridging. This material came from a site outside [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1271.28s)]
*  of the paint store. I think early on, I was trying to weave these two sides of who I was [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1278.48s)]
*  together. The art world and the sites that I had come from, the life that I had led, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1283.88s)]
*  I didn't want to leave any of it behind. I didn't want to edit out anything. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1289.3600000000001s)]
*  Private collectors began snapping up his end paper paintings and his career took off. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1292.92s)]
*  He's now a celebrity in the art world. And his gallery openings are star-studded events. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1298.92s)]
*  How are you? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1306.64s)]
*  At the latest one in Los Angeles, Beyonce and Jay-Z, who own several Bradfords, stopped [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1307.88s)]
*  in. The ten paintings in this exhibition sold out before the gallery doors opened. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1313.24s)]
*  Look how nice this is. Wow, it's gorgeous. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1320.16s)]
*  Bradford and his partner more than 20 years, Alan DeCastro, are committed to using contemporary [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1323.96s)]
*  art and their own money to revitalize the neighborhood Bradford grew up in. In 2014, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1328.88s)]
*  they opened Art and Practice with Eileen Harris Norton, the first collector to buy Bradford's [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1335.64s)]
*  work. It's a nonprofit complex of buildings that includes a gallery, lecture spaces, and [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1341.24s)]
*  his mother's old beauty salon. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1347.16s)]
*  This is the last hair salon that my mom worked in and then I took it over from her. It was [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1349.4s)]
*  in the 90s. It was called Foxy Hair. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1353.6000000000001s)]
*  They turned Foxy Hair into a center for young adults transitioning out of foster care. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1357.0s)]
*  I would run down the block in here and buy myself whatever I needed to put back on the [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1362.6s)]
*  hair. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1367.6399999999999s)]
*  But we were surprised to learn that Mark Bradford still styles hair. He does it for some of [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1368.6399999999999s)]
*  his former clients from the beauty shop, who are also among his closest friends. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1373.0s)]
*  When you look around, does his art make sense to you? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1377.3999999999999s)]
*  It does. It's like a map of space. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1380.0s)]
*  I mean, I look at it, it's beautiful, but I don't really get it. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1384.0s)]
*  He gave me something from his studio a long time ago and I put it in my garage. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1388.48s)]
*  Yes you did. Wow. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1394.32s)]
*  I put it in my garage. This was before he got popular, I guess. And it's all torn up. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1395.32s)]
*  And this guy was like, you know, you have something like a Mona Lisa. I'm like, for [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1403.24s)]
*  real? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1406.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1407.84s)]
*  Y'all wrong for that. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1408.84s)]
*  I don't see it. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1409.84s)]
*  You don't see it? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1410.84s)]
*  I don't. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1411.84s)]
*  I don't. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1413.1999999999998s)]
*  But I like how you give a little insight of what's going on in our community. I know that [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1414.1999999999998s)]
*  much about your art. So that much I really like. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1420.72s)]
*  Bradford's latest work continues to focus on difficult and controversial issues. This [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1424.56s)]
*  painting, which is prominently displayed in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, is called [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1429.48s)]
*  150 Portrait Tone and was made in response to the 2016 fatal police shooting of Philando [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1434.1599999999999s)]
*  Castile during a traffic stop in Minnesota. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1441.16s)]
*  He was trying to get out his ID and his wallet out his pocket and he let the officer know. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1444.36s)]
*  Castile's girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, live streamed the incident. Bradford was so haunted [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1451.08s)]
*  by her words, he made them into this painting. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1456.12s)]
*  Please don't tell me this, Lord. Please Jesus don't tell me that he's gone. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1459.6s)]
*  It's really the conversation that his girlfriend is having. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1463.98s)]
*  With multiple people, which I was fascinated by. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1467.0s)]
*  Why were you fascinated by? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1470.2s)]
*  How composed she was. She was having a conversation with her daughter in the back seat, with Philando, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1471.44s)]
*  who was passing away, with God, with us, Facebook, and with the policemen, all simultaneously. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1477.64s)]
*  It was visual and textual and heartbreaking and heroic and strong all at the same time. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1487.0800000000002s)]
*  In another major new work, Bradford turned his gaze to the Civil War. It's called Pickett's [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1495.0s)]
*  Charge and it's a reimagining of a pivotal Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1500.52s)]
*  It was commissioned by the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1505.92s)]
*  Bradford used as his starting point blown up photos of a 19th century panoramic painting [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1511.0s)]
*  of Pickett's Charge, a painting which offers a romanticized view of the Confederacy. He [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1516.16s)]
*  then added layers of paper and cords over it, then carefully gouged, shredded, and ripped it apart. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1521.76s)]
*  They almost feel like lacerations, almost scarring. That's what those feel like. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1528.72s)]
*  And a little bit like bullet wounds, like it really punctures. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1533.44s)]
*  It's a 360 degree painting that raises many questions in Bradford's mind, particularly [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1537.6s)]
*  about how we look at history. It's looking at it through a different lens. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1543.24s)]
*  Yes, that's the feeling that I wanted you to have, that history was laying on top of it, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1547.44s)]
*  gouging into it, erasing it, bits of it showing. It's kind of me kind of revising it. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1552.16s)]
*  So is this a more accurate representation of history? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1561.36s)]
*  I don't really believe history is ever fully accurate. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1564.72s)]
*  It's acknowledging that. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1567.72s)]
*  It's acknowledging the gaps, the things we don't know. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1568.92s)]
*  So many people have come to see Pickett's Charge. The Hirshhorn has extended the exhibition [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1572.48s)]
*  for three more years. Bradford is already working on new paintings for shows in China, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1577.44s)]
*  London, and New York. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1585.0s)]
*  Do you worry about the vagaries of the art world? What is popular today, 20 years from now? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1587.24s)]
*  Oh no, no, no, no. I wouldn't have, no. I have never... [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1592.64s)]
*  I mean, art has value because people believe it has value. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1596.32s)]
*  No, I think art has value because it has value. I'm not going to wait for somebody else to [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1599.32s)]
*  tell me my work has value. I certainly wasn't going to wait on people to tell me I had value. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1603.6s)]
*  I'd probably still be waiting. I'd just... It has value because I think it has value. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1607.92s)]
*  And then if other people get on the value, you know, Mark Bradford value train, great. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1613.68s)]
*  Over the years, we've done stories on all sorts of people. But to our knowledge, we have never [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1629.84s)]
*  done one on a late middle-aged man who dresses in biker gear with visible tattoos and sterling [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1634.8s)]
*  silver skull rings. And certainly not one who also happens to be fluent in French and advanced [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1641.2s)]
*  mathematics. No, Peter Marino is one of a kind. If you follow the worlds of art, architecture, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1647.6s)]
*  and high fashion, you probably know he is a serious player in all of them. A taste maker [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1654.32s)]
*  for some of the richest, most sophisticated people in the world. Many of whom would agree [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1660.0s)]
*  Marino's appearance is actually one of the least interesting things about him. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1665.76s)]
*  At first glance, you might mistake him for the bouncer at a leather bar, a professional wrestler, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1672.24s)]
*  or the front man for a village people tribute band. But here in Paris, at a reception for the [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1677.6s)]
*  Biennale, one of the oldest art and antique fairs in the world, Peter Marino is instantly recognized [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1683.52s)]
*  and actively courted by people you might think would run the other way. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1696.0s)]
*  But behind the threatening keep your distance façade [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1702.56s)]
*  Monsieur, vous n'avez expliqué tout. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1705.52s)]
*  How about the older statement, don't judge a book by its cover. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1735.52s)]
*  But you want people to judge it by this look. This is your look. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1739.52s)]
*  Absolutely not. It's a decoy. A decoy. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1742.8799999999999s)]
*  Sure. Would you think you're talking to a bright architect looking at a guy like me? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1746.0s)]
*  You still know calculus and trig and all of that stuff? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1750.08s)]
*  Had to. Had to get my license and you got to keep your license up to date. You have to take 18 [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1752.96s)]
*  credits a year. That's the hardest part. You got to keep taking courses, dude. They don't let you [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1756.96s)]
*  forget it. Yeah. The arts and fashion worlds have always had a high tolerance for eccentricity. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1761.68s)]
*  Take Tom Wolfe in his white suits, Karl Lagerfeld's dark glasses and fingerless gloves, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1768.5600000000002s)]
*  and Lady Gaga. There is no question that Marino's signature look has made him one of a handful of [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1774.72s)]
*  living architects actually recognized by the media. One of your good friends said that you'd like the [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1782.5600000000002s)]
*  shock value. Like you'd like the fact that people say, what's with him? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1788.08s)]
*  I like more the fact that I like to think out of the box. Thinking out of the box goes along [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1794.3999999999999s)]
*  with dressing out of the box and living out of the box. If you want to come up with a really original [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1798.8799999999999s)]
*  design idea and you want to capture a whole new design direction, perhaps the best way [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1804.3999999999999s)]
*  to arrive at that is not by acting and thinking and doing like everybody else. That's all. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1811.04s)]
*  If the getup was simply a publicity gimmick, Marino would have disappeared decades ago. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1817.1200000000001s)]
*  His work would not be regularly featured in Architectural Digest and other glossy magazines. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1822.64s)]
*  The firm that bears his name would not be occupying two floors and 16,000 square feet of some of the [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1828.72s)]
*  most expensive office space in New York, which is furnished with museum quality artwork, all for [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1835.84s)]
*  Marino's private collection. Paintings and sculpture, modern art and antiquities, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1842.32s)]
*  all juxtaposed in perfect harmony. This is quite a room, quite a reception area. What is this piece? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1848.24s)]
*  This is 2003 Anselm Kiefer. And this? This is Gandharan, third century AD. Gandharan? Yeah, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1856.6399999999999s)]
*  it's from Gandhara and it's the region just on the Silk Road where the Chinese culture and the [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1863.9199999999998s)]
*  Indian culture just met with the Greek culture. Art is at the center of Marino's universe and his [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1869.6s)]
*  knowledge of it is encyclopedic. He not only collects it, he curates it and commissions it [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1875.1999999999998s)]
*  for his projects. It covers nearly every inch of wall space and is here, he says, not to impress [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1880.7199999999998s)]
*  his clients, but to inspire the staff of 150 designers and architects with whom he turns out [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1887.4399999999998s)]
*  between 50 and 100 projects a year. Design wise, I look at everything. If I don't personally design [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1893.6s)]
*  it, I'll review it. I'm the kind of creative director of the firm. You're a bit of a control [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1899.76s)]
*  freak. You'd have to ask the staff for that. Bordering on the tyrannical? You'd have to [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1904.9599999999998s)]
*  confirm that with the staff. Do you see yourself as a tyrannical boss? No, I only care about the work [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1911.04s)]
*  and I am not tyrannical personally in any way shape or form, but I am absolutely passionate [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1919.2800000000002s)]
*  about the quality of the work. And so are the clients that can afford him, who mostly come from [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1925.92s)]
*  the world's wealthiest one hundredth of one percent, encompassing the Glitterati and the [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1931.8400000000001s)]
*  Amarati. This is a residential project we're building on the top of Los Angeles. It's a large [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1937.2800000000002s)]
*  site assembled from over seven homes and this is in construction. And what is this structure? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1942.88s)]
*  This is for the subterranean parking. And this is a private home? This is a private home. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1948.5600000000002s)]
*  And you, can you tell us anything about the owner? No. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1955.7600000000002s)]
*  It's Marino's default answer. He won't comment about his clients, which have reportedly included [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1960.0800000000002s)]
*  the likes of multi-billionaires David Geffen and David Koch, as well as Giselle Bündchen and Tom [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1965.2800000000002s)]
*  Brady. This home in Milan, we're told, was done for Giorgio Armani. I like my clients, all of my [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1972.4s)]
*  clients say, you do your talented, but your best virtue is your discretion. They really don't want [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1980.5600000000002s)]
*  to be talked about. This Hamptons beach house was designed for a young hedge fund manager and his [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1986.4s)]
*  wife in this ski chalet in Lebanon with ocean views for a Swiss banker. But for every private [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=1992.0800000000002s)]
*  client Marino won't speak about, somewhere in the world he is unveiling a project that is the talk [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2000.32s)]
*  of the town. Like Boon the Shop, a multi-brand luxury shopping center that takes up two downtown [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2005.9199999999998s)]
*  blocks in Seoul, South Korea. No expense was spared. It's all white Greek marble. These are [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2013.9199999999998s)]
*  trapezoids, like they fell to space. It's an interesting building because the entire [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2021.2s)]
*  inside is rough concrete. He says it was built for the family that controls Samsung. It's [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2025.84s)]
*  fair to say you work with some of the richest people in the world, right? Yes. Did they need [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2032.1599999999999s)]
*  to be treated a different way? If they need to be treated a different way, no one's told me. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2036.8799999999999s)]
*  I remember when I was meeting certain royal families, if I had to behave a certain way, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2044.8799999999999s)]
*  like you better tell me what I'm supposed to say and do. They went, the way you look, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2054.96s)]
*  it doesn't really matter, just be yourself. I went, okay, okay. Those partnerships can produce [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2059.76s)]
*  some unusual optics. We watched this meeting with Sydney Toledano, the CEO of Christian Dior, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2066.2400000000002s)]
*  who is one of Marino's biggest clients and biggest fans. They have collaborated on dozens of Dior [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2072.8s)]
*  boutiques all over the world. Toledano is used to working with big egos and difficult people, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2079.44s)]
*  but says Marino is not one of them. I never had the impression that it was complicated because [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2085.68s)]
*  he always find the solution and he's very professional. How important is it to your [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2092.16s)]
*  business or how important has he been to your business? He has been key. Don't tell him. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2096.88s)]
*  He understands Dior. He understands Dior. Toledano sees Marino's look as an artistic [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2102.08s)]
*  presentation of his personality. He doesn't even mind the fact that Marino also works [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2108.0s)]
*  for most of his competitors. This is a new building. We'll be building for Chanel. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2113.6s)]
*  So you've got Chanel up here. You've got Louis Vuitton. Who else? Dior, Hublot, Zegna. We do [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2117.52s)]
*  Zegna worldwide. We do Bulgari. We're opening a new one in London in December. Fendi, if you just saw [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2125.76s)]
*  the Fendi on 57th in Madison. For decades, Marino has been the architect of choice for nearly all [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2133.28s)]
*  of the top fashion designers and luxury brands and is widely credited with reimagining the use of [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2139.76s)]
*  retail space, moving away from boxy department stores and into elegant boutiques. His work [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2145.92s)]
*  lines the most conspicuous avenues and boulevards of the world. It's a third of his business. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2153.28s)]
*  Every store is unique and each one distills the essence and the look of the company it was built [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2158.8s)]
*  for. A sense of travel and luxury for Louis Vuitton, the timeless classic look for Chanel. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2164.32s)]
*  How did you get them to all come to you? It's the old questions. They had a why do they all go to [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2171.52s)]
*  you? Steve, would you go to a knee doctor who had done two knee operations if you need an operation, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2176.4s)]
*  a one who had done 300 successfully? Who would you go to? That's why they come to me. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2181.92s)]
*  Marino's work ethic and personality are rooted in Queens, the New York neighborhood where he was [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2189.28s)]
*  born 67 years ago, the only son in a middle-class Italian family. In high school, he excelled in [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2194.88s)]
*  art and graduated from Cornell University in 1971 with a degree in architecture. He learned the [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2202.2400000000002s)]
*  trade from the very best, serving apprenticeships with IM Pei and Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2209.28s)]
*  But he picked up the ways of the wealthy and the value of celebrity from another master, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2215.76s)]
*  artist Andy Warhol, who always considered business one of the finer forms of art. He certainly knew [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2220.6400000000003s)]
*  how to get attention. The blonde wig, dude that was so good. The blonde wig, it's pretty hard to [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2226.8s)]
*  Marino did some early work for Warhol and hung out at his New York studio called the factory, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2234.88s)]
*  which was a magnet for music and movie stars, socialites and royalty. Bob Colacello was the [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2240.16s)]
*  editor of Warhol's interview magazine when Marino first walked through the door. And what was he [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2246.4s)]
*  like? He had little bow ties and he was very properly dressed. You know, when he was funny, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2251.6s)]
*  he was talented. You could see that right away. Colacello, now a contributing editor at Vanity [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2258.32s)]
*  Fair magazine and Isabelle Ratazzi, the former model and longtime friend of Marino, think he [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2264.7200000000003s)]
*  has changed very little from those ironic factory days of Campbell soup cans and pop art parodies [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2270.6400000000003s)]
*  of fame. Peter fed right into that. I mean, we were all on the same sort of wavelength, you know, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2276.88s)]
*  tongue in cheek, tongue in cheek. A lot of what we were doing was very tongue in cheek. And Peter, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2282.6400000000003s)]
*  I think is still very tongue in cheek. Totally. He's enjoying it. It's a way to have fun [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2286.48s)]
*  at other people's expenses sometimes. I think Peter deep down, more than anything, is an artist. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2292.2400000000002s)]
*  He has an incredible sense of aesthetics. He loves beauty and anything in art and music. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2299.76s)]
*  It's on display at Marino's 12 acre estate where every summer there is a lavish party for friends [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2308.72s)]
*  to introduce young and up and coming classical musicians. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2315.04s)]
*  It's hosted by Peter and Jane Trapnell, his waspy wife of 33 years, a charming and accomplished [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2322.08s)]
*  costume designer who friends say is an essential part of the equation. She's too smart to be [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2329.04s)]
*  interviewed. But you've been married a long time. 33 years. That's great. Don't look like the perfect [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2334.56s)]
*  couple, if you know what I mean. It's a good marriage because each of us is what we are, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2343.2s)]
*  allows the other one to be themself and appreciates each other for the right reason. You know, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2351.68s)]
*  it's rare that you'll find people who don't try to change the other person and [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2356.7999999999997s)]
*  let everyone be what they are. What's this? The only other constant in Marino's life, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2363.9199999999996s)]
*  as you may have guessed, are motorcycles, his latest prominently displayed on the project board. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2369.68s)]
*  This is my Super Duke KTM 1290. It's very fast. You're supposed to say, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2375.44s)]
*  does Jane sit on the back? Does Jane sit on the back? Absolutely not. She's in the back of a [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2381.68s)]
*  car and driver and she's with the two dogs. Marino finds cars claustrophobic. He has a half a dozen [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2387.2s)]
*  bikes, has ridden them all over the country and regularly uses them to commute between New York [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2396.08s)]
*  and his home on Long Island. It's his release and the core of his identity. Alone on the road, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2401.12s)]
*  where he can take in the air and the light and the space, all part of living life outside the box. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZUQffi0pI&t=2407.84s)]
