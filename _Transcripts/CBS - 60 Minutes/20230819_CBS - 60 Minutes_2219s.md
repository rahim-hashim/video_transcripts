**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [August 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk)
*  Charlie and Carol Gasco were an elderly couple who moved to Santa Monica, California sometime [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=0.0s)]
*  in early 1997 to begin a new phase of their life. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=19.34s)]
*  For the next 14 years, they did almost nothing that was memorable, and they would be of absolutely [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=23.36s)]
*  no interest if it weren't for the fact that Charlie Gasco turned out to be James Whitey [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=28.44s)]
*  Bulger, the notorious Boston gangster and longtime fugitive who's just beginning to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=33.52s)]
*  serve two lifetime sentences. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=38.8s)]
*  Carol Gasco was actually Catherine Gregg, Whitey's longtime girlfriend and caregiver. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  The story of how they managed to elude an international manhunt for so long while hiding [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=46.82s)]
*  in plain sight is interesting. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=51.36s)]
*  Tonight you'll hear it from the Gasco's neighbors and for the first time from the federal agents [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=53.84s)]
*  who finally unraveled the case with the help of a boob job and an alley cat. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=58.34s)]
*  If you're forced into retirement with a comfortable nest egg and a desire to be left completely [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=64.46000000000001s)]
*  alone, there is no better place than Santa Monica, California. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=69.5s)]
*  This low-key, seaside suburb of LA is shared by transients and tourists, hippies and hedonists, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  celebrities and lots of senior citizens attracted to the climate and an abundance of inexpensive [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=80.42s)]
*  rent-controlled apartments just a few blocks from the ocean. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=86.82s)]
*  Places like the Princess Eugenia on 3rd Street, which is where Charlie and Carol Gasco, a [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=90.58s)]
*  childless couple from Chicago, lived for 14 years without attracting much attention from [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=96.5s)]
*  longtime neighbors or landlords. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=101.46s)]
*  Josh Bond is the building manager. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=104.02s)]
*  What were they like? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=105.69999999999999s)]
*  They were like the nice, retired old couple that lived in the apartment next to me. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=107.17999999999999s)]
*  Good tenants? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=111.5s)]
*  Excellent tenants. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=112.5s)]
*  Never complained, always paid rent on time. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=113.5s)]
*  And cash? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=115.94s)]
*  And cash. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=116.94s)]
*  Janice Goodwin lived down the hole. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=117.94s)]
*  They had nothing and they never went out. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=119.89999999999999s)]
*  They never had food delivered. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=122.78s)]
*  She never dressed nicely. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=124.62s)]
*  You thought they were poor? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=126.86s)]
*  Yes, without a doubt. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=128.14s)]
*  The one thing everyone remembers about the Gasco's is that they loved animals and always [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=129.98s)]
*  made a fuss over the ones in the neighborhood. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=134.57999999999998s)]
*  Barbara Gluck remembers that Carol Gasco always fed a stray cat after its owner had died. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=137.1s)]
*  She would, you know, pet it and be sweet to it and then she would put a plate of food [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=143.18s)]
*  like out here. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=149.66s)]
*  And she liked the cat? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=151.74s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=153.22s)]
*  She loved the cat. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=154.22s)]
*  And we all liked the cat, but she was taking care of the cat. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=156.26000000000002s)]
*  And what about Charlie Gasco? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=159.38s)]
*  You know, he always had a hat on and dark glasses. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=161.10000000000002s)]
*  I have to say it was mysterious to me why a lovely woman like that was hanging out with [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=165.54000000000002s)]
*  that guy, that old grumpy man. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=173.54000000000002s)]
*  I never could figure that one out until I heard they had 800,000 something dollars in [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=175.06s)]
*  the wall. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=181.26000000000002s)]
*  And then I went, oh, okay. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=182.26000000000002s)]
*  Money wasn't the only thing found in the Gasco's apartment on June 22, 2011, when the FBI stopped [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=187.62s)]
*  by and ended what it called the most extensive manhunt in the Bureau's history. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=194.42000000000002s)]
*  Weapons all over the apartment. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=199.70000000000002s)]
*  Weapons by his nightstand, weapons under the window sill, shotguns, mini-rugers, rifles. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=201.14s)]
*  Loaded. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=206.22s)]
*  Loaded, ready to go. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=207.22s)]
*  What had started out as a routine day for Special Agent Scott Garriola, who is in charge [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=208.98s)]
*  of hunting fugitives in L.A., would turn into one of the most interesting days of his career. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=213.92s)]
*  After getting a call to stake out a building in Santa Monica, he notified his backup team [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=219.38s)]
*  with the LAPD. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=223.82s)]
*  I had four guys working that day and they said, we got a tip on Whitey Bulger and I'll [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=224.82s)]
*  see you there in about an hour. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=230.16s)]
*  And invariably the techs will return, who's Whitey Bulger? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=232.36s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  A few of them. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  I had to remind them, gently remind them who Whitey Bulger was. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  That he was number one on the FBI's most wanted list? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=240.76s)]
*  Number one, yeah. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=243.04s)]
*  Big East Coast figure, but in the West Coast not so much. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=245.36s)]
*  The cops in L.A. were focused on gang bangers and cartel members, not some retired Irish [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=249.36s)]
*  mobster who hadn't been spotted in 16 years. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  But then few mobsters have ever been as infamous in the city as Whitey Bulger was in Boston. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=258.34s)]
*  And his reputation was for more than just being grumpy. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=263.97999999999996s)]
*  Besides extortion and flooding the city with cocaine, Bulger routinely performed or ordered [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=267.41999999999996s)]
*  executions. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=273.09999999999997s)]
*  Some at close range, some with a hail of bullets, and at least one by strangulation, after which [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=274.5s)]
*  it's said he took a nap. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  Special Agent Rich Tien, who ran the FBI's Whitey Bulger Fugitive Task Force, had heard [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=282.29999999999995s)]
*  it all. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=287.08s)]
*  Whitey Bulger was charged with 19 counts of murder. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=288.32s)]
*  He was charged with other crimes. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=290.64s)]
*  He was a scourge to the society in South Boston, his own community. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  He was also a scourge to the FBI and a great source of embarrassment to Tien, Special Agent [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=298.02s)]
*  Phil Torsny, and others on the FBI task force. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=303.62s)]
*  Years earlier, Whitey Bulger had infiltrated the Boston office of the FBI and bought off [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  agents who protected him and plied him with information, including the tip that allowed [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=312.9s)]
*  Bulger to flee just days before he was to be indicted. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=317.9s)]
*  We really had to catch this guy to establish credibility after all the other issues. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=321.53999999999996s)]
*  And it was just a matter of bringing this guy back to Boston to make sure this guy didn't [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=327.34s)]
*  die or get away with this thing. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=330.73999999999995s)]
*  Torsny, who's now retired and Agent Tommy McDonald, joined the task force in 2009. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=334.9s)]
*  The joke was, Bulger was on the FBI's least wanted list. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=340.8s)]
*  There hadn't been a credible lead in more than a decade, and their efforts in Bulger's [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=344.68s)]
*  old neighborhood of South Boston were met with mistrust and ridicule. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=348.68s)]
*  Some people, they told us right out front, you guys aren't looking for that guy. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=353.0s)]
*  People just made the assumption we had him stashed somewhere. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=356.54s)]
*  People really thought that kind of thing. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=359.44s)]
*  Despite that mindset that we're not going to help you, the FBI still got it done. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=361.04s)]
*  Took 16 years. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=367.0s)]
*  Took 16 years. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=368.0s)]
*  Yeah, this was not a typical fugitive. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=369.2s)]
*  The FBI says Bulger had planned his getaway years in advance, with money set aside and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=372.2s)]
*  a fake identity for a Thomas Baxter. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=377.36s)]
*  During his first two years on the lam, Bulger was in touch with friends and family, shuttling [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=380.72s)]
*  between New York, Chicago, and the resort town of Grand Isle, Louisiana, where he rented [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=385.56s)]
*  a home until his identity was compromised. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=391.4s)]
*  After that, it seemed as if Bulger had disappeared from the face of the earth, except for the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=394.84s)]
*  alleged sightings all over the world. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=399.32s)]
*  How many of these tips do you think might have been true? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=402.0s)]
*  Boy, there was thousands and thousands of tips, and I think, I don't think any of them [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=404.88s)]
*  are true. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=411.0s)]
*  One of the obstacles was there were really no good photographs of Bulger or his longtime [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=412.4s)]
*  live-in girlfriend, Catherine Gregg, a former dental hygienist. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=417.35999999999996s)]
*  The FBI often noted that the couple shared a love of animals, especially dogs and cats, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=421.84s)]
*  and asked veterinarians to be on the lookout. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=427.44s)]
*  There were reports that Gregg once had breast implants and other plastic surgery in Boston, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=430.23999999999995s)]
*  so the task force reached out to physicians. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  Eventually, they got a call from a Dr. Mathias Donnellan, who had located her files in storage. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=438.4s)]
*  I was trying to leave the office a little early to catch one of my kids' ball games, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=444.23999999999995s)]
*  I said, well, listen, I'm going to swing by in the morning and pick those up. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=448.0s)]
*  And they said to me, do you want the photos, too? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=452.08000000000004s)]
*  And I said, you have photos? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=455.76s)]
*  And they said, yeah, we have photos. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=456.76s)]
*  I said, we'll be there in 15 minutes. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=458.24s)]
*  The breast implant lead produced a treasure trove of high-resolution Catherine Gregg photographs [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=460.84000000000003s)]
*  that would help crack the case. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=466.48s)]
*  The FBI decided to switch strategies, going after the girlfriend in order to catch the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=468.6s)]
*  gangster. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  This is an announcement by the FBI. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=474.52000000000004s)]
*  The FBI created this public service announcement. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=477.2s)]
*  60-year-old Gregg is the girlfriend of 81-year-old Bulger. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=479.84s)]
*  It ran in 14 markets on daytime talk shows aimed at women. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=483.32s)]
*  Call the tip line at 1-800-CALL-FBI. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=486.96s)]
*  And it didn't take long. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  The very next morning, the Bulger task force got three messages from someone that used [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  to live in Santa Monica and was 100 percent certain that Charlie and Carol Gasco, apartment [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  at the Princess Eugenia apartments, were the people they were looking for. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=503.68s)]
*  The descriptions and the age difference matched, and Deputy U.S. Marshal Neil Sullivan, who [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=508.0s)]
*  handled the lead, said there was another piece of tantalizing information. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=512.72s)]
*  The tipster specifically described that they were caring for this cat and their love for [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=517.04s)]
*  this cat. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=522.04s)]
*  So that was just one piece of the puzzle and the tip that just added up to saying, if this [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=523.04s)]
*  isn't them, it's something we better check out immediately, because it sure sounds like [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=527.64s)]
*  A search of the FBI's computer database for the Gascoes raised another red flag, not for [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=533.16s)]
*  what it found, but for what it didn't. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=538.4s)]
*  Basically like they were ghosts. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=540.76s)]
*  No driver's license. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=542.3199999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=543.3199999999999s)]
*  No driver's license, no California ID, like they didn't exist. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=544.3199999999999s)]
*  That's the apartment. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=548.24s)]
*  That corner on the third floor. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=549.24s)]
*  On the right-hand side? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=550.8s)]
*  Yep. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=551.8s)]
*  By early afternoon, FBI agent Scott Garriola had set up a number of surveillance posts [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=552.8s)]
*  and had already met with apartment manager Josh Bond to talk about his tenants. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=557.88s)]
*  He closed the door, threw down a folder and opened it up and said, are these the people [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=562.24s)]
*  that live in Apartment 303? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=566.64s)]
*  Did you say anything when you saw the pictures? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=569.8s)]
*  My initial reaction was, holy s***. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=572.08s)]
*  You live next door to a gangster. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=574.4399999999999s)]
*  I still didn't really know who he was. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=576.08s)]
*  But it didn't take him long to figure it out. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=578.88s)]
*  While the FBI was mulling its options, Bond logged on to Bolger's Wikipedia page. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=581.0s)]
*  I'm kind of scrolling down and it's like, oh wow, this guy's serious. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=586.08s)]
*  It's like murders and extortion. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=589.28s)]
*  And then I get to the bottom and there's this thing, it's like from one of his old people [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=591.8s)]
*  saying, well the last time I saw him he said, you know, when he goes out he's going to have [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=596.48s)]
*  guns and he's going to be ready to take people with him. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=601.04s)]
*  I was like, ooh, maybe I shouldn't be involved in this. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=603.08s)]
*  We were sitting here laughing about it, but he's a pretty serious guy. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=605.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=609.8s)]
*  He killed a lot of people. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=610.8s)]
*  True. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=611.8s)]
*  Or had them killed. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=612.8s)]
*  I didn't know that at the time. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=613.8s)]
*  Bond told the FBI he wasn't going to knock on the Gasco's door because there was a note [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=615.6800000000001s)]
*  posted expressly asking people not to bother them. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=620.28s)]
*  Carroll told neighbors that Charlie was showing signs of dementia. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=624.0s)]
*  So we were back there. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=627.64s)]
*  So Garriola devised a ruse involving the Gasco's storage locker in the garage. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=629.24s)]
*  Had the name Gasco across it and apartment 303. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=634.6800000000001s)]
*  He had the manager call to tell them that their locker had been broken into and that [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=638.28s)]
*  he needed someone to come down to see if anything was missing. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=642.48s)]
*  Carroll Gasco said her husband would be right down. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=645.88s)]
*  We just rushed him. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=648.9200000000001s)]
*  He mean guns out, FBI don't move. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=649.9200000000001s)]
*  He gave the words, hey, FBI, get your hands up. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=652.04s)]
*  Hands went up right away. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=656.12s)]
*  And then at that moment we told him to get down on his knees and he gave us, yeah, he [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=657.6800000000001s)]
*  gave us a, I ain't getting down on my effing knees. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=662.84s)]
*  Didn't want to get his pants dirty. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=665.24s)]
*  Didn't want to get his pants dirty. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=666.24s)]
*  You know, wearing white and seeing the oil on the ground, I guess he didn't want to get [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=667.24s)]
*  down in oil. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=670.96s)]
*  Even at 81, this was a man used to being in control. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=672.22s)]
*  I asked him to identify himself and that didn't go over well. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=675.74s)]
*  He asked me to effing identify myself, which I did. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=678.9s)]
*  And I asked him, I said, are you, are you Whitey Bulger? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=682.82s)]
*  He said, yes. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=685.58s)]
*  Just about that moment, someone catches my attention from a few feet away by the elevator [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=686.58s)]
*  shaft. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=690.9s)]
*  It was Janice Goodwin from the third floor coming to do her laundry. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=691.9s)]
*  And I said, excuse me, I think I can help you. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=695.4200000000001s)]
*  This man has dementia. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=698.1s)]
*  So if he's acting oddly, you know, that could be why. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=699.62s)]
*  Immediately, what flashed through my mind is, oh my God, I just arrested an 81 year [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=703.94s)]
*  old man with Alzheimer's who thinks he's Whitey Bulger. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=707.66s)]
*  What is he going to tell me next? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=710.58s)]
*  He's Elvis? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=711.58s)]
*  So I said, do me a favor. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=712.58s)]
*  I said, this woman over here says you have a touch of Alzheimer's. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=714.5s)]
*  He said, don't listen to her. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=716.98s)]
*  She's effing nuts. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=718.38s)]
*  He says, I'm James Bulger. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=719.38s)]
*  A few minutes later, he confirmed it, signing a consent form allowing the FBI to search [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=722.5s)]
*  his apartment. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=727.54s)]
*  As he's signing, he says, that's the first time I've signed that name in a long time. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=728.78s)]
*  There's a feeling of resignation. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=732.74s)]
*  I don't think he had it. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=735.1s)]
*  I did ask him, I said, hey, Whitey, aren't you relieved that you don't have to look over [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=736.4599999999999s)]
*  your shoulder anymore and it's come to an end? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=741.1s)]
*  And he said, are you nuts? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=744.42s)]
*  But in some ways, Whitey Bulger and Catherine Gregg had already been prisoners in apartment [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=746.5799999999999s)]
*  303, which appeared to be a mixture of the murderous and the mundane. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=751.78s)]
*  They had provided the weapons and all the money. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=758.06s)]
*  They had stockpiled the lifetime supply of cleansers, creams and detergents. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=760.22s)]
*  The FBI took special interest in a collection of 64-ounce bottles with white socks stretched [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=765.46s)]
*  over the top. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=771.5s)]
*  I said, hey, Whitey, what are these? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=772.5s)]
*  Are these some kind of Molotov cocktail you're making? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=773.98s)]
*  He goes, no. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=776.18s)]
*  He said, I buy tube socks from the 99-cent store and they're too tight on my calves. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=777.18s)]
*  So I stretch them out. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=781.42s)]
*  I said, why are you shopping at the 99-cent store? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=783.3s)]
*  You have half a million dollars under your bed. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=785.1s)]
*  I had to make the money last. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=787.7s)]
*  It's been said that one of the reasons it took so long to catch Whitey Bulger is that [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=790.3000000000001s)]
*  people were looking for a gangster and Bulger, whether he liked it or not, had ceased to be one. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=794.86s)]
*  He said it was hard to keep up that mindset of a criminal. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=800.6600000000001s)]
*  And that's part of the reason he came down to that garage. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=804.0600000000001s)]
*  He said if he was on his game, you know, 15, 20, 30 years ago, he probably would have sent [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=808.34s)]
*  something there. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=813.3000000000001s)]
*  But he said it was hard to stay on that edge, that criminal edge, after being on the lam [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=814.74s)]
*  as a regular citizen for 15 years. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=820.66s)]
*  The master manipulator gave credit to Catherine Gregg for keeping him crime-free, hoping it [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=823.58s)]
*  would mitigate her sentence. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=828.42s)]
*  She's now serving eight years for harboring a fugitive. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=830.3s)]
*  On the long plane ride back to Boston, Bulger told his captors that he became obsessed with [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=833.94s)]
*  not getting caught and would do anything to avoid it, even if it meant obeying the law. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=838.98s)]
*  Whitey Bulger's biggest fear, they said, was being discovered dead in his apartment, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=844.58s)]
*  and he had a plan to avoid it. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=849.5400000000001s)]
*  If he became ill and knew he was on his deathbed, he'd go down to Arizona, crawl down the bottom [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=851.7s)]
*  one of these mines and die and decompose and hope that we would never find him and still [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=856.1s)]
*  be looking for him forever. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=862.5s)]
*  In the early 90s, John Veazey was a man with an unusual occupation. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=874.58s)]
*  He killed people. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=888.94s)]
*  Veazey was a hitman in the Philadelphia Mafia and found himself smack in the middle of the [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=890.1800000000001s)]
*  bloodiest mob war in the city's history. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=895.34s)]
*  As is often the case with hitmen, Veazey's career was a short one. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=898.58s)]
*  When he learned his own crew might want to kill him, he became a government witness, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=902.6999999999999s)]
*  a rat. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=907.5s)]
*  His testimony helped send two dozen wise guys to prison, some for the rest of their lives, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=908.66s)]
*  and the Philly mob would never be the same. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=914.3s)]
*  Today, the one-time killer is a free man living under an assumed name somewhere in America. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=916.7399999999999s)]
*  We've agreed not to divulge exactly where. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=922.66s)]
*  He's married, has a good job, and says he's found God. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=925.7399999999999s)]
*  Back in his old South Philadelphia neighborhood, not everyone believes John Veazey's story [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=929.58s)]
*  of redemption. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=934.82s)]
*  They say he's still the same lowlife thug he was 20 years ago. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=936.5s)]
*  When the mob made him an offer, he couldn't refuse. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=941.1s)]
*  In 1993, you were an ex-con, a laborer, and a guy walks up to you and offers you $10,000 [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=945.6600000000001s)]
*  to do what? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=952.94s)]
*  Kill a guy. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=953.94s)]
*  Were you interested? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=954.94s)]
*  I just said, yeah, where's the gun? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=955.94s)]
*  That casual? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=958.1800000000001s)]
*  He said, take some time thinking about it. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=959.78s)]
*  I said, just take some time to get me the gun and let's get it done. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=960.78s)]
*  That's how it was for John Veazey, one bad choice after another. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=964.18s)]
*  He grew up in the mostly Italian neighborhood of South Philadelphia, home to the city's [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=968.9399999999999s)]
*  underworld. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=973.62s)]
*  He was the youngest of five. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=975.1999999999999s)]
*  His mother sold crystal meth out of her family's bakery. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=977.18s)]
*  By his mid-teens, John was a junkie and the father of two. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=980.8199999999999s)]
*  By his late 20s, he had been arrested more than 60 times. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=984.8599999999999s)]
*  He says he never aspired to join the mob, but the promise of a big payday got his attention. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=989.86s)]
*  I mean, you get $10,000 and you never have no money. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=994.86s)]
*  They're offering money to take somebody's life. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=997.9s)]
*  But my question to that is real simple. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=999.6999999999999s)]
*  How many poor people are being offered $10,000 to kill somebody? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1002.06s)]
*  But that's not an economic issue. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1005.38s)]
*  That's a moral issue. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1006.98s)]
*  It's moral if you have morals. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1007.98s)]
*  You had no morals. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1009.88s)]
*  Correct, none. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1010.88s)]
*  In the early 90s, the Philadelphia mob was at war, blood in body bags routine. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1012.98s)]
*  On one side was a group of older, Sicilian-born wise guys led by John Stanfa. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1019.5s)]
*  On the other, younger American mobsters headed by Joey Merlino. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1025.34s)]
*  For 30 years, George Anastasia covered the mob for the Philadelphia Inquirer. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1030.74s)]
*  He says a young, streetwise thug like Veazey was the kind of muscle John Stanfa needed. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1035.6200000000001s)]
*  Stanfa was getting an enforcer. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1042.34s)]
*  Stanfa was getting a guy who wasn't afraid to go out there and bust heads. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1043.86s)]
*  He was getting a guy who would go out and collect money, who would go out and intimidate [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1046.5s)]
*  people, and who would go out and kill people if he was ordered to do so. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1049.86s)]
*  John Veazey's first hit was in broad daylight. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1053.1s)]
*  The targets? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1056.4599999999998s)]
*  Rival mob boss, Joey Merlino, and his top lieutenant, Michael Cangalini. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1057.4599999999998s)]
*  Veazey and a partner drove up on the pair, hit the brakes, and opened fire. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1062.62s)]
*  Was your heart racing as you were coming down the street? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1067.22s)]
*  Well, I didn't really think it like that. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1069.22s)]
*  I was going to work, and part of my work that day was to kill somebody. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1071.6s)]
*  Joey Merlino survived the attack, but Michael Cangalini was killed. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1075.12s)]
*  One name off the boss's hit list. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1080.72s)]
*  How many names on the list? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1083.24s)]
*  25, 35, maybe. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1084.52s)]
*  If you see one of the guys on this list on the street, you take them out. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1086.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1089.24s)]
*  One month later, Veazey struck again. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1090.8s)]
*  The victim identified as Frank Baldino was getting into his white Cadillac after having [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1094.1599999999999s)]
*  dinner at the popular Melrose Diner in South Philadelphia. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1098.3s)]
*  Bullet casings all over. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1101.5s)]
*  Frank Baldino was a bartender who just about everyone in the neighborhood knew and liked, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1103.34s)]
*  including John Veazey. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1108.7s)]
*  But John Stamford thought Baldino had become too friendly with the other side and wanted [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1110.6599999999999s)]
*  him dead. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1115.82s)]
*  Put my gun right through the window. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1116.82s)]
*  And this was a guy you liked? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1118.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1120.78s)]
*  If you shoot someone in the head six times who you like, what would you do to someone [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1122.06s)]
*  you didn't like? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1124.8999999999999s)]
*  I shot him six times in the head because I was supposed to kill him. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1126.42s)]
*  I wanted to make sure he was dead. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1129.26s)]
*  But amid all the carnage, the hitman says he was volunteering as a Boy Scout leader. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1131.76s)]
*  Now, there's a positive role model for Boy Scouts, a hitman. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1137.78s)]
*  I'll tell you what, the kids didn't know I was a hitman. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1141.26s)]
*  A lot of parents were mad, but the kids had fun when I took them camping, I can tell you [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1143.3400000000001s)]
*  that. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1147.66s)]
*  John, do you get how crazy that sounds? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1148.66s)]
*  I can tell you I do, but I never really thought about it like that. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1149.66s)]
*  I would drive by and I'd have the kids in my station wagon, and then at night time I [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1153.62s)]
*  might be in a Cadillac. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1157.54s)]
*  Hunting for people you're supposed to kill. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1158.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1160.6999999999998s)]
*  VZ Star was rising. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1161.6999999999998s)]
*  He was summoned to this Philadelphia hotel to become a made member of the mob. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1163.9199999999998s)]
*  But the sacred ceremony was the last thing on his mind. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1169.2199999999998s)]
*  He wanted the $10,000 he'd been promised for his first hit. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1172.5s)]
*  I wanted the money, I never got the money. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1176.54s)]
*  Why didn't John Stamford pay you? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1178.86s)]
*  They said they were saving money for the war and I said, what are we buying, a Sherman [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1180.34s)]
*  tank? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1183.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm bringing all this money, all this money's coming, 100,000, 50,000, nobody's [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1184.8999999999999s)]
*  getting paid. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1189.1799999999998s)]
*  Those complaints did not sit well with Stanford. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1190.62s)]
*  A few months later, the mob boss ordered another hit, this time on VZ. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1194.06s)]
*  But John had an older brother, Billy, with friends in the mob. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1200.1399999999999s)]
*  When Billy learned John might be in trouble, he pleaded with him to turn himself in, to [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1203.54s)]
*  become a government informant, a rat. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1208.5s)]
*  Why do it? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1211.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1212.38s)]
*  I guess it was the right thing to do. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1213.38s)]
*  When Billy was talking to you, what was he telling you? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1214.8600000000001s)]
*  He told me it was the only opportunity, the only way. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1217.26s)]
*  He didn't want to watch me get executed. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1221.3000000000002s)]
*  Billy VZ drove John to the U.S. Attorney's Office. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1223.3000000000002s)]
*  FBI agent Paul Hayes, now retired, became John's government handler. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1226.8200000000002s)]
*  Billy understood the mob. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1232.22s)]
*  That's why he wanted him to come in and cooperate, because he knew how the mob could turn on [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1233.94s)]
*  you and kill you in a moment. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1239.78s)]
*  And in fact, I think he was right. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1241.5s)]
*  VZ agreed to wear a wire and collect evidence. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1243.7s)]
*  But he wasn't wearing it on the night he went to this South Philadelphia apartment with [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1246.98s)]
*  two trusted mob associates. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1251.42s)]
*  Inside, everything was covered in plastic. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1253.78s)]
*  It's not normal to walk in a room with plastic. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1257.14s)]
*  But I did. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1260.5s)]
*  I never thought anything. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1261.5s)]
*  What did you think was about to happen? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1262.82s)]
*  They told me they were painting. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1264.3s)]
*  He was shot four times with a small caliber pistol, three times in the head, once in the [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1266.38s)]
*  chest. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1272.66s)]
*  The guy shoots in the back of the head. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1273.66s)]
*  They had two men, two to one. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1274.94s)]
*  How did you manage to get out? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1276.62s)]
*  You fight. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1277.62s)]
*  You do what you grew up doing. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1278.62s)]
*  He wrestled a knife from one attacker, stabbed him and ran from the building. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1281.1s)]
*  The legend of John VZ was born. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1286.04s)]
*  This is a guy who can't be killed now. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1289.06s)]
*  You can't bring him down. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1290.94s)]
*  And it enhances that whole reputation as a tough guy. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1292.46s)]
*  John VZ should have been dead that night. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1294.8200000000002s)]
*  And he wasn't. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1296.66s)]
*  How do you explain it? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1297.66s)]
*  Poor equipment. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1298.66s)]
*  They should have had a better gun, a bigger gun. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1299.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1300.98s)]
*  Maybe it's destiny. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1301.98s)]
*  Maybe this is supposed to happen. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1302.98s)]
*  John Stanfa and 23 members of his crew were indicted on charges including murder and racketeering. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1304.46s)]
*  VZ's appearance at their trial as a government witness was eagerly anticipated. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1311.94s)]
*  But on the morning he was to testify, he was approached by FBI agent Paul Hayes. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1316.82s)]
*  And I said, John, I have something to tell you. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1322.22s)]
*  Your brother was murdered in a hit. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1325.26s)]
*  And John crumbled to the floor. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1329.42s)]
*  Billy had been ambushed in his car not far from his home. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1332.3799999999999s)]
*  Five days later, John took the stand, giving jurors an unvarnished account of life in the [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1336.8999999999999s)]

*  He was a highly effective witness. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1343.74s)]
*  Very good. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1345.74s)]
*  What was so good about him? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1347.7s)]
*  Because he was genuine. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1348.7s)]
*  This is what we did. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1349.7s)]
*  I shot this guy. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1350.7s)]
*  And that guy over there told me to do it. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1351.7s)]
*  The defense tried to diminish his testimony. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1353.1s)]
*  They said, John, we see that you're wearing glasses. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1356.66s)]
*  Did the government buy you those glasses? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1359.46s)]
*  And he said, yes, they did. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1360.94s)]
*  And then he said, did the government buy you those glasses to make you more believable [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1361.94s)]
*  and credible in front of this jury? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1365.1s)]
*  He says, I don't know. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1367.6200000000001s)]
*  But ever since your client shot me in the back of the head, my vision's been slightly [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1368.6200000000001s)]

*  All the defendants were found guilty. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1373.98s)]
*  John Stanfield was sentenced to five consecutive life terms. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1377.18s)]
*  Veasey, as part of his plea agreement, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, plenty of [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1380.3s)]
*  time for dark thoughts of revenge. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1385.58s)]
*  You wanted to kill the people who killed your brother? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1388.9s)]
*  Them, family, it didn't really matter. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1391.1000000000001s)]
*  You were going to shoot him? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1394.22s)]
*  Well, I had plans to inject their wives with AIDS. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1395.22s)]
*  What? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1398.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1399.6200000000001s)]
*  I was going to bump into them with a shopping cart, like have a little needle. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1400.6200000000001s)]
*  They wouldn't even feel it. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1404.22s)]
*  That's just evil. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1405.38s)]
*  It is evil. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1406.38s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1407.38s)]
*  I was pretty evil. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1408.38s)]
*  And I ain't going to try to say I wasn't. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1410.94s)]
*  This is John Veasey today, just another suburban homeowner trying to stay ahead of the yard [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1413.98s)]
*  work. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1420.14s)]
*  I have a great wife, a great family, nice home, good job. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1421.14s)]
*  Veasey shares his new life with Norma, his wife of eight years. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1425.54s)]
*  They married after John's brief stint in the witness protection program. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1430.02s)]
*  Can you even fathom the person that he was or the things he used to do? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1434.8s)]
*  No. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1439.48s)]
*  No, because I don't know that person. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1440.48s)]
*  I know my husband. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1444.1599999999999s)]

*  The caring individual, that's who I know. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1449.56s)]
*  But John didn't rob ice cream trucks. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1452.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, he did some bad things. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1453.68s)]
*  But if God is willing to forgive, why wouldn't we? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1456.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, he's human. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1461.24s)]
*  As an ex-con, finding work was difficult. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1465.1599999999999s)]
*  But with his wife's encouragement, Veasey talked his way into a job selling cars. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1468.1599999999999s)]
*  Turns out he was a natural. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1473.52s)]
*  He's earned Salesman of the Year awards and a six-figure salary. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1475.8s)]
*  Do you tell customers about your past now? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1479.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1481.6399999999999s)]
*  I asked. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1482.6399999999999s)]
*  What might they ask? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1483.6399999999999s)]
*  Some people will be like, man, you're like one of them mob guys. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1484.6399999999999s)]

*  You know what? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1487.6399999999999s)]
*  I've changed. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1488.6399999999999s)]

*  The book, The Hitman, written by two Philadelphia journalists, details Veasey's criminal past [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1492.56s)]
*  and efforts to turn his life around. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1498.6399999999999s)]
*  Search for peace. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1501.16s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1519.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1520.0s)]
*  How you doing, young lady? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1521.0s)]

*  How are you? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1523.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1524.48s)]
*  Like I always say now, I'm not who I want to be. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1525.48s)]
*  I'm not who I'm going to be, but I'm definitely not the person I used to be. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1528.44s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1531.8s)]
*  You're not buying that car? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1532.8s)]
*  I'm not buying it. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1533.8s)]
*  Reporter George Anastasia isn't alone in his skepticism. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1534.8s)]
*  Minnig in South Philadelphia don't believe Veasey is capable of changing. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1538.96s)]
*  He's found God because it's expedient to find God, because he's somewhere in middle America [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1543.8s)]
*  and it works to find God there. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1547.88s)]
*  I don't think if he's back on a street corner in South Philly, he's found God. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1549.8s)]
*  He's looking to avenge what happened to his brother. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1553.2s)]
*  He's looking to settle scores. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1555.76s)]
*  His brother's murder almost 20 years ago has remained an obsession. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1559.0s)]
*  We learned that on visits to Philadelphia, Veasey has made threats against those he thinks [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1564.44s)]
*  were responsible. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1569.56s)]
*  Kathy Cangalini says she's been a target for years. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1571.0s)]
*  It's frightening. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1574.7s)]
*  It's aggravating. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1575.7s)]
*  It's intimidating. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1576.76s)]
*  Why would John Veasey threaten you? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1578.48s)]
*  He believes that my husband has killed his brother. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1580.2s)]
*  Her husband John Cangalini and others were tried in 2001 for the murder of Billy Veasey [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1584.48s)]
*  and found not guilty. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1590.6s)]
*  But John Veasey maintains Cangalini did murder Billy as payback for his first hit when he [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1592.96s)]
*  killed Cangalini's brother Michael. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1598.52s)]
*  Kathy says Veasey has posted menacing pictures on Facebook and left her voicemails that she [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1601.84s)]
*  saved, like this one from 2011. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1607.68s)]
*  He's the punk. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1619.04s)]
*  He threatens me. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1620.04s)]
*  Has my husband been a punk? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1621.04s)]
*  He's the punk. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1622.6000000000001s)]
*  He threatens women. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1624.0600000000002s)]
*  That's what he does. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1625.48s)]
*  John Veasey lives under an alias, and few in his new community are aware of his past. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1628.88s)]
*  But over the last five years, his name has appeared in at least four police reports. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1634.7s)]
*  In 2008, an argument in a restaurant led to a fight. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1640.26s)]
*  I waited for him to take his drink, and I sized him up and I hit him with a straight, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1645.26s)]
*  good, good punch, and the glass went through his face. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1649.94s)]
*  Veasey was arrested and pleaded guilty to misdemeanor battery. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1652.98s)]
*  His victim required 25 stitches and plastic surgery. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1657.14s)]
*  Only reason it's big for me because I'm a killer. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1661.42s)]
*  What do you think about how many of your friends had a bar room fight growing up? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1663.98s)]
*  John, I gotta tell you, in talking to you, sometimes I wonder if you're still just a [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1666.78s)]
*  tough guy or if you're still part of you a bad guy. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1672.9s)]
*  That's something you all have to wonder, I guess. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1678.66s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1680.1s)]
*  I would say that if that's open for debate. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1683.34s)]
*  Linda Vecchio was a highly decorated FBI agent who helped put some of the mafia's [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1693.98s)]
*  most notorious leaders behind bars. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1702.5s)]
*  He's also one of the few FBI agents ever charged with murder. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1705.1s)]
*  It was his relationship with a violent mob informant known as the Grim Reaper that got [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1709.38s)]
*  him and the FBI in trouble. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1714.06s)]
*  He's telling the story for the first time in a new book and to us tonight. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1716.3600000000001s)]
*  It's rare to get an inside look at the shadowy world of informants and their handlers. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1721.06s)]
*  It's rarer still to hear an FBI agent describe a brutal mafia killer as his friend. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1726.26s)]
*  But that is exactly what Linda Vecchio told us. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1732.1799999999998s)]
*  He says his informants information helped cripple the mob. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1735.84s)]
*  To get it, however, Vecchio has been accused of making a deal with the devil. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1739.26s)]
*  I didn't make any bargains with the devil. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1744.78s)]
*  I wasn't dancing with the devil. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1746.02s)]
*  I was dancing with a guy that was very close to the devil. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1747.1s)]
*  He was a tough guy, but that was what they were paying me to do. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1749.9s)]
*  I got close to members of organized crime so we could eliminate them. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1753.38s)]
*  Do you feel like you walked up to the line? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1757.22s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1759.3000000000002s)]
*  I got close to it. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1760.3000000000002s)]
*  I freely admit that. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1762.26s)]
*  In the 1980s, the mafia was a big problem in New York City, and this was as close as [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1764.7800000000002s)]
*  law enforcement often got. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1769.9s)]
*  Surveillance footage taken outside a mob hangout called the Wimpy Boys Social Club in Bensonhurst, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1772.3600000000001s)]
*  an area then controlled by the Colombo family. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1778.62s)]
*  One of the most notorious wise guys was Greg Scarpa, who had a reputation for brutality. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1781.58s)]
*  He was a made guy, a button in the Colombo family. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1786.54s)]
*  A tough guy too. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1789.54s)]
*  Very tough. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1790.6999999999998s)]
*  He was absolutely fearless, one of the toughest guys I've ever seen. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1791.6999999999998s)]
*  His toughness may have been legendary, but what no one in the Colombo family knew was [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1795.62s)]
*  that the Grim Reaper was also a rat. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1800.3s)]
*  In the 1960s, he had secretly provided the FBI with detailed information about fellow [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1804.12s)]
*  mobsters, but he'd had a falling out with the Bureau and broke off relations. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1808.9799999999998s)]
*  In 1980, DeVecchio wanted Scarpa back, so he decided to take a big chance. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1814.1399999999999s)]
*  He drove up to the gangsters' home unannounced and blocked Scarpa's car as he was pulling [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1819.6s)]
*  out of his driveway. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1824.6599999999999s)]
*  You know, it was like, who the f*** are you? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1825.6599999999999s)]
*  And I said, you know, I'd like to speak with you. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1829.2399999999998s)]
*  I do need some help. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1831.6799999999998s)]
*  I want to get schooled in the life. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1832.74s)]
*  Educate me. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1834.92s)]
*  About two weeks later, he called and he said, come alone. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1835.92s)]
*  And I did. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1839.24s)]
*  FBI agents aren't supposed to meet alone with informants, but DeVecchio got special [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1840.24s)]
*  permission. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1845.0s)]
*  Scarpa was considered a top-echelon informant and great care was taken to keep their meeting [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1846.0s)]
*  secret. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1851.2s)]
*  When law enforcement officials announced one of the most important prosecutions ever against [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1852.3s)]
*  the mob in 1985, very few people knew that Greg Scarpa's information had played a role. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1856.5s)]
*  It was called the Commission case. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1863.14s)]
*  This is a great day for law enforcement. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1865.18s)]
*  And it not only catapulted a young prosecutor named Rudy Giuliani into the limelight, it [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1867.38s)]
*  also sent the heads of three of the five crime families away for life. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1872.42s)]
*  DeVecchio got promoted and ended up leading two organized crime squads in New York. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1878.02s)]
*  Greg Scarpa got paid $66,000 for the information he supplied over 12 years. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1883.5s)]
*  And when he was arrested for credit card fraud, DeVecchio helped keep him out of jail. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1889.0600000000002s)]
*  His career and his life and his milieu that he worked in was so different than mine. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1894.54s)]
*  It was fascinating to me to learn about that. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1898.9s)]
*  I like the guy. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1901.3000000000002s)]
*  You know, I make no bones about that. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1902.3000000000002s)]
*  I'm not ashamed of that. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1903.42s)]
*  It doesn't mean I condone what he did. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1904.42s)]
*  It was a friendship. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1906.54s)]
*  It was a friendship. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1907.6200000000001s)]
*  He was your friend. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1908.6200000000001s)]
*  He was. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1909.6200000000001s)]
*  But Greg Scarpa wasn't just a run-of-the-mill mobster. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1910.82s)]
*  He was a stone-cold killer. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1913.58s)]
*  He's believed to have murdered at least 12 people during the time he was an informant. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1915.8999999999999s)]
*  DeVecchio told us that on one occasion, Scarpa even let him know he'd killed another mobster. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1920.7399999999998s)]
*  There was a body found in Brooklyn one day. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1926.4599999999998s)]
*  I said, who did the work? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1927.9399999999998s)]
*  Who did the murder? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1930.4199999999998s)]
*  Who killed him, yeah. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1931.4199999999998s)]
*  And he smiled. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1932.4199999999998s)]
*  What did that smile tell you? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1933.4199999999998s)]
*  A smile told me he did it. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1934.4199999999998s)]
*  He didn't tell me he did it. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1936.3799999999999s)]
*  But I knew him well enough that, you know, he gave me that knowing look like, I did it, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1937.6999999999998s)]
*  you know I did it, and I'm telling you I did it, but I'm not telling you I did it in words. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1942.9799999999998s)]
*  When he smiled and you thought, OK, I mean, he killed that guy, is that something you [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1946.86s)]
*  would investigate? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1951.26s)]
*  No. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1952.26s)]
*  No. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1953.26s)]
*  The guy was dead. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1954.26s)]
*  I mean, as callous as that may sound, the person who's dead is not going to bring him [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1955.26s)]
*  back. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1959.2199999999998s)]
*  Ellen Corchella was a federal prosecutor who worked on cases with Linda DeVecchio's squad. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1960.2199999999998s)]
*  You are absolutely not supposed to keep an informant on the street that is killing people. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1964.94s)]
*  Even if that person is giving you valuable information, which may have other arrests [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1969.6200000000001s)]
*  as a result of it? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1973.98s)]
*  And the question I would put to your question is, when is it valuable enough information [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1975.38s)]
*  that you let people continue to kill other people on the street? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1980.3s)]
*  In 1991, a war started between two rival factions of the Colombo family. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1983.9s)]
*  Greg Scarpa is believed to have killed more people than anybody else. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1989.1000000000001s)]
*  The whole time you're meeting with him during the war as an informant, he's also going [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1993.9s)]
*  around killing people. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1997.44s)]
*  Yes, he is. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=1998.7s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2000.0600000000002s)]
*  And did you know that at the time? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2001.0600000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2002.8200000000002s)]
*  I knew that because I knew the guy he was. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2003.8200000000002s)]
*  But if you know the guy you're talking to to stop the war is actually the guy who's [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2005.7800000000002s)]
*  conducting the war. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2009.14s)]
*  He's not. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2010.14s)]
*  He wasn't the only one conducting the war. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2011.14s)]
*  Everybody was shooting everybody. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2013.26s)]
*  I think that it became more valuable to him to have this informant on the street than [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2014.8200000000002s)]
*  it was to pursue other law enforcement goals. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2022.1s)]
*  So you think DeVecchio was protecting Scarpa? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2026.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2029.5s)]
*  Protecting him, she says, by giving Scarpa sensitive law enforcement information. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2031.3s)]
*  Prosecutors first became suspicious when Scarpa's son, who was also involved in organized crime, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2036.1399999999999s)]
*  went on the run just before he was going to be arrested. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2040.9399999999998s)]
*  Those suspicions grew when some of Scarpa's crew got busted and started talking to authorities. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2044.26s)]
*  There was at least two of them that told us they had a source in law enforcement. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2050.04s)]
*  And one of them basically was the guy who stayed at Scarpa's right hand. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2053.74s)]
*  So he saw Scarpa go off and get phone calls and then come back and say, here's an address [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2057.68s)]
*  where I think we can find somebody to kill. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2065.52s)]
*  I just got it from my source. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2067.96s)]
*  After hearing what Scarpa's associates had to say, four FBI agents accused their boss, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2070.52s)]
*  and DeVecchio of leaking information to his informant, Greg Scarpa. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2075.6s)]
*  One of the agents specifically remembered DeVecchio asking for addresses that ended [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2080.2s)]
*  up in Scarpa's hands. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2084.5s)]
*  And these were no ordinary addresses. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2086.44s)]
*  They were the suspected hideouts of mobsters Greg Scarpa was trying to kill. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2088.4s)]
*  Did you ever give Scarpa any law enforcement information? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2093.48s)]
*  Never. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2096.08s)]
*  Never. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2097.08s)]
*  His son disappeared right on the eve of him about to be arrested by the DEA. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2098.08s)]
*  Did you tip him off for that? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2102.12s)]
*  No, I did not. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2103.12s)]
*  I went to him and asked him, I said, do you know where he is? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2104.12s)]
*  He said, I don't know where he is, Len. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2107.44s)]
*  Was he lying to me? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2109.3199999999997s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2111.3199999999997s)]
*  But he looked me in the eye and said, I don't know where he is, Len. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2112.92s)]
*  The FBI launched an internal investigation of DeVecchio, which went on for years, but [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2115.16s)]
*  came up with nothing. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2120.16s)]
*  In 2006, however, the Brooklyn District Attorney charged DeVecchio with murder, accusing him [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2121.92s)]
*  of telling Scarpa who to kill and where to find them. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2127.56s)]
*  The Brooklyn District Attorney's case fell apart when a key witness was thoroughly discredited [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2131.72s)]
*  during the trial. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2136.44s)]
*  Former FBI agents who supported DeVecchio applauded as the charges were dismissed. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2139.44s)]
*  But the judge who released DeVecchio criticized him and the FBI for making a quote, deal with [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2144.0s)]
*  the devil, letting Scarpa get away with his crimes for close to 15 years. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2150.56s)]
*  DeVecchio retired from the FBI in 1996 and now runs a private investigations business [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2157.32s)]
*  in Florida. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2162.36s)]
*  He feels he's been wrongly accused and unfairly maligned, which is why he's written a book [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjqOQWr-Vk&t=2163.36s)]
