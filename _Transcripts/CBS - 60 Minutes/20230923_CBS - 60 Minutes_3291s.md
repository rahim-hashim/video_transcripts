*  The End [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight we're going to tell you a story you've probably never heard before, because [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=13.6s)]
*  only a few people outside the FBI know anything about it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=17.18s)]
*  It's a spy story unlike any other. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  And if you think your life is complicated, wait till you hear about Jack Barsky's, who [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=24.44s)]
*  led three of them simultaneously. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=29.16s)]
*  One as a husband and father, two as a computer programmer and administrator at some top American [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=31.92s)]
*  corporations, and three as a KGB agent spying on America during the last decade of the Cold [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  War. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=43.8s)]
*  The FBI did finally apprehend him in Pennsylvania, but it was long after the Soviet Union had [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=45.34s)]
*  crumbled. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=50.36s)]
*  What makes Jack Barsky's story even more remarkable is he's never spent a night in [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=51.84s)]
*  jail. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  The Russians declared him dead a long time ago. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=57.12s)]
*  He's living a quiet life in upstate New York and has worked in important and sensitive [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=59.72s)]
*  jobs. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  He's now free to tell his story as honestly as a former spy ever can. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=65.24s)]
*  So who are you? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=70.72s)]
*  Who am I? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=71.72s)]
*  That depends when the question is asked. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=74.52s)]
*  Right now I'm Jack Barsky. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=77.56s)]
*  I work in the United States. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=78.88s)]
*  I'm a US citizen, but it wasn't always the case. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=80.8s)]
*  How many different identities do you have? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=84.22s)]
*  I have two main identities, a German one and an American one. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=85.92s)]
*  What's your real name? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  My real name is Jack Barsky. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  What name were you born with? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=95.24s)]
*  Albrecht Dietrich. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=96.8s)]
*  Say that three times real fast. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=99.64s)]
*  Just say it once slowly. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=101.84s)]
*  Albrecht Dietrich. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=103.24s)]
*  How Albrecht Dietrich became Jack Barsky is one of the untold stories of the Cold War, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  an era when the real battles were often fought between the CIA and the KGB. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=111.2s)]
*  Barsky was a rarity, a Soviet spy who posed as an American and became enmeshed in American [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=116.84s)]
*  society. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=122.4s)]
*  For the 10 years he was operational for the KGB, no one in this country knew his real [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=123.64s)]
*  story, not even his family. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=128.6s)]
*  Did you think you were going to get away with this? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, otherwise I wouldn't have done it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=132.8s)]
*  What Barsky did can be traced back to East Germany, back to the days when he was Albrecht [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=136.24s)]
*  Dietrich. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=141.0s)]
*  A national scholar at a renowned university in Jena, Dietrich was on the fast track to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=142.0s)]
*  becoming a chemistry professor, his dream job. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=148.48s)]
*  Didn't work out that way because I was recruited by the KGB to do something a little more adventurous. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=151.32s)]
*  Spy. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=157.16s)]
*  We called it something different. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  We used the euphemism. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=160.16s)]
*  I was going to be a scout for peace. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=161.44s)]
*  A KGB scout for peace. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=164.76s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=166.62s)]
*  The spies were the good guys and the capitalist spies were the evil ones, so we didn't use [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=167.70000000000002s)]
*  the word spy. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=171.82s)]
*  He says his spying career began with a knock on his dorm room door one Saturday afternoon [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=173.9s)]
*  in 1970. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=179.18s)]
*  A man introduced himself, claiming to be from a prominent optics company. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=180.9s)]
*  He wanted to talk with me about my career, which was highly unusual. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  I immediately, there was a flash in my head that said, that's Stasi. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=188.70000000000002s)]
*  East German secret police. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=192.9s)]
*  East German secret police, yeah. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=193.98000000000002s)]
*  It was a Stasi agent. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=195.94s)]
*  He invited Dietrich to this restaurant in Jena where a Russian KGB agent showed up and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=197.66s)]
*  took over the conversation. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=203.3s)]
*  The KGB liked Dietrich's potential because he was smart, his father was a member of the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=205.5s)]
*  Communist Party and he didn't have any relatives in the West. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=210.3s)]
*  Dietrich liked the attention and the notion he might get to help the Soviets. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=214.1s)]
*  And what did you think of America? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=218.18s)]
*  Was the enemy. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=220.3s)]
*  The reason that the Americans did so well was because they exploited all the third world [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=221.94s)]
*  countries. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=226.82s)]
*  That's what we were taught and that's what we believed. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=227.82s)]
*  We didn't know any better. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=230.18s)]
*  I grew up in an area where you could not receive West German television. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=231.7s)]
*  It was called the Valley of the Clueless. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=238.14s)]
*  For the next couple of years, the KGB put Dietrich through elaborate tests. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=241.9s)]
*  And then in 1973, he was summoned to East Berlin to this former Soviet military compound. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=246.58s)]
*  The KGB, he says, wanted him to go undercover. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=253.26s)]
*  At that point, I had passed all the tests. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=256.86s)]
*  So they wanted, they made me an offer. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=259.14s)]
*  But you didn't think about it all along. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=261.3s)]
*  That's true. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=262.98s)]
*  With one counterweight in that you didn't really know what was going to come. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=263.98s)]
*  How do you test drive becoming another person? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=269.46s)]
*  It was a difficult decision, but he agreed to join the KGB and eventually found himself [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=272.82s)]
*  in Moscow undergoing intensive training. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=277.5s)]
*  A very large part of the training was operational work. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=280.38s)]
*  Determination as to whether you're being under surveillance, Morse code, shortwave radio [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=283.58s)]
*  reception. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=289.09999999999997s)]
*  I also learned how to do microdots. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=290.09999999999997s)]
*  A microdot is, you know, you take a picture and make it so small with the use of a microscope [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=291.53999999999996s)]
*  that you can put it under a postage stamp. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=297.73999999999995s)]
*  The Soviets were looking to send someone to the U.S. who could pose as an American. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=302.34s)]
*  Dietrich showed a command of English and no trace of an East German accent that might [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=306.94s)]
*  give him away. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=311.41999999999996s)]
*  He learned a hundred new English words every day. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=312.85999999999996s)]
*  It took me forever. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=315.85999999999996s)]
*  I did probably a full year of phonetics training. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=317.09999999999997s)]
*  The difference between hot and hut, right, that's very difficult and most Germans don't [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=323.53999999999996s)]
*  get that one. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=330.34s)]
*  Did you want to go to the United States? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=331.34s)]
*  Oh yeah, sure. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=333.06s)]
*  It was New York, San Francisco, and we heard about these places. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=334.06s)]
*  Your horizons were expanding. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=338.78s)]
*  Oh absolutely. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=340.06s)]
*  Now I'm really in the big league, right? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=341.06s)]
*  Dietrich needed an American identity. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=344.06s)]
*  And one day a diplomat out of the Soviet embassy in Washington came across this tombstone just [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=347.06s)]
*  outside of D.C. with the name of a 10-year-old boy who had died in 1955. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=352.88s)]
*  The name was Jack Philip Barsky. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=358.94s)]
*  And they said, guess what, we have a birth certificate. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=361.82000000000005s)]
*  You're going to the U.S. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=363.78000000000003s)]
*  And that was the Jack Barsky birth certificate? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=365.62s)]
*  The Jack Barsky birth certificate that somebody had obtained and I was given. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=367.3s)]
*  I didn't have to get this myself. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=372.06s)]
*  Did you feel strange walking around with this identity of a child? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=373.58000000000004s)]
*  No. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=379.18s)]
*  No. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=380.18s)]
*  When you do this kind of work, some things you don't think about because if you explore, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=381.56s)]
*  you may find something you're not like. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=386.9s)]
*  The newly minted Jack Barsky landed in New York City in the fall of 1978 with a phony [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=389.29999999999995s)]
*  backstory called The Legend and a fake Canadian passport that he quickly discarded. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=395.21999999999997s)]
*  The KGB's plan for him was fairly straightforward. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=400.82s)]
*  They wanted the 29-year-old East German to get a real U.S. passport with his new name, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=404.0s)]
*  then become a businessman, then insert himself into the upper echelons of American society, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=409.26s)]
*  and then to get close to national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski so that he could [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=415.12s)]
*  spy on him. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=419.64s)]
*  That was the plan. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=421.2s)]
*  It failed. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=422.96s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=423.96s)]
*  Because I was not given very good instructions with regard to how to apply for a passport. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=424.96s)]
*  When he went to apply for a passport at Rockefeller Center, Barsky was thrown off by the list of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=431.56s)]
*  questions. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=436.36s)]
*  Specific details about my past for which I had no proof, so I walked out of it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=437.36s)]
*  Did the KGB have a pretty good grasp on the United States and how things worked there? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=442.6s)]
*  No. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=447.32000000000005s)]
*  No? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=448.32000000000005s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=449.32000000000005s)]
*  They made a number of mistakes in terms of giving me advice what to do, what not to do. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=450.32000000000005s)]
*  They just didn't know. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  Left to fend for himself in a country the KGB didn't understand. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=459.08000000000004s)]
*  He got himself a cheap apartment and tried to make do with a birth certificate and $6,000 [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=462.70000000000005s)]
*  in cash the Soviets had given him. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=467.98s)]
*  His spying career at that point more resembled the bumbling Boris Badinoff than James Bond. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=470.52s)]
*  So you were working as a bike messenger? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=476.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=478.71999999999997s)]
*  That doesn't sound like a promising position for a spy. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=479.71999999999997s)]
*  No, but there were a lot of things that I didn't know. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=482.88s)]
*  So how close did you ever get to Brzezinski? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=486.68s)]
*  Not very. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=489.64s)]
*  To get a Social Security card, which he would need if he wanted a real job, Barsky knew [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=491.14s)]
*  he would have to do some acting. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=495.88s)]
*  It was unusual for a 30 plus year old person to say, you know, I don't have a Social Security, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=497.68s)]
*  God, give me one. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=504.08s)]
*  So in order to make my story stick, I made my face dirty, so I looked like somebody who [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=505.76s)]
*  just came off a farm. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=514.08s)]
*  It worked. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=516.8s)]
*  The lady asked me, she said, so how come you don't have a card? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=517.8s)]
*  When the answer was I didn't need one, why? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=523.0s)]
*  Well, I worked on a farm. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=524.96s)]
*  And that was the end of the interview. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=527.24s)]
*  The Social Security card enabled him to enroll at Baruch College in Manhattan, where he majored [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=528.98s)]
*  in computer systems. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=534.12s)]
*  He was class valedictorian, but you won't find a picture of him in the school yearbook. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=535.88s)]
*  In 1984, he was hired as a programmer by Metropolitan Life Insurance, where he had access to the [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=540.96s)]
*  personal information of millions of Americans. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=547.5600000000001s)]
*  You were writing computer code? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=551.0s)]
*  Right, yes. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=552.44s)]
*  Lots of it. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=553.44s)]
*  And I was really good at it. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=554.44s)]
*  But he didn't write. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=555.84s)]
*  He stole on behalf of the KGB. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=556.84s)]
*  What was the most valuable piece of information you gave them? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=559.44s)]
*  I would say that that was the computer code, because that was a very prominent piece of [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=563.2s)]
*  industrial software still in use today. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=567.8000000000001s)]
*  This was IBM code? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=571.12s)]
*  No comment. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=573.88s)]
*  You don't want to say? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=574.88s)]
*  No. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=576.88s)]
*  It was good stuff. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=577.88s)]
*  Let's put it this way. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=578.88s)]
*  It was helpful to the Soviet Union. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=580.84s)]
*  It would have been helpful to the Soviet Union and their running organizations and factories [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=582.44s)]
*  and so forth. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=587.8800000000001s)]
*  How often did you communicate with the Russians? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=588.8800000000001s)]
*  I would get a radiogram once a week. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=590.8800000000001s)]
*  A radiogram meaning? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=593.5200000000001s)]
*  A radiogram means a transmission that was on a certain frequency at a certain time. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=594.5200000000001s)]
*  Every Thursday night at 915, Barsky would tune into his shortwave radio at his apartment [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=600.12s)]
*  in Queens and listen for a transmission he believed came from Cuba. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=605.44s)]
*  All the messages were encrypted that they became digits. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=610.3199999999999s)]
*  And the digits would be sent over in groups of five. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=614.9599999999999s)]
*  And sometimes that took a good hour to just write it all down and another three hours [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=619.52s)]
*  to decipher. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=625.24s)]
*  During the ten years he worked for the KGB, Barsky had a ready-made cover story. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=627.0s)]
*  When somebody asked you, you know, where are you from, Jack? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=631.72s)]
*  What did you say? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=633.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm originally from New Jersey. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=634.8399999999999s)]
*  I was born in Orange. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=635.8399999999999s)]
*  That's it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=636.8399999999999s)]
*  American. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=637.8399999999999s)]
*  Nobody ever questioned that. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=638.84s)]
*  People would question my, you know, you have an accent. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=640.08s)]
*  But my comeback was, yeah, my mother was German and we spoke a lot of German at home. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=643.52s)]
*  You had to tell a lot of lies. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=650.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=651.72s)]
*  I was living a lie. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=652.72s)]
*  Were you a good liar? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=655.72s)]
*  The best. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=657.32s)]
*  You had to be a good liar to juggle the multiple lives he was leading. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=658.32s)]
*  Every two years, while he was undercover for the KGB, Barsky would send a message to the [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=662.9200000000001s)]
*  KGB, Barsky would return to East Germany and Moscow for debriefings. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=668.4799999999999s)]
*  During one of his visits to East Berlin, he married his old girlfriend, Gurlinda, and [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=673.1999999999999s)]
*  they had a son. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=677.7199999999999s)]
*  Did that complicate matters? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=679.18s)]
*  Initially it wasn't complicated at all. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=680.9599999999999s)]
*  It got complicated later. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=682.4s)]
*  Because? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=684.4799999999999s)]
*  Because I got married in the United States to somebody else. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=686.16s)]
*  Did she know about your other wife in Germany? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=690.16s)]
*  No. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=692.3599999999999s)]
*  Did your wife in Germany know about the... [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=693.3599999999999s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=696.38s)]
*  So you had two wives. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=697.96s)]
*  I did. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=698.96s)]
*  I was officially a bigamist. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=700.96s)]
*  That's the one thing I am so totally not proud of. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=703.78s)]
*  Being a spy was all right. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=708.18s)]
*  Being a bigamist. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=710.86s)]
*  In hindsight, I was a spy for the wrong people, but this one hurt because I had promised my [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=716.38s)]
*  German wife that we would be together forever, and I broke that promise. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=722.84s)]
*  The one way I can explain that to myself is I had separated the German, the Dietrich, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=729.12s)]
*  from the Barsky to the point where the two just didn't know about each other. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=735.4s)]
*  Not only did he have two different identities and two wives, he had a son named Matthias [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=740.64s)]
*  in Germany and a daughter named Chelsea in America. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=745.14s)]
*  By November 1988, a radiogram from the KGB would force him to make an excruciating choice. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=748.84s)]
*  I received a radiogram that essentially said, you need to come home. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=755.98s)]
*  Your cover may soon be broken and you are in danger of being arrested by the American [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=760.64s)]
*  authorities. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=766.0600000000001s)]
*  Barsky was given urgent instructions from the KGB to locate an oil can that had been [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=767.32s)]
*  dropped next to a fallen tree just off this path on New York's Staten Island. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=772.6s)]
*  The fake passport and cash that he needed to escape the United States and return to [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=778.16s)]
*  East Germany would be concealed inside the can. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=782.64s)]
*  I was supposed to pick up the container and go on, leave, not even go back home to the [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=785.8399999999999s)]
*  apartment, just disappear. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=792.12s)]
*  The container wasn't there. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=793.88s)]
*  I don't know what I would have done if I had found it, but I know what I did when I didn't [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=795.76s)]
*  find it. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=799.92s)]
*  I did not tell them, repeat the operation. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=800.92s)]
*  I made the decision to stay. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=803.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=806.0799999999999s)]
*  Because of Chelsea. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=807.36s)]
*  Her daughter? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=808.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=809.8000000000001s)]
*  If Chelsea is not in the mix, it's a no-brainer. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=811.08s)]
*  I'm out of here. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=814.24s)]
*  Barsky had chosen Chelsea over Matthias. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=816.44s)]
*  I had bonded with her. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=818.92s)]
*  It was a tough one because on the one hand, I had a wife and a child in Germany, but if [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=820.88s)]
*  I don't take care of Chelsea, she grows up in poverty. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=832.12s)]
*  This may be a little harsh, but it sounds like the first time in your life that you [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=836.2s)]
*  thought about somebody besides yourself. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=839.5200000000001s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=842.32s)]
*  I was quite an egomaniac. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=844.7600000000001s)]
*  I was. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=850.44s)]
*  Jack Barsky was still left with the not insignificant matter of telling the KGB that he was staying [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=853.0s)]
*  in America. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=858.2s)]
*  In a moment, we'll tell you how he duped the KGB and how the FBI changed his life. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=859.5200000000001s)]
*  At the end of 1988, Jack Barsky's 10-year run as a clandestine KGB agent in the United [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=869.76s)]
*  States was about to come to an end. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=875.9200000000001s)]
*  He had ignored Soviet warnings that his cover had been blown and decided to remain in America [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=879.12s)]
*  and not return to his native East Germany. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=884.36s)]
*  He was taking a chance that no one in America would ever find out who he really was, and [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=887.56s)]
*  he was taking a bigger chance that the KGB wouldn't retaliate for disobeying an order. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=892.56s)]
*  The urgency with which the Soviets seemed to view the situation became clear one morning [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=898.52s)]
*  in Queens. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=903.72s)]
*  Jack Barsky says he was on his way to work in December 1988, standing and waiting for [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=907.52s)]
*  an A train on this subway platform when a stranger paid him a visit. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=912.52s)]
*  There's this character in a black coat, and he sidles up to me and he whispers in my ears, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=917.12s)]
*  he says, you've got to come home or else you're dead. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=922.88s)]
*  And then he walked out. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=927.68s)]
*  Russian accent? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=930.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=931.32s)]
*  That's an incentive. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=932.32s)]
*  It's an incentive to go. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=934.92s)]
*  It means spies get killed all the time. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=936.12s)]
*  They do. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=938.4s)]
*  But not me. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=939.4s)]
*  The entire time, I always had this childlike belief that everything would be all right. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=940.68s)]
*  So what are you going to tell the Russians? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=946.8s)]
*  Well, I sent them this Dear John letter, the goodbye letter, in which I stated that I had [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=948.4s)]
*  contracted AIDS and that the only way for me to get a treatment would be in the United [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=955.52s)]
*  States. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=961.76s)]
*  You just wrote them a letter and said, I can't come back, I've got AIDS? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=962.76s)]
*  There's three things I tell people that the Russians were afraid of. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=966.3199999999999s)]
*  AIDS, Jewish people, and Ronald Reagan. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=971.3199999999999s)]
*  In that order? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=977.12s)]
*  I think Ronald Reagan took the top spot. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=978.9200000000001s)]
*  They thought he would push the button. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=981.9200000000001s)]
*  The AIDS letter apparently worked because in East Berlin, the Soviets told his German [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=984.1400000000001s)]
*  wife Gerlinda he wasn't coming back. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=988.72s)]
*  They went to Gerlinda and told her that I had died of AIDS. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=991.36s)]
*  So I think they just wrote me off completely. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=995.5200000000001s)]
*  You were officially dead in East Germany? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=997.74s)]
*  After five years, she was able to declare me dead. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1000.2s)]
*  Dead. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1003.2s)]
*  Once the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union fell apart, Barsky was a man without a country. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1004.2s)]
*  No one would warn him back. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1013.8000000000001s)]
*  He felt his secret was safe in America. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1015.88s)]
*  He became a family guy with a wife, two kids, Chelsea and Jesse, and a job. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1018.5200000000001s)]
*  He burrowed himself into suburbia, keeping a low profile. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1023.9000000000001s)]
*  I was settling down. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1027.52s)]
*  I was living in rural Pennsylvania at the time in a nice house with two children. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1029.1599999999999s)]
*  It was like typical middle class existence. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1034.6s)]
*  And his life would have stayed quiet if a KGB archivist named Vasily Matrokin hadn't [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1037.6399999999999s)]
*  defected to the West in 1992 with a trove of notes on the Soviet spying operations around [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1042.2399999999998s)]
*  the world. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1048.52s)]
*  Buried deep in his papers was the last name of a secret agent the KGB had deployed somewhere [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1050.2399999999998s)]
*  in America, Barsky. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1055.8s)]
*  We were concerned that he might be running an agent operating in the federal government [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1057.92s)]
*  somewhere. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1065.24s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1066.24s)]
*  In the FBI, the CIA, the State Department. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1067.24s)]
*  We had no idea. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1069.96s)]
*  Joe Reilly was an FBI agent when the Bureau got the Matrokin tip, and the Barsky case [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1071.44s)]
*  quickly became serious enough that FBI Director Louis Free got personally involved. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1076.3200000000002s)]
*  The FBI didn't know who or where he was, but the best lead seemed to be a Jack Barsky [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1082.36s)]
*  who was working as an IT specialist in New Jersey with a suburban home across the border [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1088.08s)]
*  in Mount Bethel, Pennsylvania. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1093.24s)]
*  Aside from his name, was there anything else that made you suspicious and make you think [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1095.0s)]
*  that this was the guy you were looking for? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1098.9199999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1101.0s)]
*  One thing was the fact that he had applied for a Social Security number late in life, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1102.0s)]
*  especially someone like him who was educated and intelligent. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1106.8s)]
*  The FBI began following Barsky, and when this surveillance photo caught him talking [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1111.02s)]
*  to a native of Cuba, the Bureau grew increasingly concerned. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1115.22s)]
*  There were some indications that I could possibly be the head of an international spy ring because [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1119.54s)]
*  I had a friend who was originally from Cuba. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1124.44s)]
*  And it so happened that this friend owned an apartment that was rented to a Soviet diplomat. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1127.3799999999999s)]
*  So that one raised all kinds of flags and they investigated me very, very, very carefully. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1133.3799999999999s)]
*  FBI Agent Joe Riley went so far as to set up an observation post on a hillside behind [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1139.42s)]
*  Barsky's house. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1144.7s)]
*  This is a picture he took of his view. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1146.14s)]
*  I got a telescope and binoculars as if I was a bird watcher, but I was looking at his backyard [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1148.14s)]
*  and at him. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1155.14s)]
*  Over time, I learned a great deal about him. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1156.26s)]
*  Like what? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1159.94s)]
*  Just watching him. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1160.94s)]
*  Well, I became convinced that he loved his children. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1161.94s)]
*  And that was important because I wanted to know if he would flee. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1166.78s)]
*  There was less chance of that if he was devoted to his children, and he was. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1170.78s)]
*  But that wasn't enough for the FBI. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1175.66s)]
*  The Bureau bought the house next door to get a closer look at the Barsky's. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1177.46s)]
*  Did you get a good deal? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1181.02s)]
*  I think we paid what he was asking. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1184.42s)]
*  And we had agents living there so that we could be sure who was coming and going from [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1188.18s)]
*  his house without being too obvious in our surveillance. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1193.98s)]
*  You had no idea the FBI was living next door to you? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1198.0600000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1201.14s)]
*  Never saw Joe Riley up on the hill with the binoculars? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1202.14s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1205.9s)]
*  When the FBI finally got authorization from the Justice Department to bug Barsky's home, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1207.5800000000002s)]
*  the case broke wide open. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1212.6200000000001s)]
*  Within I'd say the first two weeks that we had microphones in his house, he had an argument [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1214.74s)]
*  with his wife in the kitchen. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1220.46s)]
*  And during the course of that dispute, he readily admitted that he was an agent operating [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1223.34s)]
*  from the Soviet Union. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1229.86s)]
*  It was all the FBI needed to move in on Barsky. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1233.3799999999999s)]
*  They set a trap for him at a toll bridge across the Delaware River as he drove home from work [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1236.1s)]
*  late one Friday afternoon in May of 1997. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1241.3s)]
*  I'm being waved to the side by a state trooper. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1245.02s)]
*  And he said, we're doing a routine traffic check. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1248.1s)]
*  Would you please get out of the car? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1250.58s)]
*  I get out of the car. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1251.58s)]
*  And somebody steps up from behind and shows me a badge. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1253.7s)]
*  And he said, FBI, we would like to talk to you. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1258.26s)]
*  His face just dropped. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1262.74s)]
*  And we told him that he had to go with us. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1265.62s)]
*  The first words out of my mouth were, am I under arrest? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1268.18s)]
*  And the answer was no. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1272.06s)]
*  Now, that took a big weight off of me. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1273.46s)]
*  So I figured there was a chance to get out of this in one piece. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1276.54s)]
*  And the next question I asked, so what took you so long? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1280.74s)]
*  The FBI had rented an entire wing of a motel off Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania for Barsky's [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1287.2600000000002s)]
*  interrogation. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1293.0200000000002s)]
*  But on the way to the motel, I remember turning to him. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1294.5400000000002s)]
*  And I told him that this didn't have to be the worst day of his life. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1297.98s)]
*  And he immediately realized that he had an out. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1302.5800000000002s)]
*  I said to them, listen, I know I have only one shot out of this. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1306.38s)]
*  And that means I need to come clean and be 100% honest and tell you everything I know. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1310.66s)]
*  The FBI questioned Barsky throughout the weekend and gave him a polygraph test that he passed. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1317.8600000000001s)]
*  Convinced that his spying days were over and that his friendship with the Cuban was just [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1323.46s)]
*  that, the FBI decided to keep the whole thing quiet and allowed Barsky to go back to work [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1327.7800000000002s)]
*  on Monday morning. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1333.3000000000002s)]
*  Was he charged with something? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1334.82s)]
*  No. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1336.4199999999998s)]
*  Even though he had confessed to being a Soviet spy? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1338.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1340.78s)]
*  That seems odd. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1341.78s)]
*  Well, we wanted him to cooperate with us. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1343.7s)]
*  We did want to put him in jail. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1346.8999999999999s)]
*  He was no use to us there. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1348.1399999999999s)]
*  Barsky continued to meet not only with the FBI, but with the National Security Agency [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1350.4199999999998s)]
*  to offer his firsthand insights into the KGB and the Russians. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1355.1799999999998s)]
*  I was able to provide them with a lot of valuable information on how the KGB operated. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1359.4199999999998s)]
*  The only people who were aware of his secret were the FBI and Penelope, his wife in America, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1364.7s)]
*  who subsequently filed for divorce. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1369.7s)]
*  His daughter, Chelsea, then a teenager, knew only that he wanted to tell her something [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1372.38s)]
*  when she turned 18. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1376.94s)]
*  That day finally arrived on a four-hour drive to St. Francis University. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1379.02s)]
*  He started chuckling to himself and he said, well, I was a spy. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1383.6200000000001s)]
*  I was a KGB spy. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1388.96s)]
*  I was like, what? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1390.46s)]
*  Really? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1392.5800000000002s)]
*  Jack also revealed to Chelsea why he had decided to stay in America. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1393.6599999999999s)]
*  He said that he fell in love with me and my curls when I was a little baby, and then I [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1397.46s)]
*  cried. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1403.74s)]
*  Did he tell you everything? [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1404.74s)]
*  No, he didn't. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1405.74s)]
*  He didn't tell me 100% the whole truth. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1406.74s)]
*  He left some things out at that point. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1409.1799999999998s)]
*  I told her everything that you can tell in four hours that is age-appropriate. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1410.6999999999998s)]
*  She was still a teenager. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1416.82s)]
*  I may not have told her that I was married in Germany. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1418.6999999999998s)]
*  He waited another two years before he matter-of-factly dropped another bombshell about his past. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1421.74s)]
*  He just looked straight ahead at the TV and he said, did I tell you you have a brother? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1427.3s)]
*  And I turned my head. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1435.26s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1436.9s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1437.9s)]
*  The half-brother was Matthias, the boy Jack had left behind in Germany. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1439.5s)]
*  Chelsea was determined to find him. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1444.02s)]
*  Jack didn't like the idea. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1445.98s)]
*  I did not feel comfortable getting in touch with him. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1447.74s)]
*  I did not feel comfortable with my acknowledging my German past. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1451.98s)]
*  After a year of trying to track him down online, Chelsea finally got a reply from Matthias. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1456.48s)]
*  The subject line said, dear little sister. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1461.5s)]
*  And when I saw dear little sister, I just started weeping because that meant everything [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1465.86s)]
*  to me. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1470.62s)]
*  That meant that he accepted me. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1471.62s)]
*  And this is me. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1474.58s)]
*  A month later, Matthias was in Pennsylvania visiting Chelsea and her brother Jesse. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1476.06s)]
*  They hit it off. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1480.82s)]
*  Matthias wasn't interested in seeing his father and changed his mind. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1482.06s)]
*  Was it awkward? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1486.4199999999998s)]
*  I just remember he stared at me for a couple of minutes. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1488.62s)]
*  He just stared at me. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1491.5s)]
*  I mean, he had reason to be angry with you. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1492.5s)]
*  When I told him the dilemma that I was faced with, he actually said, I understand. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1496.1399999999999s)]
*  And what's your relationship like with Matthias now? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1501.62s)]
*  He feels like he is my son. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1504.94s)]
*  Gerlinda, the wife in Germany who thought he was dead, wants nothing to do with Jack [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1508.3400000000001s)]
*  today or with 60 Minutes. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1513.02s)]
*  He has remarried and has a four-year-old daughter. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1517.3200000000002s)]
*  They live in upstate New York, where Jack has worked as director of software development [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1520.5s)]
*  for a company that manages New York's high-voltage power grid, a critical piece of U.S. infrastructure. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1525.06s)]
*  When he told his employer recently that he had once been a KGB spy, he was placed on [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1532.34s)]
*  a paid leave of absence. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1537.22s)]
*  Before becoming an American citizen last year, he had been given a clean bill of health by [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1539.3s)]
*  the FBI and U.S. intelligence agencies. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1543.46s)]
*  But in the world of espionage, it's often difficult to tell what's true and what's [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1546.54s)]
*  legend. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1551.3s)]
*  Are you telling the truth right now? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1552.3s)]
*  I am, absolutely. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1553.62s)]
*  The truth, as far as I know it, yes. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1554.62s)]
*  As far as you know it? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1558.1s)]
*  Well, you know, sometimes memory fails, but I am absolutely not holding back anything. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1559.3s)]
*  Why tell the story now? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1566.5s)]
*  I want to meet my maker clean. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1568.02s)]
*  I need to get clean with the past. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1570.1s)]
*  I need to digest this fully. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1574.82s)]
*  All right, take your mulligan already. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1576.74s)]
*  The FBI agent who apprehended him, Joe Reilly, still believes in Barsky. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1580.82s)]
*  And in yet another twist of the story, the two are good friends and golfing buddies. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1585.6s)]
*  He's a very honest person. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1590.4399999999998s)]
*  And if you want to find out how honest someone is, play golf with them. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1593.48s)]
*  But you're a former FBI guy and he's a former spy. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1598.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1601.32s)]
*  What's the bond? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1602.32s)]
*  It's personal. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1603.32s)]
*  He credits me for keeping him out of prison. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1604.84s)]
*  After nearly 30 years, Jack Barsky went back to visit a unified Germany, first in October, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1608.6799999999998s)]
*  then again last month. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1614.24s)]
*  So that was essentially the very beginning of my career. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1615.76s)]
*  He showed his kids where this improbable tale began and some other key settings in his odyssey. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1619.32s)]
*  And he caught up with old classmates who knew him as Albrecht Dietrich. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1624.36s)]
*  When you're here in Germany, are you Albrecht or are you Jack? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1629.0s)]
*  No, I'm Jack. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1633.28s)]
*  I am 100% Jack. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1634.28s)]
*  I let the other way out and sometimes he interferes, but they get along very well now. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1636.68s)]
*  The Berlin Wall, which once divided east and west, is now gone except for a section that [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1644.44s)]
*  has been turned into an art display. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1649.36s)]
*  Checkpoint Charlie, once the epicenter of the Cold War, is now a tourist attraction [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1652.0s)]
*  full of kitsch. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1656.76s)]
*  Statues of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels still stand in the eastern part of Berlin, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1658.28s)]
*  relics of another era, as is the man who straddled two worlds and got away with it. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1663.1200000000001s)]
*  Everyone who knew him at the FBI thought Robert Hansen was a quiet, unassuming computer nerd. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1674.24s)]
*  But it turns out this FBI agent gave away more secrets than any spy in the history of [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1681.24s)]
*  the Bureau. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1687.04s)]
*  For $600,000 in cash and diamonds from the Russians, Hansen compromised, among other [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1688.04s)]
*  things, the existence of a top-secret surveillance tunnel under the Russian Embassy in Washington, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1693.76s)]
*  D.C., seeking to get the money. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1699.72s)]
*  Secret U.S. war plans and the identity of Russians working as spies for the U.S. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1703.76s)]
*  For over 22 years, he went undetected as he worked his way up to chief of the Soviet Analytical [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1709.76s)]
*  Unit, which has been described as a supermarket of classified information on U.S. operations [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1715.76s)]
*  against the Russians. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1721.76s)]
*  What's more, he not only betrayed his country, he also betrayed his church and his wife in [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1723.76s)]
*  an almost unimaginable way. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1729.76s)]
*  Betrayal was at the very core of his soul. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1732.76s)]
*  Pulitzer Prize-winning author Norman Mailer and filmmaker Lawrence Schiller have spent [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1736.76s)]
*  the last 10 months investigating the Hansen case for an upcoming CBS television movie [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1740.76s)]
*  and a book called Into the Mirror. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1746.76s)]
*  Here he is with one of his sons. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1749.76s)]
*  Teaching him how to shoot. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1751.76s)]
*  James Bond. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1753.76s)]
*  For their research, Schiller and Mailer have gone through a family album that depicts [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1756.76s)]
*  an image of your normal, healthy, middle-class, all-American family man. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1760.76s)]
*  Now, this is the picture of them getting married. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1766.76s)]
*  Look how happy he is. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1769.76s)]
*  And he's tall and handsome, and she looks like Natalie Wood. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1770.76s)]
*  This is the perfect couple. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1773.76s)]
*  Here's the whole family. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1775.76s)]
*  Look at that. Just gorgeous. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1777.76s)]
*  All six members of his family. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1778.76s)]
*  By all outward appearances, Hansen was devoted to his kids and Bonnie, his wife of 33 years. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1781.76s)]
*  They sent their children to private religious schools so they could be instilled with solid [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1788.76s)]
*  Christian values. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1793.76s)]
*  But this was all an illusion. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1795.76s)]
*  Bob Hansen wasn't just a double agent. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1797.76s)]
*  He had multiple secret lives at the office and at home. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1799.76s)]
*  Just right after being married, he started to photograph his wife. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1804.76s)]
*  He started taking pictures of her, nude pictures, a little more risque, pretty strong pictures. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1808.76s)]
*  That may not sound all that strange, but what was even stranger was that he was sending [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1815.76s)]
*  those nude pictures, unbeknownst to his wife, to his best friend, now retired U.S. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1821.76s)]
*  Army officer Jack Horschauer. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1827.76s)]
*  And if that's not enough, Hansen showed his best friend even more. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1829.76s)]
*  He had immense knowledge of technology. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1834.76s)]
*  So he was able to put a closed circuit television camera in his bedroom, hidden away behind a [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1836.76s)]
*  photograph with a little hole in the photograph, and it was piped into a television set someplace [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1842.76s)]
*  else in the house. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1847.76s)]
*  And when Jack Horschauer would visit, he'd say, just turn on the television. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1848.76s)]
*  And if you want to watch something interesting, let me know. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1851.76s)]
*  And he would watch Robert Hansen making love to his wife. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1854.76s)]
*  His wife didn't know about this. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1858.76s)]
*  Larry, you're telling this in the most matter of fact tone of voice as if, hey, he set up a [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1859.76s)]
*  camera and let his friend watch him in bed with his wife. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1863.76s)]
*  This is over the top. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1867.76s)]
*  It's not only over the top, but then he would ask Jack Horschauer, well, would you like to see me do [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1869.76s)]
*  something else in bed? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1874.76s)]
*  What else would you like? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1875.76s)]
*  What do you call that? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1876.76s)]
*  I call it wiccan to the nth degree. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1878.76s)]
*  And there's even more. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1881.76s)]
*  Incredible as it sounds, Hansen published stories about his sexual life with his wife on adult [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1883.76s)]
*  oriented websites and used his own name. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1889.76s)]
*  He lived a life of treachery and betrayal, and he betrayed everyone. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1893.76s)]
*  Nobody knows more about spies and their peccadilloes than John Martin. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1899.76s)]
*  He oversaw the investigations and prosecutions of some 76 spies when he was a senior official at the [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1904.76s)]
*  Justice Department. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1911.76s)]
*  Out of government now, he has followed the Hansen case closely. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1912.76s)]
*  Do you know that Hansen wrote pornographic stories on the Internet? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1917.76s)]
*  I did not know that until recently. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1922.76s)]
*  If the Bureau had found out about that, would that have rung the bell? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1925.76s)]
*  He would have been removed from access and an investigation would have been conducted. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1929.76s)]
*  Now, he used his own name and the name of his wife. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1934.76s)]
*  How come that wasn't caught? [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1937.76s)]
*  They just weren't looking or? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1940.76s)]
*  I don't know if the FBI is surfing the pornographic net looking for spies. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1942.76s)]
*  They may be doing it after this case. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1948.76s)]
*  Hansen began feeding the Soviets valuable information in 1979, just three years after joining the FBI. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1951.76s)]
*  He communicated with the Russians in writing. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1959.76s)]
*  This is a copy of one of his actual letters sent in 1985 to his handler Victor Cherkashin. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1962.76s)]
*  Soon I will send a box of documents to Mr. Degtyar. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1969.76s)]
*  They are from certain of the most sensitive and highly compartmented projects of the U.S. intelligence community. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1973.76s)]
*  In his letters, he gave up the identity of Soviet spies like Tophat, a high-ranking and highly productive Soviet officer who was on the CIA payroll. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1980.76s)]
*  When you give up the names of live sources, you're doing the maximum damage that you can. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1991.76s)]
*  Were they really the top of the line sources? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=1998.76s)]
*  They were top of the line sources. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2000.76s)]
*  And they were pulled back and two of the three sources were executed after he gave them up. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2002.76s)]
*  Do you think that was deliberate? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2009.76s)]
*  Oh yes, absolutely. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2010.76s)]
*  That he knew exactly who he was targeting? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2011.76s)]
*  Absolutely. He was getting rid of his competition. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2013.76s)]
*  A treachery of it. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2016.76s)]
*  A treachery. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2017.76s)]
*  But Martin tips his hat to Hansen for his shrewdness and covering his tracks. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2018.76s)]
*  He was as much a mystery to the KGB as he was to the FBI, never allowing his Russian handlers to meet him. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2023.76s)]
*  He communicated with them only in writing. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2030.76s)]
*  They didn't know he was with the FBI and they assumed, probably assumed that he was with the CIA. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2033.76s)]
*  That's because he threw them off his track by often signing his message with the pen name Ramon Garcia, which ends quite deliberately with the letters CIA. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2040.76s)]
*  And the information he gave up concerned the CIA as well as other intelligence agencies, but never the FBI where he worked. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2052.76s)]
*  So what kind of man would betray his country so secretly and his wife so publicly? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2060.76s)]
*  John Le Carre could not write a novel about Hansen. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2067.76s)]
*  Graham Greene couldn't. Even Norman Mailer couldn't. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2071.76s)]
*  It takes Dostoevsky. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2075.76s)]
*  Dostoevsky. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2077.76s)]
*  He's the most complex, probably the most complex real character that I've ever had to contend with. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2078.76s)]
*  He says the contradictions involving his wife alone were extraordinary. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2085.76s)]
*  By the way, he adored her. He worshiped her. He loved her. You can't imagine how much he loved her. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2090.76s)]
*  But he's a man of parts. So not only did he love her and adore her, he also had to betray her. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2095.76s)]
*  You see, what you find there is that next to his most noble and loving emotions are his most evil emotions and they alternate. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2100.76s)]
*  How does he keep from going insane? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2108.76s)]
*  Good question, since he was also betraying the church he was seemingly devoted to. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2110.76s)]
*  Hansen was and still is a member of a conservative order within the Roman Catholic Church called Opus Dei, Latin for Work of God, a group dedicated to fighting communism. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2116.76s)]
*  He attended mass and took communion daily. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2128.76s)]
*  So he'd go to church, this very conservative Opus Dei order, and pray and deal with the Roman. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2131.76s)]
*  Pray on his knees. Pray on his knees. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2139.76s)]
*  And in any... [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2141.76s)]
*  Tremble while he prayed. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2142.76s)]
*  So while he was praying, are you saying that he didn't, he was laughing at it? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2143.76s)]
*  No, I think he almost demands that you come up with a new kind of psychology to explain him. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2147.76s)]
*  He was an absolutely devout man, prayed with intensity, brought up his children. He was a model father. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2153.76s)]
*  And he would help them write essays about how good America was. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2159.76s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2163.76s)]
*  And here was a man that was always talking about fighting communism, which was one of the things that Opus Dei was very much involved in. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2164.76s)]
*  He is at the same time giving the Soviet Union those secrets which are the most important. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2172.76s)]
*  This is the epitome of the amoral human being. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2178.76s)]
*  You have to find a new word. It's sort of dramatically amoral. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2181.76s)]
*  Dr. Alan Solarian, a psychiatrist hired by Hanson's legal defense team who spent 30 hours interviewing him, says Hanson isn't amoral. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2186.76s)]
*  He's ill, suffering from a severe psychological disorder. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2196.76s)]
*  He is driven by demons. He is driven by thoughts, unwanted thoughts. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2201.76s)]
*  Solarian says Hanson shared his whole secret life with his Opus Dei priest. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2206.76s)]
*  He tells the priest, not only his psychological demons, on top of this, he tells this priest that he's also spying. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2212.76s)]
*  And look at the kind of advice he got. Lousy advice. He was told to pray more and to turn the money to Mother Teresa. To me, that's outrageous. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2222.76s)]
*  They basically said if you give the money to Mother Teresa, everything will be okay. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2233.76s)]
*  Yes. Exactly. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2237.76s)]
*  Hanson has told the government that indeed he gave his spy money in the early 80s, about $12,000 up to that time, to Mother Teresa, and then went on to spy some more. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2240.76s)]
*  With Bob Hanson, the church dropped the ball. They fumbled it. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2252.76s)]
*  The church's position is that a priest cannot reveal what he learns in confidence. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2256.76s)]
*  But Solarian thinks the church should have encouraged Hanson to seek psychiatric help and turn himself in. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2261.76s)]
*  Instead of using his $600,000 in spy money to bail his family out of debt, Hanson has three mortgages on the house. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2269.76s)]
*  He spent much of the money on Priscilla Gailey, whom he met at a strip club where she performed. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2277.76s)]
*  He goes out with this stripper who was beautiful and had won awards for being the best stripper of the year in this city and that city, including Washington, D.C., and who was a charming, intelligent woman. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2284.76s)]
*  And he spent a year with her. He spent some like $80,000 on her in that year, which was almost equal to his yearly salary, and never made a pass at her. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2295.76s)]
*  Right. Never. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2307.76s)]
*  She made a pass at him, but he never made a pass at her. He wanted to convert her. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2308.76s)]
*  And he rejected her? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2311.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2313.76s)]
*  There's no question he rejected her, but he still tried to convert her to Catholicism. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2314.76s)]
*  And this was not the only girl that he did it with. There were several other strippers. One I think he even succeeded in converting. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2320.76s)]
*  He, the exhibitionist, was trying to save an exhibitionist. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2326.76s)]
*  You're right on that. But there's another angle. Bob Hansen was not trying to save Priscilla. Bob Hansen was trying to save himself. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2331.76s)]
*  It was, maybe it's too much psycho babble, but in Sikai we call it projective identification. He put himself onto somebody else and tried to help. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2343.76s)]
*  Something else Dr. Solarian believes Hansen did was use his spying as a way to fend off his demons. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2354.76s)]
*  His espionage was an escape from his sexual demons. That when he found himself in an exciting, dangerous position, such as espionage and spying, he found that his demons slowed down. They calmed down. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2361.76s)]
*  You're not going to be able to dismiss Hansen by speaking of his psychiatric categories. He goes beyond that. He is crazier than crazy. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2375.76s)]
*  He comes out at the other end because his behavior is so rational, you see, under immense stress and tension. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2383.76s)]
*  Think of taking these secrets out of the FBI week after week, month after month, year after year. He gave the Russians, you know, the average big spy like Walker or one of those, would give two or three drops a year. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2389.76s)]
*  And one year Hansen gave something like 13 or 14 drops. It was unheard of. The Russians were just going on, who is this man? He's a genius. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2401.76s)]
*  You said that he liked the game. He liked living on the edge. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2410.76s)]
*  He liked the game. He found adventure in it and he looked upon himself as someone who was smarter than everybody else and he looked down upon his colleagues. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2413.76s)]
*  But eventually the game caught up with him when a Russian spy turned over the entire KGB file on the man known as Ramon Garcia. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2425.76s)]
*  While the file did not contain Hansen's name, it did include a tape recording of his voice and his fingerprints lifted from this plastic garbage bag that he once used to wrap classified documents. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2434.76s)]
*  The perfect spy was not so perfect after all. He got a little sloppy. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2447.76s)]
*  And so on February 18, 2001, about a month before he was set to retire from the FBI, Hansen's whirls, all three or four of them, came crashing down. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2453.76s)]
*  Is this a tragic figure? Is this somebody we need to reserve just an ounce of pity for? Or is this just outright pure evil, pure criminality? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2465.76s)]
*  How about having the difference? A little pity and he probably is pretty damn evil. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2476.76s)]
*  Hansen, who will be sentenced in May, has agreed to plead guilty to espionage and cooperate with the government. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2481.76s)]
*  In return, he avoids the death penalty and assures that his wife Bonnie will collect most of his pension from his 25 years with the FBI. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2488.76s)]
*  And finally, what about Bonnie? We're told that she still loves him and completely forgives him. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2497.76s)]
*  We're used to spy novels about the Russians, but today's reality in espionage is different. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2506.76s)]
*  China has just as good a spy network in the United States. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2520.76s)]
*  And tonight you are going to see a Chinese spy caught red-handed taking American military secrets from an employee of the Defense Department. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2524.76s)]
*  If China is the Asian dragon, then it has awakened to compete with the United States all around the world for resources, markets, and strategic advantage. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2533.76s)]
*  The Chinese are also shopping for information, ranging from U.S. nuclear weapons designs to the inside deliberations of the Obama White House. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2542.76s)]
*  Because of the nature of espionage, you never get a look at this clandestine underworld. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2551.76s)]
*  But recently, the FBI recorded a Chinese agent stealing America's secrets. And we're making the video public for the first time. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2557.76s)]
*  There's a nice Thai restaurant out there. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2566.76s)]
*  This is what espionage looks like. The man driving the car is Greg Bergersen. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2570.76s)]
*  He's a civilian analyst at the Pentagon with one of the nation's highest security clearances. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2575.76s)]
*  His companion is Taishen Guo, a spy for the People's Republic of China. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2581.76s)]
*  This is Guo in an FBI surveillance photo. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2587.76s)]
*  He was born in Taiwan, but he's a naturalized American citizen who owns a number of businesses in Louisiana. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2590.76s)]
*  And this is Bergersen, who worked at the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which manages weapons sales to U.S. allies. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2597.76s)]
*  Bergersen knew a secret that the Chinese desperately wanted to know. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2607.76s)]
*  What kind of weapons was America planning to sell to Taiwan, the rebellious Chinese island that mainland China wants to reclaim? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2612.76s)]
*  It's July 2007. They're driving outside Washington. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2621.76s)]
*  And neither man knows that what they're about to do is being recorded by two cameras the FBI has concealed in their car. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2626.76s)]
*  You sure that that's okay? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2637.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2642.76s)]
*  You sure? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2643.76s)]
*  We watched the tape with John Slattery, the FBI agent at headquarters who oversaw the case. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2644.76s)]
*  He recently retired as a deputy assistant director. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2649.76s)]
*  What's happening there? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2653.76s)]
*  Information has been passed prior, and this is reward for that, or there is expectation that passage of information is forthcoming. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2654.76s)]
*  So that's what's happening right here. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2662.76s)]
*  How much money is he holding in his hand? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2664.76s)]
*  I think we're probably looking at about $2,000 thereabouts. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2666.76s)]
*  Tai-Shing-Wu's money and contacts came to the FBI's attention while the Bureau was investigating a different Chinese espionage case. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2671.76s)]
*  They followed him, tapped his phone, watched his email, and all of that led to Bergersen. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2679.76s)]
*  In the car, the Pentagon employee and Chinese spy were plotting the handover of secret documents that listed future weapon sales to Taiwan and details of a Taiwanese military communications system. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2685.76s)]
*  I'm very, very, very, very reticent to let you have it because it's all classified. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2698.76s)]
*  But I will let you see it, and you can take all the notes you want, which I think you can do today, but if it ever fell into the wrong hands, I know it's not going to, but if it ever was, then I would be fired for sure. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2708.76s)]
*  I'd go to jail because I violated all the rules. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2729.76s)]
*  He just described them as classified documents. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2732.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2735.76s)]
*  He knows precisely what he's doing. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2736.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2737.76s)]
*  He's almost going down your list of requirements for an indictment by a grand jury. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2738.76s)]
*  And we thank him for that. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2743.76s)]
*  When it comes to espionage against the United States, is China now the number one threat that we face? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2746.76s)]
*  I would be hard pressed to say whether it's the Chinese or it's the Russians, but they're one two or two one. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2751.76s)]
*  Michelle Van Cleave was America's top counterintelligence officer. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2758.76s)]
*  Working for the director of national intelligence, she was in charge of coordinating the hunt for foreign spies from 2003 to 2006. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2763.76s)]
*  The Chinese are the biggest problem we have with respect to the level of effort that they're devoting against us versus the level of attention we are giving to them. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2772.76s)]
*  What do the Chinese want from us? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2785.76s)]
*  Virtually every technology that is on the U.S. control technology list has been targeted. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2787.76s)]
*  Sensors and optics and biological and chemical processes, these are the things, information technologies across all of the things that we have identified as having inherent military application. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2794.76s)]
*  The Chinese have stolen technology used in the space shuttle and in submarine propulsion systems. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2808.76s)]
*  In the late 1990s, a congressional commission found that China now holds the most closely guarded secrets America had. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2814.76s)]
*  We learned and the Cox Commission reported that the Chinese had acquired the design information for all U.S. thermonuclear weapons currently in our inventory. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2822.76s)]
*  Make sure I understand, the Chinese are in possession today of the designs of all of our nuclear weapons? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2836.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2845.76s)]
*  How did they get that? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2846.76s)]
*  The questions of how they acquired it remain to some extent unknown. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2848.76s)]
*  How the U.S. lost its atomic secrets may be unknown, but there are fewer mysteries in the case of Taishen Guo and Greg Bergerson. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2857.76s)]
*  The FBI says that Guo wanted to expand his Louisiana businesses into China, and when he sought permission from Beijing, the Chinese asked for a few favors for their intelligence service. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2865.76s)]
*  The $2,000 was only part of Guo's development of Bergerson. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2878.76s)]
*  Guo wined and dined his spy, and Bergerson seemed to have an appetite for espionage. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2884.76s)]
*  At one dinner, Guo's tab came to $710. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2890.76s)]
*  Guo took Bergerson to Las Vegas for some shows, and the day of the ride, Guo brought a box of expensive cigars. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2895.76s)]
*  All the while, Guo lied to Bergerson, telling him that the information was being passed to Taiwan, the U.S. ally. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2903.76s)]
*  Does that make any difference in the law, whether you're spying for a hostile government or a friendly one? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2911.76s)]
*  Of course not. Classified information is not allowed to be passed without certain approvals to any foreign government. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2917.76s)]
*  But I think when you see the information, you can get out of it what you need. You can take all the notes you want. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2923.76s)]
*  It's just, I cannot ever let anyone know, because that's my job. I get fired for sure on that. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2932.76s)]
*  Well, if I don't even get fired, I'll go to f***ing jail. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2941.76s)]
*  The recruitment of Bergerson has a familiar ring to Fengjie Li. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2944.76s)]
*  Li recruited spies for China as an officer in the Ministry of State Security. The MSS is their CIA. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2949.76s)]
*  Give me a sense of all the different ways you would persuade someone to spy for China. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2958.76s)]
*  That should be a long story. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2965.76s)]
*  I've got time. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2967.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2968.76s)]
*  In our interview, Li switched between English and Mandarin. He worked for Chinese intelligence 14 years, recruiting spies in Russia. He's now seeking political asylum in the U.S. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2969.76s)]
*  Let me say this. Intelligence work is different from other kind of work. When I target a hundred people, even if 99 people have refused me, if there is one I persuade... [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2983.76s)]
*  That's enough. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2994.76s)]
*  That's enough. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2995.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2997.76s)]
*  Li told us that he recruited spies through blackmail and sometimes greed, especially if someone wanted to do business in China. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=2999.76s)]
*  Once, he says, his agents recruited the official photographer for a European head of state that he still won't name. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3008.76s)]
*  Would you say the MSS spends most of its effort on the United States? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3016.76s)]
*  Definitely, without a doubt. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3020.76s)]
*  What would some examples be of the kind of information that MSS was interested in getting a hold of? [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3024.76s)]
*  For example, what President Obama thinks right now. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3029.76s)]
*  They want to know what President Obama thinks. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3036.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3038.76s)]
*  If you make me part of the owner... [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3039.76s)]
*  Thanks to Greg Bergerson, the Chinese were about to find out just what sort of weapons America intended to sell to Taiwan. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3041.76s)]
*  The day of that car ride, Bergerson drove Guo and the secret documents to a restaurant outside Washington, D.C. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3048.76s)]
*  Inside the restaurant, Guo copied the secrets by hand. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3055.76s)]
*  Out in the parking lot, Bergerson waited with a glass of wine, one of those cigars, and the FBI in tow. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3060.76s)]
*  As they left, Bergerson just couldn't stop talking. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3067.76s)]
*  But I will be very careful to keep my tracks clean and no fingerprints. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3073.76s)]
*  Just like these documents, no fingerprints. I can't afford to lose my job. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3079.76s)]
*  Later, Guo left the U.S. for Beijing. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3085.76s)]
*  But while he waited for his flight, federal agents got into his bags, photocopied his handwritten notes, and put them back. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3088.76s)]
*  Guo's notes matched the secret document on the right. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3097.76s)]
*  But John Slattery, who oversaw the case for the FBI, told us the Bureau didn't make arrests until six months later. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3101.76s)]
*  But I mean, this is drop-dead evidence. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3108.76s)]
*  And espionage is occurring. Why didn't you arrest them sooner than that? [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3112.76s)]
*  Well, these investigations are tremendously complex and tremendously difficult to begin with. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3117.76s)]
*  The Department of Defense wants you to stop it right away. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3124.76s)]
*  Please, sooner than later. But the FBI says, listen, we want to make sure we can sustain a conviction here. And are there other players in this? [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3126.76s)]
*  Turns out there were other players. Guo had another source inside the Pentagon. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3135.76s)]
*  And Guo was connected to spies on the West Coast who were giving up U.S. space and naval technology. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3140.76s)]
*  Presumably, the U.S. is doing the same kind of spying in China. But Michelle Van Cleave says America has so much more to lose. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3147.76s)]
*  I think we're a real candy store for the Chinese and for others in terms of technology and commercial products, rather proprietary information. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3156.76s)]
*  And so we will always be the principal target for them. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3167.76s)]
*  What is the most serious damage that Chinese espionage has done to the United States? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3170.76s)]
*  It's the totality of the collection effort. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3176.76s)]
*  Take a case like this or cases like this, traditional espionage, penetration of the interior, couple that with industrial and economic collection, couple that with cyber. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3179.76s)]
*  It greatly concerns me. It greatly concerns me. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3191.76s)]
*  Bergersen kept saying, I could go to jail. And both men did. In 2008, prosecutors showed them this tape and they pled guilty. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3210.76s)]
*  Bergersen got almost five years for communicating national defense information. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3219.76s)]
*  Guo, a naturalized American citizen, is in a U.S. prison doing 15 years for espionage. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3224.76s)]
*  Prison may have been the best option Bergersen had because after he left the car, Guo pulled out his own tape recorder. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3231.76s)]
*  We'll never know why he taped the damning conversation, but it is classic spycraft to use blackmail to get it ever deeper and deeper secrets. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3240.76s)]
*  For every case that is broken, like the Bergersen case, for example, how many others are there that we have no idea about? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3250.76s)]
*  Oh, it's not the important question. You never know what you don't know. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3260.76s)]
*  But certainly we have seen such an extensive range of activities by the Chinese that it should make you very uncomfortable. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3264.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrKZtIBYx3I&t=3290.76s)]
