# Our latest immigration reports | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik)
*  Three weeks ago, 238 Venezuelan migrants were flown from Texas to a maximum security prison [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=0.0s)]
*  in El Salvador. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=19.36s)]
*  That country's president offered to take them, and the Trump administration used a [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=21.04s)]
*  law not invoked since World War II to send them, claiming they are all terrorists and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=25.28s)]
*  violent gang members. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=30.8s)]
*  The government has released very little information about the men, but through internal government [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=32.64s)]
*  documents we've obtained a list of their identities and found that an overwhelming [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=37.6s)]
*  majority have no apparent criminal convictions or even criminal charges. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  They are now prisoners. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=47.88s)]
*  Among them, a makeup artist, a soccer player, and a food delivery driver. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=49.72s)]
*  Being held in a place so harsh that El Salvador's justice minister once said the only way out [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=54.88s)]
*  is in a coffin. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=60.68s)]
*  The shackled men were forced to lower their heads and bodies as they were unloaded from [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=61.68s)]
*  buses and taken to El Salvador's mega prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=68.56s)]
*  or SECOT. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=74.72s)]
*  Andres Hernandez Romero was among them. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=76.4s)]
*  Andres is a 31-year-old Venezuelan. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=79.4s)]
*  He's a makeup artist. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  He is a gay man. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=85.04s)]
*  He loves to do theater. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  He was part of a theater troupe in his hometown. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=88.76s)]
*  Lindsay Toslowski, Andres' attorney, says he does not have a criminal record in the United [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=92.0s)]
*  States or Venezuela. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=97.12s)]
*  She says he left his home country last year because he was targeted for being gay and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=99.44s)]
*  for his political views. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=104.28s)]
*  Last May, Andres made the long trek north through the Darien Gap to Mexico where he [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  eventually got an appointment to seek asylum in the United States. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=111.96s)]
*  At a legal border crossing near San Diego, he was taken into custody while his case was [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=116.36s)]
*  processed. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  Did he have a strong asylum case? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=122.96s)]
*  We believe he did have a strong asylum case. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=124.96s)]
*  He had also done a credible fear interview, which is the very first part of seeking asylum [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=127.24s)]
*  in the United States, and the government had found that his threats against him were credible [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=132.76s)]
*  and that he had a real probability of winning an asylum claim. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=137.88s)]
*  But last month, Andres did not appear for a court hearing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=141.76s)]
*  Our client who was in the middle of seeking asylum just disappeared. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=145.6s)]
*  One day he was there and the next day we're supposed to have court and he wasn't brought [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=150.16s)]
*  to court. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=154.89999999999998s)]
*  You use the word disappeared. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=155.89999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I use that word because that's what happened. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  But Andres did appear in photos taken by Time magazine photographer Philip Holsinger, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=161.24s)]
*  who was there when the Venezuelans arrived at Secote. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=166.68s)]
*  Holsinger told us he heard a young man say, I'm not a gang member, I'm gay, I'm a stylist. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=170.44s)]
*  And then he cried for his mother as he was slapped and had his head shaved. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=177.08s)]
*  By comparing Holsinger's photographs to photos of Andres' tattoos taken by the government, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  we were able to confirm that this is Andres. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=187.34s)]
*  His lawyer, who was representing him pro bono, had never seen these photos before. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=190.82s)]
*  It's horrifying to see someone who we've met and know as a sweet, funny artist in the most [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=200.14s)]
*  horrible conditions I could imagine. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=212.0s)]
*  You fear for Andres' safety in there? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=217.42s)]
*  We have grave concerns about whether he can survive. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=218.5s)]
*  In October, Tom Homan, who is now the White House border czar, told 60 Minutes the Trump [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=222.66s)]
*  administration's mass deportation plan would start by removing the worst of the worst. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=228.26s)]
*  We're going to prioritize those with convictions, we're going to prioritize those security threats, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=234.42s)]
*  we have to do that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=237.7s)]
*  You've got to get the worst first. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=238.7s)]
*  But are they the worst? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=240.54s)]
*  The Trump administration has yet to release the identities of the Venezuelan men it sent [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=241.98s)]
*  to El Salvador last month. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=246.46s)]
*  We obtained internal government documents listing their names and any known criminal [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=248.68s)]
*  information. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  We cross-referenced that with domestic and international court filings, news reports, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=254.68s)]
*  and arrest records whenever we could find them. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=259.64s)]
*  At least 22% of the men on the list have criminal records here in the United States or abroad. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=262.8s)]
*  The vast majority are for nonviolent offenses like theft, shoplifting, and trespassing. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=269.76s)]
*  About a dozen are accused of murder, rape, assault, and kidnapping. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=276.0s)]
*  For 3% of those deported, it is unclear whether a criminal record exists. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=280.4s)]
*  But we could not find criminal records for 75% of the Venezuelan's 179 men now sitting [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=285.72s)]
*  in prison. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=293.16s)]
*  In response to our findings, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said many [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=295.2s)]
*  of those without criminal records, quote, are actually terrorists, human rights abusers, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=300.12s)]
*  gangsters, and more. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  They just don't have a rap sheet in the U.S. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=307.46s)]
*  Border czar Tom Homan said immigration agents spent hours conducting rigorous checks on [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=310.56s)]
*  each of the men to confirm they are members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang President [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=316.06s)]
*  Trump campaigned on eradicating. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=322.08s)]
*  To expedite removals of the Tren de Aragua savage gangs, I will invoke the Alien Enemies [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=324.44s)]
*  Act of 1798 to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=331.84s)]
*  soil. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=339.0s)]
*  But in Andres' case, the only evidence the government presented in immigration court [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=340.64s)]
*  were these pictures of his tattoos, crowns which immigration authorities say can be a [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=345.28s)]
*  symbol of Tren de Aragua. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=350.8s)]
*  These are tattoos that not only have a plausible explanation because he is someone who worked [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=353.16s)]
*  in the beauty pageant industry, but also the crowns themselves were on top of the names [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=358.88000000000005s)]
*  of his parents. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=363.76000000000005s)]
*  The most plausible explanation for that are that his mom and dad are his king and queen. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  Could it be possible that there is something that perhaps the government knows that you [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=370.04s)]
*  don't? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't think that that is possible. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=376.36s)]
*  But if it was possible that they had some information, they should follow the Constitution, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=378.6s)]
*  present that information, give us the ability to reply to it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=384.68s)]
*  A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said on social media that its intelligence [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=389.16s)]
*  assessments go well beyond just gang-affiliate tattoos. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=394.12s)]
*  She said Andres' own social media indicates he is a member of Tren de Aragua. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  We went back a decade and could only find photos like these. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=403.92s)]
*  Tattoos and social media were also used to link another Venezuelan migrant, Herce Reyes [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=409.08000000000004s)]
*  Barrios, to the Tren de Aragua gang. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=414.24s)]
*  Immigration court documents include this Facebook post from 14 years ago showing him flashing [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=417.96000000000004s)]
*  what officers said was a gang sign. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=423.56s)]
*  His girlfriend told us it was all about rock and roll. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=426.8s)]
*  Colombian agents also flagged Herce's crown tattoo as a gang symbol, but they did not [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  mention the crown is above a soccer ball. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=436.08000000000004s)]
*  Herce was a soccer player in Venezuela. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=438.72s)]
*  His lawyer says the tattoo honors his favorite team, Real Madrid, whose logo includes a crown. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=441.96000000000004s)]
*  Organized crime analysts told us members of the Salvadoran MS-13 gang can often be identified [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=448.72s)]
*  by signature tattoos, but Tren de Aragua is different. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=455.40000000000003s)]
*  Are tattoos a reliable indicator of membership in Tren de Aragua? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=460.04s)]
*  No. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=464.88s)]
*  Expert after expert tells us tattoos are not a reliable indicator of whether you're part [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=465.88s)]
*  of this particular gang. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=471.08000000000004s)]
*  Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, is leading the legal [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=473.20000000000005s)]
*  challenge against the Trump administration's efforts to send migrants to Secot. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  There are a lot of people who might hear what you're saying and say, these people don't [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=483.12s)]
*  have papers. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=487.72s)]
*  They should be deported. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=488.84s)]
*  To that you say what? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=491.28s)]
*  If they are here illegally and don't have a right to stay, they can be deported back [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=493.08s)]
*  to their home country. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=497.88s)]
*  If they've committed crimes, they can be prosecuted and perhaps spend many, many years in a U.S. prison. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=499.35999999999996s)]

*  Last month, President Trump did what he had promised on the campaign trail. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=521.2s)]
*  He invoked a 1798 law called the Alien Enemies Act, which allows the president to remove [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=525.4s)]

*  When is something going to occur? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1379.22s)]

*  elected he'll conduct the largest deportation in American history. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1581.32s)]
*  There are more than 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, about [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1585.8799999999999s)]
*  3% of the population. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1590.6799999999998s)]
*  Nearly 80% of them have lived in the country for a decade or more. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1592.8s)]
*  How realistic is this mass deportation campaign promise? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1597.1599999999999s)]
*  What would be the human and financial cost? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1601.0s)]
*  We took these questions to one of the people Donald Trump has said would join him if he [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1603.72s)]
*  wins a second term, Tom Homan, who led immigration enforcement during the first Trump administration [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1607.84s)]
*  when thousands of migrant children were separated from their parents at the border. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1614.16s)]
*  I hear a lot of people say the talk of a mass deportation is racist, it's threatening to [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1619.56s)]
*  immigrant community. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1626.3600000000001s)]
*  It's not threatening to an immigrant community. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1628.48s)]
*  It should be threatening to the illegal immigrant community. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1630.2s)]
*  But on the heels of historic illegal immigration crisis, that has to be done. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1633.64s)]
*  How you doing? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1640.3200000000002s)]
*  At the Republican National Convention this summer, Tom Homan was the proud pitchman of [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1642.2s)]
*  mass deportation. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1647.0s)]
*  I got a message to the millions of illegal immigrants that Joe Biden's released in our [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1648.0s)]
*  country, you better start packing now. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1652.68s)]
*  Over three decades, he worked his way up from border patrolman to acting director of immigration [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1656.88s)]
*  and customs enforcement, the agency known as ICE, during the first year and a half of [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1661.82s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1666.74s)]
*  This election cycle, former President Trump has mentioned mass deportation at nearly every [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1668.82s)]
*  rally. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1674.34s)]
*  We will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country because we have [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1675.34s)]
*  no choice. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1681.98s)]
*  What would the largest deportation in American history look like to you? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1684.54s)]
*  Let me tell you what it's not going to be first. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1690.22s)]
*  It's not going to be a mass sweep of neighborhoods. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1692.46s)]
*  It's not going to be building concentration camps. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1695.68s)]
*  I've read it all. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1698.38s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1699.38s)]
*  But if mass deportation is not going to be, as you said, massive sweeps in concentration [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1700.38s)]
*  camps, what is it? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1705.3s)]
*  There'll be targeted arrests. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1706.66s)]
*  We'll know who we're going to arrest, where we're most likely to find them based on numerous [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1708.42s)]
*  investigative processes. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1712.8600000000001s)]
*  Former President Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, said it would be reasonable to deport [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1716.82s)]
*  a million people a year. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1720.98s)]
*  Trump's top immigration adviser, Stephen Miller, told a conservative audience that deportees [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1723.26s)]
*  would be removed from the country in a massive military air operation. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1728.1799999999998s)]
*  So you grab illegal immigrants and then you move them to the staging grounds and that's [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1732.62s)]
*  what the planes are waiting for federal law enforcement to then move those illegals home. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1736.4199999999998s)]
*  You deputize the National Guard to carry out immigration enforcement. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1740.96s)]
*  Stephen Miller said that this will involve large-scale raids. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1744.54s)]
*  I don't use the term raids, but you're probably talking about worksite enforcement operations, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1749.3s)]
*  which this administration pretty much stopped. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1753.74s)]
*  Workplace enforcement, that's a roundup. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1756.42s)]
*  And that's going to be necessary. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1758.3799999999999s)]
*  Worksite enforcement operates just not about people who's working illegally in the country [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1760.78s)]
*  and companies that hire them that's going to undercut their competition. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1763.86s)]
*  I had U.S. citizen employees. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1766.3s)]
*  That's where we find a lot of trafficking cases, women and children who are forced into [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1768.22s)]
*  forced labor to pay off their smuggling fees. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1773.26s)]
*  A study by the American Immigration Council found that mass deportation could result in [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1775.46s)]
*  the removal of millions of construction, hospitality and agriculture workers, reducing the GDP [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1780.06s)]
*  by $1.7 trillion. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1786.1599999999999s)]
*  Can you just limit it to criminals and national security threat though? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1789.3s)]
*  If I'm in charge of this, my priorities are public safety threats and national security [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1793.34s)]
*  threats first. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1796.6599999999999s)]
*  First implies others follow though, right? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1798.98s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1801.8999999999999s)]
*  So game that out for me. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1802.94s)]
*  What's the scenario? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1804.14s)]
*  It's not okay to enter a country illegally, which is a crime. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1805.14s)]
*  That's what drives illegal immigration. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1808.98s)]
*  When there's no consequences, the Biden-Harris administration has proven this. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1811.02s)]
*  You can get to the border, turn yourselves in, get released within 24 hours. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1814.96s)]
*  So you are carrying out a targeted enforcement operation. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1820.14s)]
*  Grandma's in the house. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1823.22s)]
*  She's undocumented. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1824.7800000000002s)]
*  Does she get arrested too? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1825.7800000000002s)]
*  It depends. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1827.38s)]
*  Which? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1828.38s)]
*  Let the judge decide. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1829.38s)]
*  We're going to remove people that judges already deported. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1830.38s)]
*  Home in suggestion that grandma might face arrest would mark a major shift in policy. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1833.42s)]
*  Under President Biden, ICE is mostly targeting those deemed national security or public safety [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1839.9s)]
*  threats and people who just crossed the border illegally. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1845.74s)]
*  The majority of the four million deportations carried out by the Biden administration have [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1851.74s)]
*  occurred at the southern border where an unprecedented influx of migrants created [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1856.56s)]
*  scenes of chaos, a humanitarian crisis, and one of vice president Harris's biggest political [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1863.84s)]
*  vulnerabilities. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1869.84s)]
*  Homan says mass deportation is the solution. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1871.72s)]
*  How many people would be deported? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1875.34s)]
*  That's a, you can't ask that question. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1878.48s)]
*  Why not? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1880.6799999999998s)]
*  How many officers do I have? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1882.1599999999999s)]
*  Is there a written plan on this? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1883.6799999999998s)]
*  Not that I know of. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1885.32s)]
*  If there's no memo, if there's no plan, is this fully baked? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1887.2s)]
*  We've done it before. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1893.84s)]
*  But not a deportation of this scale. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1895.72s)]
*  ICE is very good at these operations. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1898.6799999999998s)]
*  This is what they do. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1900.78s)]
*  To see what they do, we went to Silver Spring, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C., where [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1904.34s)]
*  ICE agents gathered in a parking lot before dawn. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1911.08s)]
*  It's what ICE does every day and has been doing for many years. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1915.84s)]
*  Their task this morning, locate and arrest undocumented immigrants with criminal histories, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1921.0s)]
*  including assault, robbery, drug and gun convictions, identified by ICE as a threat to public safety. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1926.4399999999998s)]
*  Matt Elliston, director of ICE's Baltimore field office, told us the goal was to catch [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1937.0s)]
*  the first target by surprise. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1941.6799999999998s)]
*  You've been watching him. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1944.56s)]
*  You know his routine. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1947.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we know his routine. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1948.8799999999999s)]
*  We've been watching him for a couple days. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1949.8799999999999s)]
*  Wait till he gets about in front of my vehicle. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1951.36s)]
*  Sure enough, a white van soon appeared to pick him up, but they didn't get very far. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1954.1599999999999s)]
*  What do you got in your hand? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1960.3999999999999s)]
*  The man they arrested was a 24-year-old Guatemalan with an assault conviction who had been ordered [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1964.28s)]
*  deported by a judge five years ago. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1969.44s)]
*  The ICE agents discovered that the driver of the van was also in the country illegally. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1973.78s)]
*  They told us he'd been deported once before. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1978.8s)]
*  He has no criminal record. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1981.16s)]
*  He was picking up his employees to go to work. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1983.44s)]
*  It doesn't make sense to waste a detention bed on someone like that when we have other [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1985.8799999999999s)]
*  felons to go out and get today. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1990.12s)]
*  A lot of folks might hear you and say, like, hold on, you've got an undocumented immigrant [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1992.08s)]
*  who comes face to face with ICE who's responsible for deporting folks from this country, and [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=1995.84s)]
*  you let them go. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2001.68s)]
*  We utilize immigration law to enhance public safety. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2002.84s)]
*  It's not to just aimlessly arrest anyone we come across, right? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2005.96s)]
*  We do targeted enforcement in ICE. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2009.04s)]
*  It took a team of more than a dozen officers seven hours to arrest six people, and that [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2013.2s)]
*  doesn't include the many hours spent searching for them. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2018.92s)]
*  So how would it even be possible then for ICE to arrest a million people in this country [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2023.96s)]
*  if that mass deportation plan were to take effect? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2031.04s)]
*  I could say here in Maryland, we would never be able to resource or find that amount of [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2034.0800000000002s)]
*  detention, which would be our biggest challenge, right? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2038.3600000000001s)]
*  And just the amount of money that that would cost in order to detain everybody, you know, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2041.64s)]
*  would be at the Department of Defense level of financing. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2046.72s)]
*  It's insane to think about it at this sort of scale. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2050.68s)]
*  Jason Hauser, ICE chief of staff during the first two years of the Biden administration, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2053.4s)]
*  go ahead and take it off for me. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2058.52s)]

*  The average stay as they await deportation is 46 days. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2065.96s)]
*  One deportation flight can cost a quarter of a million dollars, and that assumes the [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2070.48s)]
*  home country will accept them. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2075.24s)]
*  Many like Cuba and Venezuela rarely do. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2077.4799999999996s)]
*  ICE currently has some 6,000 law enforcement agents. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2080.64s)]
*  How much manpower would it take to arrest and deport a million people? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2085.56s)]
*  You're talking 100,000 official officers, police officers, detention officers, support [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2090.64s)]
*  staff, management staff. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2097.9199999999996s)]
*  Trump adviser Stephen Miller has said staff could come from other government agencies [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2099.52s)]
*  like the DEA. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2103.98s)]
*  The idea that you're going to take the FBI or the Marshals Service or the Bureau of Prisons [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2104.98s)]
*  or the Secret Service or FEMA off of their mission sets that protect and protect our [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2110.3s)]
*  communities will not make us safer. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2116.7s)]
*  Immigration enforcement requires specialized training and language skills that most military [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2123.54s)]
*  and law enforcement officers don't have. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2128.14s)]
*  There's this discussion out there that makes it sound like it's just an easy swap. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2131.02s)]
*  It is not an easy swap. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2135.7s)]
*  So what I can tell you from the Immigration and Nationality Act, immigration law is second [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2136.7s)]
*  to the U.S. tax code and complexity. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2142.18s)]
*  We have seen one estimate that says it would cost $88 billion to deport a million people [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2144.92s)]
*  a year. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2152.22s)]
*  I don't know if that's accurate or not. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2153.22s)]
*  Is that what American taxpayers should expect? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2156.28s)]
*  What price do you put on international security? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2159.2s)]
*  Is that worth it? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2160.74s)]
*  Is there a way to carry out mass deportation without separating families? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2161.94s)]
*  Of course there is. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2166.14s)]
*  Families can be deported together. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2170.1s)]
*  Sit. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2172.14s)]
*  Monica Camacho Perez and her family worry about that. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2173.54s)]
*  They have lived and worked in the country since coming illegally from Mexico more than [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2177.18s)]
*  20 years ago. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2181.06s)]
*  What scares you the most? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2182.68s)]
*  I think of my nieces and my nephews that they're going to get separated from their parents. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2184.06s)]
*  They made a life in Baltimore where Monica, who's 30, teaches English as a second language. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2190.62s)]
*  We are a normal family like anybody else. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2200.6s)]
*  We go to church, we work every day, we pay taxes. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2204.94s)]
*  She's among the more than 500,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2210.78s)]
*  who are protected from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2216.1400000000003s)]
*  known as DACA. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2221.42s)]
*  I'm the only one right now that's protected while my parents are not, my brothers are [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2222.42s)]
*  not. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2227.78s)]
*  My brothers have children that are born here. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2228.78s)]
*  So if they were to get deported, what would happen to their kids? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2232.1400000000003s)]
*  Although I have my life here. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2237.7000000000003s)]
*  I think that I would take the decision to go back with my parents to take care of them. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2240.08s)]
*  You would? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2248.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2249.0s)]
*  You own a home here. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2250.0s)]
*  This is the city you grew up in. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2251.0s)]
*  But they're also part of my American dream. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2252.92s)]
*  And I can't imagine living here without them. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2260.04s)]
*  Like Monica's nieces and nephews, more than four million U.S.-born children live with [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2264.12s)]
*  an undocumented parent. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2268.68s)]
*  Why should a child who is an American citizen have to pack up and move to a country that [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2270.8799999999997s)]
*  they don't know? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2277.64s)]
*  Because their parent obviously entered the country illegally, had a child knowing he [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2278.64s)]
*  was in the country illegally, so he created that crisis. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2282.48s)]
*  While Homan ran ICE, in what became one of the most controversial policies of the Trump [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2286.0s)]
*  administration, at least 5,000 migrant children were forcibly separated from their parents [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2290.6s)]
*  who were prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2296.56s)]
*  You've been called the father of Trump's family separation policy. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2299.72s)]
*  How does that sit with you? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2303.84s)]
*  It's not true. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2304.84s)]
*  I didn't write the memorandum to separate families. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2305.84s)]
*  I signed the memo. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2309.64s)]
*  Why did I sign the memo? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2310.64s)]
*  I was hoping to save lives. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2313.64s)]
*  While you and I are talking right now, a child is going to die in the border. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2315.52s)]
*  So we thought maybe if we prosecute people, it will stop coming. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2318.16s)]
*  And if Trump wins a second term? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2322.48s)]
*  I don't know of any form of policy, but they're talking about family separation. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2325.12s)]
*  Should it be on the table? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2328.6s)]
*  It needs to be considered, absolutely. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2329.6s)]
*  Do you think a mass deportation plan would deter other people from coming to this country [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2332.96s)]
*  illegally? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2338.68s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2339.68s)]
*  Regardless, people are still going to try to come for a better life. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2341.24s)]
*  There's no denying immigration has become one of the most important and contentious [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2345.48s)]
*  issues in this presidential election year. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2358.56s)]
*  And there's no better example of that than the high stakes fight between the state of [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2361.44s)]
*  Texas and the Biden administration. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2365.08s)]
*  Three years ago, Texas's Republican Governor Greg Abbott launched Operation Lone Star, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2368.0s)]
*  deploying thousands of police and soldiers and miles of barriers to deter record numbers [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2373.44s)]
*  of illegal crossings. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2378.7200000000003s)]
*  The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that immigration is the job of the federal government. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2380.52s)]
*  But as we first reported earlier this year, rarely has a state so aggressively challenged [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2385.7200000000003s)]
*  that authority. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2390.76s)]
*  In January, Governor Abbott ordered his state national guard to block the federal government's [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2392.2400000000002s)]
*  border patrol from Shelby Park, a dusty stretch of border along the Rio Grande in Eagle Pass, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2396.88s)]
*  To understand why, you need to see what happened there in December. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2403.96s)]
*  We were on the banks of the river before dawn with soldiers from the Texas National Guard. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2409.52s)]
*  We heard the cries of people before we could see their faces. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2414.6s)]
*  It wasn't until we moved closer that we realized how many people had just crossed from Mexico. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2420.0s)]
*  The soldiers told them it was dangerous to cross here. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2428.08s)]
*  Help us, they begged. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2431.7599999999998s)]
*  Some of the women cried. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2437.08s)]
*  We have children. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2438.48s)]
*  We heard groans and found this young man twisting in the wire. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2442.68s)]
*  He kept going. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2448.72s)]
*  Stay calm, they told each other as families pushed their children through. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2453.92s)]
*  Nearly everyone we saw made it across and into the United States. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2462.92s)]
*  Thousands of people a day crossed here in late December, a record for this section of [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2469.44s)]
*  the Texas border. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2474.0s)]
*  There were so many people, the U.S. Border Patrol had to transform Shelby Park into an [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2476.32s)]
*  open-air holding center. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2481.72s)]
*  Weeks later, once the surge died down, Governor Abbott ordered his Texas National Guard to [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2484.2s)]
*  block the federal government's Border Patrol from entering the park without permission. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2489.2799999999997s)]
*  Governor Abbott argued the federal government had failed to fulfill its obligation to the [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2494.3999999999996s)]
*  states, and in that, some heard echoes of Texas' history of rebellion and threats of [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2498.9199999999996s)]
*  secession. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2504.64s)]
*  I can't believe, Governor, I'm going to ask you this question, but I'm going to ask you, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2505.64s)]
*  Do you believe that Texas has the right to secede? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2509.44s)]
*  Is that what we're talking about here? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2512.44s)]
*  Those are false narratives, what Texas and the United States have the right to do, and [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2514.12s)]
*  that's to enforce the law. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2520.16s)]
*  You heard the argument against what you're doing out here. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2521.64s)]
*  Each state can't control its own border policy. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2524.44s)]
*  You're looking at a completely chaotic system. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2526.92s)]
*  That's the job of the federal government. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2528.96s)]
*  We're not imposing a Texas border policy. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2530.4s)]
*  Texas very simply is enforcing the laws that are the policy of the United States Congress. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2533.56s)]
*  What gives you the authority to tell the U.S. Border Patrol what to do? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2539.48s)]
*  For one, as governor of the state of Texas, I have the authority to control ingress and [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2543.08s)]
*  egress to any land in the state of Texas. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2547.56s)]
*  For another, this land we're on right now was used by the federal government to further [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2550.8s)]
*  illegal activity, and I wanted to put a stop to it. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2556.08s)]
*  We went behind the guarded gates of Shelby Park in January, shortly after Governor Abbott [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2559.96s)]
*  had taken control. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2564.8s)]
*  So this is called an anti-climber. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2565.8s)]
*  Texas Department of Public Safety Lieutenant Christopher Olivares showed us where state [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2567.96s)]
*  national guardsmen were installing fresh razor wire barriers along the river. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2572.64s)]
*  Help me understand at the heart of this why Texas has a problem with the Border Patrol [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2577.56s)]
*  coming in to process migrants in this park. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2584.44s)]
*  The issue is trying to prevent another influx, because when Border Patrol is here setting [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2587.44s)]
*  up a processing center, it's going to attract, it's going to encourage more migrants to [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2593.04s)]
*  cross the river because they know where to go. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2597.32s)]
*  It's one of many spots along the Texas border where coils of sharp wire have been going [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2600.2400000000002s)]

*  Since then, thousands of migrants have been arrested and detained on trespassing charges. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2610.32s)]
*  State troopers have cracked down on human smuggling rings. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2617.8s)]
*  And the state has spent more than $150 million sending migrants on buses to cities like New [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2621.84s)]
*  York and Chicago, turning the trouble at the border into a political and financial headache [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2627.6400000000003s)]
*  for Democratic mayors. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2633.1200000000003s)]
*  Once the site of ballgames and flea markets, Shelby Park is now Governor Abbott's model [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2635.4s)]
*  of what the Texas border can be. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2640.52s)]
*  Where we are right now, there used to be 3,000 or 4,000 people crossing illegally a day. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2642.88s)]
*  For the past three days, there's an average of just three people crossing the border illegally. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2649.1s)]
*  You don't just plant a flag just to plant a flag. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2654.42s)]
*  It's got to be strategic and it's got to make sense. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2656.7s)]
*  Raul Ortiz served as chief of the U.S. Border Patrol under President Biden and deputy chief [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2659.66s)]
*  under President Trump. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2665.2599999999998s)]
*  He retired last year. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2666.86s)]
*  When agencies are making a decision based upon politics or whether they're going to [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2668.98s)]
*  get media coverage, hey, we're going to put all our personnel in this two-mile stretch. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2674.38s)]
*  What about the other 200 miles? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2679.46s)]
*  In our interview, Ortiz criticized Governor Abbott for not cooperating with the Border [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2681.3s)]
*  Patrol and playing politics with immigration. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2685.7400000000002s)]
*  But he also expressed frustration with President Biden. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2689.2200000000003s)]
*  I've never had one conversation with the president or the vice president for that matter. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2692.7000000000003s)]
*  And so I was the chief of the Border Patrol. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2697.7000000000003s)]
*  I commanded 21,000 people. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2699.94s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2703.38s)]
*  We saw 50 people today who had just crossed the border illegally. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2704.38s)]
*  So something's not working. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2710.86s)]
*  We need to make sure that Central America, South America, Mexico, that those regions [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2712.78s)]
*  understand that if you pay a smuggler and you cross in between the ports of entry and [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2719.1s)]
*  you do not have a legitimate claim to some sort of asylum benefit, you're going to be [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2724.1800000000003s)]
*  sent back. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2729.38s)]
*  Do you believe that the White House has sent mixed messages to migrants? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2730.38s)]
*  Yeah, most definitely. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2734.38s)]
*  We spoke with Ortiz in an area just four miles south of Shelby Park. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2736.28s)]
*  The ground was littered with wet clothes that migrants had changed out of and left behind [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2740.86s)]
*  after crossing the river. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2745.5s)]
*  Does all of this tell you that people are still crossing this river right here? [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2747.44s)]
*  Oh yeah, the guides or the smugglers will bring the migrants over. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2752.98s)]
*  This is all very calculated by the cartels that control these areas on the Mexican side. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2757.02s)]
*  About seven miles north of Shelby Park, we came upon this group of migrants who had just [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2762.58s)]
*  crossed the Rio Grande and were being picked up by the Border Patrol. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2767.44s)]
*  This mother and her two sons took buses from El Salvador. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2775.02s)]
*  She told us the soldiers on the U.S. side of the border weren't much of a deterrent. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2778.64s)]
*  She feared the cartels in Mexico more. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2783.34s)]
*  Sometimes they kidnap you and expect payment, she said. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2787.0s)]
*  The reality is people are still going to find a way to get in no matter how much manpower [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2790.8s)]
*  you have out here, no matter how much wire you put up. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2795.16s)]
*  This is great completely. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2797.44s)]
*  You do? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2798.44s)]
*  Yeah, because in Texas anyway, we're going to be barricading every area where people [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2799.44s)]
*  are crossing until we get every area to have like this area is right now. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2803.76s)]
*  Texas is going to barricade every area? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2809.52s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2811.92s)]
*  Every area where the cartels use as a crossing, we intend to be barricading. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2813.04s)]
*  Border is going to look like a war zone. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2817.36s)]
*  It is a war zone. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2819.08s)]
*  Over the past three years, the Biden administration has carried out over four million expulsions [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2820.3s)]
*  and deportations, more than the Trump administration. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2825.48s)]
*  But it has also allowed over three million people to remain in the country for years [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2828.4s)]
*  while their immigration cases are heard. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2833.84s)]
*  And the Border Patrol estimates another 1.6 million people have entered the country illegally [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2836.44s)]
*  without getting caught. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2842.12s)]
*  In February, former President Trump visited Shelby Park with Governor Abbott. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2843.92s)]
*  On the same day, President Biden was also at the Texas border in Brownsville. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2849.04s)]
*  Instead of playing politics with the issue, why don't we just get together and get it [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2853.12s)]
*  done? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2856.24s)]
*  President Biden says that if Republicans were serious about securing the border, they would [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2857.4s)]
*  not have rejected a bipartisan immigration deal in the Senate in February after former [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2861.72s)]
*  President Trump opposed it. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2866.72s)]
*  That deal would have increased funding for the Border Patrol and required the president [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2869.16s)]
*  to expel all migrants crossing illegally during surges like the one at Shelby Park in December. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2873.18s)]
*  The latest battle between Texas and Washington concerns a new law Governor Abbott signed [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2880.3599999999997s)]
*  authorizing Texas' more than 2,700 law enforcement agencies to arrest migrants for illegally [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2885.2599999999998s)]
*  crossing the border. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2891.48s)]
*  Texas judges could then order migrants to return to Mexico or serve time, bypassing [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2893.44s)]
*  the federal immigration system entirely. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2898.52s)]
*  Critics of the law say it is so broadly written, it fails to define when authorities can stop [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2902.36s)]
*  someone. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2907.44s)]
*  We asked Lieutenant Olivares of the Texas Department of Public Safety, or DPS, about [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2908.88s)]
*  the concern that immigrants and people of color could be subjected to racial profiling. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2913.88s)]
*  I can tell you that our troopers are not going to be stopping cars and checking for immigration [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2919.0s)]
*  status. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2921.7599999999998s)]
*  They're not. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2922.7599999999998s)]
*  But this law is not just written for DPS. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2923.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2925.16s)]
*  It's a Texas law. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2926.16s)]
*  The reality is, this is going to be carried out far from the border. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2927.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2930.48s)]
*  So couldn't you get caught up in it? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2931.48s)]
*  You're Latino. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2934.72s)]
*  Couldn't I get caught up in it? [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2935.72s)]
*  That's not the case. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2936.72s)]
*  They have to develop probable cause in order to stop a car. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2937.72s)]
*  You can't just go interview every single person in that car, ask them for immigration status. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2940.3199999999997s)]
*  But of course, yeah, there could be some issues where maybe some other agency outside of a [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2945.2s)]
*  border area could take that into account. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2948.7599999999998s)]
*  Is that making you nervous? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2951.92s)]
*  It's probable because there's a lot of agencies here in Texas that operate, right? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2952.92s)]
*  I would think that every chief at a police agency would have to implement some type of [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2956.2999999999997s)]
*  policy and procedure to actually enforce this new law. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2960.18s)]
*  In February, a federal judge stopped the new law from taking effect. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2963.98s)]
*  An appeals court is now considering the case. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2968.14s)]
*  The Department of Justice and the American Civil Liberties Union are suing Texas, arguing [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2970.98s)]
*  the law interferes with the federal government's authority over immigration. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2975.9399999999996s)]
*  But Governor Abbott argues Texas is being invaded and has the right to defend itself. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2980.58s)]
*  That idea has resonated with militias and groups opposed to illegal immigration. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2986.58s)]
*  Some joined a convoy in February and descended on the Eagle Pass area. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2991.7s)]
*  Everyone, I think, agrees that the immigration system right now is completely broken and [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=2996.46s)]
*  there's a lot of blame to go around. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3002.06s)]
*  But do you really truly believe that invasion is the right word to be using here? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3004.46s)]
*  Invasion is the word that's used in the United States Constitution. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3011.54s)]
*  Invasion or imminent danger. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3015.18s)]
*  I use them both. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3017.2200000000003s)]
*  And we are in imminent danger because of what the drug cartels do every single day, because [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3018.78s)]
*  of the known and unknown terrorists who cross every single day. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3024.7400000000002s)]
*  So the convoys and militia have heard the language and they've started to come to the [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3029.46s)]
*  point that migrants have had to be relocated from some locations for their own safety. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3034.62s)]
*  Are you not concerned about violence happening because of language like the word invasion? [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3039.66s)]
*  There's no language that would spur violence. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3045.1s)]
*  But I'll be clear about this. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3046.66s)]
*  We don't want violence of any type. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3048.54s)]
*  How does this end? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3050.86s)]
*  Oh, it is very simple. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3051.86s)]
*  And that's with a president of the United States who will actually fulfill his oath [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3054.26s)]
*  of office and enforce the laws of the United States of America. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3058.14s)]
*  That means denying illegal entry into our country. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3061.9s)]
*  Do you want to be Trump's running mate? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3064.2999999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3066.02s)]
*  What if he asks you? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3067.02s)]
*  Listen, I love being governor of Texas. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3068.02s)]
*  I can best aid him in my role by being a great governor of Texas. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3071.7799999999997s)]
*  So far, the governor has committed more than $11 billion to Operation Lone Star. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3076.8599999999997s)]
*  Over the last three years, the percentage of people entering Texas illegally has dropped [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3082.78s)]
*  while rising in other border states. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3088.0600000000004s)]
*  Abbott's critics say that has more to do with other factors like crackdowns on migration [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3090.5800000000004s)]
*  in parts of Mexico. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3095.6600000000003s)]
*  There are still more than a million illegal border crossings in Texas every year. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3097.6600000000003s)]
*  There are also at least a dozen lawsuits being fought between Texas and the federal government [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3102.86s)]
*  over immigration issues. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3107.7000000000003s)]
*  All that infighting worries former Border Patrol chief Raul Ortiz. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3109.54s)]
*  The National Guardsmen, even to some degree the Border Patrol agents, have become pawns [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3113.86s)]
*  in this political game between the two sides. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3118.1s)]
*  Who's winning? [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3120.58s)]
*  The cartels, the criminal organizations, that's who's winning in all of this. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3121.58s)]
*  They're sitting back reaping all the benefits while they watch the state of Texas and Washington, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3125.58s)]
*  D.C. go at it. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3131.7799999999997s)]
*  The number of migrants arriving at the southern border is unprecedented. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3139.54s)]
*  Last year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded 2.5 million instances of detaining [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3146.54s)]
*  or turning away people attempting to cross into the United States from Mexico. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3152.82s)]
*  So what's the fastest growing group among them? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3158.5s)]
*  Chinese migrants. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3161.98s)]
*  Yes, you heard that right, Chinese. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3162.98s)]
*  We saw large groups, including many from the middle class, come through a four-foot [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3165.68s)]
*  gap at the end of a border fence 60 miles east of San Diego. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3170.8399999999997s)]
*  The illegal entryway is a new route for those hoping to live in America. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3175.94s)]
*  Just after sunrise, we saw the first group of migrants make their way from Mexico through [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3184.9199999999996s)]
*  a gap between the 30-foot steel border fence and rocks. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3189.62s)]
*  Ducking under a bit of razor wire and into the United States. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3194.96s)]
*  We were surprised to see the number of people coming through from China, nearly 7,000 miles [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3203.96s)]
*  away. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3209.5s)]
*  Careful, watch. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3210.5s)]
*  Our cameras, and at one point, this armed border patrol agent standing 25 feet away, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3215.38s)]
*  did not deter them. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3221.36s)]
*  So how old are you? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3226.44s)]
*  This man, a college graduate, told us he hoped to find work in Los Angeles. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3229.6800000000003s)]
*  He said his trip from China took 40 days. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3234.08s)]
*  What countries did you go through? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3237.6s)]
*  30 minutes later, a smuggler's SUV raced along the border fence and dropped another [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3240.6s)]
*  group at the same spot. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3258.56s)]
*  Over four days, we witnessed nearly 600 migrants, adults and children, pass through this hole [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3268.8799999999997s)]
*  and onto U.S. soil, unchecked. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3278.3599999999997s)]
*  We saw people from India, Vietnam and Afghanistan. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3281.3599999999997s)]
*  Many of the Chinese migrants who came through will end up asking for political asylum. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3287.56s)]
*  Did you travel by yourself or with family or friends? [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3292.72s)]
*  No, just me. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3295.8799999999997s)]
*  The Gap is a global destination, littered with travel documents from around the world. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3297.6s)]
*  With the help of a translator, we learned a little about the Chinese migrants coming [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3310.64s)]
*  through. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3314.64s)]
*  We also met a banker and small business owners. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3319.64s)]
*  Some of the migrants made a grueling journey through Central America with dusty backpacks. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3324.8s)]
*  But we noticed middle-class migrants from China arriving with rolling bags. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3332.6000000000004s)]
*  They told us they took flights all the way to Mexico. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3337.5600000000004s)]
*  Some flew from China to Ecuador because it doesn't require a visa for Chinese nationals, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3342.04s)]
*  then took flights to Tijuana, Mexico. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3347.36s)]
*  The migrants told us they connected with smugglers, or what they call snakeheads in [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3351.36s)]
*  Tijuana. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3355.32s)]
*  And they each paid them about $400 for the hour-long drive that ended here at the Gap. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3360.76s)]
*  Why did you decide to come to the United States? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3369.44s)]
*  It's hard to live there. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3372.44s)]
*  It's hard to find jobs. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3377.44s)]
*  What did you do? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3384.32s)]
*  Did you work in China? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3385.32s)]
*  I used to work in the factory, but now it's hard to work in the factory. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3386.32s)]
*  Was this trip expensive? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3395.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3398.92s)]
*  She said it was, and that she sold her house to cover the $14,000 cost of her trip to [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3403.72s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3408.7599999999998s)]
*  Last year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported 37,000 Chinese citizens were apprehended [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3412.4399999999996s)]
*  crossing illegally from Mexico into the U.S. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3419.0s)]
*  That's 50 times more than two years earlier. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3423.12s)]
*  Many of the migrants told us they made the journey to escape China's increasingly repressive [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3430.08s)]
*  political climate and sluggish economy. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3434.6s)]
*  This 37-year-old woman said China's COVID lockdown destroyed her child care business. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3438.7999999999997s)]
*  She left her two young children with family at home. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3444.46s)]
*  Why did you decide to come to the United States? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3447.84s)]
*  For work? [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3455.4s)]
*  Not entirely. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3458.4s)]
*  What reasons? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3463.4s)]
*  Freedom. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3466.4s)]
*  Freedom. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3473.4s)]
*  We wondered how all of these migrants knew about this particular entryway into California. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3479.2s)]
*  The answer was in their hands. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3484.96s)]
*  What do you know about that? [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3486.96s)]
*  Oh, Tiktok. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3488.96s)]
*  Oh, you learned on Tiktok. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3489.96s)]
*  Tiktok is a social media platform created in China. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3492.96s)]
*  The post we found had step-by-step instructions for hiring smugglers and detailed directions [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3497.4399999999996s)]
*  to that hole we visited. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3503.6s)]
*  We were struck by just how orderly and routine it all seemed. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3507.76s)]
*  The migrants walked about a half mile down a dirt road and waited in line for U.S. Border [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3511.6400000000003s)]
*  Patrol to arrive so they could surrender. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3516.4s)]
*  How much property do you have here? [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3519.6000000000004s)]
*  The land they're waiting on is owned by 75-year-old Jerry Schuster, a retiree. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3521.6600000000003s)]

*  They're all doing this. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3530.4s)]
*  They're all doing this. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3531.4s)]
*  When they come over here, they come with the suitcases. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3532.4s)]
*  They come prepared with the computers just like they got off a Norwegian cruise ship [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3535.56s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3541.44s)]

*  I come from Yugoslavia and I left Yugoslavia, I went to Austria. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3556.44s)]

*  They don't care. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3573.1600000000003s)]
*  They come through their own country over here and nobody do nothing about it. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3577.32s)]
*  Schuster says it all started in May. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3584.08s)]
*  He went to investigate some smoke coming from his property and found migrants burning trees [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3586.7200000000003s)]

*  I would say that, yes. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3653.16s)]
*  Because this is an ongoing deal. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3655.56s)]

*  recorded instructions in Mandarin. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3665.88s)]

*  checks. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3677.52s)]
*  Some are interviewed. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3678.52s)]
*  Typically, within 72 hours, they are released into the United States and can begin the process [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3679.52s)]
*  of filing an asylum claim. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3685.56s)]
*  Jacqueline Arianno has volunteered on the border for eight years, offering humanitarian aid [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3689.8s)]
*  to migrants. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3695.04s)]

*  I have been able to rely on being bilingual in doing this work for the duration that I [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3699.16s)]
*  have been doing it. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3704.72s)]
*  And in this past year, I mean, there's been times that I've come to the sites and not [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3706.12s)]
*  spoken to a single Spanish speaker. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3710.2s)]
*  She relies on translation apps to communicate with Chinese migrants. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3712.2799999999997s)]
*  These people want to be picked up by border patrol. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3717.04s)]
*  Why isn't this happening at a port of entry? [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3718.8799999999997s)]
*  That would definitely be the ideal situation and people would much prefer to do so. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3721.2s)]
*  Definitely be much safer and more efficient. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3726.16s)]
*  Unfortunately, there are barriers to people being able to seek asylum at a port of entry. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3729.2s)]
*  One barrier is the phone app called CBP one asylum seekers are supposed to use the app [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3735.08s)]
*  to make an appointment to enter the U.S. through a legal border crossing. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3741.3599999999997s)]
*  As we saw last spring in Juarez, Mexico, the system is glitchy. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3745.74s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3750.04s)]
*  And it gets stuck. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3751.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3752.04s)]
*  One opportunity at nine o'clock. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3753.04s)]
*  No more. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3754.04s)]
*  Volunteers who work with migrants told us there's still a three to four month wait [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3755.88s)]
*  to secure an appointment at a border crossing. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3759.92s)]
*  So is this a shortcut? [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3763.0s)]
*  It's really like the only one that they have. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3764.56s)]
*  I don't even know that they would consider it a shortcut. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3766.36s)]
*  For years, millions of Chinese entered the U.S. with a visa that allowed them to visit, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3770.0s)]
*  work or study. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3775.04s)]
*  But in the last few years, those visas have been increasingly difficult to secure as tensions [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3776.38s)]
*  between the two countries have grown. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3782.08s)]
*  In 2016, the U.S. granted 2.2 million temporary visas to Chinese nationals. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3784.64s)]
*  In 2022, it was just 160,000. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3791.2s)]
*  So a lot of these folks may have come. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3795.72s)]
*  Tammy Lin is an immigration attorney and has worked with clients from China for nearly [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3797.44s)]
*  two decades. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3801.94s)]
*  If someone's not granted asylum here, will China then say, OK, yes, we'll take them back? [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3803.4s)]
*  I haven't seen that happen, really. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3810.2s)]
*  I think even back to 2008, a lot of the Chinese nationals that had failed asylum cases weren't [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3813.0s)]
*  able to get passports to be put on the plane to be sent back. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3820.36s)]
*  So we can't send you back. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3824.0s)]
*  Based on our review of data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, there are at least [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3827.56s)]
*  36,000 Chinese who have been ordered by U.S. courts to leave the country. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3832.36s)]
*  But China is notorious for not taking back its citizens, and the U.S. can't force China [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3837.96s)]
*  to accept them. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3843.56s)]
*  So then what happens if they have a failed claim but they can't go back to China? [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3845.16s)]
*  That's a very question. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3849.12s)]
*  They're stuck in this limbo. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3850.12s)]
*  According to the Department of Justice, last year, 55 percent of Chinese migrants were [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3852.32s)]
*  granted asylum, compared to 14 percent for every other nationality. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3857.2400000000002s)]
*  With the odds in their favor and a phone to guide them, there's little to discourage [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3863.76s)]
*  more Chinese migrants from coming through the gap near Jerry Schuster's place. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3867.92s)]
*  Have you said to anybody, hey, there's this giant hole they're coming through, how about [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3873.32s)]
*  patching that up? [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3877.76s)]
*  They know that thing is there. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3879.7200000000003s)]
*  And we've all been telling them, hey, when this thing is going to quit over here, you [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3881.92s)]
*  got to call Washington, D.C. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3886.92s)]
*  That's what they say. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3888.96s)]
*  So we did. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3890.76s)]
*  U.S. Customs and Border Protection told us their agents don't have authority to stop [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3892.12s)]
*  people from coming through gaps like this one, and can only arrest them after they've [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3896.68s)]
*  entered illegally. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3901.9s)]
*  As for closing that gap, they said it is on their priority list, but would require money [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3905.36s)]
*  from Congress. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oKqosJGik&t=3911.0s)]
