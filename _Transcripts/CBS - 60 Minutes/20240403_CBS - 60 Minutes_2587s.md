# Targeting Americans; Indian Relay | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [April 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s)
*  A car chase in Florida may have provided the vital clue to a national security mystery. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=0.0s)]
*  Many U.S. officials and their families believe they've been injured by a secret weapon in [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=20.6s)]
*  the hands of a foreign adversary. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=26.36s)]
*  It's devastating. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=29.4s)]
*  It's absolutely devastating. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  Tonight, for the first time, we have evidence of who might be responsible. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=32.6s)]
*  Are we being attacked? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=38.46s)]
*  My personal opinion, yes. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  By whom? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=42.0s)]
*  Russia. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=43.0s)]
*  Welcome to the 2023 Championship of Champions. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=44.0s)]
*  In Indian relay, as many as six thoroughbred racehorses are brought to a start line drawn [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=50.12s)]
*  in the dirt. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=55.84s)]
*  The horses are bareback, no saddles or stirrups. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=56.84s)]
*  Their riders wear no protective gear. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=60.36000000000001s)]
*  At the sound of a horn, they leap aboard and tear down the track. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=63.080000000000005s)]
*  These horses are able to run like you wouldn't believe. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=70.36s)]
*  But the hard part comes from jumping off. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=76.12s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=83.12s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=84.68s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=88.84s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=92.76s)]
*  Tonight, we have important developments in our five-year investigation of mysterious [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=104.44000000000001s)]
*  brain injuries reported by U.S. national security officials. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=110.68s)]
*  The injured include White House staff, CIA officers, FBI agents, military officers, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=115.84s)]
*  and their families. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=122.72s)]
*  Many believe that they were wounded by a secret weapon that fires a high-energy beam of microwaves [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=124.42s)]
*  or ultrasound. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=130.88s)]
*  This is our fourth story, and for the first time, we have evidence of who might be responsible. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=132.82s)]
*  Most of the injured have fought for America, often in secret, and they're frustrated that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=140.44s)]
*  the U.S. government publicly doubts that an adversary is targeting Americans. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=145.92s)]
*  One of them is Carrie. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=153.6s)]
*  We're disguising her and not using her last name because she's still an FBI agent working [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=155.68s)]
*  in counterintelligence. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=161.68s)]
*  She says in 2021 she was home in Florida when she was hit by a crippling force. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=164.0s)]
*  And bam, inside my right ear, it was like a dentist drilling on steroids. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=170.84s)]
*  That feeling when it gets too close to your eardrum, it's like that, you know, times 10. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=177.28s)]
*  It was like a high-pitched metallic drilling noise, and it knocked me forward at like a [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=183.9s)]
*  45-degree angle this way. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=189.24s)]
*  She says she was by a window in her laundry room. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=191.1s)]
*  My right ear was line of sight to that window while this thing was happening in my ear. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=194.72s)]
*  And when I leaned forward, it kind of knocked, it didn't knock me over, but it knocked me [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=200.2s)]
*  forward. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=203.1s)]
*  I immediately felt pressure, and pressure and pain started coursing from inside my right [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=204.1s)]
*  ear, down my jaw, down my neck, and into my chest. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=211.16s)]
*  At the same time, FBI agent Kerry told us the battery in her phone began to swell until [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=215.84s)]
*  it broke the case. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=222.98000000000002s)]
*  Finally, she passed out on a couch. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=224.9s)]
*  Because of chest pain, she was checked by a cardiologist and then returned to duty. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=228.72s)]
*  And I remember complaining to my colleagues for months after that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=234.26s)]
*  I felt like I had early Alzheimer's. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=239.62s)]
*  Short-term memory, long-term memory, confusing memories, multitasking. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=241.66s)]
*  My baseline changed. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=247.26s)]
*  I was not the same person. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=248.26s)]
*  Kerry's story matches those we've uncovered over the years. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=250.6s)]
*  It was like this piercing feeling on the side of my head. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  It was like I remember it was on the right side of my head, and I got like vertigo. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=259.06s)]
*  Olivia Troy was Homeland Security Advisor to Vice President Mike Pence. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  In our 2022 report, she told us she was hit outside the White House. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=269.58s)]
*  And then severe ear pain started. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=275.47999999999996s)]
*  So I liken it to if you put a Q-tip too far and you bounce off your eardrum, well, imagine [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=277.38s)]
*  taking a sharp pencil and just kind of poke in that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=281.18s)]
*  And this man told us he was among the first publicly known cases in 2016 from our embassy [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=283.94s)]
*  in Cuba. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=291.26s)]
*  That's how the incidents became known as Havana Syndrome. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=292.26s)]
*  This medically retired from an agency we can't name, blind in one eye and struggling [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=297.66s)]
*  for balance. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=304.62s)]
*  A major medical study for the government was led by Dr. David Railman of Stanford University. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=307.14000000000004s)]
*  In our 2022 report, he told us... [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=314.54s)]
*  What we found was we thought clear evidence of an injury to the auditory and vestibular [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=317.34000000000003s)]
*  system of the brain. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=324.78000000000003s)]
*  Something starting with the inner ear, where humans perceive sound and sense balance, and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=326.86s)]
*  then translate those perceptions into brain electrical signals. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=336.14s)]
*  His study found directed pulsed radio frequency energy appears to be the most plausible mechanism. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=343.46000000000004s)]
*  For example, a focused beam of microwaves or acoustic ultrasound. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=352.04s)]
*  More than 100 officials or family members have unexplained persistent symptoms. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  If I turn too fast, my gyroscope is off essentially. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=365.56s)]
*  It's like a step behind where I'm supposed to be. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=368.18s)]
*  So I'll turn too fast and I will literally walk right into the wall or the door frame. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=370.32000000000005s)]
*  For the first time, the case of FBI agent Kerry suggests which adversary might be responsible. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=375.28s)]
*  She spoke with the FBI's permission, but wasn't allowed to discuss the cases she was on when [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=383.64s)]
*  she was hit. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=389.62s)]
*  We have learned from other sources one of those cases involved this Mustang going 110 [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=391.28s)]
*  miles an hour. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=400.47999999999996s)]
*  Pull over! [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=401.47999999999996s)]
*  Pull over! [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=402.47999999999996s)]
*  In 2020, near Key West, Florida, deputies tried to stop the Mustang for speeding. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=404.32s)]
*  It ran 15 miles until it hit spike strips laid in its path. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=411.72s)]
*  Get out! [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=417.88s)]
*  Get out! [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=420.88s)]
*  Get out! [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=423.88s)]
*  Get out! [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=426.88s)]
*  A search of the car found notes of bank accounts. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=430.28s)]
*  City bank, discover savings, 75,000. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=433.88s)]
*  And this device that looks like a walkie talkie can erase the car's computer data, including [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=439.68s)]
*  its GPS record. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  There was also a Russian passport. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=448.4s)]
*  What's your first name? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=452.0s)]
*  Vitaly. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=453.0s)]
*  V-I-T-A-L-I-I. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=454.0s)]
*  Vitaly Kovalev was the driver from St. Petersburg, Russia, not Florida. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=455.12s)]
*  Why did you run? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=461.64s)]
*  Let me be honest with you. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=462.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=463.64s)]
*  You don't know why you ran? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=464.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=465.64s)]
*  And we don't know why he ran. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=466.64s)]
*  But what we learned suggests he was a Russian spy. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=467.72s)]
*  What we see here is Vitaly Kovalev fitting exactly this formula. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=471.92s)]
*  Kristo Grozev is a journalist legendary for unmasking Russian plots. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=477.12s)]
*  In 2020, he uncovered the names of the Russian secret agents who poisoned Vladimir Putin's [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=483.91999999999996s)]
*  rival Alexei Navalny. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=489.0s)]
*  Grozev is lead investigator for our collaborator on this story, The Insider, a magazine by [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  Russian exiles. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=499.08s)]
*  We asked him to trace Vitaly Kovalev. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=501.47999999999996s)]
*  He studied in a military institute. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=505.24s)]
*  He studied radio electronics with a particular focus on use within the military of microelectronics. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=507.24s)]
*  He had all the technology know-how that would be required for somebody to be assisting an [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=515.92s)]
*  operation that requires high technology. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=520.6800000000001s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, after working for two years in a military institute, he up and [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=523.16s)]
*  decides to become a chef. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=528.52s)]
*  Kovalev immigrated to the U.S. and worked as a chef in New York and Washington, D.C., [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=532.5999999999999s)]
*  even appearing at far left in a TV cooking segment. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=538.92s)]
*  Traditional Russian recipes, thanks to our wonderful chef. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=543.76s)]

*  Can someone like Kovalev simply decide to drop all of that and become a chef? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=556.8000000000001s)]
*  It is not an easy job to just leave that behind. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=562.32s)]
*  Once you're in the military and you've been trained and the Ministry of Defense has invested [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=565.6800000000001s)]

*  We don't know what Kovalev was up to, but our sources say over months he spent 80 hours [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=574.6800000000001s)]
*  being interviewed by FBI agent Kerry, who had investigated multiple Russian spies. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=583.0200000000001s)]
*  Kovalev pled guilty to evading police and reckless driving. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=591.1400000000001s)]
*  He was sentenced to 30 months. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=594.96s)]
*  While he was in jail, Kerry says she was hit in Florida and a year later when she awoke [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=597.62s)]
*  to the same symptoms in the middle of the night in California. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=604.98s)]
*  It felt like I was stuck in this state of like disorientation, not able to function, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=609.94s)]
*  what is happening and my whole body was pulsing. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=616.3000000000001s)]
*  Mark Zaid is Kerry's attorney. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=620.86s)]
*  He has a security clearance and for decades has represented Americans working in national [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=623.4200000000001s)]

*  Zaid has more than two dozen clients suffering symptoms of Havana syndrome, which the government [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=630.3800000000001s)]
*  now calls anomalous health incidents. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=636.56s)]
*  I have CIA and State Department clients as well who believe they've been impacted domestically. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=640.64s)]
*  There are dozens of CIA cases that have happened domestically that is at least believed. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=648.04s)]
*  And we're not even just talking about physical manifestation. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=656.1999999999999s)]
*  We're talking about evidence of computer issues in the midst of the incident where computer [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=660.8000000000001s)]
*  screens just literally stop working or go flicker on and off. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=668.6s)]
*  Do you know whether there are other FBI agents who have also suffered from these anomalous [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=673.24s)]
*  health incidents? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=680.4s)]
*  There are other FBI agents and personnel, not just agents, analysts. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=682.0s)]
*  I represent one other FBI person who was impacted in Miami. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=688.8s)]
*  And I also know of FBI personnel who believe they were hit overseas in the last decade. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=694.76s)]
*  Were any of these members of the FBI counterintelligence people in addition to Kerry? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=701.12s)]
*  The one thread that I know of with the FBI personnel that is common among most, if not [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=705.72s)]

*  Vitaly Kovalev served his time and in 2022 went back to Russia, ignoring American warnings [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=724.3s)]
*  that he was in danger because he'd spent so much time with the FBI. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=732.38s)]
*  Christo Grozev found this death certificate from last year, which says Kovalev was killed [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=738.14s)]
*  at the front in Ukraine. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=746.1s)]
*  Do you think Kovalev was sent to Ukraine as a punishment? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=749.1s)]
*  One theory is that he was sent there in order for him to be disposed of. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=752.88s)]
*  Is Kovalev really dead or is this another cover story? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=756.52s)]
*  That is a very good question and we actually worked on both hypotheses for a while. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=760.6999999999999s)]
*  I do believe at this point that he was dead. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=765.9s)]
*  We're dealing with energy weapons. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=769.6999999999999s)]
*  It's not going anywhere. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=772.84s)]
*  Look how effective it's been. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=774.5s)]
*  It's next generation weaponry and unfortunately it's been refined on some of us and we're [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=776.38s)]
*  the test subjects. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=782.66s)]
*  When we come back, you will hear from the Pentagon official who led a global investigation [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=785.52s)]
*  into who is targeting Americans. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=791.46s)]
*  U.S. intelligence says publicly there is no credible evidence that an adversary is inflicting [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=794.62s)]
*  brain injuries on national security officials. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=809.54s)]
*  And yet, more than 100 Americans have symptoms that scientists say could be caused by a beam [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=813.14s)]
*  of microwaves or acoustic ultrasound. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=819.62s)]
*  The Pentagon launched an investigation run by a recently retired Army Lieutenant Colonel. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=823.54s)]
*  Greg Edgreen has never spoken publicly until now. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=829.9s)]
*  Are we being attacked? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=835.76s)]
*  My personal opinion, yes. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=838.0s)]
*  By whom? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=839.74s)]
*  Russia. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=841.0999999999999s)]
*  Greg Edgreen ran the investigation for the Defense Intelligence Agency. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=842.74s)]
*  He would not discuss classified information, but he described his team's work from 2021 [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=847.7s)]
*  to 2023. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=854.1800000000001s)]
*  We were collecting a large body of data ranging from signals intelligence, human intelligence, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=856.1s)]
*  open source reporting, anything regarding the internet, travel records, financial records, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=863.58s)]
*  you name it. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=869.86s)]
*  Unfortunately, I can't get into specifics based on the classification, but I can tell [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=870.86s)]
*  you at a very early stage, I started to focus on Moscow. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=875.9s)]
*  Can you tell me about the patterns you began to see? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=880.58s)]
*  One of the things I started to notice was the caliber of our officer that was being [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=885.22s)]
*  impacted. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=892.86s)]
*  This wasn't happening to our worst or our middle range officers. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=895.1s)]
*  This was happening to our top five, 10% performing officers across the Defense Intelligence Agency. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=901.14s)]
*  And consistently, there was a Russia nexus. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=908.3s)]
*  There was some angle where they had worked against Russia, focused on Russia, and done [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=912.36s)]
*  extremely well. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=916.8s)]
*  What has been the impact on American national security? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=918.62s)]
*  The impact has been that the intelligence officers and our diplomats working abroad [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=922.9399999999999s)]
*  are being removed from their posts with traumatic brain injuries. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=929.94s)]
*  They're being neutralized. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=932.7800000000001s)]
*  Tonight we're reporting for the first time an incident at last year's NATO summit in [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=934.7800000000001s)]
*  Lithuania, a meeting that focused largely on Russia's invasion of Ukraine and was attended [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=941.0600000000001s)]
*  by President Biden. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=947.38s)]
*  Multiple sources tell us that a senior official of the Department of Defense was struck by [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=949.7s)]
*  the symptoms and sought medical treatment. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=955.44s)]
*  We told Greg Edgreen what we'd learned. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=958.86s)]
*  It tells me that there are no barriers on what Moscow will do, on who they will attack, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=961.74s)]
*  and that if we don't face this head-on, the problem is going to get worse. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=968.54s)]
*  The problem first appeared in public in 2016. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=973.26s)]
*  U.S. officials reported being hurt in Cuba and the incidents became known as Havana Syndrome. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=976.98s)]
*  What we have learned, it started two years earlier, when at least four Americans reported [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=984.74s)]
*  symptoms in Frankfurt, Germany. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=991.58s)]
*  There is also evidence of what could be revenge attacks. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=994.74s)]
*  For example, in 2014, three CIA officers were stationed in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin's obsession. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=999.82s)]
*  2014 was the year that a popular revolt overthrew Putin's preferred leader. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1009.3000000000001s)]
*  Later, those CIA officers went on to other assignments and reported being hit, one in [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1015.9000000000001s)]
*  Uzbekistan, one in Vietnam, and the third officer's family was hit in London. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1023.3000000000001s)]
*  If it is Russia, investigative reporter Kristo Grozev believes he knows who's involved. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1031.6200000000001s)]
*  In 2018, Grozev was the first to discover the existence of a top-secret Russian intelligence [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1038.5s)]
*  unit, which goes by a number, 29155. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1045.5s)]
*  These are people who are trained to be versatile assassins and sabotage operators. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1051.18s)]
*  They're trained in counter-surveillance, they're trained in explosives, they're trained in [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1057.14s)]
*  using poison, and technology equipment actually inflict pain or damage to the targets. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1060.62s)]
*  Grozev works with our collaborators on this report, a magazine called The Insider and [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1069.54s)]
*  Germany's Der Spiegel. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1075.06s)]
*  He has a long track record uncovering Russian documents, and Grozev says he found one that [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1077.6599999999999s)]
*  may link 29155 to a directed energy weapon. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1084.12s)]
*  And when I saw it, I literally had tears in my eyes because it was spelling out what [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1090.12s)]
*  they had been doing. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1094.52s)]
*  It's a piece of accounting. An officer of 29155 received a bonus for work on, quote, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1096.1399999999999s)]
*  potential capabilities of non-lethal acoustic weapons. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1104.6399999999999s)]
*  Which told us that this particular unit had been engaged with somewhere, somehow, empirical [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1109.52s)]
*  tests of a directed energy unit. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1116.08s)]
*  There it is. Written down in black and white. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1119.66s)]
*  It's the closest to a receipt you can have for this. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1122.8400000000001s)]
*  We've also found that Russia's 29155 may have been present in Tbilisi, Georgia, when [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1126.0800000000002s)]
*  Americans reported incidents there. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1133.0800000000002s)]
*  Do you believe that you were attacked? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1135.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1138.6000000000001s)]
*  She asked us to withhold her name for her safety. She is the wife of a Justice Department [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1139.94s)]
*  official who was with the embassy in Tbilisi. She's a nurse with a Ph.D. in anesthesiology. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1145.72s)]

*  describe as when you listen to a movie and the main character is also consumed by the [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1169.14s)]
*  sound after a bomb goes off. That is similar to the sound that I heard. And it just pierced [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1179.72s)]
*  my ears, came in my left side, felt like it came through the window into my left ear. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1187.72s)]
*  I immediately felt fullness in my head and just a piercing headache. And when I realized [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1195.72s)]
*  that I needed to get out of the laundry room, I left the room and went into our bedroom [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1203.6200000000001s)]

*  neighborhood a U.S. official, their spouse and child were hit. We have also learned of [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1223.44s)]
*  a phone call that was intercepted nearby. A man says in Russian, is it supposed to have [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1230.2s)]
*  blinking green lights and should I leave it on all night? We have no idea what he was [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1237.24s)]
*  talking about, but the next day the incidents began. Sources tell us that an investigation [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1244.8200000000002s)]
*  centered on this Russian, Albert Averyanov. His name on travel manifests and phone records [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1251.82s)]
*  appears alongside known members of Unit 29155. He is also the son of the commander. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1260.3999999999999s)]
*  He was groomed to become a member of the unit since he was 16. His number is in the phone [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1269.3999999999999s)]
*  books of all members of the unit. Clearly he is more than just the son of the boss. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1275.3999999999999s)]
*  He is a colleague of these people. Grozev found Albert Averyanov's phone was turned [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1280.4s)]
*  off during the Tbilisi incidents, but our sources say there is evidence someone in Tbilisi [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1287.46s)]
*  logged into Averyanov's personal email during this time. Most likely, Grozev believes Averyanov [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1295.1000000000001s)]
*  himself, placing him in the city. We believe members of Unit 29155 were there [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1302.94s)]
*  in order to facilitate, supervise, or maybe even personally implement attacks on American [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1310.06s)]
*  diplomats and American government officials using an acoustic weapon. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1317.06s)]
*  After you were able to get out of the laundry room, call your husband. What did you do then? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1322.06s)]
*  I went downstairs. I first looked on our security camera, which is right beside our front door, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1328.06s)]
*  to see if anyone was outside. There was a vehicle right outside of our gate. I took [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1334.06s)]
*  a photo of that vehicle and noticed that it was not a vehicle that I recognized, and I [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1340.06s)]
*  went outside. Did you see anyone around the vehicle? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1346.06s)]
*  I did. We sent you a photograph of Albert Averyanov, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1349.06s)]
*  and this is the picture that we sent you. You did. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1356.06s)]
*  And I wonder if that looks anything like the man you saw outside your home. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1360.06s)]
*  It absolutely does. And when I received this photo, I had a visceral reaction. It made [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1365.06s)]
*  me feel sick. I cannot absolutely say for certainty that it is this man, but I can tell [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1373.06s)]
*  you that even to this day, looking at him makes me feel that same visceral reaction, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1381.06s)]
*  and I can absolutely say that this looks like the man that I saw in the street. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1391.06s)]
*  This 40-year-old wife and mother is among the most severely injured people we have met. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1398.06s)]
*  My headaches and brain fog continued. Later on into that weekend, I started having trouble [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1406.06s)]
*  walking down the stairs, specifically at night. I had trouble finding the steps to get down [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1414.06s)]
*  the stairs, so my coordination and vestibular system started just really falling apart. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1419.06s)]
*  She was medically evacuated, and now doctors say she has holes in her inner ear canals, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1427.06s)]
*  the vestibular system that creates the sense of balance. Two surgeries put metal plates [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1434.06s)]
*  in her skull. Another surgery is likely. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1441.06s)]
*  It's devastating. It's absolutely devastating. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1445.06s)]
*  Despite experiences like hers, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1450.06s)]
*  last year, it's very unlikely a foreign adversary is responsible, but the DNI also [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1457.06s)]
*  acknowledged that some intelligence agencies had only low or moderate confidence in that [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1464.06s)]
*  assessment. This month, the National Institutes of Health reported results of brain scans. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1471.06s)]
*  NIH said there's no evidence of physical damage, but the medical science of so-called [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1477.06s)]
*  anomalous health incidents remains vigorously debated. For its part, the Director of National [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1485.06s)]
*  Intelligence says the symptoms probably result from pre-existing conditions, conventional [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1492.06s)]
*  illnesses, and environmental factors. Attorney Mark Zaid represents more than two dozen AHI [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1499.06s)]
*  clients. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1507.06s)]
*  What do you make of the intelligence community assessment? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1508.06s)]
*  So, I've had access to classified information relating to AHI. I can't reveal it. I wouldn't [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1511.06s)]
*  reveal it. I will tell you that I don't believe it to be the entire story, and I know of information [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1518.06s)]
*  that undermines or contradicts what they are saying publicly. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1526.06s)]
*  Are you saying that the government wants to cover this up? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1532.06s)]
*  There is, in my view, without a doubt, evidence of a cover-up. Now, some of that cover-up is [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1536.06s)]
*  not necessarily that, oh, we found a weapon and we don't want anybody to know about it. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1543.06s)]
*  What I've seen more so is we see lines of inquiry that would take us potentially to [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1549.06s)]
*  answers we don't want to have to deal with. So, we're not going to explore any of those avenues. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1559.06s)]
*  You know, if my mother had seen what I saw, she would say it's the Russians stupid. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1567.06s)]
*  Greg Edgreen, who ran the military investigation, told us he had the Pentagon's support, but [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1575.06s)]
*  in the Trump and Biden administrations, he says, the bar for proof was set impossibly high. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1582.06s)]
*  I think it was set so high because we did not, as a country and a government, want to face some very [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1590.06s)]
*  hard truths. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1598.06s)]
*  And what are those? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1600.06s)]
*  Can we secure America? Are these massive counterintelligence failures? Can we protect American soil and our [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1602.06s)]
*  people on American soil? Are we being attacked? And if we're being attacked, is that an act of war? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1609.06s)]
*  After what he learned in his classified investigation, Greg Edgreen retired from the Army to start a [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1617.06s)]
*  company to help the victims. He hopes to channel government contracts into treatment programs. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1625.06s)]
*  As with all spy stories, much is classified in what remains as circumstantial. None of the witnesses [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1632.06s)]
*  tonight wanted to speak. Some fear for their families. But all felt compelled to shine a light on what [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1640.06s)]
*  they see as a war of shadows, a war America may not be winning. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1647.06s)]
*  If this is what we've seen with the hundreds of cases of anomalous health incidents, I can assure you that [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1654.06s)]
*  this has become probably Putin's biggest victory. In his own mind, this has been Russia's biggest victory [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1660.06s)]
*  against the West. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1667.06s)]
*  In terms of the long term, would you consider this to be life altering? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1669.06s)]
*  Absolutely life altering for our whole family. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1676.06s)]
*  A suspected attack on Americans before Vice President Harris arrived in Vietnam. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1682.06s)]
*  I believe Russia is assisting other governments. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1692.06s)]
*  At 60minutesovertime.com. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1697.06s)]
*  The horse has played a central role in the history and mythology of many Native American tribes. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1702.06s)]
*  The Shoshone, Crow, Blackfeet, Sioux, and other tribes first saw horses when Spaniards brought them to this [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1713.06s)]
*  continent 500 years ago and have used them in hunting and in battle ever since. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1721.06s)]
*  Effectively, these tribes call themselves the Horse Nations. As you're about to see, men and women from those tribes [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1727.06s)]
*  also use horses in a sport that fans have dubbed America's original extreme sport. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1734.06s)]
*  The tribes call it Indian Relay. Its roots date back centuries, and it's one of the most exciting, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1741.06s)]
*  dangerous, and inspiring things you're ever likely to see. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1748.06s)]
*  Welcome to the 2023 Championship of Champions. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1753.06s)]
*  We start at the start. In Indian Relay, as many as six thoroughbred racehorses are brought to a start line drawn in the dirt. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1757.06s)]
*  The horses are bareback, no saddles or stirrups. Their riders wear no protective gear. At the sound of a horn, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1766.06s)]
*  they leap aboard and tear down the track. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1774.06s)]
*  To actually get on a horse bareback and run as fast as you can around is easy. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1778.06s)]
*  That's easy. Yeah. Ken Realbird is a sort of senior statesman of Indian Relay and announces races all over the American West. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1789.06s)]
*  These horses are able to run like you wouldn't believe. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1800.06s)]
*  But the hard part comes from jumping off. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1809.06s)]
*  Wait, what? After the riders race one lap around the half-mile track, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1813.06s)]
*  On the rail Riley! [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1819.06s)]
*  they all speed into a sort of equine pit row where teammates are waiting with fresh horses for what's known as the exchange. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1823.06s)]
*  So he has to come in, gear down enough, and then angle that horse in. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1834.06s)]
*  He gets off and takes one, two, three steps and he's on to the back of that horse. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1840.06s)]
*  Boom, there he goes. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1851.06s)]
*  Ken Realbird makes that flying leap from one horse to another sound simple. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1855.06s)]
*  It is not. It's more like a dangerous chaotic dance with riders and horses from six teams [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1862.06s)]
*  all trying to do the same thing at the same time in the same space. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1869.06s)]
*  You have what they call the setup man. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1877.06s)]
*  Their job primarily is to have that horse in the proper position as the rider comes in. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1881.06s)]
*  Simultaneously, you have a guy who's usually a nimble guy on his feet, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1889.06s)]
*  and he's got to catch that horse coming in at 15 miles an hour. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1895.06s)]
*  That horse, he really doesn't care about your feelings. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1904.06s)]
*  A third member of the pit crew is holding a third horse because the riders must do another leap for another lap. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1908.06s)]
*  It's exciting, but it's dangerous too, isn't it? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1920.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1924.06s)]
*  A lot of injuries. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1927.06s)]
*  A lot of injuries. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1930.06s)]
*  Almost every heat will have some of the guys getting run over. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1934.06s)]
*  And it's going to be a collision. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1938.06s)]
*  Can you imagine the front line of Kansas City Chiefs all combining one and just run over you? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1941.06s)]
*  That's what it's going to feel like because that horse is a thousand pounds. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1950.06s)]
*  Injuries to both horses and humans are part of the sport. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1956.06s)]
*  The team that best avoids collisions and wins that third lap on a third horse can be forgiven for showing off at the finish. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1960.06s)]
*  Well, that was a great race. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1969.06s)]
*  Ken Realbird says the roots of modern Indian relay are in the horse-stealing raids that tribes once staged against white settlers and each other. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1972.06s)]
*  These young men of these different nations would travel. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1982.06s)]
*  When it was middle of the night, they would come and take the prized horse and hightail it back to their home country. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1986.06s)]
*  They exchanged horses as they were running because they were being pursued. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1994.06s)]
*  And so that's pretty much the origin of the Indian relay sport that we know today. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=1999.06s)]
*  Races in the organized sport were first conducted in the early 1900s. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2006.06s)]
*  When it first started out, the majority of these races were happening more within their own communities, native communities on their reservations. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2011.06s)]
*  I've seen some races. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2019.06s)]
*  Calvin Ghostbear is a member of the Sioux Tribe. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2020.06s)]
*  Seven heats, eight heats. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2023.06s)]
*  And president of an organization called the Horse Nations Indian Relay Council. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2025.06s)]
*  What we do with Horse Nations is we basically took a lot of the races that were within the tribal nations, brought them out into the mainstream. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2031.06s)]
*  Now we're bringing it onto a bigger stage. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2042.06s)]
*  Last summer's Indian relay circuit crisscrossed the West and climaxed in Casper, Wyoming with a three-day championship event that celebrated tribal culture and song. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2048.06s)]
*  And drum and dance and offered more than $100,000 in prize money thanks to sponsorship from a casino owned by the Northern Arapaho tribe. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2061.06s)]
*  It included a women's division. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2076.06s)]
*  It's two laps and two horses rather than the three and three in men's races. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2080.06s)]
*  But the athleticism and danger are every bit as evident. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2085.06s)]
*  Now there's no quitting these kids. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2092.06s)]
*  There's also a kids Indian relay. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2094.06s)]
*  It takes a great tumble. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2096.06s)]
*  With riders as young as six racing on ponies, climbing on and falling off. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2098.06s)]
*  He's going to be all right. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2105.06s)]
*  Those are the guys that grow up to be the great riders, the great set-up men, because they're all horsemen. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2106.06s)]
*  And it's like that in every reservation. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2113.06s)]
*  On the Blackfeet reservation in Montana, we met Irvin Carlson and his son Chaz, who have been competing in Indian relay for years. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2118.06s)]
*  Chaz is one of the most seasoned riders on the summer circuit. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2129.06s)]
*  For relay making you good in the sport is this practice, practice, practice and years of experience. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2134.06s)]
*  Chaz is off, Chaz is on the track. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2141.06s)]
*  Another team we followed through the summer circuit is led by 23-year-old Tuesday Washakie from the Shoshone tribe in Wyoming. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2147.06s)]
*  Her younger sister Zia is the rider for their women's team. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2156.06s)]
*  Both feel a close connection to their horses. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2160.06s)]
*  If you're having a bad day and it's just not going your way, you can go out and you can catch your horse and ride him and things will just seem to be better. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2164.06s)]
*  I think that's just how it is. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2177.06s)]
*  Mason Redwing feels the same bond and obligation to care for his horses. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2181.06s)]
*  It's really something special because we're all here for one purpose and it's the horse. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2187.06s)]
*  Mason hails from the Crow Creek Sioux Reservation in South Dakota. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2191.06s)]
*  When I was younger I didn't know why I used to feel such anger and animosity towards my own people. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2197.06s)]
*  I didn't want to be Native American. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2202.06s)]
*  And the horse helped me reconnect with my culture and be proud of who I am and proud of where I'm from. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2205.06s)]
*  Why were you feeling you didn't like being a Native American? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2211.06s)]
*  Growing up where I'm from on the reservation you see a lot of things that make you not proud. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2215.06s)]
*  Like what? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2221.06s)]
*  To be where I'm from. Alcoholism, drug addiction, drug abuse, suicide. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2222.06s)]
*  Suicide rates on the reservation are four or five times the national average. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2228.06s)]
*  My own father succumbed to alcoholism so it really hit home. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2232.06s)]
*  You said the horse saved your life? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2238.06s)]
*  Yep, yes sir, essentially. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2239.06s)]
*  You think it does that for a lot of young Native American kids? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2242.06s)]
*  I think so. There's a lot of kids out there that are just looking for that doorway. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2245.06s)]
*  There's little glamour in Indian Relay and lots of hard work. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2252.06s)]
*  Every team is self-funded and nearly everyone has a day job to help pay the bills. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2256.06s)]
*  But the sport is on the rise. Prize money is increasing and 67 teams competed in last summer's championships. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2262.06s)]
*  The quality of horses is rising too. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2272.06s)]
*  Teams go to major racetracks like Churchill Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby, to buy sprinters well suited to Indian Relay. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2277.06s)]
*  Kentucky, that would be the ultimate demonstration race before the Derby. That would be my goal. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2286.06s)]
*  Lots of thrills and hopefully no spills today. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2296.06s)]
*  Each team competed in one heat each day of the championships. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2302.06s)]
*  Their cumulative time from the first two days determined whether they made the final championship heat on Sunday. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2307.06s)]
*  Is the race usually won or lost in the exchange? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2316.06s)]
*  Yeah. It's like a relay team in track and field. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2320.06s)]
*  But in Indian Relay, exchanges involve six riders, 18 horses, 18 other humans and a cloud of dust. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2326.06s)]
*  From what I've seen, it's like chaos. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2336.06s)]
*  In the block, it's going to be O.B. Doss. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2340.06s)]
*  Tuesday Washakie's women's team made the championship heat in Casper. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2343.06s)]
*  And her sister Zia had a clean exchange in that race. They finished a close second. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2349.06s)]
*  I don't know, you get demoralized or does it make you more determined? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2356.06s)]
*  It makes me more determined. I'd be out here mad as hell, but I shouldn't be. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2359.06s)]
*  Winning it all is going to be the Time and Toi. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2363.06s)]
*  The first place women's relay team came from the Colville Reservation in Washington State with rider Talia Time and Toi. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2367.06s)]
*  Is this your first championship? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2374.06s)]
*  No, I actually won the first one in Walla Walla. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2376.06s)]
*  Alright. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2379.06s)]
*  Yeah, when I was 13. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2380.06s)]
*  And how old are you now? [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2381.06s)]
*  17. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2382.06s)]
*  17? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2383.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2384.06s)]
*  Are you going to do it again next year? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2385.06s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to do it as long as I can. I love this game. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2386.06s)]
*  The day before, we had watched Talia win a heat with her arms raised in a pose of triumph and strength. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2391.06s)]
*  It is how we connect to the warriors of the past, the warriors of 200 years ago. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2399.06s)]
*  It's that same bloodline of that warrior that is cursing through their blood. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2406.06s)]
*  Face the Red Wing. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2412.06s)]
*  Over three days of heats, we watched Mason Red Wing and his team go from dirt-pounding frustration when an exchange went wrong to exultation as another went right. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2413.06s)]
*  Good, good, good. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2430.06s)]
*  Because we're always searching for that perfect run. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2431.06s)]
*  They didn't quite find it in the finals. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2435.06s)]
*  It's for the championship of the world. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2437.06s)]
*  The team that did was the one we'd first met months earlier on the Blackfeet Reservation, Irvin Carlson and his son Chaz. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2440.06s)]
*  So we've been following you like all summer. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2450.06s)]
*  Like this is the culmination of everything you've done all year. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2452.06s)]
*  So does this give you bragging rights for a year or what? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2455.06s)]
*  Oh yeah, oh yeah. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2458.06s)]
*  As a tribal elder sang a traditional praise song in honor of their victory and organizers presented them with a check for $20,000, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2460.06s)]
*  we noticed a group of kids at the rail, on their ponies, watching intently. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2474.06s)]
*  What the horse done for me, I know the horse can do that for everyone a thousand times over. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2480.06s)]
*  And I'm a firm believer in it. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2484.06s)]
*  I know for a fact it can bring our young men and our young women back. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2487.06s)]
*  For most Christians today is Easter Sunday, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2511.06s)]
*  a day of resurrection, of the triumph of light over darkness. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2514.06s)]
*  And although Orthodox Christians won't celebrate Easter for another month, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2519.06s)]
*  it is an Orthodox place of worship that comes to mind. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2523.06s)]
*  St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and Shrine in Lower Manhattan. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2527.06s)]
*  We told the story of the resurrection of St. Nicholas back in 2020. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2533.06s)]
*  Once a tavern, the church lived in the shadow of the World Trade Center [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2537.06s)]
*  and nearly died under its rubble on September 11, 2001. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2542.06s)]
*  Kept alive only by the faith and hope of its tiny congregation [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2547.06s)]
*  and the charity of a much wider community. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2552.06s)]
*  Today, the new St. Nicholas, its dome aglow with an inner light, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2556.06s)]
*  sits at the edge of the World Trade Center, resurrected and alive. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2562.06s)]
*  Happy Easter. I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2568.06s)]
*  We'll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNVvOqJ50s&t=2571.06s)]
