# Real-life story of "The Big Short"; 2020's economic emergency; Jerome Powell in 2020 | Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [June 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c)
*  If you had to pick someone to write the autopsy report on the Wall Street financial collapse [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=0.0s)]
*  18 months ago, you couldn't do any better than Michael Lewis. He is one of the country's [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  preeminent non-fiction writers, with a knack for turning complicated, mind-numbing material [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=23.6s)]
*  into fascinating yarns. He wrote his first best-seller, Liar's Poker, about his experiences [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=29.0s)]
*  as a young Wall Street bond trader when he was still in his twenties, and he has since [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=35.0s)]
*  followed up with seven more best-sellers on subjects ranging from Silicon Valley and The [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=39.72s)]
*  New New Thing to big-time sports in Moneyball and The Blind Side. His new book, called The [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=44.76s)]
*  Big Short, Inside the Doomsday Machine, comes out later this week, and it explains how some [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=50.86s)]
*  of Wall Street's finest minds managed to destroy $1.75 trillion of wealth in the subprime mortgage [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=56.96s)]
*  markets. We spent two days debriefing him at his home in California. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=64.4s)]
*  This was an episode where capitalism was almost destroyed just by the capitalists, and in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=69.88s)]
*  the most sensational way, they were sort of destroyed by their own folly. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=77.72s)]
*  What happened? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=84.72s)]
*  The incentives for people on Wall Street got so screwed up that the people who worked there [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=86.64s)]
*  became blinded to their own long-term interests because their short-term interests were so [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=94.68s)]
*  overpowering. And so they behaved in ways that were antithetical to their own long-term [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=101.68s)]
*  interests. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=106.84s)]
*  Michael Lewis, a one-time wonder boy on Wall Street, is about to turn 50 now. In Sconstant, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=108.28s)]
*  he lives in this hillside compound in Berkeley, California, which has a main house and three [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=114.04s)]
*  cottages, and he is much happier writing about business than actually conducting it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=119.04s)]
*  What was the book that bought this place? This would have been the new new thing that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=124.04s)]
*  bought this place. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=129.04000000000002s)]
*  How many books have you sold now? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=130.04000000000002s)]
*  Some millions. I don't know how many millions. Not John Grisham millions, but millions. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=133.04000000000002s)]
*  Lewis is here with his wife, former MTV News correspondent Tabitha Soren, and their three [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=140.04s)]
*  children, a three-year-old son and two young daughters who he takes to all of Cal Berkeley's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=145.04s)]
*  women's basketball games. It's one of the few breaks that Lewis allowed himself over [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=151.04s)]
*  the past 18 months as he dug into the idiocy and negligence that produced the worst financial [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=156.04s)]
*  crisis since the Great Depression. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=162.04s)]
*  I'm afraid that our culture will come to the conclusion, because it's always the easy [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=164.04s)]
*  conclusion, that everybody was just a bunch of criminals. I think the story is much more [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=168.04s)]
*  interesting than that. I think it's a story of mass delusion. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=174.04s)]
*  Lewis's forte has always been discovering little-known facts and characters that change [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=177.04s)]
*  people's perception about a story. So when he finally sat down at his computer with sacks [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=182.04s)]
*  full of research to write about this calamity, he had no interest in Treasury Secretary Hank [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=187.04s)]
*  Paulson or Ben Bernanke or the CEOs of Wall Street's big investment banks, who he believes [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=193.04s)]
*  had no clue what was going on while it was going on. He wanted to tell this story through the eyes [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=199.04s)]
*  of people who were paying attention and who knew that a financial disaster was inevitable. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=205.04s)]
*  But there were a handful of characters who actually had seen it coming and made a fortune off of it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=211.04s)]
*  And there were so few of them, and there were so many people who had been on the other side, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=216.04s)]
*  that I kind of wondered who they were and why they got themselves into that position. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=221.04s)]
*  What they saw. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=225.04s)]
*  What they saw. Almost more how they saw. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=226.04s)]
*  How many people were there, do you think, in the world that understood what was going on? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=230.04s)]
*  Between 10 and 20 investors, at most. And this is from a universe of tens of thousands of people who could have [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=234.04s)]
*  conceivably made that bet. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=242.04s)]
*  The first one to see that something was seriously amiss in the burgeoning subprime mortgage market [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=244.04s)]
*  was Dr. Michael Berry, a California physician with only one good eye. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=249.04s)]
*  He lost the other one to cancer as a child and also suffers from Asperger's syndrome, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=253.04s)]
*  a condition related to autism that often produces an aversion to social contact. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=258.03999999999996s)]
*  Uncomfortable dealing with patients, Berry quit medicine and started a hedge fund in Cupertino, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  spending most of his time in a darkened office glued to his computer screen. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  Beginning in 2003, he turned to something that no one else in America was doing, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=274.04s)]
*  reading and analyzing the pools of risky subprime mortgage loans that Wall Street had been buying up [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=279.04s)]
*  and bundling into highly profitable mortgage-backed securities, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=286.04s)]
*  which they were selling to investors around the world. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=290.04s)]
*  I called up the prospectuses and I read the prospectuses and I looked at these pools. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=293.04s)]
*  I could see the credit standards within these pools deteriorating, just quarter to quarter. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=297.04s)]
*  How could you tell that? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=303.04s)]
*  There was essentially crappier mortgages being put into these pools [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=304.04s)]
*  and it didn't seem investors seemed to care and it didn't seem the ratings agencies seemed to care. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=308.04s)]
*  Do you think many people read these, read these prospectuses? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=313.04s)]
*  I think the lawyers that put them together to an extent maybe. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=317.04s)]
*  Do you think the executives at the big Wall Street firms who were issuing these bonds had read them? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=321.04s)]
*  Or understood them? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=327.04s)]
*  I don't think they read them, no. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=329.04s)]
*  I think that there were probably junior analysts that were given the task of reviewing these documents. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=331.04s)]
*  However, I think that this was a profit center. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=341.04s)]
*  It was a profit center. It was something the organization wanted to do. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=345.04s)]
*  In effect, Lewis writes, Michael Berry was doing the first real analysis of the creditworthiness [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=350.04s)]
*  of the subprime borrowers and the structure of the complicated Wall Street mortgage securities, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=356.04s)]
*  the kind of work that was supposed to have been done by bond rating agencies like Standard & Poor's and Moody's [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=362.04s)]
*  so that investors could accurately judge their risk. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=368.04s)]
*  What you were doing sounds to me like the job that the rating agencies should have been doing. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=371.04s)]
*  There's no way the ratings agencies had anywhere near the manpower to look through all that was being issued. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=376.04s)]
*  Yeah, but you're one guy. And you found it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=382.04s)]
*  You would think that even if they just looked at a sample, maybe they would have come to a realization. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=387.04s)]
*  By 2005, Michael Berry had come to the realization that the Wall Street bond market had lost its mind. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=395.04s)]
*  It was buying up hundreds of millions of dollars in dicey loans to unqualified buyers who were, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=401.04s)]
*  in Michael Lewis's words, one broken refrigerator away from default. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=408.04s)]
*  Berry concluded that the subprime market would collapse in 2007. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=413.04s)]
*  He notices for the first time that there are pools, there are mortgage bonds supported by pools of loans, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=418.04s)]
*  and most of the loans are what are called negative amortizing interest only loans, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=425.04s)]
*  which means that you the homeowner and buyer, you borrow the money, and you not only don't have to repay your principal, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=430.04s)]
*  you don't have to repay the interest. And if you just don't pay anything, they just add to your loan. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=437.04s)]
*  So you can't lose your house. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=443.04s)]
*  You can't lose your house, right, in theory, right? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=444.04s)]
*  And so he figures we've reached the end of the road in the insanity of lending. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=447.04s)]
*  They're scraping the bottom of the barrel. Now is the time to lay a bet. It's before anybody does. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=452.04s)]
*  Berry figured out that these mortgage-backed securities would become worthless if just a small percentage of the dicey loans went bad, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=457.04s)]
*  and he wanted to bet against the worst of them. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=464.04s)]
*  He decided that the best way to do it would be to get Wall Street to sell him inexpensive insurance contracts on the securities [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=467.04s)]
*  that would pay off big time if they failed. The contracts were called credit default swaps. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=474.04s)]
*  He conceives that they are going to invent on Wall Street credit default swaps on subprime mortgages, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=480.04s)]
*  essentially insurance contracts on the bonds, before they even do. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=487.04s)]
*  And he helps, he participates in the creation of this instrument. And Michael Berry is the first one in. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=491.04s)]
*  Berry assumed a lot of people would figure out what he was up to, but very few did. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=497.04s)]
*  It took two years for the drama to play out, but the subprime mortgage market finally collapsed in 2007, just as he had predicted. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=502.04s)]
*  So you made a ton of money. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=510.04s)]
*  Made a ton of money, much more than I ever imagined I'd ever have. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=512.04s)]
*  We made $725 million, I think, on the funds in 2007. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=517.04s)]
*  Michael Berry's advantage was he wasn't part of the collective. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=522.04s)]
*  He was just this guy in a t-shirt and shorts with a glass eyeball and Asperger's syndrome, looking at the numbers, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=525.04s)]
*  and when nobody else really was. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=534.04s)]
*  How can they not look at the numbers? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=538.04s)]
*  I mean, how can Wall Street be selling all of these, buying all of these mortgages and repackaging them, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=540.04s)]
*  and not realizing that there are not very good mortgages? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=546.04s)]
*  Wall Street is able to dilute itself because it's paid to dilute itself. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=550.04s)]
*  That's one of the lessons of this story, is that people see what they're incentivized to see. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=555.04s)]
*  If you pay someone not to see the truth, they will not see the truth. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=562.04s)]
*  And Wall Street organized itself so people were paid to see something other than the truth. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=567.04s)]
*  And that's one of the central messages of the story. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=572.04s)]
*  You have to be very careful with how you incentivize people, because they will respond to the incentives. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=575.04s)]
*  And all of the incentives in Wall Street's largely unregulated bond market were geared toward keeping the subprime money machine humming. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=580.04s)]
*  Shortly after Michael Berry decided the people there had lost their minds, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=588.04s)]
*  Wall Street's most influential investment bank convinced the Financial Products Division of Insurance Giant AIG to join the party, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=592.04s)]
*  a decision that would destroy the company. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=601.04s)]
*  They insured tens of billions of dollars of subprime mortgage loans without even knowing they were doing it. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=604.04s)]
*  Goldman Sachs persuaded them to insure these piles of loans without them ever investigating what was in the pile. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=610.04s)]
*  So there's an additional level of incompetence. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=617.04s)]
*  They didn't even know the mistake they were making. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=620.04s)]
*  Over a period of just a few months in 2005, Goldman Sachs got AIG to insure $20 billion worth of subprime mortgage securities that the rating agencies had graded AAA. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=622.04s)]
*  But in fact, Lewis says, the pools contained some of the worst dreck on the market. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=635.04s)]
*  Do you think the big banks like Goldman Sachs played AIG for a patsy? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=640.04s)]
*  That's exactly what they did. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=645.04s)]
*  I think even Goldman Sachs would admit that to themselves, which is saying something. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=647.04s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=653.04s)]
*  Using the cover of we're all big boys in this market, they, the big investment banks, have long sought to exploit their customers. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=655.04s)]
*  What role did the rating agencies play in this? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=665.04s)]
*  They were handmaidens to Wall Street. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=668.04s)]
*  The ratings agencies get paid by Wall Street, by Merrill Lynch, by Citigroup, by Morgan Stanley, by Goldman Sachs, to rate the bonds that Wall Street creates. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=671.04s)]
*  This creates a certain moral hazard. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=682.04s)]
*  You write in the book that Goldman essentially took the worst stuff that they couldn't sell, they repackaged it and took it to Moody's and got Moody's to rate it AAA? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=684.04s)]
*  Correct. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=693.04s)]
*  How? Did they know that Moody's was going to rate it AAA? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=694.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=698.04s)]
*  They had helped design the models I'm sure that Moody's used to rate the bonds. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=699.04s)]
*  And I've spoken with people at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs who said we helped the ratings agencies understand these things. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=704.04s)]
*  They were the educators. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=712.04s)]
*  Yeah, they were the educators. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=713.04s)]
*  Lewis calls the Goldman Sachs AIG deal one of the original sins of the looming financial crisis. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=714.04s)]
*  Other Wall Street firms were so jealous of the Goldman deal, they got AIG to insure another $30 billion of what turned out to be worthless securities. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=721.04s)]
*  But Lewis thinks the fiasco had more to do with Wall Street's stupidity than corruption. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=731.04s)]
*  They didn't understand these things. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=736.04s)]
*  Not well enough. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=738.04s)]
*  Not well enough. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=739.04s)]
*  I mean there's a wonderful little vignette in the big short about the leading bond trader, subprime mortgage bond trader Morgan Stanley, a fellow named Howie Hubler, who manages to lose somewhere between, it's hard to know, but $7 billion and $12 billion in a matter of six or eight months, more than any single trader has ever lost in the history of Wall Street. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=740.04s)]
*  And no one knows his name. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=761.04s)]
*  According to Lewis, at the end of 2006 and the beginning of 2007, when the commercial bank JP Morgan became the first to recognize the danger and fled the subprime market, Hubler was gobbling up $16 billion worth of subprime mortgage bonds that would be worthless in nine months. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=763.04s)]
*  He did not understand the forces at work in his own market. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=781.04s)]
*  And he is supposed to be the smart guy. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=785.04s)]
*  I mean what were the dumb guys doing? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=787.04s)]
*  So I think that it's really clear that the firms themselves did not understand the machine they created. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=789.04s)]
*  What happened to Howie Hubler? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=798.04s)]
*  He's allowed to resign from Morgan Stanley and he takes with him millions of dollars in back pay. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=799.04s)]
*  Tens of millions of dollars in back pay. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=807.04s)]
*  It was all hushed up basically. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=809.04s)]
*  Did most of the people who made these terrible decisions leave a lot of money? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=812.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=816.04s)]
*  They all did. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=817.04s)]
*  I did not run across a single character who didn't get rich. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=818.04s)]
*  Anybody above a certain level in all these firms made huge sums of money by any standard. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=821.04s)]
*  And the people who were, I mean this is where it gets a little creepy, the people who were most instrumental in building the subprime mortgage machine also happened to be the ones who have the most detailed understanding now of the securities in the rubble. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=827.04s)]
*  And they're being paid all over again to sort through the mess because they are the experts. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=846.04s)]
*  That is an age old trick on Wall Street. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=852.04s)]
*  Just generally speaking. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=856.04s)]
*  People who create disasters make a lot of money cleaning up the disaster because they're the ones who know about the disaster. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=857.04s)]
*  What about the CEOs? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=863.04s)]
*  Stan O'Neill at Merrill Lynch and Chuck Prince at Citigroup are the most obvious examples. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=864.04s)]
*  But they're paid not tens but into the hundreds of millions of dollars to run their firms into the ground. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=873.04s)]
*  By the fall of 2008 with ARG and all of the big investment banks at some risk of going under, the government stepped in to bail out the very firms that had caused the crisis. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=880.04s)]
*  A decision was made that ARG was too big to let fail and that its gambling debts would be paid off 100 cents on the dollar. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=891.04s)]
*  And the company that benefited the most was Goldman Sachs. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=899.04s)]
*  Do you believe it had anything to do with their political connections? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=903.04s)]
*  It's hard to know. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=907.04s)]
*  There's no proof. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=911.04s)]
*  But it certainly didn't hurt. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=913.04s)]
*  It certainly didn't hurt that the Secretary of the Treasury was a former Goldman CEO. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=915.04s)]
*  It certainly didn't hurt that a lot of people at the table were former Goldman employees. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=919.04s)]
*  It certainly didn't hurt that the air everybody breathed contained the assumption that we can never do anything to harm Goldman Sachs. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=924.04s)]
*  So sure, I mean I can't really see how their political influence didn't have anything to do with it. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=933.04s)]
*  When we come back, a look at Wall Street's bonus culture and why Michael Lewis thinks it's become unsustainable. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=944.04s)]
*  Wall Street's bad bets nearly brought down the financial system in 2008. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=955.04s)]
*  One thing that didn't end, Michael Lewis says, was the bonus culture and the sense of entitlement in the financial industry. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=960.04s)]
*  According to the New York State Comptroller, Wall Street employees split $20 billion in bonuses for 2009. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=967.04s)]
*  That's up 17% over last year, but it's not a record. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=974.04s)]
*  In fact, it's a third less than the $33 billion Wall Street divided up in 2007, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=978.04s)]
*  the same year everyone on Wall Street began to acknowledge the subprime mortgage losses that would reach $1.75 trillion. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=985.04s)]
*  The size of the bonuses has left Michael Lewis appalled, but not really surprised. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=993.04s)]
*  More than 20 years ago, Lewis collected a couple of bonuses himself as a young trader at Solomon Brothers, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=999.04s)]
*  and he still can't figure out what he did to deserve them. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1006.04s)]
*  I got my Wall Street bonus, I got two bonuses in 1986 and 1987, and it was like winning the lottery. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1009.04s)]
*  The money was so shocking, even though it seems in retrospect so quaint. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1016.04s)]
*  It was a couple of hundred thousand dollars, but I was 24, 25 years old. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1022.04s)]
*  It was incredible that someone was going to give me a couple of hundred thousand dollars for what I had just done, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1026.04s)]
*  because I couldn't figure out what was so terribly useful about what I had just done. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1030.04s)]
*  And Lewis feels the same way about the latest round of bonuses that were paid out on $55 billion of Wall Street profits [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1033.04s)]
*  that he thinks wouldn't have been made without help from Uncle Sam. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1041.04s)]
*  Once the government decided the banks were too important to fail, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1045.04s)]
*  Lewis says the only way to get them back on their feet was to give them money. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1049.04s)]
*  I think they assumed that in response for this gift of life that they were giving these Wall Street firms, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1053.04s)]
*  the people who ran the Wall Street firms would behave responsibly in a way that didn't attract them. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1059.04s)]
*  Meaning what? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1065.04s)]
*  Meaning not pay themselves huge sums of money. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1066.04s)]
*  Perhaps not even pay themselves anything. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1069.04s)]
*  Just say thank you and rejigger their compensation systems. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1071.04s)]
*  Instead, they did not. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1076.04s)]
*  Instead, they used the market as an excuse for paying themselves. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1078.04s)]
*  If we don't pay our employees of Goldman Sachs huge sums of money, they're going to leave and go to JP Morgan. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1082.04s)]
*  And the JP Morgan people say, well, we don't pay these special people huge sums of money. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1086.04s)]
*  They're going to leave and go to Goldman Sachs. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1089.04s)]
*  And you kind of want to back away from it and say, well, wait a minute. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1091.04s)]
*  Why are they so valuable in the first place? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1095.04s)]
*  And really what's going on is the people at the top of the firm want to make a lot of money. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1097.04s)]
*  And if they're going to make a lot of money, they've got to pay the people under them a lot of money. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1100.04s)]
*  So it's a very elegant form of theft right now. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1104.04s)]
*  Well, their argument has been, look, we're entitled to these bonuses this year because we made all of this money. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1107.04s)]
*  You know, whenever I ask them, they never explain how they made all this money. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1112.04s)]
*  If you look at their businesses right now, they're heavily government dependent. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1116.04s)]
*  That if you were a Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley or JP Morgan, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1121.04s)]
*  you have access to a 0% loan in virtually unlimited quantities from the Federal Reserve. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1126.04s)]
*  You can take that money and reinvest it in Treasury bonds or in government agency securities and you will get the spread. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1132.04s)]
*  And you could do it over and over. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1140.04s)]
*  You're saying you borrow from the government, lending to the government and taking a cut. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1142.04s)]
*  So the government's let them make the money. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1147.04s)]
*  Well, the government is still subsidizing these firms because the losses were sensational. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1149.04s)]
*  I mean, in the financial system, there are now $1.75 trillion of losses from the subprime mortgage of Bonanza. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1154.04s)]
*  And that's their firms that really, they look, they really shouldn't exist. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1162.04s)]
*  If the market had been allowed to function, they would not exist. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1167.04s)]
*  They'd be failed enterprises. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1170.04s)]
*  I mean, even now, if the government said we have nothing to do with these places anymore, we're going to let them fail if they fail, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1172.04s)]
*  they no longer have this effective government guarantee. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1178.04s)]
*  And by the way, we're going to cut out these subsidies that we're that we're handing them under the table. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1181.04s)]
*  Most of them would fail. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1185.04s)]
*  But none of that has changed the Wall Street bonus culture. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1187.04s)]
*  Lewis says there is a sense of entitlement to outrageous compensation that he thinks is way out of proportion to its contribution to the U.S. economy. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1190.04s)]
*  How did that happen? That somebody thinks they're worth automatically millions of dollars a year? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1199.04s)]
*  Well, when you're surrounded by a lot of other people who are being paid millions of dollars a year, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1206.04s)]
*  you're not thinking, oh, it's outrageous for someone to pay me millions of dollars a year. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1211.04s)]
*  You're thinking, it's outrageous that Jim got $500,000 more than me, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1217.04s)]
*  that they are they're looking to each other as reference points rather than to the larger society. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1222.04s)]
*  Are they worth that kind of money? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1227.04s)]
*  What do you mean, are they worth that kind of money? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1229.04s)]
*  Do they deserve all that money? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1232.04s)]
*  Again, what do you mean, do they deserve it? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1234.04s)]
*  Did they did they they worked really hard? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1237.04s)]
*  They spent a lot of hours in the office. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1240.04s)]
*  So you can't begrudge someone who starts a company and employs lots of people and so on and so forth for making a lot of money. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1243.04s)]
*  I don't mind people make a lot of money. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1253.04s)]
*  On Wall Street, the business has become very obviously divorced from productivity from it from productive enterprise. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1256.04s)]
*  So in that sense, no, they don't deserve it. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1264.04s)]
*  They didn't earn it. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1268.04s)]
*  What they did was finagle it. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1270.04s)]
*  They managed they were very good at putting themselves in the middle of large financial transactions [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1273.04s)]
*  that probably shouldn't have happened in the first place and taking out little pieces of it. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1280.04s)]
*  They generated trillions of dollars of subprime mortgage loans that should never have been made. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1284.04s)]
*  But the world would be better off if that whole industry never existed. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1290.04s)]
*  So that's that's crazy. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1294.04s)]
*  Lewis says the more people learn about what happened, the angrier they become. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1296.04s)]
*  What about reform? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1300.04s)]
*  I mean, do you see anything you see anything happening? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1301.04s)]
*  There are several things that obviously should be done that have not been done. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1304.04s)]
*  And you can't explain to my mother why they haven't been done. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1308.04s)]
*  Only a really smart person on Wall Street can explain why they haven't been done. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1312.04s)]
*  But for example, all right, one of the things at the bottom of this crisis, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1316.04s)]
*  we had these ratings agencies that called a lot of things AAA gold plated securities that were worthless. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1320.04s)]
*  And the ratings agencies are paid, of course, by the Wall Street firms for their ratings. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1326.04s)]
*  Why is that allowed? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1332.04s)]
*  Why can you buy a rating? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1334.04s)]
*  That seems like a very obvious thing to change. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1336.04s)]
*  And people talk about it, but it hadn't happened. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1339.04s)]
*  Credit default swaps, insurance contracts that we trade freely, but it's not classified as insurance. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1342.04s)]
*  This market is the closest thing to sort of ground zero of the recent calamity. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1350.04s)]
*  And yet nothing has been done to change the market. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1357.04s)]
*  Nothing's been done to make it more transparent. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1360.04s)]
*  Now, he's been done to make it more like what it is an insurance market. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1362.04s)]
*  That's an obvious reform. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1366.04s)]
*  From the time I was at Solomon Brothers, it was incredible to me that the firm could advise customers what to buy and sell. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1368.04s)]
*  At the same time, they are betting on the things that they're trying to sell their customers. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1377.04s)]
*  So I might call you up and say, wow, these subprime mortgage loans, they look really, really good. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1383.04s)]
*  This pile over here, you ought to invest in that pile. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1393.04s)]
*  And meanwhile, the traders behind me are betting against it. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1396.04s)]
*  Lewis believes the financial industry is living in a world so disconnected from American life that it can't be sustained. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1401.04s)]
*  He thinks it may take a while, but he believes that Wall Street, as we know it, has done itself in. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1408.04s)]
*  The leaders on Wall Street completely lost any sense of their responsibility to the society. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1413.04s)]
*  And if you know you're going to blow up AIG by putting $20 billion of bad subprime mortgage risk into it, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1419.04s)]
*  even though it's going to be very profitable for you, you should stop and say this shouldn't be done. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1426.04s)]
*  The world economy has never shut down this fast. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1442.04s)]
*  In the U.S., virus-related layoffs are expected to measure in the millions and soon. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1446.04s)]
*  For insight into what's coming, we found someone with responsibilities over the economy now [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1453.04s)]
*  and who helped pull the U.S. out of the great recession of 2008. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1459.04s)]
*  That person is Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1464.04s)]
*  In 2008, he was the Treasury official in charge of the $700 billion rescue of the financial system. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1470.04s)]
*  We met Kashkari this past Thursday for an eye-opening look at the stock market freefall, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1478.04s)]
*  the near freeze in the bond markets, and a prediction for this economic emergency. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1485.04s)]
*  Millions of people are going to lose their jobs, and that's what's so scary about this. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1491.04s)]
*  Are we in a recession? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1495.04s)]
*  If we're not right now, we will be soon. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1497.04s)]
*  My basic case scenario is we will at least have a mild recession like after 9-11. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1499.04s)]
*  The worst case would be we'd have a deep recession like the 2008 financial crisis. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1504.04s)]
*  We just don't know right now. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1508.04s)]
*  And what's keeping us from knowing with any certainty? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1509.04s)]
*  Nobody knows how the virus is going to progress. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1513.04s)]
*  How many Americans are going to get it? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1515.04s)]
*  How effective is social distancing going to be? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1517.04s)]
*  How long will it take the health care system to catch up? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1519.04s)]
*  Nationwide, last week there were almost 300,000 people filing first claims for unemployment benefits. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1523.04s)]
*  It could be five times that amount next week, maybe more. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1529.04s)]
*  Where is the bottom? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1533.04s)]
*  If this is a three-month shutdown, we'll find the bottom pretty soon. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1535.04s)]
*  If this is a year-long shutdown, this could be very damaging to the U.S. economy [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1539.04s)]
*  and most importantly to the American people. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1544.04s)]
*  Forty-six-year-old Neel Kashkari has been president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis since 2016. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1546.04s)]
*  He's the son of Indian immigrants and literally a rocket scientist. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1553.04s)]
*  As an engineer, he worked on NASA's spacecraft. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1558.04s)]
*  After Horton Business School, he joined investment firm Goldman Sachs. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1561.04s)]
*  In 2008, as assistant treasury secretary, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1566.04s)]
*  Kashkari ran the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP, that helped end the Great Recession. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1570.04s)]
*  Kashkari was also the Republican nominee for governor of California in 2014. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1579.04s)]
*  Today, he is one of 12 Federal Reserve regional bank presidents who oversee and support the nation's largest banks. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1586.04s)]
*  I heard from a bank in our region. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1595.04s)]
*  A well-to-do customer came in and said, I want to withdraw $600,000 of cash. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1597.04s)]
*  Now, we can supply all the cash that the banks need to meet their customers' concerns, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1602.04s)]
*  but it just speaks to the fear and the uncertainty that is rippling through the economy. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1607.04s)]
*  Will the Federal Reserve ensure that banks have all the cash they need to satisfy whatever withdrawals may be coming? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1611.04s)]
*  Yes, this is the fundamental reason the Federal Reserve exists. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1620.04s)]
*  We call it lender of last resort. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1623.04s)]
*  This is literally why central banks exist. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1625.04s)]
*  If everybody gets scared at the same time and they demand their money back, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1627.04s)]
*  that's why the Federal Reserve is here, is to make sure that there's liquidity, that there's money to meet those demands. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1631.04s)]
*  We will absolutely meet those demands. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1636.04s)]
*  Is the Fed just going to print money? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1639.04s)]
*  That's literally what Congress has told us to do. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1641.04s)]
*  That's the authority that they've given us, to print money and provide liquidity into the financial system. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1644.04s)]
*  And that's how we do it. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1649.04s)]
*  We create it electronically, and then we can also print it with the Treasury Department, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1650.04s)]
*  print it so that you can get money out of your ATM. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1655.04s)]
*  Are the banks sound? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1658.04s)]
*  They are right now. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1660.04s)]
*  Now, we're hearing from big businesses across the country, including in Minnesota, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1661.04s)]
*  that big businesses are drawing down their credit lines. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1664.04s)]
*  They're borrowing money from the banks just because they're nervous. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1667.04s)]
*  And if they're all drawing down these credit lines at the same time, it puts stress on the banking system. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1670.04s)]
*  And that's where the Federal Reserve steps in to provide that liquidity, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1675.04s)]
*  to make sure that the banks have enough money to get out to their customers. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1678.04s)]
*  The Dow has tumbled about 35 percent. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1682.04s)]
*  But something else is wrong. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1685.04s)]
*  Some investors lost confidence in bonds, which normally do well in troubled times. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1687.04s)]
*  The bond market finances government, corporations, and by extension, home buyers. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1693.04s)]
*  And the stresses you're seeing in the bond market are what? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1699.04s)]
*  Well, we were seeing stresses this week in the Treasury market and in the mortgage-backed security market. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1702.04s)]
*  And that's why the Fed stepped in with this very aggressive action to provide liquidity to those markets. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1706.04s)]
*  We saw stresses in the commercial paper market, which is another type of bond market. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1712.04s)]
*  And we're still seeing stresses in the municipal market, where state governments and cities fund themselves, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1716.04s)]
*  and in the corporate bond market. So we're not out of the woods yet. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1721.04s)]
*  And by stresses, you mean what? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1724.04s)]
*  There's just a freezing up of new financings for corporations. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1726.04s)]
*  That's something I'm very focused on. We need to get that market open again. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1730.04s)]
*  Because we don't want blue-chip American companies who have customers, who are operating. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1733.04s)]
*  We don't want this virus to creep into their businesses because they're not able to raise money to meet their basic operational needs. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1740.04s)]
*  We need them to keep running. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1748.04s)]
*  Solid blue-chip American companies are having trouble borrowing money? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1749.04s)]
*  It's more expensive for them to borrow money. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1754.04s)]
*  Say someone's saying, I'm going to go issue a billion dollars of debt to go fund my new factory. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1756.04s)]
*  Those aren't taking place right now. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1760.04s)]
*  People are shunning U.S. Treasury bonds, which are always thought to be the safest possible investment. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1762.04s)]
*  It is. Now keep in mind, Treasury bond prices are still very high relative to history. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1770.04s)]
*  They're just not quite as high as they were a few weeks ago. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1775.04s)]
*  So they still are viewed as a very safe investment, very attractive for a lot of people. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1778.04s)]
*  But this fear of where the virus is going to go is leading people to say, I just want cash. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1783.04s)]
*  And if that's cash under my mattress or in my safe, I'll sleep better at night. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1789.04s)]
*  What's it going to take to get the bond markets working again? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1794.04s)]
*  I think a combination of factors. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1797.04s)]
*  I think Congress taking bold action to say they're standing behind the U.S. economy, the trillion dollar stimulus they're talking about. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1798.04s)]
*  I think that'll help. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1805.04s)]
*  I think continued actions from the Federal Reserve will help. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1806.04s)]
*  And I think more confidence that the health care system is catching up to the crisis. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1809.04s)]
*  This past Sunday, the Fed dropped interest rates nearly to zero. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1814.04s)]
*  Then every day last week, it announced emergency lending programs. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1819.04s)]
*  It pledged to spend at least seven hundred billion dollars supporting mortgages, banks, money market mutual funds, corporate bonds and lending to central banks of other countries because the dollar is the currency of world trade. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1824.04s)]
*  We are being very aggressive. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1842.04s)]
*  And I think our chairman, Jay Powell, has learned from the experience of 2008. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1843.04s)]
*  We're moving much faster than we moved in 2008. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1847.04s)]
*  We're being more aggressive. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1850.04s)]
*  Is there more we can do? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1851.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1852.04s)]
*  Is there more we may end up doing? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1853.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1855.04s)]
*  But I think we're being very aggressive. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1856.04s)]
*  And I think that's the right thing. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1857.04s)]
*  Can you characterize everything that the Fed has done this past week as essentially flooding the system with money? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1859.04s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1866.04s)]
*  And there's no end to your ability to do that? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1867.04s)]
*  There is no end to our ability to do that. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1870.04s)]
*  What did we learn from 2008 when you were in the Treasury Department? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1872.04s)]
*  And how is that being applied today? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1877.04s)]
*  There are two big mistakes when I look back at 2008 that we made that I think are relevant today. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1879.04s)]
*  Number one, we were always too slow and too timid in responding to the crisis. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1884.04s)]
*  The reason is we didn't know how bad it was going to get. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1889.04s)]
*  And we didn't want to overreact. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1891.04s)]
*  And it turned out it got really, really bad. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1893.04s)]
*  And the right answer should have been overreacting to try to avoid the devastating recession that we ended up happening. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1896.04s)]
*  So today, whether it's health care policymakers, fiscal policymakers, which means Congress or the Federal Reserve, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1901.04s)]
*  we should all be erring on the side of overreacting to try to avoid the worst economic outcomes. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1907.04s)]
*  And number two, in 2008, we tried to be very targeted in helping homeowners, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1914.04s)]
*  only helping homeowners who needed a little bit of help because a lot of Americans were angry at the thought of their neighbor getting a bailout for being irresponsible or so they thought. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1919.04s)]
*  So we tried to target our programs. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1928.04s)]
*  It ended up we didn't help very many people. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1930.04s)]
*  We would have been much better off if we had been much more generous in our support for homeowners, deserving and not deserving. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1932.04s)]
*  We would have had a less serious crisis. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1939.04s)]
*  So my advice to Congress as they're designing their programs to help workers and help small businesses, err on being generous. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1942.04s)]
*  When America gets back to work, how long does it take to recover from this? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1949.04s)]
*  You know, the economy can bounce back fairly quickly. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1955.04s)]
*  It's the workers that take time. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1958.04s)]
*  That's the one of the other lessons from 2008. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1960.04s)]
*  It took more than 10 years to put America fully back to work relative to where they were before the crisis. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1962.04s)]
*  Ten years. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1969.04s)]
*  And so that's what we have to try to avoid having these mass layoffs. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1970.04s)]
*  We can't have another 10 year recovery. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1975.04s)]
*  The deadline for filing taxes, both personal and business, has been postponed until July. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1977.04s)]
*  This past week, the House and the Senate proposed trillion dollar emergency spending plans. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1985.04s)]
*  The bills envision sending government checks directly to households, expansion of unemployment insurance, corporate tax cuts and relief for small business. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=1991.04s)]
*  Republicans and Democrats are haggling over the details. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2002.04s)]
*  Well, what do the small businesses need? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2006.04s)]
*  I think that they need forgivable loans. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2008.04s)]
*  It's much better if we can keep small businesses to retain their workers than to lay them off. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2011.04s)]
*  What do you mean by forgivable loans? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2016.04s)]
*  I've heard a proposal that if the government made a loan to a small business, if they retained their workers, the government would forgive the loan after a couple of years, just to avoid the mass layoffs that we're starting to see right now. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2018.04s)]
*  Sort of a bridge loan to get the local restaurant or the local mechanic through this period of time. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2030.04s)]
*  That's right. And importantly, keeping their workers employed. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2037.04s)]
*  That's much better because once people are lost into the sidelines, it just takes a long time to get them back. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2040.04s)]
*  The Federal Reserve System, as we know it today, was set up in the Great Depression to regulate big banks, set interest rates and be the source of all cash. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2047.04s)]
*  That's why every bill in your pocket is inscribed Federal Reserve Note. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2058.04s)]
*  The Fed's mandate is to provide the highest rate of employment with the lowest rate of inflation. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2063.04s)]
*  But in 2008, it invoked its authority for the first time to take on the role of emergency first responder. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2069.04s)]
*  If the current measures are not enough, what else can the Fed do? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2078.04s)]
*  Well, we have very broad authorities with our emergency lending authorities that have to be done in concert with the Treasury Secretary. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2082.04s)]
*  We've announced a couple of those measures this week on money markets and commercial paper as an example. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2088.04s)]
*  Some people have suggested that we should be providing more support directly to the corporate bond market, and I'm sympathetic with those views, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2094.04s)]
*  and also the municipal market, making sure that states and cities are able to access the capital markets as well. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2101.04s)]
*  So there's a range of things that the Federal Reserve could do. We're far from out of ammunition. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2107.04s)]
*  Far from out of ammunition. Sunday, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate to zero. Can you go below zero? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2111.04s)]
*  In theory we could. Some countries have. I don't think many of us, I don't think any of us on the committee think that's a particularly good idea. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2119.04s)]
*  It creates other challenges for financial markets. But in the last crisis, we used something called quantitative easing, buying long-term bonds. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2125.04s)]
*  We've got a lot more experience on how to do that. It didn't trigger inflation. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2132.04s)]
*  So there are other tools that we've used before that I think we could also use again and use again aggressively. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2136.04s)]
*  States are facing an enormous surge in unemployment claims. Connecticut alone, which normally has a little over 2,000 claims a week, saw 72,000 last week. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2142.04s)]
*  When the national number of new claims for unemployment is released on Thursday, it's expected to be in the millions. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2155.04s)]
*  The Fed is now watching China and South Korea, where the outbreak appears to be subsiding. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2163.04s)]
*  What are you seeing in China? Well, China appears to be turning back on and they are telling a very good story that they've got their arms around this. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2170.04s)]
*  They don't have new cases. But if at the same time they're saying lots of people had the disease with no symptoms. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2177.04s)]
*  So unless you've tested everybody, how do you know that you've really got this under control? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2184.04s)]
*  And as you relax the economic controls, does the virus simply flare back up again? We just don't know yet. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2189.04s)]
*  To the person who is about to grab their car keys and go to the ATM and take out $3,000, you say what? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2195.04s)]
*  You don't need to. Your ATM is safe. Your banks are safe. There's enough cash in the financial system and there is an infinite amount of cash at the Federal Reserve. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2202.04s)]
*  We will do whatever we need to do to make sure that there's enough cash in the banking system. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2211.04s)]
*  Are you optimistic or pessimistic? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2215.04s)]
*  Overall, I'm optimistic. Having been at the front line of the 2008 financial crisis and I saw how devastating that was, we did get through it. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2218.04s)]
*  It was very painful for millions of Americans. We did get through it. We will get through this crisis. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2227.04s)]
*  Jerome Powell shook Washington, Wall Street and the world this past week when he warned the pandemic crisis threatens lasting damage to American prosperity. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2233.04s)]
*  As chairman of the Federal Reserve, Powell was among the most powerful people in the economy. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2255.04s)]
*  He acted swiftly in the sharpest collapse since the Great Depression, but he fears Congress's initial $3 trillion bailout will not be enough to save a generation from low growth and stagnant incomes. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2260.04s)]
*  We asked Chairman Powell how high unemployment will go and how long it will take to see a recovery. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2274.04s)]
*  He spoke to us this past Wednesday after a blunt speech that gave markets a shove. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2281.04s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, I just got a push notification on my phone. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2288.04s)]
*  Dow tanks more than 500 points in Wall Street's selloff after Fed chair warns economic recovery will be prolonged and bumpy. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2291.04s)]
*  You knew that was coming. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2304.04s)]
*  I've been watching the markets. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2306.04s)]
*  Truth is, the markets have been watching him. His speech Wednesday was a warning and a prayer. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2308.04s)]
*  He raised the specter of a prolonged recession and weak recovery if the federal government doesn't use all its power to support business and workers. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2314.04s)]
*  I was really calling out a risk that I think is an important one for people to be cognizant of. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2324.04s)]
*  The risk of longer run damage to the economy and really the good news is that we have the tools to limit that longer run damage by continuing to provide support to households and businesses as we get through this. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2330.04s)]
*  What metrics are you looking at here hour by hour, day to day, to divine what the future is going to be? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2345.04s)]
*  The thing that matters more than anything else is the medical metrics, frankly. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2354.04s)]
*  It's the spread of the virus. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2358.04s)]
*  The real time economic data that we're seeing is just a function of how successful the social distancing measures are. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2360.04s)]
*  So the data we'll see for this quarter, which ends in June, will be very, very bad. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2368.04s)]
*  There'll be a big decline in economic activity, big increase in unemployment. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2373.04s)]
*  So what we're really looking at is getting the medical data, which is not what we usually look at, taken care of so that the economic data can start to recover. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2377.04s)]
*  Congress has already spent $3 trillion on relief, but another $3 trillion, passed Friday by House Democrats, is a dead letter in the Senate amid a partisan debate over how much to borrow. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2386.04s)]
*  We're in no rush. We're in no rush. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2400.04s)]
*  Talk of slowing the economic response is among the reasons Powell is speaking tonight. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2402.04s)]
*  He's a Republican appointed by President Trump. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2408.04s)]
*  Congress has done a great deal and done it very quickly. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2411.04s)]
*  There is no precedent in post-World War II American history that's even close to what Congress has done. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2415.04s)]
*  And the question is, will it be enough? And I don't think we know the answer to that. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2422.04s)]
*  It may well be that the Fed has to do more. It may be that Congress has to do more. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2426.04s)]
*  As this period of time grows longer, what begins to happen to the economy? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2431.04s)]
*  There's a real risk that if people are out of work for long periods of time, that their skills atrophy a little bit and they lose contact with the workforce. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2435.04s)]
*  Longer and deeper recessions tend to leave behind damage to people's careers. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2448.04s)]
*  The small and medium-sized businesses that are so important to this country, if they have to go through a wave of avoidable insolvencies, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2455.04s)]
*  you've lost something there that's more than just a few businesses. It's really the job creation machine. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2465.04s)]
*  Keeping people and businesses out of insolvency just for maybe three or six more months, while the health authorities do what they can do, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2473.04s)]
*  we can buy time with that. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2482.04s)]
*  I was speaking to a former official of the Federal Reserve who said, V-shaped recovery, off the table. There's no chance. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2484.04s)]
*  Well, I would say the main thing is to get back on the road to recovery. And I think that can happen relatively soon. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2494.04s)]
*  Likely to happen in the second half of the year. That's a reasonable expectation. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2501.04s)]
*  After that, the path is going to depend on a range of things. It's very plausible that the economy will take some time to gather momentum. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2505.04s)]
*  We spoke to Powell in the Federal Reserve boardroom. The Washington headquarters was otherwise silent, its staff working from home. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2513.04s)]
*  The building, dedicated in 1937 by FDR, was itself a Depression-era project to create construction jobs. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2523.04s)]
*  The Fed is the source of all U.S. currency, and it regulates the economy by setting interest rates. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2533.04s)]
*  In the Depression, it was given vast power to lend money in an emergency. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2539.04s)]
*  It used that authority for the first time in the 2008 collapse, and for the second time nine weeks ago. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2545.04s)]
*  Has the Fed done all it can do? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2554.04s)]
*  Well, there's a lot more we can do. We're not out of ammunition by a long shot. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2556.04s)]
*  No, there's really no limit to what we can do with these lending programs that we have. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2560.04s)]
*  In March, as the Dow collapsed 8,000 points and credit markets began to freeze, Powell called an emergency meeting on a Sunday. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2565.04s)]
*  He cut interest rates to near zero, and in partnership with the Treasury, the Federal Reserve offered more than $3 trillion in lending to banks, businesses, cities and states. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2574.04s)]
*  With that assurance, the credit markets essential to daily business began to function again. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2587.04s)]
*  Fair to say you simply flooded the system with money. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2593.04s)]
*  Yes, we did. That's another way to think about it. We did. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2597.04s)]
*  Where does it come from? Do you just print it? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2601.04s)]
*  We print it digitally. So we, you know, we as a central bank, we have the ability to create money digitally. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2604.04s)]
*  And we do that by buying Treasury bills or bonds or other government guaranteed securities. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2612.04s)]
*  And that actually increases the money supply. We also print actual currency and we distribute that to the Federal Reserve banks. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2618.04s)]
*  But by law, Chairman Powell's Federal Reserve can only lend money that must be paid back. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2625.04s)]
*  Congress, he believes, should spend money to expand its historic bailout. After all, he says, this emergency is nothing like 2008. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2631.04s)]
*  This is not because there was some inherent problem, a housing bubble or something like that, or the financial system in trouble. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2641.04s)]
*  Nothing like that. The economy was fine. The financial system was fine. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2647.04s)]
*  We're doing this to protect ourselves from the virus. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2651.04s)]
*  And that means that when the virus outbreak is behind us, the economy should be able to recover substantially. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2654.04s)]
*  And what sort of support, in your view, do you think the Congress would want to consider? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2662.04s)]
*  I don't give them advice on particular policies, but I would say, if I may, that policies that help businesses avoid avoidable insolvencies and that do the same for individuals. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2667.04s)]
*  Keep workers in their homes. Keep them paying their bills. Keep families solvent. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2679.04s)]
*  Among the options, extending the increase in unemployment benefits, which expires in July, and supporting local governments, which are struggling with a collapse in tax revenue. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2685.04s)]
*  Powell believes trillions in additional federal debt could be paid down over decades. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2697.04s)]
*  The U.S. has been spending more than it's been taking in for some time, and that's something we're going to have to deal with. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2703.04s)]
*  The time to do that is when the economy is strong, when unemployment is low, when economic activity is high. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2712.04s)]
*  That's when you deal with that problem. This is not the time to prioritize that concern. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2718.04s)]
*  We have the ability to borrow at low rates. We have the ability to service that debt. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2724.04s)]
*  And I would say this is the time when we can use that strength to our longer-run benefit. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2728.04s)]
*  What economic reality do the American people need to be prepared for? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2735.04s)]
*  Well, I would take a more optimistic cut at that if I could. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2740.04s)]
*  And that is, this is a time of great suffering and difficulty, and it's come on us so quickly and with such force that you really can't put into words the pain people are feeling and the uncertainty they're realizing. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2743.04s)]
*  And it's going to take a while for us to get back, but I would just say this. In the long run, and even in the medium run, you wouldn't want to bet against the American economy. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2757.04s)]
*  This economy will recover. It may take a while. It may take a period of time. It could stretch through the end of next year. We really don't know. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2766.04s)]
*  Can there be a recovery without a reasonably effective vaccine? [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2775.04s)]
*  Assuming there's not a second wave of the coronavirus, I think you'll see the economy recover steadily through the second half of this year. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2780.04s)]
*  So for the economy to fully recover, people will have to be fully confident, and that may have to await the arrival of a vaccine. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2790.04s)]
*  If an effective vaccine arrives, millions of doses are likely well over a year away. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2798.04s)]
*  This month, President Trump pressed states to reopen without a vaccine or adequate testing. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2805.04s)]
*  Well, I feel about vaccines like I feel about tests. This is going to go away without a vaccine. It's going to go away, and we're not going to see it again, hopefully, after a period of time. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2812.04s)]
*  Chairman Powell says vaccine development is highly uncertain, and until then, major industries will suffer. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2821.04s)]
*  The parts that involve people being in the same place very close together, those parts of the economy will be challenged until people feel really safe again. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2829.04s)]
*  Sporting events, theaters. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2837.04s)]
*  I would think those would be very difficult. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2839.04s)]
*  Airlines. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2841.04s)]
*  It'll be quite challenging for them. Lots of the rest of the economy, though, can move ahead, but we can't fully recover, because those other parts of the economy matter. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2842.04s)]
*  We can't fully recover, though, until people feel confident that they're safe. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2853.04s)]
*  You are an enormous fan of the Washington Capitals. When do you think you're going to be comfortable going back to a game? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2856.04s)]
*  You know, certainly no sooner than next season. Generally, public sporting events, public concerts and things like that, those will be among the last things that can be resumed. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2863.04s)]
*  Most states are taking early steps to reopen, even though the U.S. lacks the testing capacity experts say is indispensable to success. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2876.04s)]
*  If the economy reopens and the infection rate surges, what then? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2886.04s)]
*  The government would have to reintroduce these social distancing measures and that you would have another downturn, and that would be bad for confidence. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2892.04s)]
*  So that's a risk we really want to avoid. You know, the virus hasn't gone away. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2899.04s)]
*  The reason that cases have gone down and are declining is because people have been in their homes and not in their businesses and not out among crowds. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2905.04s)]
*  Powell told us the economy will shrink dramatically in the second quarter, April, May and June, at an annualized rate of around 30 percent. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2914.04s)]
*  This past week, the Labor Department reported a total of more than 35 million Americans had lost their jobs so far. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2924.04s)]
*  The unemployment rate will be historic. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2933.04s)]
*  And your people are projecting what? 20 percent? 25 percent? [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2936.04s)]
*  There are a range of perspectives, but those are those numbers are sound about right for what the peak may be. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2942.04s)]
*  25 percent is the estimated height of unemployment during the Great Depression. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2949.04s)]
*  Do you think history will look back on this time and call this the second Great Depression? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2955.04s)]
*  No, I don't. I don't think that's a likely outcome at all. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2961.04s)]
*  We had a very healthy economy two months ago. Our financial system is strong. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2964.04s)]
*  You have governments around the world and central banks around the world responding with great force and very quickly and staying at it. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2968.04s)]
*  So I think all of those things point to what will be a it's going to be a very sharp downturn. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2976.04s)]
*  It should be a much shorter downturn than you would associate with 1930s. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2982.04s)]
*  You expect the third quarter to see growth. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2987.04s)]
*  It's a reasonable expectation that there'll be growth in the second half of the year. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2990.04s)]
*  I would say, though, we're not going to get back to where we were quickly. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2993.04s)]
*  We won't get back to where we were by the end of the year. That's unlikely to happen. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=2997.04s)]
*  In terms of the workforce, Mr. Chairman, who is getting hurt the worst by this downturn? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=3002.04s)]
*  People who are getting hurt the worst are the most recently hired, the lowest paid people. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=3008.04s)]
*  It's women, to an extraordinary extent, of the people who were working in February, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=3013.04s)]
*  who were making less than forty thousand dollars per year, almost 40 percent have lost their jobs in the last month or so. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=3018.04s)]
*  What gives you hope in this dark time? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=3026.04s)]
*  We have highly industrious people. We have the most dynamic economy in the world. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=3029.04s)]
*  And, you know, we're the home of so much of the great technology in the world. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=3034.04s)]
*  So in the long run, I would say the U.S. economy will recover. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=3039.04s)]
*  We'll get back to the place we were in February. We'll get to an even better place than that. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=3045.04s)]
*  I'm highly confident of that. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=3049.04s)]
*  So I think we're going to need to help each other through this. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=3051.04s)]
*  And we will. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IFGV9Y13c&t=3055.04s)]
