# Disinformation warfare and Russian hacking | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [November 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE)
*  It's widely accepted that Vladimir Putin used disinformation warfare to interfere in our [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=0.0s)]
*  2016 presidential campaign. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  But how exactly did he do it? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=22.36s)]
*  Well, according to a U.S. intelligence report, one of his weapons was a Russian television [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=24.68s)]
*  network called RT. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=29.96s)]
*  It stands for Russia Today, and you can find it on many of our cable or satellite systems, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=32.4s)]
*  just like any other news outlet. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=38.08s)]
*  We recently went to Moscow to meet with the head of RT, Margarita Simonyan. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=40.8s)]
*  We arrived just as the Justice Department was insisting that RT register as a foreign [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=46.2s)]
*  in the United States under an 80-year-old law enacted to expose Nazi propaganda. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=52.559999999999995s)]
*  And Simonyan was scalding mad. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=59.44s)]
*  Should we close American media in Russia because they're all anti-Putin and they wage campaigns [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=63.32s)]
*  against him every single day? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=71.08s)]
*  Should we close them? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=72.84s)]
*  You tell me. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=73.84s)]
*  No one's closing you. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=74.84s)]
*  No one's closing you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=75.84s)]
*  What they're doing is destroying our reputation. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  Should we do the same thing here in Russia to all the American media? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=80.56s)]
*  They're all anti-Putin. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=83.76s)]
*  Should we do that? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=85.44s)]
*  Probably should, shouldn't we? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  Margarita Simonyan is blustery, a force to reckon with. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  She's the head of a vast state-run TV network with almost 2,500 employees. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=93.76s)]
*  They broadcast around the world with a Spanish channel for Latin America, an Arabic channel [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=100.36s)]
*  for the Middle East, and four English editions, including RT UK and RT America, available [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  on cable and satellite. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=120.08s)]
*  While not a lot of Americans watch RT on TV, it is widely disseminated on social media [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=122.08s)]
*  and YouTube, where it has racked up more than 2 billion views. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=130.04s)]
*  Much of their schedule is routine news of the day or talk shows, including this one [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=135.72s)]
*  hosted by Larry King. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=141.44s)]
*  There is no movie like this movie. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=143.8s)]
*  We wanted a CNN of our own. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=146.4s)]
*  You can put it in these words. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=147.84s)]
*  That would be true. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=149.4s)]
*  I can't deny it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=150.4s)]
*  Let me tell you what U.S. intelligence agencies say about RT. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  And I'm talking about the CIA, FBI, and NSA. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=156.12s)]
*  They describe you as a weapon in an information war. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=160.64s)]
*  All the Russian intelligence agencies call the American media the same. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=165.28s)]
*  I think that's what the intelligence agencies do. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  I think it's pretty much their job. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=173.52s)]
*  She dismisses the U.S. intelligence report that assesses with high confidence that Putin [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=176.08s)]
*  ordered an influence campaign aimed at the U.S. election and that RT, Russia's state-run [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=181.72s)]
*  propaganda machine, contributed to the influence campaign. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  In this intelligence report, I don't even know how many references to you. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=192.48s)]
*  Twenty-seven. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=197.32s)]
*  Twenty-seven references to you, a photograph of you, and a cartoon of you stepping over [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=198.32s)]
*  the White House. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=204.44s)]
*  There's nothing illegal that we did. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=205.44s)]
*  There's nothing murky. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=207.23999999999998s)]
*  There's no weird activity that we're involved in. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=209.04s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=212.92s)]
*  To most of our questions, her answer was, well, what about you? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=213.92s)]
*  Let's talk about Russian interference in our election, which our intelligence agencies [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=219.0s)]
*  tell us happened. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=225.24s)]
*  And you believe them, just like you believe that they were weapons of mass destruction [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=226.24s)]
*  in Iraq. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=231.0s)]
*  Didn't you believe that? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=232.0s)]
*  Continue to believe that Russian interference in American elections happened. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=234.16s)]
*  In five years, you will know that it didn't. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  It's also Facebook and Twitter say the same thing now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=239.68s)]
*  What do they say? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=243.4s)]
*  What do they say? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=244.4s)]
*  They say that the Russians used their websites to perpetrate pro-Trump, anti-Hillary Clinton [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=245.96s)]
*  information. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  I can't deny that there could have been Russian media that had their opinion on Twitter, on [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=256.6s)]
*  Facebook, whatever, broadcast. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=262.6s)]
*  Is that bad? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=265.08s)]
*  Is that illegal? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=266.08s)]
*  Isn't that what the American media do as well? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=267.08s)]
*  British media supported Hillary. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=269.64s)]
*  No problem with that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=272.24s)]
*  No interference. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  French media supported Hillary. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=275.35999999999996s)]
*  No problem with that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=277.4s)]
*  Some Russian media supported Trump. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=279.35999999999996s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  Did RT support Trump? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=282.2s)]
*  No. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=283.64s)]
*  RT did not support Trump. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=284.64s)]
*  Our fault is that RT did not support Hillary either. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=285.64s)]
*  I know that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=289.52s)]
*  I wanted to win somebody who would be nicer to Russia. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=290.79999999999995s)]
*  Did you get that? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=295.44s)]
*  No. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=296.44s)]
*  Is it even possible? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=298.76s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=299.76s)]
*  One curiosity is RT's connection to Michael Flynn, President Trump's former national security [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=300.92s)]
*  adviser who has pled guilty to lying to the FBI in the Russia probe. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=307.04s)]
*  Simonyan invited him to RT's 10th anniversary gala in 2015. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=312.6s)]
*  You paid him $45,000 to come to the event and sat him next to Mr. Putin. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=318.0s)]
*  It just conjures up the idea that eventually he may have been some kind of a conduit when [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=323.6s)]
*  he did get close to Trump. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=329.64000000000004s)]
*  Because he sat next to Putin. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=331.76000000000005s)]
*  Not because he sat next to Putin, but there was some relationship. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=333.6s)]
*  With Putin. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=337.8s)]
*  Putin didn't know who he was. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=338.8s)]
*  I give you my word on that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=339.8s)]
*  But members of Congress want this further investigated since Flynn failed to disclose [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=341.48s)]
*  these contacts on his security clearance forms. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=346.44s)]
*  So you've had this job for how long? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=350.44s)]
*  For 12 years now. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=353.16s)]
*  12 years. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=354.88s)]
*  It started when you were 25. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=355.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=358.32000000000005s)]
*  She was a young reporter covering the Kremlin at the time and Putin liked her work. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=359.48s)]
*  So when RT was created, she was tapped to be the editor in chief of the new state-owned [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=364.84s)]
*  TV network. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=370.56s)]
*  I marvel that a 25-year-old was given that job. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=372.08s)]
*  I do too. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=376.84s)]
*  But it worked, didn't it? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=378.76s)]
*  When it started, the focus was on happy stories about Russia. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=380.24s)]
*  But according to U.S. intelligence, under her leadership and Putin's guidance, RT morphed [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=385.0s)]
*  into a tool to attack the West. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=390.76s)]
*  Its budget, set by the Kremlin, grew tenfold to over $300 million a year. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=394.08s)]
*  That's because RT is part of a larger strategy. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=402.4s)]
*  Five years ago, Russia's highest-ranking military officer wrote what's known as the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=406.12s)]
*  Gorazimov Doctrine, saying that in warfare, information can be more effective than a military [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=410.76s)]
*  weapon, an idea that was then put into action. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=417.0s)]
*  Your defense minister said in February that he had formed a new branch of the military [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=421.12s)]
*  called Information Warfare Troops. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=428.12s)]
*  I don't know if that's the case, if that's what the military is doing. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=430.84000000000003s)]
*  We know that that's what NATO has been doing for years and years. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=434.56s)]
*  They're military. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=438.64s)]
*  We're not military. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=439.8s)]
*  In 2012, you said that Russia needs RT the same way it needs a defense ministry. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=440.8s)]
*  And you've also said RT was fighting, quote, an information war against the whole Western [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=447.76s)]

*  We asked Julian Assange whether he has the e-mail that could put Hillary Clinton in prison. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=591.98s)]
*  RT's most popular segment about candidate Clinton, with over 10 million views online, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=597.4200000000001s)]

*  That's not accurate, but it's right out of the Russian playbook, Disinform and Distort, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=611.9399999999999s)]

*  the Pentagon of inventing Ebola. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=635.98s)]
*  Can you blame anyone for distrusting the U.S.'s medical intentions at this point? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=638.74s)]
*  They air a steady diet of violent protests and racial conflict to suggest the U.S. lacks [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=643.3000000000001s)]

*  Right now, if we open a website of the American media funded by the American government and [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=662.1s)]
*  read what is there right now, that is what screams that not only Russian democracy is [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=668.62s)]

*  Typically on RT, NATO is bad, Assad of Syria is not. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=686.14s)]
*  The U.S. foments conflict. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=691.1999999999999s)]
*  Russia does not. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=693.68s)]
*  You're telling me you didn't invade Crimea? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=694.68s)]
*  No, we did not. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=696.88s)]
*  You call it invasion. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=698.18s)]
*  But what do you call it? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=699.18s)]
*  We call it the free will of the people. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=700.18s)]
*  And now European leaders agree with the U.S. intelligence report. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=703.92s)]
*  French President Emmanuel Macron, with Putin at his side, accused Russia of interfering [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=708.76s)]
*  in their election, calling RT an agent of propaganda. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=715.04s)]
*  And British Prime Minister Theresa May made some of the same charges against the Kremlin. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=719.48s)]
*  It is seeking to weaponize information, deploying its state-run media organizations to sow discord [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=727.24s)]
*  in the West and undermine our institutions. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=734.22s)]
*  RT says that in the U.S. it has begun facing repercussions from Silicon Valley. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=737.4s)]
*  YouTube downgraded their preferred channel status and Twitter banned RT ads from their [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=743.96s)]
*  platform. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=749.96s)]

*  What happened to that? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=769.12s)]
*  What happened to the American way? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=770.88s)]
*  If you register as a foreign agent, you still are protected by the First Amendment and there [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=773.48s)]
*  is still no censorship. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=778.4s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=779.4s)]
*  So what? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=780.4s)]
*  That is true. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=781.4s)]
*  No, that's not true. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=782.4s)]
*  Because effectively, not a lot of people would like to work being labeled a foreign agent. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=783.4s)]
*  The same thing will happen to American media in Russia. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=787.6800000000001s)]
*  Exactly the same. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=790.76s)]
*  And we will see how many people will still work for American media in Russia being labeled [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=791.76s)]
*  a foreign agent. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=795.9200000000001s)]

*  Not me. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=797.9200000000001s)]

*  Definitely. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=800.9200000000001s)]
*  They already said that. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=801.9200000000001s)]
*  And indeed, Russia hastily passed a law enabling its Justice Ministry to label U.S. government-owned [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=803.92s)]
*  media like Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, and Voice of America, foreign agents. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=811.04s)]

*  They weren't looking for all the Democrats or all the Republicans or all the people who [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=985.1800000000001s)]
*  lived in one district or another? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=988.62s)]
*  There was no rhyme or reason to it. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=990.46s)]
*  Steve Sanvoss showed us the voter registration website where the hackers exploited a security [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=992.5s)]
*  flaw to get in. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=998.3000000000001s)]
*  His IT team determined the attackers had been in their system, unseen, for three weeks. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1000.34s)]
*  They only noticed when the hackers suddenly ramped up their attack and in just a couple [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1007.1s)]
*  of hours scooped up bits of information on up to 90,000 voters, complete records of 3,500. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1012.22s)]
*  His engineers upgraded the firewall and plugged the website holes. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1019.86s)]
*  That stopped the data heist, but not the attack. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1024.98s)]
*  The hits continued even though they weren't penetrating. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1028.62s)]
*  The logs revealed that about a million and a half hits were coming in. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1032.62s)]
*  A million and a half? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1037.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1038.34s)]
*  Five queries per second for a period of approximately 30 days. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1039.34s)]
*  So this almost seems like they wanted to be noticed. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1044.1799999999998s)]
*  The only thing they didn't do is identify themselves as the Russians. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1047.58s)]
*  Sanvoss says he suspected the hackers wanted to sow doubt about the integrity of the vote. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1051.06s)]
*  Illinois notified the FBI. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1057.78s)]
*  What Illinois discovered set off a chain of events that take us to today. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1061.02s)]
*  Former FBI agent Anthony Ferrante was director of cyber incident response for President Barack [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1065.86s)]
*  Obama's National Security Council. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1071.94s)]
*  When you go in to investigate this intrusion that the state of Illinois saw, what did you [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1075.14s)]
*  see? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1082.3s)]
*  The FBI identified digital fingerprints left by the intruder. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1083.3s)]
*  Think of it as a crime scene where fingerprints are dusted and pulled. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1087.82s)]
*  We do the same thing when investigating a computer intrusion. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1091.74s)]
*  And your analysis pointed the finger at Russia. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1096.4199999999998s)]
*  It did indeed. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1099.78s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security was so alarmed by what it saw the Russians doing, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1101.7s)]
*  it took the unprecedented step of arranging a conference call with election officials [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1106.98s)]
*  from all 50 states. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1112.1s)]
*  The FBI put out this flash alert. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1114.3s)]
*  But the intelligence community wasn't prepared to publicly implicate Russia. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1117.58s)]
*  So the call and the alert simply warned states to be on the lookout for the kind of malicious [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1122.6999999999998s)]
*  attack that had hit Illinois. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1128.8999999999999s)]
*  Did information from other states start flooding in? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1131.4599999999998s)]
*  I would show up to work every single day and learn of two, three, four more states that [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1134.3799999999999s)]
*  had been actively targeted by the same actors. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1140.7s)]
*  And it was after two or three weeks of this that my colleagues and I said we have to believe [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1144.42s)]
*  that this is a large-scale coordinated campaign to target every single state in the union. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1149.6200000000001s)]
*  Anthony Ferrante reported what he was learning to Michael Daniel, President Obama's cyber [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1157.0600000000002s)]
*  czar. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1162.5800000000002s)]
*  What was the reaction when you saw this in the White House? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1163.5800000000002s)]
*  I think that was the point we realized that we were playing a different game, that we [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1166.3400000000001s)]
*  had thought that we were dealing with the normal sort of espionage routine that was [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1170.5s)]
*  associated with presidential elections. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1173.86s)]
*  And we now realize that we are potentially dealing with something way more serious. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1176.9s)]
*  Sixty minutes obtained this previously undisclosed Department of Homeland Security internal document [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1181.78s)]
*  that details the scope of the Russian cyber attack, a snapshot of what investigators were [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1187.58s)]
*  seeing on October 28th, less than two weeks before the presidential election. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1193.18s)]
*  The document shows hackers tried to get into 20 state election systems and an election [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1199.3s)]
*  IT provider in Nebraska. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1204.7s)]
*  Hackers successfully infiltrated Illinois, a county election database in Arizona, a Tennessee [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1207.7s)]
*  state website and an IT vendor in Florida. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1213.26s)]
*  But it was always our working assumption that we did not detect all of the potential Russian [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1217.3s)]
*  activity that was going on. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1221.82s)]
*  There's other stuff that they might have done that we don't know. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1223.78s)]
*  It's entirely possible. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1227.98s)]
*  They quickly ruled out the Russians were tampering with voting machines. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1229.42s)]
*  There are tens of thousands of them and they're not connected to the internet. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1233.58s)]
*  What seemed much more likely to us was causing chaos at the polls on election day. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1237.88s)]
*  So if you intrude into a voter registration database and you change two digits of everybody's [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1243.04s)]
*  address so that their voter ID doesn't match what's in the voter rolls when they show up [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1247.7s)]
*  at the polls. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1253.16s)]
*  And that creates chaos? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1254.16s)]
*  Sure. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1255.9s)]
*  When those stories start to spread, lines begin to form, election officials can't figure [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1257.06s)]
*  out what's going on. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1261.96s)]
*  You would only have to do it in a few places and it would almost feed on itself. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1263.24s)]
*  Compounding that worry, states were reluctant to accept cybersecurity help from Homeland [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1268.22s)]
*  Security. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1273.54s)]
*  Under the constitution, states run elections. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1275.02s)]
*  Several pushed back against what they saw as federal intrusion, still unaware the threat [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1278.7s)]
*  was coming from Russia. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1284.86s)]
*  Our system was under attack. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1286.86s)]
*  Why not scream it from the top of the roof and let the states know that this was a serious, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1288.3s)]
*  incredible threat. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1294.9799999999998s)]
*  The Obama administration did not want to appear to be biased. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1296.34s)]
*  We had a presidential candidate who was campaigning on the fact that the election was rigged and [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1300.8999999999999s)]
*  he wasn't certain he was going to get a fair shot at the presidency. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1307.9799999999998s)]
*  And I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1312.3s)]
*  I have to be honest. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1313.9399999999998s)]
*  It was a very sensitive issue. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1315.86s)]
*  On October 7th, three months after the Illinois hack and one month before the election, the [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1318.5s)]
*  Obama administration decided it had enough evidence to call out the Russians. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1324.1799999999998s)]
*  But there was no press conference, no pronouncement from the Oval Office, just this three paragraph [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1329.82s)]
*  statement saying the Kremlin intended to interfere with the U.S. election process. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1335.5s)]
*  Did that statement get the reaction that you had hoped for? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1341.46s)]
*  There were some other news events that happened around the release of that statement that [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1344.82s)]
*  tended to swamp some of it out. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1348.06s)]
*  The Access Hollywood tape, yes. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1349.9399999999998s)]
*  Hello, how are you? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1352.06s)]
*  Hi. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1353.46s)]
*  The hacked emails of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, were also leaked the [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1354.46s)]
*  same day. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1359.8999999999999s)]
*  The press and the public paid little attention to the administration's statement on Russian [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1361.46s)]
*  hacking. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1365.9399999999998s)]
*  So the National Security Council did something never done before, contacted Russia on the [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1367.26s)]
*  cyber hotline, a communication channel added to the old nuclear hotline in 2013 to prevent [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1373.22s)]
*  cyber war. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1380.46s)]
*  So what did the message say? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1382.14s)]
*  It basically said, we know that you are carrying out these kinds of activities and stop, knock [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1383.5s)]
*  it off. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1390.34s)]
*  Was that tough enough? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1391.34s)]
*  So I think certainly the fact that this was the first time we'd ever exercised this channel, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1392.94s)]
*  which was supposed to be for very serious cyber incidents and cyber issues, I think [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1398.94s)]
*  that in and of itself sent a message. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1404.8600000000001s)]
*  The Russians brushed it off. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1408.22s)]
*  The administration was bracing for the worst. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1410.46s)]
*  It drew up this Election Day response plan, which called for war rooms at the White House, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1413.94s)]
*  the FBI and Homeland Security, and planned for the unprecedented deployment of armed [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1419.46s)]
*  federal law enforcement agents should a cyber attack cause complete breakdown at a polling [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1426.58s)]
*  place. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1431.5s)]
*  On Election Day, the team saw no signs the Russians tampered with the vote. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1432.88s)]
*  Why do you think they didn't pull the trigger on Election Day? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1438.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1442.74s)]
*  I don't know if we'll ever know. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1443.74s)]
*  Do you think they would have succeeded in creating chaos? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1446.26s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1451.06s)]
*  The agency charged with helping states protect elections from attack is the Department of [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1452.54s)]
*  Homeland Security, DHS. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1457.7s)]
*  The agency has been criticized for a slow response. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1460.66s)]
*  We tried repeatedly to interview Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen or one of her deputies, but [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1464.66s)]
*  DHS denied all our requests. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1470.1s)]
*  Instead, we were directed to the secretary's recent testimony before the Senate Select [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1473.18s)]
*  Committee on Intelligence. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1478.4s)]
*  The threat of interference remains, and we recognize that the 2018 midterm and future [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1480.3s)]
*  elections are clearly potential targets for Russian hacking attempts. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1485.26s)]
*  Secretary Nielsen told the senators DHS is offering to run security checks of state online [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1490.06s)]
*  election systems. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1495.82s)]
*  It's also granting security clearances for state officials to receive classified cyber [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1497.58s)]
*  threat briefings. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1502.6599999999999s)]
*  Many senators expressed frustration with the agency's response. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1504.6s)]

*  threat of cyber war eclipsed that of nuclear war between the two old superpowers. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1651.1s)]
*  And SolarWinds was one big reason why. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1657.1s)]
*  Last year, in perhaps the most audacious cyber attack in history, Russian military hackers [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1660.86s)]
*  sabotaged a tiny piece of computer code buried in a popular piece of software called SolarWinds. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1666.1799999999998s)]
*  As we first reported in February, the hidden virus spread to 18,000 government and private [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1673.3s)]
*  computer networks by way of one of those software updates we all take for granted. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1679.4199999999998s)]
*  After it was installed, Russian agents went rummaging through the digital files of the [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1685.38s)]
*  U.S. Departments of Justice, State, Treasury, Energy, and Commerce, among others. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1690.66s)]
*  And for nine months, they had unfettered access to top-level communications, court documents, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1696.5400000000002s)]
*  even nuclear secrets. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1703.18s)]
*  I think from a software engineering perspective, it's probably fair to say that this is the [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1706.1000000000001s)]
*  largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1711.02s)]
*  Brad Smith is president of Microsoft. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1715.86s)]
*  He learned about the hack after the presidential election this past November. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1718.7s)]
*  By that time, the stealthy intruders had spread throughout the tech giant's computer network [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1723.34s)]
*  and stolen some of its proprietary source code used to build its software products. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1729.1399999999999s)]
*  More alarming, how the hackers got in, piggybacking on a piece of third-party software used to [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1735.38s)]
*  connect, manage, and monitor computer networks. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1742.5s)]
*  What makes this so momentous? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1746.18s)]
*  One of the really disconcerting aspects of this attack was the widespread and indiscriminate [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1750.0200000000002s)]
*  nature of it. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1756.6000000000001s)]
*  What this attacker did was identify network management software from a company called [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1758.5200000000002s)]
*  SolarWinds. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1763.5s)]
*  They installed malware into an update for a SolarWinds product. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1764.9s)]
*  When that update went out to 18,000 organizations around the world, so did this malware. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1770.14s)]
*  The Orion Platform is the underlying foundation. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1777.7800000000002s)]
*  SolarWinds Orion is one of the most ubiquitous software products you've probably never heard [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1780.94s)]
*  of. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1786.14s)]
*  But to thousands of IT departments worldwide, it's indispensable. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1787.14s)]
*  It's made up of millions of lines of computer code. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1792.38s)]
*  4,032 of them were clandestinely rewritten and distributed to customers in a routine [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1796.14s)]
*  update, opening up a secret back door to the 18,000 infected networks. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1802.7s)]
*  Microsoft has assigned 500 engineers to dig into the attack. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1809.7s)]
*  One compared it to a Rembrandt painting. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1815.18s)]
*  The closer they looked, the more details emerged. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1817.88s)]
*  When we analyzed everything that we saw at Microsoft, we asked ourselves, how many engineers [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1822.6000000000001s)]
*  had probably worked on these attacks? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1828.0600000000002s)]
*  And the answer we came to was, well, certainly more than 1,000. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1831.22s)]
*  You guys are Microsoft. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1834.6000000000001s)]
*  How did Microsoft miss this? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1836.74s)]
*  I think that when you look at the sophistication of this attacker, there's an asymmetric advantage [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1840.0800000000002s)]
*  for somebody playing offense. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1847.56s)]
*  Is it still going on? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1849.4s)]
*  Almost certainly these attacks are continuing. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1851.0s)]
*  The world still might not know about the hack if not for FireEye, a $3.5 billion cybersecurity [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1853.7s)]
*  company run by Kevin Mandia, a former Air Force intelligence officer. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1861.24s)]
*  I can tell you this. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1867.0s)]
*  If we didn't do investigations for a living, we wouldn't have found this. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1868.0s)]
*  It takes a very special skill set to reverse engineer a whole platform that's written by [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1872.0800000000002s)]
*  bad guys to never be found. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1877.16s)]
*  FireEye's core mission is to hunt, find, and expel cyber intruders from the computer networks [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1879.88s)]
*  of their clients, mostly governments and major companies. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1885.72s)]
*  But FireEye used SolarWinds software, which turned the cyber hunter into the prey. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1889.8000000000002s)]
*  This past November, one alert FireEye employee noticed something amiss. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1896.68s)]
*  Just like everybody working from home, we have two-factor authentication. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1902.3600000000001s)]
*  A code pops up on our phone. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1905.7199999999998s)]
*  We have to type in that code, and then we can log in. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1907.8s)]
*  A FireEye employee was logging in, but the difference was our security staff looked at [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1910.8799999999999s)]
*  the login, and we noticed that individual had two phones registered to their name. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1915.8s)]
*  So our security employee called that person up, and we asked, hey, did you actually register [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1921.3999999999999s)]
*  a second device on our network? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1927.8799999999999s)]
*  And our employee said, no, it wasn't me. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1929.9599999999998s)]
*  Suspicious, FireEye turned its gaze inward and saw intruders impersonating its employees [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1932.6s)]
*  snooping around inside their network, stealing FireEye's proprietary tools to test its clients' [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1939.84s)]
*  defenses and intelligence reports on active cyber threats. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1947.12s)]
*  The hackers left no evidence of how they broke in. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1952.32s)]
*  No phishing expeditions, no malware. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1955.84s)]
*  So how did you trace this back to SolarWinds software? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1959.36s)]
*  It was not easy. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1964.12s)]
*  We took a lot of people and said, turn every rock over, look in every machine, and find [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1965.4399999999998s)]
*  any trace of suspicious activity. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1971.54s)]
*  What kept coming back was the earliest evidence of compromise is the SolarWinds system. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1974.4399999999998s)]
*  We finally decided, tear the thing apart. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1979.4399999999998s)]
*  They discovered the malware inside SolarWinds and on December 13th informed the world of [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1982.76s)]
*  the Brazen attack. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1990.16s)]
*  Much of the damage had already been done. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1992.32s)]
*  The U.S. Justice Department acknowledged the Russians spent months inside their computers [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=1995.44s)]
*  accessing email traffic, but the department won't tell us exactly what was taken. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2001.08s)]
*  It's the same at Treasury, Commerce, the NIH, Energy, even the agency that protects [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2007.2s)]
*  and transports our nuclear arsenal. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2014.32s)]
*  The hackers also hit the biggest names in high tech. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2017.44s)]
*  So what does that target list tell you? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2021.68s)]
*  I think this target list tells us that this is clearly a foreign intelligence agency. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2024.1200000000001s)]
*  It exposes the secrets potentially of the United States and other governments as well [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2030.2s)]
*  as private companies. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2035.78s)]

*  we do know this, it is in the wrong hands. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2042.78s)]
*  And Microsoft's Brad Smith told us it's almost certain the hackers created additional back [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2046.58s)]
*  doors and spread to other networks. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2052.7s)]
*  The revelation this past December came at a fraught time in the U.S. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2055.98s)]
*  President Trump was disputing the election and tweeted, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2061.3s)]
*  China might be responsible for the hack. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2064.2200000000003s)]

*  What we are seeing is the first use of this supply chain disruption tactic against the [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2112.7400000000002s)]
*  United States. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2118.54s)]
*  But it's not the first time we've witnessed it. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2120.02s)]
*  The Russian government really developed this tactic in Ukraine. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2122.58s)]
*  For years, the Russians have tested their cyber weapons on Ukraine. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2127.66s)]
*  Not Petya, a 2017 attack by the GRU, Russia's military spy agency, used the same tactics [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2133.1s)]
*  as the SolarWinds attack, sabotaging a widely used piece of software to break into thousands [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2140.9s)]
*  of Ukraine's networks. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2147.82s)]
*  But instead of spying, it ordered devices to self-destruct. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2149.7400000000002s)]
*  It literally damaged more than 10 percent of that nation's computers in a single day. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2154.7400000000002s)]
*  The television stations couldn't produce their shows because they relied on computers. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2160.82s)]
*  Automated teller machines stopped working. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2166.42s)]
*  Grocery stores couldn't take a credit card. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2168.34s)]
*  Now, what we saw with this attack was something that was more targeted. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2171.02s)]
*  But it just shows how if you engage in this kind of tactic, you can unleash an enormous [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2176.46s)]
*  amount of damage and havoc. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2182.1s)]
*  It's hard to downplay the severity of this. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2184.34s)]
*  It is hard to downplay the severity of this because it's only a stone's throw from a [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2187.14s)]
*  computer network attack. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2191.54s)]
*  Chris Inglis spent 28 years commanding the nation's best cyber wires at the National [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2194.34s)]

*  Why didn't the government detect this? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2213.78s)]
*  The government is not looking on private sector networks. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2216.5s)]
*  It doesn't surveil private sector networks. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2219.1400000000003s)]
*  That's a responsibility that's given over to the private sector. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2221.38s)]
*  FireEye found it on theirs. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2225.1000000000004s)]
*  Many others did not. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2226.5400000000004s)]
*  The government did not find it on their networks. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2228.06s)]
*  That's a disappointment. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2230.34s)]
*  Disappointment is an understatement. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2232.38s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security spent billions on a program called Einstein to detect cyber [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2234.02s)]
*  attacks on government agencies. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2239.98s)]
*  The Russians outsmarted it. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2242.2599999999998s)]
*  They circumvented the NSA, which gathers intelligence overseas, but is prohibited from surveilling [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2244.9s)]
*  U.S. computer networks. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2251.42s)]
*  So the Russians launched their attacks from servers set up anonymously in the United States. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2253.42s)]
*  This hack happened on American soil. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2260.7000000000003s)]
*  It went through networks based in the United States. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2263.58s)]
*  Are our defense capabilities constrained? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2267.66s)]
*  The U.S. intelligence community, the U.S. Department of Defense, can suggest what the [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2270.46s)]
*  intentions of other nations are based upon what they learn in their rightful work overseas, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2274.82s)]
*  but they can't turn around and focus their unblinking eye on the domestic infrastructure. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2281.22s)]
*  That winds up making it more difficult for us. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2286.58s)]
*  He says history shows that once inside a network, the Russians are a stubborn adversary. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2289.66s)]
*  It's hard to kind of get something like this completely out of the system, and they certainly [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2296.2999999999997s)]
*  don't understand all the places that it's gone to, all of the manifestations of where [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2300.8199999999997s)]
*  this virus, where this software still lives. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2305.2999999999997s)]
*  And that's going to take some time. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2308.8199999999997s)]
*  And the only way you'll have absolute confidence that you've gotten rid of it is to get rid [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2310.38s)]
*  of the hardware, to get rid of the systems. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2313.9s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2316.34s)]
*  So unless you get rid of all the computers and all the computer networks, you will not [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2317.34s)]
*  be sure that you have gotten this out of the systems? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2320.86s)]
*  You will not be. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2323.38s)]
*  We've never been left with a breach like that before, where we know months into it that [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2324.38s)]
*  we're only looking at the tip of the iceberg. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2331.46s)]
*  It's not every day you meet someone who builds cyber weapons as complex as those deployed [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2334.26s)]
*  by Russian intelligence. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2339.82s)]
*  But John Miller, who started off as a hacker and now runs a company called Bold End, designs [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2341.78s)]
*  and sells cutting edge cyber weapons to U.S. intelligence agencies. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2348.78s)]
*  I build things much more sophisticated than this. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2354.1000000000004s)]
*  What's impressive is the scope of it. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2357.3s)]
*  This is a watershed style attack. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2359.5s)]
*  I would never do something like this. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2363.02s)]
*  It creates too much damage. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2365.7400000000002s)]
*  Miller says with the SolarWinds attack, Russia has demonstrated that none of the software [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2367.94s)]
*  we take for granted is truly safe, including the apps on our telephones, laptops and tablets. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2373.62s)]
*  These days, he says, any device can be sabotaged. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2381.58s)]
*  When you buy something from a tech company, a new phone or a laptop, you trust that that [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2385.9s)]
*  is secure when they give it to you. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2391.36s)]
*  And what they've shown us in this attack is that is not the case. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2393.38s)]
*  They have the ability to compromise those supply chains and manipulate whatever they [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2398.02s)]
*  want, whether it's financial data, source code, the functionality of these products. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2404.82s)]
*  They can take control. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2411.1s)]
*  So for instance, they could destroy all the computers on a network? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2412.34s)]
*  Oh, easily. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2416.1s)]
*  The malware that they deployed off of SolarWinds, it didn't have the functionality in it to [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2417.1800000000003s)]
*  do that, but to do that is trivial. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2422.74s)]
*  A couple dozen lines of code. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2425.22s)]
*  Since our story first aired, the hacks have kept coming. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2429.3399999999997s)]
*  And one of the people you just heard from, former NSA Deputy Director Chris Inglis, was [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2433.22s)]
*  chosen as the country's first National Cyber Director, reporting directly to President [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2438.5s)]
*  Biden. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2443.9399999999996s)]
*  And Putin, for his part, still denies Russia's involvement in SolarWinds. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2445.58s)]
*  This past week, the U.S. government issued an urgent warning about dangerous new malware [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2457.7s)]
*  that could cripple industrial systems worldwide. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2463.18s)]
*  It comes on the heels of Ukraine, withstanding an attempt by Russian hackers to knock out [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2467.1s)]
*  power to two million people in that war-torn country. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2472.42s)]

*  with an initiative called Shields Up. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2501.66s)]
*  We are seeing evolving intelligence about Russian planning for potential attacks, and [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2505.7s)]
*  we have to assume that there's going to be a breach, there's going to be an incident, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2511.46s)]
*  there's going to be an attack. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2515.5s)]

*  What does that mean? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2587.42s)]

*  There's only been one country out there that's actually had expertise in taking down electric [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2680.38s)]
*  power systems, and that's Russia. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2684.98s)]
*  Robert Lee, another former NSA hacker, is the co-founder of Dragos, a cybersecurity [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2686.86s)]
*  company. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2692.9s)]
*  He's known as a wizard of the dark arts of cyber war, specializing in the defense of [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2694.58s)]
*  critical infrastructure. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2699.98s)]
*  In 2015, he investigated an incident in Ukraine, the most destructive cyber attack on civilian [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2702.02s)]
*  infrastructure the world had ever seen. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2709.1s)]
*  What would you find? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2712.54s)]
*  The Russian state broke into three different power companies across Ukraine, probably about [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2713.54s)]
*  six months ahead of the actual attack. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2718.1800000000003s)]
*  They broke in over the summer, got into position, and they started learning how to operate those [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2720.54s)]
*  systems. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2725.58s)]
*  As a result, they disconnected over 60 substations across Ukraine and caused blackouts for around [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2727.2599999999998s)]
*  225,000 customers in the dead of winter. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2732.86s)]
*  It was all done remotely from this building in Moscow by hackers with the military intelligence [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2736.1s)]
*  agency, the GRU. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2741.98s)]
*  The Ukrainians had to send utility workers to the impaired substations to manually restart [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2744.46s)]
*  each one. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2750.62s)]
*  A year later, Lee says, GRU hackers were back with a much more sophisticated attack, a piece [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2751.66s)]
*  of malware that could cripple multiple transmission stations with one keystroke. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2758.9s)]
*  What did it mean that Russia was able to do this? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2765.58s)]
*  It was a shock to everybody, because there's been a lot of theory around how you could [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2769.18s)]
*  do this. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2772.7s)]
*  People in my community on the cybersecurity side have been talking about this for a long [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2773.7s)]
*  time on It's Possible, but to actually see it demonstrated is a giant proof that you [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2776.18s)]
*  can do it. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2782.18s)]
*  And we also know now they're bold enough to do it. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2783.74s)]
*  Could the Russians do the same thing here in the U.S.? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2786.3399999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2789.58s)]
*  Over the last few years, Lee's cybersecurity company, Dragos, has tracked the same GRU [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2790.8999999999996s)]
*  hacking group known among researchers as Sandworm, installing malware and probing power companies [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2797.66s)]
*  here in the U.S. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2803.94s)]
*  There was about a dozen power companies that ended up getting compromised in the 2014-2015 [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2806.06s)]
*  time frame by the same group that ended up taking down the electric system in Ukraine. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2811.82s)]
*  In the summer of 2017, Russian hackers launched a more brazen and potentially much more dangerous [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2816.7000000000003s)]
*  attack, this time on Petro Rebig, a massive oil refinery along the Red Sea in Saudi Arabia. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2823.38s)]
*  On a Friday night in August, a safety system triggered the whole plant to shut down. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2831.34s)]
*  Julian Gutmanis was working cybersecurity for the Saudi oil giant Aramco and rushed [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2837.46s)]
*  to the scene to investigate. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2843.0600000000004s)]
*  From what you saw, you were alarmed? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2845.38s)]
*  At that stage, yes. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2848.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2849.38s)]
*  Like, why is somebody going after the safety systems on a weekend at night? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2850.38s)]
*  It's just not normal. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2852.86s)]
*  What Gutmanis discovered stopped him in his tracks. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2854.82s)]
*  Gutmanis had hacked into the emergency shutdown system and installed suspicious computer files. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2859.06s)]
*  The files were created and executed momentarily before the initial outage that we responded to. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2865.7s)]
*  You were able to trace that back? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2871.7799999999997s)]
*  Forensically, yeah. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2873.38s)]
*  I came across a function that they defined in there called execute exploit. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2874.38s)]
*  Hairs stood up on my arms and I'm like, this is probably something really serious. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2879.02s)]
*  You don't normally have the word exploit in normal kind of vendor software. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2882.2999999999997s)]
*  So that set off alarm bells? [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2887.14s)]
*  Yeah, huge alarm bells. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2889.7400000000002s)]
*  And it really kind of made us focus on how did these files get there? [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2890.7400000000002s)]
*  Where did they come from? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2893.7400000000002s)]
*  Who created them? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2895.26s)]
*  And what do we do? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2896.86s)]
*  What are they trying to do? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2898.2200000000003s)]
*  Gutmanis now works for Robert Lee at Dragos, who also investigated the hack. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2899.6600000000003s)]
*  Lee says the hackers could have set off explosions and released toxic chemicals with the malware [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2905.7400000000002s)]
*  they implanted, known as Triton. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2911.6600000000003s)]
*  It's the first time in history we've ever seen a cyber attack explicitly designed to [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2915.02s)]
*  kill people. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2919.9s)]
*  It targets safety systems. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2920.9s)]
*  And these safety systems are only there to protect lives. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2922.74s)]
*  So going after that system explicitly, the only reason to do it is to hurt people. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2926.18s)]
*  What happened is they made a small error in the software that instead of actually causing [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2931.22s)]
*  the effects they were looking to achieve, like an explosion where you'd kill people, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2936.8s)]
*  instead it simply shut down the plant. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2940.58s)]
*  The Russians pose a serious and persistent threat. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2943.14s)]
*  As the second highest ranking official in the Justice Department, Deputy Attorney General [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2947.08s)]
*  Lisa Monaco oversees the FBI and its 1,000-strong cyber division. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2951.64s)]
*  Three weeks ago, her department unsealed two secret indictments. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2957.58s)]
*  One described how Triton worked and identified this man, Yevgeny Gladkik, from a Russian [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2962.7999999999997s)]
*  Ministry of Defense research institute as one of the hackers. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2968.88s)]
*  The second indictment says between 2012 and 2017, these three Russian intelligence agents [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2973.6s)]
*  and accomplices hacked hundreds of energy companies around the world and managed to [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2980.36s)]
*  get inside the computer network at a nuclear power plant in Kansas. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2986.1600000000003s)]
*  This was historical activity. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2992.12s)]
*  But it is very much the type of activity that we are warning about today when it comes to [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=2995.2799999999997s)]
*  Russia's response to the world's response to the horror in Ukraine. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3001.92s)]
*  What about right now? [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3007.0s)]
*  Are you seeing Russian activity, Russian plots to disrupt our infrastructure? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3008.92s)]
*  We are seeing Russian state actors scanning, probing, looking for opportunities, looking [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3015.96s)]
*  for weaknesses in our systems on critical infrastructure, on businesses. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3023.2s)]
*  Think of it, Bill, as a burglar going around trying to jiggle the lock in your house door [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3028.08s)]
*  to see if it's open. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3036.0s)]
*  And we're seeing that. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3037.68s)]
*  Those who violate our laws should expect to face justice. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3038.68s)]
*  Earlier this month, Monaco joined Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3042.92s)]
*  Wray to announce the U.S. had conducted a bold operation, stopping Russian hackers as [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3048.74s)]
*  they were preparing to strike. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3055.4599999999996s)]
*  We're talking military intelligence actors deploying malware, malicious code on thousands [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3058.14s)]
*  of computers in hundreds of countries. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3065.64s)]

*  It's like an army of infected computers that with a single command can be deployed to do [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3073.62s)]
*  everything from gathering information, stealing information, and sometimes to have destructive [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3079.8199999999997s)]
*  effect. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3085.8599999999997s)]
*  And we were able to work with the private sector to understand it, to be able to use [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3086.8599999999997s)]
*  unique investigative tools to trace it back to attackers at keyboards, and then use our [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3090.8599999999997s)]

*  a deal with Europeans at least and possibly the Americans to take the sanctions off. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3148.5s)]
*  I think he's mistaken on that, but I think at least until he tries that, he's unlikely [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3152.86s)]
*  to launch the cyber attacks. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3157.06s)]

*  Well, I think the reality is that those sanctions will not come off, that the economic pressure [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XtCstIaiE&t=3165.58s)]
