# World's Most Interesting Places: Vol. 4 | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [June 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88)
*  The Arctic Warms Up [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=0.0s)]
*  Temperatures in the Arctic continued to warm more than twice as fast as the rest of the world. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=13.0s)]
*  That's according to the U.S. government's latest climate report. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=19.0s)]
*  The past six years in the Arctic have been the warmest there since records began in 1900. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=22.0s)]
*  Decades ago, an eccentric Russian geophysicist warned that frozen soil, called permafrost, contained enough greenhouse gas itself to pose a threat to the climate if it ever melted. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=29.0s)]
*  As we first reported last March, science scoffed at Sergei Zemov's warning. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=43.0s)]
*  But now that the permafrost is collapsing, the world is listening. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=49.0s)]
*  We traveled to the Siberian Arctic to meet Zemov, who has devised a scheme to save the world in a place that he named for the last ice age, Pleistocene Park. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=54.0s)]
*  Our trip took three days, and our final leg in an adventure of geoscience was on an aeronautical fossil, a Soviet-era Antonov. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=67.0s)]
*  We approached a Siberia we had never seen in our imaginations, a forest touching the horizon in a land sequined with lakes. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=80.0s)]
*  This was far north even by a Siberian compass, above the Arctic Circle, where the Koloma River fills the East Siberian Sea. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=90.0s)]
*  Fifteen time zones from New York. We found the aspiring ghost town of Chersky. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=100.0s)]
*  A trading port in Soviet times, Chersky was gutted by the fall of communism, losing 80% of its residents. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=106.0s)]
*  There's not much reason to visit unless, like many scientists today, you're beating a path to the Northeast Scientific Station to meet its founder, 63-year-old Sergei Zemov. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=115.0s)]
*  Hello. Hello. I'm Scott. I'm Sergei. Nice to see you, Sergei. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=127.0s)]
*  He welcomed us in summer, when fireweed enjoys a few weeks of liberation. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=132.0s)]
*  But 40 Siberian winters remained indelible on Zemov's face, the price of solitude for a geophysicist who longed to be remote from his communist bosses. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=137.0s)]
*  When people hear the word Siberia, they think about exile, but it sounds to me like exile is exactly what you had in mind. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=150.0s)]
*  Yes, only one problem is so long winter. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=157.0s)]
*  The winter's long. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=161.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=162.0s)]
*  Winters are long as ever, but not as cold. This ground was once so icy, humankind named it permafrost. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=163.0s)]
*  But in the 1990s, Zemov noticed it wasn't so permanent. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=172.0s)]
*  Frozen ground. Do you hear? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=176.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=178.0s)]
*  It's roof of permafrost. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=179.0s)]
*  He can remember when his shovel wouldn't bite the frozen surface, but now he's down more than six feet. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=181.0s)]
*  In the past, all our soil, which was melted in summer, freeze. Everywhere, totally, and it's happened usually November, December. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=189.0s)]
*  Now, in all winter, it's did not freeze. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=199.0s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=203.0s)]
*  It means permafrost is melted. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=204.0s)]
*  This is a warning to the world because organic matter in the permafrost, plants and animals, has been frozen for hundreds of thousands of years. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=207.0s)]
*  As it thaws, microbes consume that organic matter and release carbon dioxide and methane, greenhouse gases, which contribute to a warmer climate. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=218.0s)]
*  We just pulled this up out of the hole and it's burning my fingers it's so cold. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=230.0s)]
*  Yes, soil with water and water is ice. In five minutes, it will be melted. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=235.0s)]
*  Years ago, Zemov calculated there is enough carbon in permafrost to threaten the world. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=241.0s)]
*  But big science gave that idea a cold shoulder, maybe in part because of Zemov himself. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=248.0s)]
*  He endures Siberian winters when most Russians head south. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=255.0s)]
*  He enjoys a refreshing vodka from time to time, smokes like a Soviet steel mill, and often just lies down to think. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=259.0s)]
*  I sometimes describe him as somewhere between a madman and a genius. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=269.0s)]
*  Max Holmes is a leading climate scientist and deputy director of the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=273.0s)]
*  He told us Zemov's key discovery was that Siberian permafrost held far more carbon than anyone knew. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=281.0s)]
*  When Zemov made this observation, he couldn't get his papers published in scientific journals. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=290.0s)]
*  It can take a while to get papers published that fly in the face of conventional wisdom. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=296.0s)]
*  But science warmed to Zemov's theory, and now he's published dozens of papers in science journals. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=304.0s)]
*  Max Holmes has made several visits to Zemov's station. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=310.0s)]
*  The estimates of how much carbon locked up in permafrost keep going up. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=314.0s)]
*  And most of us were probably thinking about the upper meter. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=318.0s)]
*  The upper three feet or so of the soil. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=321.0s)]
*  Yeah, the upper three feet, that's right. If you go down much deeper than that, the carbon content is very low. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=323.0s)]
*  But what's special about this area where Zemov is, the carbon content of the permafrost extends to much greater depths. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=328.0s)]
*  So consequently, there's an awful lot of carbon that's locked up there. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=335.0s)]
*  Scientists estimate there is more greenhouse gas in permafrost than in all of the world's remaining oil, natural gas, and coal. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=339.0s)]
*  There's no consensus about how much of it could be released. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=349.0s)]
*  How far below the surface are we right now? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=354.0s)]
*  Right now we are about 10 meters. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=358.0s)]
*  So about 30 feet. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=360.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=361.0s)]
*  Ten times deeper than originally thought, we found the remains of Ice Age plants and microbes. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=362.0s)]
*  Let's see if we can take some samples. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=369.0s)]
*  With Zemov's chief collaborator, his son Nikita. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=371.0s)]
*  It's a ticking carbon bomb, as it's called. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=376.0s)]
*  A carbon bomb. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=379.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=380.0s)]
*  Nikita Zemov grew up here with his father and sensibly moved south for college, leaving behind the old man in the river. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=382.0s)]
*  But Nikita's plan to be a mathematician melted away when Sergey asked his son to return to see what he had seen. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=391.0s)]
*  A few hours from the research station, there's a vast subsidence of permafrost, sort of a rolling landslide called Duvani Yar. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=399.0s)]
*  Geology is a slow science, but here it's almost a spectator sport. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=410.0s)]
*  The bones of extinct woolly mammoths are thawing after more than 12,000 years. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=418.0s)]
*  The collapse of frozen earth is happening in much of the Arctic, including Alaska. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=424.0s)]
*  25% of the northern hemisphere is permafrost. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=430.0s)]
*  The Zemovs have a theory, many would say a crazy idea, for diffusing the carbon bomb. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=435.0s)]
*  They want to cool the permafrost by returning part of Siberia to the Ice Age, or at least what it looked like in those days, known as the Pleistocene era. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=442.0s)]
*  If we were standing on this hill in the Pleistocene era, what would we see? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=453.0s)]
*  No any trees. It looks like grasslands and savannah. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=458.0s)]
*  And you will see around 1,000 of mammoths, around maybe 5,000 of bison, around maybe 10,000 of horses around this place, and also lions. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=463.0s)]
*  Lions? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=479.0s)]
*  Yes, the main predator was lions here. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=480.0s)]
*  Sergei Zemov told us when man became the main predator, the woolly mammoth and other large grazers were hunted to extinction. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=483.0s)]
*  Forests replaced grasslands, and that made Siberia vulnerable to a warming climate, because trees trap more heat than grass. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=491.0s)]
*  And winter temperatures of 40 below can't freeze the permafrost if there are no herds of animals to trample the insulating snow. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=501.0s)]
*  So this is what you use instead of a mammoth? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=511.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=514.0s)]
*  As a demonstration project they call Pleistocene Park, Nikita Zemov is knocking down trees over 54 square miles and restocking the big grazers. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=515.0s)]
*  Zemovs believe returning the land to its Ice Age appearance will cool the permafrost even in a warming world. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=526.0s)]
*  You're trying to bring the animals back now. How can you do that? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=534.0s)]
*  Physically, or morally, or financially? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=538.0s)]
*  All three, but let's start with physically. You need what, hundreds of thousands, millions of these animals? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=542.0s)]
*  You need to start with something. Second, you need to prove to people that the concept works. And to prove that concept works, for many things you don't need millions of animals. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=549.0s)]
*  You brought up the moral issue of bringing the animals in here. What do you mean by that? I mean, some people say you're playing God. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=559.0s)]
*  You know, I think it's not me playing God. It was our ancestors who were playing God 15,000 years ago. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=567.0s)]
*  Humans came and they dropped a number of animals worldwide. And we are just trying to get this back. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=574.0s)]
*  This is where the Zemovs experiment gets crazier. What they need is the greatest tree crusher of the last 20,000 years. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=580.0s)]
*  And they are surrounded with evidence of the once abundant woolly mammoth. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=590.0s)]
*  That's amazing. It's young female. Young female mammoth. This one is at least 20, 25 pounds. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=595.0s)]
*  Do you need the woolly mammoth to bring all of this back in the park? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=603.0s)]
*  It's like, do you need your right arm to live and do your job? No, you don't need it. But with your arm, you will do it better. So same with mammoth. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=608.0s)]
*  Today, one place you might get a woolly mammoth is in Boston, Massachusetts, specifically in the lab of Harvard geneticist George Church. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=619.0s)]
*  Sergei is hoping that you're going to deliver a mammoth to him. Can you do that? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=629.0s)]
*  I think he's hoping that we will deliver an animal that is very similar to the ones that used to roam there. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=636.0s)]
*  We need cold resistant elephants. That's what he would like. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=644.0s)]
*  Church is another scientist who's made the trek to Zemoff's world. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=647.0s)]
*  We return to his renowned genetics lab with DNA from mammoth bones. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=651.0s)]
*  If you look at the 23 genomes of the elephants, there's lots of evidence of lots of interbreeding all over the place among the different so-called species. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=657.0s)]
*  So in a way, we're just recreating a hybrid that could easily have existed. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=666.0s)]
*  When do you imagine you might be able to pull up a truck and deliver this creature to Pleistocene Park? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=671.0s)]
*  I would say that probably in five years we'll know whether we can get this to work for mice and maybe pigs and elephants. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=677.0s)]
*  And then if we can get embryos to grow in the laboratory all the way to term, then it's probably a decade. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=687.0s)]
*  The Zemoffs have not convinced everyone in climate science. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=696.0s)]
*  Critics say they lack long-term temperature records of the permafrost. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=700.0s)]
*  And their work is restricted to a relatively small area. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=705.0s)]
*  You know, to the untrained eye, someone could come away from a meeting with Sergei thinking that he's a crackpot. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=709.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. I mean, he kind of plays the part. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=717.0s)]
*  But as a climate scientist, how do you evaluate him? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=720.0s)]
*  I think he's usually right. Certainly he has controversial ideas, and a lot of them I think end up being supported over time. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=723.0s)]
*  What do you think of his concept of Pleistocene Park? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=732.0s)]
*  Fascinating theory. I'm fascinated by the science that can be done to figure out if it's correct. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=736.0s)]
*  I'm glad he's pursuing this. We need to think about solutions. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=744.0s)]
*  The Zemoffs have little funding for their big idea. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=748.0s)]
*  The government donated the land, and their income flows from the rent that they charge visiting scientists for the research station. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=752.0s)]
*  Theirs is science on a shoestring, with a very long timeline. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=760.0s)]
*  Sergei, you've devoted your life to this, but I wonder why you thought it was important that Nikita devote his life to this. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=765.0s)]
*  Why it's important? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=774.0s)]
*  Hmm. Our experiment, it's a long time experiment. Decades, decades. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=778.0s)]
*  It'll take decades? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=785.0s)]
*  Yes. And it's also, we think about my grand grandchildren. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=786.0s)]
*  They have some intriguing results in the early days of Pleistocene Park. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=792.0s)]
*  Data show the permafrost is becoming colder where heat-trapping trees have been cut down. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=797.0s)]
*  It's a little more weight on the genius side of the madman scale, and perhaps early evidence that resurrecting the future of the world may depend on burying Siberia's past. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=804.0s)]
*  New animals have arrived at the park since our story first aired last March. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=818.0s)]
*  Not mammoths, but a dozen bison from Denmark. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=823.0s)]
*  It took Nikita Zemoff and his crew more than a month to bring them by land and river to their new home. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=827.0s)]
*  The cattle drive is an enduring symbol of the American West. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=842.0s)]
*  The image of tough cowboys pushing huge herds of cows across the open range is stamped on our imaginations. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=846.0s)]
*  But by the 21st century, with Western states growing and changing fast, most horseback cattle drives have been run off the range by suburban sprawl, government regulation, lower beef consumption, and the return of protected predators. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=853.0s)]
*  But there's a group of stubborn men and women in Wyoming who every spring push thousands of cows along the same 70-mile route their ancestors pioneered 125 years ago. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=869.0s)]
*  As we first reported last fall, this throwback to the Old West is called the Green River Drift, and it's the longest running cattle drive left in America. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=881.0s)]
*  Just after dawn one Saturday in June of 2021, I'm trying to help Wyoming rancher Albert Summers and his team move hundreds of cows. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=893.0s)]
*  Most of them mothers with new calves in a cloud of dust toward high green pastures where they'll graze all summer. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=914.0s)]
*  And if you feel inclined, Bill, you can whistle, you can yell. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=922.0s)]
*  I can do anything. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=926.0s)]
*  This is like cowboys therapy. You get to voice everything out. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=927.0s)]
*  Come on, Indy. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=934.0s)]
*  I do the best I can. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=935.0s)]
*  Come on, cows. Move, cows. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=937.0s)]
*  But it's not quite as good as little Shad Swain, the son of Albert's ranching partner, Ty. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=940.0s)]
*  Shad is five years old? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=946.0s)]
*  He is. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=948.0s)]
*  Shad, if you can do this, I can do this, OK? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=949.0s)]
*  Shad got to do it with a sour apple lollipop in his mouth. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=954.0s)]
*  All of us, with the help of some fearless herding dogs, move cattle over hills, across creeks, through shimmering groves of aspen, along what cowboys call driveways, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=959.0s)]
*  and across highways north toward those distant mountains. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=976.0s)]
*  How long does it take you to get them to the summer feeding area? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=981.0s)]
*  So it takes about 13 days from when we start to when we get up there where we want to be. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=984.0s)]
*  We travel up to about 60 to 70 months. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=992.0s)]
*  Albert Summers is one of 11 ranchers who work together to drive more than 7,000 head of cattle on the Green River Drift. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=998.0s)]
*  Those 11 ranches all lie in Wyoming's Green River Valley, south of Jackson Hole. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1007.0s)]
*  Here, the Wyoming Range is to the west, the Wind River Range is to the east. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1014.0s)]
*  The valley between is part bone-dry high desert and verdant river drainage where Native Americans once hunted buffalo. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1021.0s)]
*  Today, the Green River runs through Albert Summers' ranch. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1030.0s)]
*  And your family's been doing this how long? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1035.0s)]
*  My family's been doing this since about 1903. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1038.0s)]
*  Albert's neighbor, Jeannie Lockwood's family, has been at it even longer. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1045.0s)]
*  This was my granddad's ranch. He homesteaded this in 1889. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1049.0s)]
*  Her ranch is about 20 miles south of Albert Summers' place. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1054.0s)]
*  We joined her on horseback before dawn the day she started moving her cattle north. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1059.0s)]
*  There's that sun. It's going to peak up over the hill. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1066.0s)]
*  Along the same path, her family has trekked for 125 years. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1069.0s)]
*  So you're going to be doing this for the next two weeks? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1074.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1077.0s)]
*  Getting up at four o'clock in the morning? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1079.0s)]
*  Or three or two thirty. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1081.0s)]
*  Or two thirty. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1084.0s)]
*  Those early starts barely compare to what old timers endured when cowboys stayed out under the stars all night and the sun all day until they got the herd to high pastures. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1085.0s)]
*  Well, I think we can go home. What do you think? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1097.0s)]
*  Today, they go home after each day's drive. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1099.0s)]
*  The next morning, they trailer their horses back to where they'd left the cattle, round up those that have strayed, and move them out again before dawn. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1102.0s)]
*  The old chuck wagon? It's been replaced by a cooler and the tailgate of a pickup truck. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1112.0s)]
*  But compared to what your grandfather did... [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1118.0s)]
*  Our ancestors, yeah. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1120.0s)]
*  This is easy. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1122.0s)]
*  Yeah, we have it easy. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1123.0s)]
*  Only ranchers would call this easy. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1125.0s)]
*  Driving cattle is hot, dusty, demanding, and they'll be lucky to make a $50 profit per cow when they finally send them to market. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1129.0s)]
*  Jeannie's daughter, Hayley, and son-in-law, France, help wrangle the herd. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1139.0s)]
*  Her husband, Milford, shuttles the horse trailers. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1144.0s)]
*  They all left regular jobs and moved back to the ranch several years ago after Jeannie's brother, who had been running the place, died in an accident. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1148.0s)]
*  It takes all of us to do it, it seems like. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1157.0s)]
*  Jeannie was a librarian. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1161.0s)]
*  So what is it about this place that makes you give up regular, normal American jobs and come back here to do this really hard work? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1163.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, it was home to me. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1176.0s)]
*  And it was hard work for my parents, and I know it was hard work for my grandparents, and I just couldn't see letting it go. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1181.0s)]
*  Labor of love, it's called. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1191.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1193.0s)]
*  Where's the emphasis, labor or love? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1194.0s)]
*  Love. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1196.0s)]
*  Love might sustain the Green River Drift, but it was born in crisis. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1198.0s)]
*  The winter of 1889-90 is really what started the drift. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1203.0s)]
*  Clint Gilchrist is an historian who grew up in this valley and has written about that harsh winter. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1208.0s)]
*  And it killed off the vast majority of the cattle herds that were here because they weren't prepared for a bad winter. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1214.0s)]
*  Nobody had prepared for a bad winter. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1220.0s)]
*  White settlers were not prepared. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1222.0s)]
*  Native tribes, which the U.S. government drove off the land to make room for homesteaders, knew that winters in the Green River Valley could be merciless. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1224.0s)]
*  The Shoshone Indians and the Crow Indians were one of the dominant tribes in these areas, and they didn't winter here. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1234.0s)]
*  They wintered over on the other side of the mountains where it was less elevation. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1239.0s)]
*  After that brutal winter, ranchers realized they had to move their cattle out of the valley long enough to grow a crop of hay. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1245.0s)]
*  So while the cattle are up in the uplands, you're able to grow hay. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1253.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1258.0s)]
*  And that feeds them all winter long. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1259.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1260.0s)]
*  And so that was the genesis of what we call the drift. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1261.0s)]
*  The drift, Albert Summers says, because when the first fall frost chills the mountains, the cows instinctively head for home. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1265.0s)]
*  Just on their own. Turn around and start coming back. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1275.0s)]
*  Turn around and start. We open gates. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1278.0s)]
*  Drift back. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1279.0s)]
*  And they drift back. In the spring, we drive them. In the fall, they drift. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1280.0s)]
*  When the drift began 125 years ago, there were no regulations, no subdivisions, just wide open range. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1285.0s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1294.0s)]
*  Now ranchers drive their cattle to U.S. Forest Service land, the largest grazing allotment in the country, 127,000 acres of the Bridger-Teton National Forest. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1297.0s)]
*  Last summer, they paid the federal government $1.35 a month for every cow and her calf. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1310.0s)]
*  Burdock. Summers. Price. Burdock. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1317.0s)]
*  How much each rancher will owe is tallied at a place called the counting gate. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1323.0s)]
*  Summers. Summers. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1327.0s)]
*  It's Jamie Burgess' job to read brands or ear tags and call out which cows belong to which ranch. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1330.0s)]
*  Summers. Price. Price. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1338.0s)]
*  While his wife Rita adds up the totals. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1341.0s)]
*  When the cows finally reach mountain pastures, they're handed off to range riders. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1346.0s)]
*  Bring them. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1352.0s)]
*  Like Brittany Hesseltine, whose job is to watch over them all summer. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1354.0s)]
*  And you're up here by yourself? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1359.0s)]
*  Yes. Just me, my horses, my three dogs and a cat. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1361.0s)]
*  How long altogether? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1368.0s)]
*  It'll be about five months. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1370.0s)]
*  Every day for those five months, Brittany is out at dawn to check on the 600 or so cattle in her care. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1372.0s)]
*  First thing in the morning, you come out on a rise and especially in the fall, the elk are bugling and just talking to each other. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1380.0s)]
*  Brittany earned her degree in veterinary science in 2019. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1390.0s)]
*  This was her third summer as a range rider. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1394.0s)]
*  It's really hard work. What's the attraction? What's the draw? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1397.0s)]
*  Something about it speaks to my soul. I really can't describe what, but all winter long, I'm like, oh, a couple months more, a couple months more. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1401.0s)]
*  And then I'll be up at home. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1411.0s)]
*  Her home for the summer was a small trailer in an isolated camp off the grid. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1413.0s)]
*  No running water, no cell service. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1419.0s)]
*  At the start of last summer, four of the five drift range riders were women. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1422.0s)]
*  You told us that you thought women made the best range riders. Why would that be? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1428.0s)]
*  They're hard workers. And I can't say that they're, you know, the men aren't good, but the women don't go to town. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1435.0s)]
*  And as much as some of the men kind of have a tendency to visit the tavern. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1442.0s)]
*  Yeah, they'll go on that. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1448.0s)]
*  Yeah, they'll go on the other side of the mountain. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1450.0s)]
*  So what happened to the cowboys? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1454.0s)]
*  I don't know. Maybe they're just not cut out for it. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1457.0s)]
*  There's beauty up here and danger, too. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1463.0s)]
*  Since listed as endangered species, wolf and grizzly bear populations have exploded in these mountains. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1467.0s)]
*  Brittany keeps track of the calves they kill. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1474.0s)]
*  If it was actually killed by a predator, then there will be bruising on the hide on the inside. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1478.0s)]
*  And it's very obvious. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1484.0s)]
*  You know, like last year we lost 24 calves. Didn't come home. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1486.0s)]
*  Now we lose between 10 and 15 percent of our calves. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1489.0s)]
*  That sounds like a lot. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1493.0s)]
*  It's a lot. It would break us if it weren't for a compensation program by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1494.0s)]
*  So you get paid for every animal you lose? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1501.0s)]
*  We do. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1504.0s)]
*  Predators aren't the only threat to these ranchers. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1505.0s)]
*  A growing chorus of critics argue cattle shouldn't graze on public lands at all. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1508.0s)]
*  Consumption of beef is declining, and so is the number of ranches on the Drift. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1514.0s)]
*  There were more than 20 in the early 1990s. Today, just 11. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1519.0s)]
*  The Green River Drift is so iconic that the cattle drive has earned a spot on the National Register of Historic Places. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1525.0s)]
*  These remaining ranchers are determined to see that it's not just relegated to history books. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1533.0s)]
*  So what does it mean to you to be doing what your father and your grandfather did on the same land? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1539.0s)]
*  That's hard to talk about. It means a lot. It means a lot. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1546.0s)]
*  Albert Sommers has no children, so to preserve this land and its tradition, he set up what's called a conservation easement. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1553.0s)]
*  Preservationists have paid him to agree that his ranch will never be developed or subdivided, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1562.0s)]
*  and to allow the public to use the land for recreation. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1568.0s)]
*  That agreement will also apply to his partner Ty Swain as he takes over, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1571.0s)]
*  and to his son Shad, when and if he picks up the reins. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1576.0s)]
*  So with the conservation easement, this land will not change? It will stay the same? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1582.0s)]
*  It will stay the same. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1588.0s)]
*  Well, no land stays the same, but this land will not be developed, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1589.0s)]
*  and I will go to my grave peacefully with that knowledge, but just not tomorrow. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1594.0s)]
*  Many traditions have left their mark on this land. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1601.0s)]
*  Native Americans were forced to give way to fur traders, pioneers, and homesteaders. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1605.0s)]
*  Today, it's the cowboy way of life that is fighting to hold on. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1611.0s)]
*  It's tight every year. I mean, we're down to the last dime at the end of the year. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1618.0s)]
*  It sounds like you're not in it for the money. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1622.0s)]
*  No, sir. No, we're not. You know, if somebody says, you know, you're a rich rancher, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1624.0s)]
*  only rich in the fact that we get to do what we do and we live where we live, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1630.0s)]
*  and we get to see the sun come up over those mountains, that's the rich part of this job. It's not the money. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1635.0s)]
*  Jeannie Lockwood and her family are driving their cattle on the Drift again this summer. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1647.0s)]
*  So is Albert Summers, though after 31 years in charge of the drive, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1651.0s)]
*  he's handed that responsibility off to someone else. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1656.0s)]
*  And Brittany Hazeltine, the young woman we met up in the high country, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1659.0s)]
*  she's also back in the saddle this summer, and this year, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1663.0s)]
*  she was put in charge of hiring all the other range riders. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1667.0s)]
*  Over the years at 60 Minutes, we have been in more than a few tunnels. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1677.0s)]
*  We explored Mexican drug lord El Chapo's subterranean escape routes, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1682.0s)]
*  burrowed through a Roman villa buried by Mount Vesuvius, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1686.0s)]
*  and traveled the depths of the New York City subway. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1690.0s)]
*  But nothing prepared us for a place called Moab Katsong, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1693.0s)]
*  a South African gold mine that extends nearly two miles beneath the surface. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1697.0s)]
*  In their pursuit of the gold, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1702.0s)]
*  South Africans have dug the deepest holes on earth. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1704.0s)]
*  The country was the world's top gold producer for decades. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1707.0s)]
*  Now the gold is running out. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1711.0s)]
*  Just as these ultra deep mines have attracted a new breed of miner [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1713.0s)]
*  on a very different quest, we went along for the adventure. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1718.0s)]
*  In the early morning light, tall mine shafts loom over the Val River Basin [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1722.0s)]
*  two hours south of the mine. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1727.0s)]
*  This once was a booming gold field. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1730.0s)]
*  Now most mines lie abandoned. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1733.0s)]
*  But Moab Katsong is bustling. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1736.0s)]
*  Long before the sun rises, thousands of miners start lining up [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1739.0s)]
*  for the triple deck elevator called the cage. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1744.0s)]
*  It's jammed, but more always push on. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1748.0s)]
*  And early one morning, so did the others. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1752.0s)]
*  We are packed in as tight as sardines. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1756.0s)]
*  The electric bells signal we're ready. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1759.0s)]
*  And the cage drops. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1763.0s)]
*  Slowly at first, then picks up speed fast. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1765.0s)]
*  We plunge 450 stories straight down. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1769.0s)]
*  It's the longest elevator ride on earth. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1773.0s)]
*  This is fast. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1776.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1778.0s)]
*  Really fast. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1779.0s)]
*  It's a lot faster than I thought. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1780.0s)]
*  This is fast. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1783.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1784.0s)]
*  Really fast. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1785.0s)]
*  The cage rattles and whistles as we descend. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1786.0s)]
*  The air gets more humid the deeper we go. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1789.0s)]
*  Our lifeline to the surface is a machine called the manwinder. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1793.0s)]
*  Massive coils of steel rope two inches thick that attach to the cage [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1798.0s)]
*  and unspool faster and faster. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1803.0s)]
*  We dropped two miles in a couple of minutes [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1807.0s)]
*  and emerged in an underground city. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1810.0s)]
*  This is like Grand Central Station in Russia. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1813.0s)]
*  To get to the gold, miners must walk miles [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1817.0s)]
*  through a vast maze of dimly lit tunnels. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1820.0s)]
*  Sometimes you're lucky and can catch a ride. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1826.0s)]
*  But mostly you just walk. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1831.0s)]
*  For Leroy Lee, it's in the blood. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1834.0s)]
*  His father worked in the mines. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1837.0s)]
*  Now it's his turn. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1839.0s)]
*  His family depends on his job. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1841.0s)]
*  It's four, six people. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1844.0s)]
*  It's my kids, my wife, my friends, actually, and my mother, my sister. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1846.0s)]
*  The gold in these ultra deep mines is found in narrow veins [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1851.0s)]
*  laced through the rock. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1855.0s)]
*  Some are no wider than a pencil. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1857.0s)]
*  It's cramped at the rock face, and we crouch alongside the miners [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1860.0s)]
*  as they work hunched over in the dark. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1864.0s)]
*  The noise from the drills is deafening. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1868.0s)]
*  Massive air conditioners cool the tunnels, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1872.0s)]
*  but it can still reach 120 degrees down here. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1875.0s)]
*  Are you guys ready? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1879.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1880.0s)]
*  At the end of the shift, we had to rush not to miss the elevator back up. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1881.0s)]
*  It doesn't wait for anyone. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1886.0s)]
*  And here's where all that breaking rock pays off, the smelter. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1890.0s)]
*  The ore is smashed and pulverized in a grinder [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1895.0s)]
*  before being fed into a furnace. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1898.0s)]
*  Manga Kasango, who runs the operation, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1901.0s)]
*  told us we were the first TV crew to film the weekly ritual they call the pour. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1904.0s)]
*  We all had to wear these special pajamas with no pockets [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1911.0s)]
*  so we couldn't steal anything. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1915.0s)]
*  The heat was intense as the furnace reached almost 2,000 degrees. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1918.0s)]
*  The gold turned to liquid and poured down into the molds. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1924.0s)]
*  When I saw it the first time, I was like, wow. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1929.0s)]
*  That's something that keeps me going on that. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1932.0s)]
*  When you hear people who have never seen gold or touched it, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1935.0s)]
*  I feel like I'm more privileged. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1940.0s)]
*  These bars will be refined again to 99.99% purity [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1944.0s)]
*  before they're sold for coins and jewelry. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1951.0s)]
*  The mine used to process about 60 tons of gold a year. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1955.0s)]
*  Now it's just a quarter of that. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1959.0s)]
*  Still, the day we watched the pour, there was a pretty good haul. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1962.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1967.0s)]
*  This is quite heavy. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1972.0s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1975.0s)]
*  How much is this? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1976.0s)]
*  11 million rand. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1977.0s)]
*  So that's about $7.5 million to $8 million for what you poured today. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1978.0s)]
*  Yes, definitely. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1986.0s)]
*  That sounds like a good day. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1987.0s)]
*  It's a good business. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1989.0s)]
*  It's one thing to come here for the gold, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1993.0s)]
*  but now this harsh environment has attracted others, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1996.0s)]
*  scientists hunting for what they call extreme life. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=1999.0s)]
*  We found water that's a billion years old. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2004.0s)]
*  A billion years old. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2006.0s)]
*  A billion years old. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2007.0s)]
*  In these caves. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2008.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2009.0s)]
*  An international team led by Princeton geoscientist Tullis Anstadt [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2010.0s)]
*  and Belgian biologist Gaetan Bourgony are pioneers in the search for life [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2015.0s)]
*  buried in the rock where no one thought it could survive. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2021.0s)]
*  Bourgony says his colleagues thought he was crazy when he took a sabbatical [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2025.0s)]
*  to try to prove there was life deep underground. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2030.0s)]
*  Oh, come on, they said. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2034.0s)]
*  You're going to go to South Africa for a year. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2035.0s)]
*  You're going to look for something that does not exist there. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2037.0s)]
*  They've lost count of the number of trips to the bottom of the mines [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2040.0s)]
*  searching for life hidden in the ancient water seeping through the rock. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2043.0s)]
*  This is a completely different world down there. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2048.0s)]
*  There are different rules. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2051.0s)]
*  How so? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2052.0s)]
*  The temperature is different. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2053.0s)]
*  The pressure is different. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2054.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a tough world down there for life. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2055.0s)]
*  The next day, we went along with them to the deepest level of the mine. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2058.0s)]
*  For them, it was just another day at the office. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2063.0s)]
*  For us, it was an eye opener. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2066.0s)]
*  This feels like that movie, a journey to the center of the Earth. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2069.0s)]
*  With just the light from our headlamps, we waded through a tunnel [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2073.0s)]
*  that had been flooded with cold water to cool it down. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2078.0s)]
*  Then we grabbed a chairlift cut through a channel of rock, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2082.0s)]
*  except this one went down. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2086.0s)]
*  This is like the best Disney ride ever. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2090.0s)]
*  Picture five of New York's World Trade Centers stacked on top of each other. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2092.0s)]
*  That's how deep in the Earth we are. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2097.0s)]
*  We'll stop for a second. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2103.0s)]
*  I hope it's a second. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2105.0s)]
*  We have to get off? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2108.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2110.0s)]
*  When the chairlifts stopped suddenly, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2111.0s)]
*  we had to hike down the last 50 yards to the bottom. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2114.0s)]
*  Then, at the end of an abandoned tunnel, our scientists found something amazing. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2119.0s)]
*  I've been looking for 20 years for a salty water deposit like this. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2125.0s)]
*  I've never found it until now. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2129.0s)]
*  White patches on the wall turned out to be salt. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2131.0s)]
*  Is that edible? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2135.0s)]
*  Try that. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2136.0s)]
*  He's tried it. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2137.0s)]
*  He's tried it? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2139.0s)]
*  It's salty. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2140.0s)]
*  This is ancient salt? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2141.0s)]
*  That's the question. It has to be. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2143.0s)]
*  It's very, very salty. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2145.0s)]
*  And the source? This dripping salt water. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2147.0s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2151.0s)]
*  It tells me this water is extremely old, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2153.0s)]
*  because in these rock formations, they were formed three billion years ago. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2155.0s)]
*  There weren't salt deposits back then. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2159.0s)]
*  They believe this water could be all that's left of an ancient ocean, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2161.0s)]
*  and where there's water, there can be life. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2166.0s)]
*  We could be looking at something which has never seen the life that has evolved on the surface of the planet. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2169.0s)]
*  All from this cave two miles down in South Africa. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2174.0s)]
*  All from gold mines in South Africa. Exactly. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2178.0s)]
*  In 2011, they found what no one thought possible. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2182.0s)]
*  These tiny worms living in a pocket of water 5,000 years old. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2186.0s)]
*  What you're seeing is magnified. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2192.0s)]
*  These worms are no bigger than a human hair. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2194.0s)]
*  It was a species never before seen. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2197.0s)]
*  It survives without sunlight, deep in the hot underworld, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2200.0s)]
*  so they called it Mephisto, or the devil. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2204.0s)]
*  That's where my worms live. They eat bacteria. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2208.0s)]
*  The first worm you found was in something like that. Yeah. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2211.0s)]
*  Using an endoscope camera, they were the first to film this deep inside the Earth's crust. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2214.0s)]
*  This is the devil worm's home. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2220.0s)]
*  Before this, no one thought animal life could exist this deep. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2223.0s)]
*  You made a big discovery. For me it is big because for me personally, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2228.0s)]
*  I had to fight quite a lot of people to be able to do this. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2233.0s)]
*  On a personal level, that was the biggest victory for me. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2236.0s)]
*  In the total grand scheme of things, it's just a worm. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2239.0s)]
*  It's just a worm. It's just a worm. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2243.0s)]
*  They were surprised to find other living creatures too. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2246.0s)]
*  So many, they called them a zoo. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2250.0s)]
*  A crustacean, about 1 64th of an inch. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2253.0s)]
*  An arthropod, a flat worm, and single cell bacteria. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2257.0s)]
*  It set off a storm of speculation about where else extreme life might exist. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2262.0s)]
*  Perhaps even on Mars. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2268.0s)]
*  NASA helped fund their research. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2271.0s)]
*  If there is life here in the deep, then you should definitely dig on Mars [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2273.0s)]
*  because if life was ever there, you will find some life form, I believe, very strongly, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2277.0s)]
*  still on Mars. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2282.0s)]
*  So the Martians we meet in the future could be these single cell organisms you're talking about? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2284.0s)]
*  Yes, indeed. I think that would be the most likely. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2292.0s)]
*  But be prepared to be surprised, I would say. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2295.0s)]
*  South Africa's gold mines are now so deep, they might as well be on another planet. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2300.0s)]
*  I'm not sure that we really want to send human beings much deeper. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2306.0s)]
*  Bernard Swanepoel started his career underground and ended it as the CEO of Harmony Gold, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2310.0s)]
*  which now owns Moab Katsong. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2317.0s)]
*  If you are in a successful mining team, it must be like a successful sports team. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2320.0s)]
*  I mean, mining is one of those activities where at the end of every shift, you know whether you won or lost. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2325.0s)]
*  Gold was the lifeblood of South Africa. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2330.0s)]
*  The way it's dug out has changed little since Apartheid, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2334.0s)]
*  when underpaid black miners often worked in mortal danger. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2338.0s)]
*  At its worst, more than 800 workers a year died in mining accidents. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2342.0s)]
*  No coincidence, the struggle that led to Apartheid's defeat started underground. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2348.0s)]
*  Gold and gold mining seem to be in the DNA of South Africa. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2354.0s)]
*  South African gold mining especially has always been at the center of all political and other activities in our country. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2361.0s)]
*  I mean, how bad Apartheid history is intertwined with gold mining. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2369.0s)]
*  I mean, a lot of the legislation to dispossess black people of land was in order to create cheap labor for South African gold mines. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2373.0s)]
*  You grew up in a small mining town during the era of Apartheid. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2382.0s)]
*  What are your strongest memories? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2388.0s)]
*  Well, ultimately I'm a privileged person that because I was white and I was male, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2391.0s)]
*  those were the two requirements at the time to become a mining engineer. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2398.0s)]
*  So are you the new face of South African mining? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2402.0s)]
*  I would say yes. We are the new generation in the mining. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2408.0s)]
*  Just a dozen years after Apartheid ended, engineer Manga Kasango started managing the smelter. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2412.0s)]
*  He told us he chose to move here from the Congo to work in the mines. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2419.0s)]
*  Has that wound in South Africa been healed? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2425.0s)]
*  Not 100% healed, but there is some healing happening. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2429.0s)]
*  There is some healing, yes, because we have different people working in the mines, and the mindset has been changing. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2433.0s)]
*  Now safety is paramount. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2443.0s)]
*  You will find women underground and blacks are senior managers. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2446.0s)]
*  Once some of the lowest paid laborers are now among the highest. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2450.0s)]
*  But this generation of gold miners know they may be the last. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2455.0s)]
*  Of the 11 gold mines that once flourished around here, only three still operate. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2460.0s)]
*  The mines are now so deep it's becoming too expensive to get the gold out. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2468.0s)]
*  The story of the ultra deep mines is nearing its final chapter. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2473.0s)]
*  To dig the riches from such astounding depths took grit and brute force. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2482.0s)]
*  Now South Africa's resolve must be deployed to solving the next challenge. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2488.0s)]
*  What to do when the gold runs out? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2493.0s)]
*  A remote jewel of land off the coast of Canada, Fogo Island floats in the northeast corner of the northeast province of Newfoundland and Labrador, the outstretched right fingertip of this continent. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2498.0s)]
*  The place might be drop dead gorgeous, but it wasn't immune to the fate befalling so many small and isolated communities in North America. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2518.0s)]
*  Its one and only industry went into steep decline and so in turn did its population. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2526.0s)]
*  Then about a decade ago a local returned home fresh off making a fortune in the tech sector. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2531.0s)]
*  Her pockets were deep, so was her desire to lift up the place and bring people back. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2537.0s)]
*  So she unleashed a sort of economic experiment. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2542.0s)]
*  As we first told you last fall, we took two planes, a long drive and a ferry to reach Fogo Island and check on the early results. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2545.0s)]
*  The saying here goes, you'll know the Newfoundlanders in heaven. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2556.0s)]
*  They'll be the ones who want to go home. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2561.0s)]
*  And the adage comes to life on Fogo Island, a 90 square mile patchwork of 10 minuscule fishing villages where clapboard houses the color of jelly beans cling to rock 400 million years old. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2563.0s)]
*  Among its quirks, Newfoundland has its own time zone, half an hour ahead of the mainland. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2577.0s)]
*  But wander through Fogo Island's villages and you might as well set your watch back to the 18th century. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2584.0s)]
*  Back then all you needed to get by here was a pig, a potato patch and something called a punt. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2591.0s)]
*  A small wooden fishing boat used in pursuit of North Atlantic Kai, the species that once kept this place afloat. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2600.0s)]
*  Seemingly every structure on the island was built in service of catching and preserving fish. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2609.0s)]
*  With one gleaming exception, a 40 million dollar luxury inn. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2614.0s)]
*  Part edge of the earth destination, part economic engine on stilts, the inn is the brainchild of eighth generation Fogo Islander Zeta Cobb. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2619.0s)]
*  And locals gave her a funny look when she first floated the idea. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2628.0s)]
*  What kind of reaction did that get? [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2632.0s)]
*  Why would anyone come here? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2634.0s)]
*  We love this place but it wasn't obvious when you know there are fancy places in the world that people go. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2635.0s)]
*  Our assumption is everybody wants to go where it's warm. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2640.0s)]
*  Someone suggested to us it looked like a ship. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2643.0s)]
*  The architecture of the inn was obviously a topic of much conversation. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2646.0s)]
*  I think about it as a metaphor. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2650.0s)]
*  It's about people from here and people from away. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2652.0s)]
*  It's about the future and the past. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2655.0s)]
*  The past looms large on Fogo Island. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2657.0s)]
*  To fully appreciate the inn, even as a metaphor, you have to understand Fogo's history. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2660.0s)]
*  Just something. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2666.0s)]
*  Zeta Cobb took us through dozens of tiny islands that dot Fogo's waters to a place called Little Fogo Island. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2667.0s)]
*  And for those keeping track, that's an island off an island off an island. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2674.0s)]
*  Her ancestors landed here from Ireland in South England. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2679.0s)]
*  They came for one reason. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2683.0s)]
*  Fish, fish and fish. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2685.0s)]
*  When you say fish, is it just a given? [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2687.0s)]
*  It's a given. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2689.0s)]
*  So yes, when we say fish we mean cod. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2690.0s)]
*  Is it possible to exaggerate the importance of cod to this place? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2694.0s)]
*  No, it's not possible because everything that you need to know about someone from here, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2699.0s)]
*  you can figure it out by just studying that lowly fish. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2705.0s)]
*  It's actually quite a noble fish. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2708.0s)]
*  A noble fish? [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2710.0s)]
*  It asks very little and gives so much. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2711.0s)]
*  They exist on almost anything. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2714.0s)]
*  I mean I think a cod could eat a rubber boot if it had to. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2716.0s)]
*  Not unlike the noble fish, Zeta Cobb's family survived without fuss. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2719.0s)]
*  In Cod they trusted. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2724.0s)]
*  Families worked side by side here, trading their fish for goods. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2726.0s)]
*  No bank accounts, no cash. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2730.0s)]
*  Cobb's parents could neither read nor write. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2732.0s)]
*  She and her six brothers grew up in a house with no electricity. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2735.0s)]
*  She says it was a happy childhood, until it wasn't. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2738.0s)]
*  What happened? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2742.0s)]
*  The worst of the 20th century came down on top of us very quickly [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2743.0s)]
*  in the form of the industrialization of the fisheries. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2747.0s)]
*  So these enormous factory ships showed up here all along the coast of Newfoundland [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2750.0s)]
*  and fished day and night until just about every last fish was gone. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2755.0s)]
*  With one small punt launched from this one dock, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2760.0s)]
*  Cobb's father couldn't compete with commercial vessels [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2763.0s)]
*  that had come to the North Atlantic from all over the world. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2766.0s)]
*  How bad did things get for him? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2769.0s)]
*  Things got, people come back with nothing. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2771.0s)]
*  But one day in particular he came back with one fish. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2774.0s)]
*  And he brought the fish into the house, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2777.0s)]
*  and he slapped it down onto the kitchen floor and said, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2780.0s)]
*  well, it's done. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2784.0s)]
*  And it was the next day he burned his boat. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2786.0s)]
*  He burned his boat? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2788.0s)]
*  He burned his boat. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2789.0s)]
*  It was almost like a sacrifice. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2790.0s)]
*  It was. He did it as a statement. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2792.0s)]
*  He did it as an expression of pain and anger. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2794.0s)]
*  Lambert Cobb made this sacrifice once he realized that those big boats were, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2800.0s)]
*  in his words, turning fish into money. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2805.0s)]
*  He said to me, as a 10-year-old, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2808.0s)]
*  you have got to figure out how this money thing works, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2810.0s)]
*  because if you don't, it's going to eat everything we love. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2813.0s)]
*  He wasn't wrong. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2816.0s)]
*  As fish stocks dwindled, so did the island's population, from 5,000 to 2,500. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2817.0s)]
*  The Cobbs left grudgingly for the mainland in the 1970s. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2823.0s)]
*  Zeta Cobb's father died shortly thereafter, but she heeded his advice. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2827.0s)]
*  She got a business degree, worked in fiber optics, landed in Silicon Valley, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2832.0s)]
*  and before long was the third highest paid female executive in America. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2836.0s)]
*  In her early 40s, she cashed out tens of millions in stock options, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2841.0s)]
*  dropped out of the winner-take-all economy, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2845.0s)]
*  and took her business savvy home, determined to revitalize Fogo Island. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2848.0s)]
*  Instead of writing a check, she posed a question. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2853.0s)]
*  What do we have and what do we know, and how can we put that forward [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2856.0s)]
*  in a way that's dignified for Fogo Islanders, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2859.0s)]
*  and creates economy, and connects us to the world? [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2863.0s)]
*  Spend one night at what the locals call a shed party, and the answer emerges. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2872.0s)]
*  When you think about the people of this place, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2878.0s)]
*  if there's one thing we're really good at, it's hospitality. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2880.0s)]
*  What does hospitality mean here? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2883.0s)]
*  Hospitality in its purest form is the love of a stranger. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2885.0s)]
*  We didn't get a lot of strangers, and when they arrived, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2889.0s)]
*  as my mother used to say, it's always better to see a light coming into the harbor [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2892.0s)]
*  than a light going out. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2895.0s)]
*  So in 2013, Cobb built the biggest beacon in the harbor. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2897.0s)]
*  She made the Fogo Island Inn the centerpiece of a charitable trust called ShoreFast, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2901.0s)]
*  with profits reinvested in the island. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2906.0s)]
*  At $2,000 a night, the inn does turn a profit, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2909.0s)]
*  but there were other considerations. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2912.0s)]
*  We're going to put a 29-room inn on an island that's never had an inn. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2914.0s)]
*  What are the consequences of that? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2919.0s)]
*  Well, more people will come. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2921.0s)]
*  Well, how many more people? [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2922.0s)]
*  As one woman said, well, you know, we're only 2,500 people. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2923.0s)]
*  We can only love so many people at a time. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2926.0s)]
*  ShoreFast and the inn employ more than 300 islanders, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2929.0s)]
*  but the real payoff is the ripple effect. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2933.0s)]
*  For starters, all the furniture at the inn is locally made. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2936.0s)]
*  Same for the pillows and quilts. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2941.0s)]
*  It so happens the women of Fogo Island have been making them for their own homes for 400 years. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2943.0s)]
*  We're getting there. We got half done. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2949.0s)]
*  Word is out now. This quilt is destined for a customer in Baltimore. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2951.0s)]
*  We joined the quilting bee, but didn't last long. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2955.0s)]
*  It was all very nice except for this one square. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2960.0s)]
*  This is our lettuce room. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2963.0s)]
*  ShoreFast puts up seed money for new businesses, too, a quarter of a million dollars so far. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2965.0s)]
*  And then you put your plant in. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2970.0s)]
*  A $7,500 microloan went to Dwight Budden and his father Hayward, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2972.0s)]
*  a former fisher who left Fogo Island when the industry collapsed. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2976.0s)]
*  He's back now as a hydroponic farmer growing greens for the inn. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2981.0s)]
*  There's our kale. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2987.0s)]
*  Does Hayward eat kale? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2988.0s)]
*  Not too much. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2990.0s)]
*  Beyond the kale, new culture is taking root. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2993.0s)]
*  Futuristic-looking studios now speckle the landscape, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=2996.0s)]
*  part of ShoreFast's ambition to bring artists and residents to Fogo. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3000.0s)]
*  And back at the inn, a chef turns cod into oat cuisine. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3005.0s)]
*  If your dad saw cod with magnolia oil and sea foam and porcini, what would he say? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3011.0s)]
*  First thing he'd say, can you really eat that? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3018.0s)]
*  You can do more than eat cod. You can fish for it again. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3020.0s)]
*  Now that a decades-long ban has been eased, Fogo Island's fishers are backhauling cod. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3024.0s)]
*  We ventured out of Fogo Harbor with brothers Glenn and Jerry Best, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3030.0s)]
*  the fifth generation of their family, to harvest these waters. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3035.0s)]
*  You go east, your next stop is Ireland. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3039.0s)]
*  Ireland. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3041.0s)]
*  We're not going there today. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3042.0s)]
*  And over and like that, right? [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3043.0s)]
*  Best brothers showed us the traditional Newfoundland way of fishing with a hand line. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3045.0s)]
*  150 feet down, no rods, reels or nets. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3050.0s)]
*  Now we're talking. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3054.0s)]
*  That's the beauty. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3056.0s)]
*  Up comes cod without much of a fight. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3057.0s)]
*  Now that's a nice cod. That's probably a 20-pound fish. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3060.0s)]
*  Cod is making a comeback in the North Atlantic. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3064.0s)]
*  Canada still imposes catch limits, but when the best get down to business, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3067.0s)]
*  we use an automated system to drop thousands of hooks in the water at a time. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3073.0s)]
*  We watch them offload 20,000 pounds of cod from a single trip. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3077.0s)]
*  What's more, shellfish has done the unthinkable and dethroned cod as king. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3082.0s)]
*  Crab and shrimp now make up 80% of Glenn Best's business, and he's never had a better year. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3088.0s)]
*  You told me you caught 400,000 pounds of snow crab. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3094.0s)]
*  That's 760 a pound is $3 million. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3097.0s)]
*  That was a good year. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3101.0s)]
*  But a thriving fishery isn't always enough to keep the kids around. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3103.0s)]
*  Best's three children have moved away from FOGO to pursue other careers. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3107.0s)]
*  Your family's been doing this for generations. You named this boat after your dad. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3112.0s)]
*  So the sad part about it is that Jerry and myself, we probably could be the last generation that will fish within our family. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3117.0s)]
*  When the day comes that that happens, that will probably be a sad day. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3126.0s)]
*  Still, FOGO Island's population has stabilized. There's hope the next census will show an uptick. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3131.0s)]
*  Babies are the island's biggest celebrities, but as ever, with growth come growing pains. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3137.0s)]
*  It's already become one of those islands where you have to pray to get a spot on the ferry. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3143.0s)]
*  Jennifer Sexton spent summers on FOGO Island visiting her grandparents. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3149.0s)]
*  She recently moved here from Western Canada to open this coffee joint where locals mix with those who come from away. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3154.0s)]
*  Everybody asks about the inn. What do you tell them? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3161.0s)]
*  Well, it's a blessing and a curse. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3164.0s)]
*  Her regulars grumble that not long ago they could get a home for $25,000. Canadian. Now homes cost 10 times as much. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3168.0s)]
*  For somebody from away, that wouldn't be a lot. But for somebody from here, that is a lot of money. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3177.0s)]
*  Zeta Cobb, the woman who turned this tide, says she doesn't want unchecked growth either. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3183.0s)]
*  As the economy grows, we will be smaller as a percentage of the whole economy. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3188.0s)]
*  A rare business leader that wants less market share. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3194.0s)]
*  We want less market share, exactly. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3197.0s)]
*  You said it with a smile on your face, but there's a lot of responsibility here. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3199.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the consequences are huge because, as my brother says, yes, our parents will get out of the graveyard and ring our necks if we mess this up. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3203.0s)]
*  What's your response to the capitalist who would say, why are you limiting your growth? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3212.0s)]
*  That is the techno-economic question. But I start with a different question. What are we optimizing for? We are optimizing for place. We're optimizing for community. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3217.0s)]
*  The pillars of this community have been won over. If Cobb's experiment helps diversify the economy, Glenn Best says he's all in. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3227.0s)]
*  It's not like we're overrun by tourism. That's not the way it works here. We're not the Venice of Newfoundland. We're not out of patience with people yet. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3235.0s)]
*  On our last night at the Shed Party, we got the full sweep of Fogo Island, its hospitality and its contrasts laid out on the table. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3244.0s)]
*  Cod and crab, young and old, warmth, wit and this. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3256.0s)]
*  A traditional song delivered with a handshake, a kind of hope that comes tempered by history. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3262.0s)]
*  The undoing of this traditional way of making a life was very painful. I think I still carry those broken hearts. I think that kind of pain doesn't go away. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3271.0s)]
*  To what extent has that been repaired by the work you've done since you've come back? [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3282.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it actually does help. You can heal a broken heart. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3287.0s)]
*  Be satisfied with what you've got. Live well enough. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC85GStU88&t=3291.0s)]
