# Seniors hacking the lottery, living their best lives and inventing plant-based fuels | Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [February 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw)
*  TICKING [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=0.0s)]
*  Last year, Americans spent more than $80 billion dollars playing state lotteries. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=13.5s)]
*  That's around $250 for each citizen, more than what was spent on concerts, sporting events, and movie tickets combined. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=18.32s)]
*  Over 25 states took in more from their lottery proceeds than from corporate income tax. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=26.06s)]
*  Because of these stakes, it's essential that in both perception and reality, lotteries [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=32.92s)]
*  are truly games of chance, everyone entering with an equal opportunity to win. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=37.44s)]
*  Which is why investigators took note when a retired couple from Michigan, Jerry and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=42.72s)]
*  Marge Selby, made $26 million winning various state lottery games dozens of times. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=47.06s)]
*  This is not a story though of a con or a scam or an inside job. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=54.36s)]
*  No, this is a ballad of a couple from small town America who did something that most people [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=58.24s)]
*  only dream of. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  They didn't so much as beat the lottery odds as they figured them out. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=64.52s)]
*  For years, high school sweethearts Jerry and Marge Selby lived a quiet life in Everett, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=70.38s)]
*  Michigan, population 1,900. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=75.64s)]
*  A single stoplight factory town that collapses in the folds of a map. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=78.6s)]
*  Together they raised six kids and ran a local convenience store on Main Street. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=83.16s)]
*  Jerry handled the liquor and cigarettes and Marge kept the books and made the sandwiches. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  How long did you have the store? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=93.88s)]
*  Seventeen years. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=95.44s)]
*  Seventeen years? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=96.84s)]
*  Every day? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=98.32s)]
*  Every day. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=99.32s)]
*  Why did you decide to sell it? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=100.32s)]
*  I was 62, Marge was 63, and I thought it was a nice time to sell and see what we could [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=101.64s)]
*  do after that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=107.72s)]
*  You're in your early 60s, you decide to retire, you're going to put your feet up, what was [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=108.72s)]
*  the plan? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=113.04s)]
*  Yeah, that was basically it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=114.04s)]
*  I don't think we had one per se. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=115.04s)]
*  That was basically it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=118.68s)]
*  We were going to enjoy life a little bit. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=119.84s)]
*  But one morning in 2003, Jerry happened to walk back into the corner store and spotted [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  a brochure for a brand new lottery game called Windfall. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=129.04000000000002s)]
*  Jerry always possessed what he calls a head for math. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  He has a bachelor's degree in the subject from nearby Western Michigan University. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=136.6s)]
*  And in only a matter of minutes, he realized that this was a unique game. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=141.48s)]
*  I read it and by the time I was out here I knew what the potential might be. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=145.92s)]
*  It did not take you weeks to suss this out? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=152.72s)]
*  Three minutes. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  Three minutes and you found the loophole in the state line? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  Three minutes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=158.16s)]
*  I found a special feature. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=159.16s)]
*  That feature was called a roll down and the lottery announced when it was coming. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=163.48s)]
*  Unlike the Mega Millions games you've probably heard of, where the jackpot keeps building [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=168.68s)]
*  until someone hits all six numbers and wins the big prize, in Windfall if the jackpot [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=172.70000000000002s)]
*  reached five million dollars and no one matched all six numbers, all the money rolled down [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=178.12s)]
*  to the lower tier prize winners, dramatically boosting the payouts of those who matched [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=183.52s)]
*  five, four or three numbers. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=188.32s)]
*  Sound complicated? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=191.32s)]
*  Well, it wasn't to Jerry. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=192.32s)]
*  See if you can stick with him here. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=194.70000000000002s)]
*  Here's what I said. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=196.72s)]
*  If I played $1,100 mathematically I'd have one four number winner. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=198.72s)]
*  That's a thousand bucks. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=205.36s)]
*  I divided $1,100 by six instead of $57 because I did a mental quick dirty and I come up with [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=207.0s)]
*  $18. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=213.36s)]
*  So I knew I'd have either $18 or $19 three number winners and that's 50 bucks each. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=214.36s)]
*  At $18 I got $1,000 for a four number winner and I got $18 three number winners worth $50 [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=219.88s)]
*  each, that's 900 bucks. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=227.04s)]
*  So I got $1,100 invested and I've got a $1,900 return. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  Sounds like good math. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, a little over 80 percent, isn't it? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  You're talking about this as if it's the most obvious set of figures in the world. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=237.04s)]
*  This is not taxing the outer limits of your math skills. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=241.84s)]
*  No, it is. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=244.96s)]
*  Actually it's just basic arithmetic. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=246.2s)]
*  Are you thinking, I bet there are a million people that have also caught on to this? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=249.0s)]
*  Exactly is what I thought. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=253.68s)]
*  When a roll down was announced, Jerry sprang into action. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=256.16s)]
*  He bought $3,600 in windfall tickets and won $6,300. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=259.74s)]
*  Then he bet $8,000 and nearly doubled it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=265.8s)]
*  At that point I told Marge what I was doing. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=269.88000000000005s)]
*  I was going to say, putting thousands of dollars in action on a state lottery game, at what [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  point do you share this with your wife? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=277.12s)]
*  Right at that point. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=280.04s)]
*  Jerry says, I think I've cracked the Michigan State lottery. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=281.04s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=284.36s)]
*  It didn't surprise me. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=286.04s)]
*  You weren't surprised? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  No, I wasn't surprised because as long as nobody wins and you win money, you could see [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  the numbers. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  So when you realize there aren't a million people that have discovered this, it's pretty [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=294.52000000000004s)]
*  much just you. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=297.72s)]
*  What's that feeling like? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=299.56s)]
*  Amazed. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=300.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=301.56s)]
*  Amazed. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=302.56s)]
*  Pretty happy. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=303.56s)]
*  I just couldn't fathom it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=304.56s)]
*  Soon Jerry and Marge Selby started playing for hundreds of thousands of dollars. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=308.88s)]
*  Jerry set up a corporation, GS Investment Strategies. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=313.68s)]
*  He showed us stacks of record books that detailed their winnings. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  Here's one that was pretty successful. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=321.2s)]
*  We played $515,000 and we got back $853,000. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  That's about a 60% return. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=327.84s)]
*  That was a good return. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=332.0s)]
*  They invited family and friends to share in their, well, windfall, selling shares in the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=333.8s)]
*  corporation for $500 apiece. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=338.68s)]
*  You might say this was a different kind of hedge fund. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=341.84s)]
*  We met some of the local investors at the Everett hangout spot, Sugar Ray's Cafe. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=345.32s)]
*  All four of you guys are members of an exclusive club. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=350.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=353.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=354.76s)]
*  James White is a local attorney. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=355.76s)]
*  Dave Huff operated a machine in Tool Shop and brothers, Lauren and Ray Gerber, are retired [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=357.96s)]
*  farmers. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=363.79999999999995s)]
*  And when you looked at the mathematics of it, it made sense. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=364.79999999999995s)]
*  You guys followed the math when he broke it down? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=368.55999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=370.92s)]
*  But he's really good at math. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=371.92s)]
*  So he explained this. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=374.6s)]
*  We asked him questions. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=375.6s)]
*  Yeah, he's a math whiz. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=376.6s)]
*  You guys remember how much you gave him to invest? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=378.32s)]
*  I had about $8,000 and then I put another six in for the grandkids. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=382.56s)]
*  For the grandkids. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=387.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=388.44s)]
*  But overall, you guys came out way ahead on this. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=389.44s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=391.08s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=392.08s)]
*  Yeah, it was a good game. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=393.08s)]
*  It helped me put three kids through school and one through law school. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=394.08s)]
*  So it was quite beneficial. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=399.52s)]
*  Used it for education. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=401.2s)]
*  Pretty much. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=402.2s)]
*  There's a lot of people around town that knew what it was about and talk about it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=403.2s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=407.35999999999996s)]
*  But a lot of people were really leery. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=408.35999999999996s)]
*  They were thinking, you guys are nuts. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=411.71999999999997s)]
*  By the spring of 2005, Jerry's Club stood at 25 members. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=414.71999999999997s)]
*  Those willing to press their luck included three state troopers, a factory plant manager [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=420.02s)]
*  and a bank vice president. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=425.12s)]
*  They had played windfall 12 times, winning millions when Michigan suddenly shut down [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=427.36s)]
*  the game, citing, ironically, lack of sales. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  Michigan game gets closed down. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=436.84s)]
*  How long before you realized there was a game in Massachusetts that also presented some [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=438.28s)]
*  favorable odds? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=442.32s)]
*  One of our players emailed me and he said, Massachusetts has a game called cash windfall. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=443.76s)]
*  Do you think we could play that? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  I've heard that. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=451.4s)]
*  And so I got on the computer. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=452.68s)]
*  I looked at the game and once I researched it, I got back with him and I said, we can [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=455.64s)]
*  play that game. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=463.88s)]
*  We got another winner. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=464.96s)]
*  How long did it take you this time to figure out that you could get a positive return here? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=467.2s)]
*  Ten minutes. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=473.12s)]
*  That's when Jerry and Marge Selby developed a routine they continued for the next six [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=474.12s)]
*  years, driving 900 miles to Massachusetts every time there was a roll down and buying [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=478.68s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of tickets at two local convenience stores. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=484.72s)]
*  Then they hold up, not in some fancy suite at the High Rollers Hotel, but in a room at [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=489.48s)]
*  the Red Roof Inn, sorting the tickets by hand for 10 hours a day, 10 days straight. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=495.16s)]
*  Not so much playing the lottery as working it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=501.4s)]
*  So once there was a roll down on average, how much were you putting in play? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=504.52s)]
*  Over $600,000 per play, seven plays a year. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=508.72s)]
*  $4.2 million once this roll down was coming. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=513.84s)]
*  Per year. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=517.48s)]
*  Did you ever get nervous? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=518.48s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=521.0s)]
*  What did you do with all the losing tickets? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=522.0s)]
*  Saved them. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=525.0s)]
*  You saved them in the big totes? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=526.0s)]
*  Big plastic totes. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=529.2800000000001s)]
*  There must have been millions. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=530.2800000000001s)]
*  18. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=532.08s)]
*  $18 million worth of losing. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=533.08s)]
*  And you have this. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=535.76s)]
*  Just in case we had a physical federal audit. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=537.2800000000001s)]
*  We had the upstairs of the barn, I stored them in one end and in the other end. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=539.86s)]
*  And then I thought, oh no, this floor is going to fall through. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=545.1s)]
*  So then we stored them down in a pole barn. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=548.1400000000001s)]
*  And we had probably 60, 65 tubs of tickets. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=551.1400000000001s)]
*  Did you guys ever say, well, we're supposed to be retired here. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=554.9000000000001s)]
*  We're making 14 hour drives to Massachusetts. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=558.3000000000001s)]
*  We're having fun. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=560.86s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=561.86s)]
*  It's fun for you guys. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=562.86s)]
*  It's fun doing it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=563.86s)]
*  You get a high on it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=564.86s)]
*  And it gave you the satisfaction of being successful at something that was worthwhile [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=566.38s)]
*  to not only us personally, but to our friends and our family. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=572.5s)]
*  But in 2011, the Boston Globe got a tip and discovered that in certain Massachusetts locations, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=576.3399999999999s)]
*  cash winfall tickets were being sold at an extraordinary volume. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=582.38s)]
*  Smart people had figured out, if I buy enough of these tickets, I'll always be a winner. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=587.0999999999999s)]
*  I'll get back more than I spent. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=592.4599999999999s)]
*  Scott Allen oversees the Globe's investigative reporters, known as the Spotlight Team. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=594.66s)]
*  The paper's reporting revealed that two groups were dominating cash winfall, the Selby Gang [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=600.02s)]
*  from Everett, Michigan, and their competition, a syndicate led by math majors from MIT, the [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=605.5799999999999s)]
*  Massachusetts Institute of Technology. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=612.42s)]
*  These were kids young enough to be the Selby's grandchildren. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=615.3s)]
*  The guy who started it, he was doing an independent study project as an undergraduate at MIT. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=619.06s)]
*  And he figured out that he could win this game. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=624.66s)]
*  So he got a bunch of his friends to pool in their money. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=626.54s)]
*  So they became, as time went on, professional cash winfall players, recruiting their friends [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=629.14s)]
*  and raising money from backers until they, too, were spending hundreds of thousands of dollars. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=635.46s)]
*  Incredibly, the MIT group bet between $17 and $18 million on cash winfall over a seven-year [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=640.18s)]
*  period, earning at least $3.5 million in profits, almost the exact same rate of return as the [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=646.46s)]
*  Selby's. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=653.66s)]
*  You've got a syndicate from Northwest Michigan. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=654.66s)]
*  You've got a group of MIT students. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=656.86s)]
*  Did your story meter start beeping? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=659.18s)]
*  It was, oh, it's a great story. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=661.42s)]
*  The Boston Globe article caused a sensation, raising suspicion that the game was rigged. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=663.54s)]
*  The Massachusetts state treasurer shut down the cash winfall game and called for an investigation. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=669.3s)]
*  It was led by then state inspector general Greg Sullivan. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=675.14s)]
*  When we got involved, the public perception was there must be some kind of organized crime [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=679.06s)]
*  or public corruption to explain how millions of dollars are being bet by syndicates on [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=684.9s)]
*  state lottery tickets. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=692.9799999999999s)]
*  We really looked at this looking for corruption. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=694.6999999999999s)]
*  We used subpoenas. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=697.3399999999999s)]
*  We looked at documents. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=698.9s)]
*  We interviewed dozens of people to look at this in detail with a hypothesis that something [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=700.14s)]
*  illegal had happened. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=708.4200000000001s)]
*  You went into this looking for organized crime. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=709.86s)]
*  As the story unfolded, were you surprised by what you found? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=711.9s)]
*  I wasn't surprised. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=714.7800000000001s)]
*  I was dumbfoundedly amazed that these math nerd geniuses had found a way, legally, to [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=716.6600000000001s)]
*  win a state lottery and make millions from it. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=728.6600000000001s)]
*  And the state's getting rich in the process. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=731.34s)]
*  In the state that got very rich, the state made $120 million. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=733.1s)]
*  The investigation found no one's odds of winning was affected by high volume betting. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=736.5s)]
*  When the jackpot hit the roll down threshold, cash winfall became a good bet for everyone, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=742.38s)]
*  not just the big time bettors like the Selby's. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=747.82s)]
*  By then though, Massachusetts state lottery had moved on to a different game without a [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=751.12s)]
*  statistical twist. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=756.14s)]
*  And with that, Jerry and Marge Selby's excellent adventure drew to an end. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=758.0600000000001s)]
*  In total, their unlikely homegrown company grossed more than $26 million from nine years [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=763.26s)]
*  of playing the lottery. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=769.62s)]
*  Your corporation, $26 million. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=771.42s)]
*  You smile when you recounted that figure. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=775.66s)]
*  That was satisfactory. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=777.86s)]
*  They made nearly $8 million in profit before taxes. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=779.86s)]
*  Back in Everett, not exactly the land of extravagance, the Selby's put their winnings to practical [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=785.8199999999999s)]
*  renovating their home and helping their six kids, 14 grandkids and 10 great grandchildren [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=791.7399999999999s)]
*  pay for their education. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=798.06s)]
*  They still get together with members of their lottery group, but millions of dollars in [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=800.18s)]
*  winfall tickets have been replaced by nickel and dime poker night. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=804.42s)]
*  And Marge makes everyone chicken pot pie. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=808.8599999999999s)]
*  I'm struck by how measured you are telling this story. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=812.3s)]
*  Do you find anything remarkable about this? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=815.9399999999999s)]
*  The only thing I found really remarkable is nobody else really seemed to grasp it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=818.8199999999999s)]
*  What I'm hearing you say is that this part of the country is really good at keeping a secret. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=823.4599999999999s)]
*  It's always been a dream of mankind to live forever. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=839.54s)]
*  Since the start of the 20th century, we have increased life expectancy in this country [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=843.8199999999999s)]
*  by a remarkable 30 years, from just 49 in 1900 to almost 79 today. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=848.46s)]
*  And more and more of us are making it into that group we all hope and kind of dread joining [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=855.86s)]
*  the over 90 crowd. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=860.94s)]
*  Affectionately dubbed the oldest old, men and women above the age of 90 are now the [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=863.3000000000001s)]
*  fastest growing segment of the U.S. population. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=868.14s)]
*  Yet very little is known about the oldest old, since until recently there were so few [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=871.82s)]
*  of them. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=876.64s)]
*  So what determines which of us will make it past age 90? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=878.06s)]
*  What kind of shape we'll be in if we do? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=882.06s)]
*  And what can we do to up our odds? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=885.0799999999999s)]
*  Finding out is the goal of a groundbreaking research study known as 90 Plus. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=888.42s)]
*  I was born on April 21st, 1914. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=896.54s)]
*  My birthday is February 7th, 1918. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=901.38s)]

*  And it was, I'm sure, a lovely day. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=915.7s)]
*  Do you feel 95? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=919.1s)]
*  What age do you feel? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=921.3s)]
*  I feel about 52. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=922.3s)]
*  Not really. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=926.3s)]
*  What they have in common, other than having lived a combined total of almost 400 years, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=927.5s)]

*  They didn't like the words Leisure World. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=962.44s)]

*  We went after all 14,000, and if they were still alive, we wanted to find where they [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1010.92s)]
*  were. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1015.9s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1218.1000000000001s)]

*  after this photo was taken. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1225.04s)]
*  It went right into the flames as a candles. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1226.6s)]
*  So I always had a lot of excitement all the time. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1231.0s)]
*  And that was the beginning. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1234.28s)]
*  You're not going to forget that ever. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1236.28s)]
*  No. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1238.0s)]
*  But when it comes to recent memories and thinking skills, she struggles more and more. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1239.0s)]

*  They go not because she can't come to them. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1265.82s)]

*  No. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1322.8600000000001s)]
*  While their spouses, friends, and colleagues... [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1323.8600000000001s)]
*  Never had hardly anything. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1325.8600000000001s)]
*  ...were dropped out along the way. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1328.06s)]
*  What's your secret? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1330.06s)]
*  I wish I knew. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1331.06s)]
*  Genes clearly contribute to longevity, says K. Woss, but they aren't everything. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1332.06s)]
*  Jane Whistler's parents both died when she was young. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1338.06s)]
*  Well, whatever your secrets are, by being in the study, we're going to try to find them out. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1341.06s)]
*  So you can go back and look at their medical history. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1345.06s)]
*  Everybody in the study filled out that questionnaire in the early 1980s. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1349.06s)]
*  Comparing that data to how it's all turned out has yielded a slew of published findings [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1353.26s)]
*  about behaviors associated with living longer. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1358.6599999999999s)]
*  So what's the verdict? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1362.46s)]
*  No surprise, smokers died earlier than non-smokers. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1364.58s)]
*  And what about exercise? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1368.98s)]
*  People who exercised definitely lived longer than people who didn't exercise. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1370.82s)]
*  A little as 15 minutes a day on average made a difference. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1375.36s)]
*  45 was the best. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1379.26s)]
*  Even three hours didn't beat 45 minutes a day. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1381.22s)]
*  Oh, wow, that's interesting. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1384.22s)]
*  And it didn't all have to be at once. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1385.22s)]
*  It could be, for example, 15 minutes of walking and then later in the day gardening or something. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1387.22s)]
*  And it also didn't have to be very intense exercise. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1393.22s)]
*  And non-physical activities, book clubs, socializing with friends, board games, all good. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1397.22s)]
*  Every hour you spent doing activities in 1981, you increased your longevity. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1404.3s)]
*  And the benefit of those things never leveled off. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1411.3s)]
*  The subjects we spoke to had definitely been active, but they didn't strike us as having [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1415.3s)]
*  lived their lives worrying about their health. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1420.3s)]
*  I'm not a big vitamin person. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1423.3s)]
*  Have you watched over the years what you ate? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1425.3s)]
*  Not really. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1428.3s)]
*  Dessert? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1430.3s)]
*  Sure, I love dessert. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1431.3s)]
*  I always had a glass of wine before dinner, and now I still do, but I can't quite finish it. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1433.3799999999999s)]
*  Clean living, huh? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1440.3799999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1441.3799999999999s)]
*  No, not clean living. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1442.3799999999999s)]
*  I don't know what clean living is. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1444.3799999999999s)]
*  What about alcohol? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1447.3799999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1449.3799999999999s)]
*  I love wine. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1450.3799999999999s)]
*  Do you take vitamins? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1451.3799999999999s)]
*  Yes, a lot of them. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1453.3799999999999s)]
*  So which vitamins helped? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1455.3799999999999s)]
*  Antioxidants? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1457.3799999999999s)]
*  Okay, vitamin E. We're sitting at the edge of our chairs. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1458.3799999999999s)]
*  Did it make a difference? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1461.46s)]
*  It was my favorite, but mm-mm. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1462.46s)]
*  No. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1464.46s)]
*  People who took vitamin E didn't live any longer than people who didn't take vitamin E. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1465.46s)]
*  They also looked at vitamin A, C, and calcium. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1469.46s)]
*  The short answer is none of them made a difference. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1474.46s)]
*  None of them made a difference to living for long. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1477.46s)]
*  In terms of how long you lived. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1479.46s)]
*  What about alcohol? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1481.46s)]
*  Oh, alcohol made a difference. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1483.46s)]
*  But it may not be what you think. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1485.46s)]
*  Moderate alcohol was associated with living longer than individuals who did not consume [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1487.54s)]
*  alcohol. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1492.54s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1493.54s)]
*  Moderate alcohol, you live longer? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1494.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1497.54s)]
*  Up to two drinks a day led to a 10 to 15 percent reduced risk of death compared to non-drinkers. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1498.54s)]
*  Isn't that exciting? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1505.54s)]
*  And any kind of alcohol seemed to do the trick. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1507.54s)]
*  A lot of people like to say it's only red wine. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1510.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1512.54s)]
*  In our hands, it didn't seem to matter. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1513.54s)]
*  Martini's just as good. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1514.54s)]
*  And there's good news for coffee drinkers. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1515.62s)]
*  Caffeine intake, equivalent to one to three cups of coffee a day, was better than more [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1518.62s)]
*  or none. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1523.62s)]
*  And if you're concerned about those bulging waistlines, listen to this. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1525.62s)]
*  It turns out that the best thing to do as you age is to at least maintain or even gain [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1530.62s)]
*  weight. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1537.62s)]
*  Gain weight? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1538.62s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1539.62s)]
*  So being a little overweight, you're going to have to do a lot of work. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1540.62s)]
*  Being overweight is good? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1544.6999999999998s)]
*  Being obese is never good. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1547.6999999999998s)]
*  And being overweight as a young person wasn't good either. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1549.6999999999998s)]
*  But late in life, they found people who were overweight or average weight both outlived [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1553.6999999999998s)]
*  people who were underweight. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1559.6999999999998s)]
*  It's not good to be skinny when you're old. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1561.6999999999998s)]
*  But living a long time, even if we don't have to watch our waistlines, isn't the only thing [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1565.6999999999998s)]
*  most of us care about. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1570.6999999999998s)]
*  We want to be all there to enjoy it. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1572.78s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1575.78s)]
*  And it's in the areas of Alzheimer's and dementia that the 90-plus study is generating some [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1576.78s)]
*  of its most provocative and surprising findings. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1582.78s)]
*  We'll tell you about that and one more thing, romance. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1585.78s)]
*  After 90? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1590.78s)]
*  How's your sex life? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1591.78s)]
*  You brought it up. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1593.78s)]
*  When we come back. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1594.78s)]
*  We are a nation getting older. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1602.78s)]
*  By the middle of the century, the number of Americans aged 90 and above is projected to [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1607.78s)]
*  quadruple. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1612.78s)]
*  While that's good news for those of us who want to stick around, it also means more time [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1613.78s)]
*  literally to start to lose our minds. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1618.78s)]
*  Dementia, including that most dreaded form, Alzheimer's disease, is a looming threat and [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1621.78s)]
*  a primary focus of the 90-plus study. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1627.78s)]
*  Participants are asked to donate their brains to the study after they die so researchers [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1630.86s)]
*  can compare what they saw in life to the secrets buried deep within. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1636.86s)]
*  And the picture isn't always matching up, bringing new discoveries and new questions [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1641.86s)]
*  about what may actually be causing dementia in the oldest old and what we may be able [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1647.86s)]
*  to do about it. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1653.86s)]
*  You know, I think that it was common belief that if you got to 90 and you didn't have [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1654.9399999999998s)]
*  dementia or Alzheimer's that you weren't going to get it. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1661.9399999999998s)]
*  Unfortunately, no. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1664.9399999999998s)]
*  I really, really expected to find that. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1666.9399999999998s)]
*  But in our study, that's not to happen. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1669.9399999999998s)]
*  It's not true. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1671.9399999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1672.9399999999998s)]
*  Oh, 62. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1673.9399999999998s)]
*  It turns out the risk of developing dementia doubles every five years starting at the age [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1676.9399999999998s)]
*  of 65 and it keeps right on doubling. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1682.02s)]
*  And given the growth in numbers of the oldest old by mid-century... [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1687.02s)]
*  We are going to have more people with dementia over the age of 90 than we currently have [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1691.02s)]
*  at all ages put together. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1697.02s)]
*  We're not even thinking about it. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1699.02s)]
*  We should be. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1701.02s)]
*  Where do we start? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1702.02s)]
*  As charming and engaging as all the 90-plussers we met were, one who we were particularly [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1703.02s)]
*  moved by was 96-year-old Ted Rosenbaum, a former American history teacher who's been [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1709.1s)]
*  married for 63 years. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1715.1s)]
*  You still look lovely to me. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1717.1s)]
*  I was very lucky. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1721.1s)]
*  So now at this stage of the game, if it's petering out, just reminiscing about our past [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1724.1s)]
*  is a source of incalculable joy. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1731.1s)]
*  An orange and a banana are alike because they're both... [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1736.1799999999998s)]
*  Fruits. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1741.1799999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1742.1799999999998s)]
*  Ted did well on parts of the 90-plus exam like repeating long strings of numbers backwards. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1743.1799999999998s)]
*  Six, one, eight, four, three. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1749.1799999999998s)]
*  Three, four, eight, one, six. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1754.1799999999998s)]
*  But when it came time to remember the three words she had told him just 40 seconds earlier... [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1759.26s)]
*  Three words. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1766.26s)]
*  Yep. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1767.26s)]
*  Give me a hint. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1770.26s)]
*  He was lost. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1772.26s)]
*  Three words. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1774.26s)]
*  And that wasn't his only problem. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1776.26s)]
*  What is today's date? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1778.26s)]
*  Today's date? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1780.26s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1781.26s)]
*  Today's date. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1786.26s)]
*  Does he have dementia at this point? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1789.26s)]
*  Yes, Ted has dementia. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1792.26s)]
*  Unfortunately, there's no blood tests, there's no x-ray. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1795.26s)]
*  It's an examiner finding out that an individual has problems in two or more of the main things [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1799.26s)]
*  the brain does for them. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1806.9s)]
*  So that's where he is. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1808.22s)]
*  And what's perhaps the most devastating is he knows it. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1810.3400000000001s)]
*  My worst condition is my memory. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1814.5s)]
*  When you can't remember something, what goes on inside you? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1819.5s)]
*  Terrible frustration, terrible, you know, it's having more and more of a negative impact [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1824.5s)]
*  on me psychologically. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1831.5s)]
*  Determining what's behind his memory loss isn't easy, since diseases like Alzheimer's [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1834.5s)]
*  can only be definitively diagnosed in the brain after death. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1840.66s)]
*  So it's after the 90-plussers die that a new round of sleuthing begins. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1845.66s)]
*  When subjects in the study donate their brains, they come here to neuropathologist Dr. Ronald [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1851.66s)]
*  Kim. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1857.66s)]
*  He showed us one of the things he always looks for, the plaques and tangles in the brain [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1858.74s)]
*  that are the telltale signs of Alzheimer's disease. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1864.5s)]
*  It forms all of these plaques. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1867.86s)]
*  All these brown spots are plaques. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1870.06s)]
*  Yes, are plaques, that's correct. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1871.6599999999999s)]
*  And in an individual like this, I would expect the patient to be demented. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1873.26s)]
*  You read newspapers every day? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1877.8999999999999s)]
*  Yes, I read them in the evening. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1879.46s)]
*  Lorin Bigelow spent five years in the study. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1881.3s)]
*  He passed away last summer, and while Dr. Kim studies his brain, the rest of the 90-plus [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1884.6399999999999s)]
*  team independently reviews years of his test results and videos to assess whether he had [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1890.6399999999999s)]
*  developed dementia and if so, from what? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1896.94s)]
*  While early on his scores were strong, over the years there was a gradual but unmistakable [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1901.22s)]
*  decline. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1909.66s)]
*  He'd pick up a newspaper he had just finished, use the TV remote to try and make a phone [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1911.3400000000001s)]
*  call. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1917.22s)]
*  Do you know who is the president? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1918.22s)]
*  I want to say her before. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1919.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1922.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1923.54s)]
*  I can't think of it. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1928.54s)]
*  Not remember his age. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1930.54s)]
*  Anxious. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1932.54s)]
*  The consensus here was likely Alzheimer's, which presumes a brain with plaques and tangles. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1934.06s)]
*  Are we ready to hear the truth? [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1939.82s)]
*  Only then do they open up Dr. Kim's report. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1942.1000000000001s)]
*  Plaques zero, so no plaques. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1945.7s)]
*  Wow. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1948.22s)]
*  No cortical tangles anywhere. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1949.22s)]
*  Pretty amazing. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1952.22s)]
*  What's amazing is they're finding that 40 percent of the time in people over 90, what [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1953.22s)]
*  doctors would think is Alzheimer's isn't. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1959.82s)]
*  In Lauren Bigelow's brain, Dr. Kim found something else, something the 90-plus study is finding [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1963.56s)]
*  quite a bit, evidence of tiny microscopic strokes called micro-infarcts. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1969.98s)]
*  His brain was full of them. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1976.78s)]
*  Here is a micro-infarct. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1978.54s)]
*  It's the hole, which is basically a tiny stroke. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1979.54s)]
*  So you've got all this tissue is missing. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1982.54s)]
*  If you find one, it suggests that you should probably look for others, and some patients [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1985.3799999999999s)]
*  may have hundreds or thousands of them. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1989.6599999999999s)]
*  These microscopic strokes are insidious because people don't even know they're having them. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1992.06s)]
*  They can be totally silent, and slowly but surely over time you're picking off, you're [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1996.94s)]
*  disconnecting your cortex from the rest of the brain, and then you start becoming demented. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2002.58s)]
*  It can look just like Alzheimer's is clinically. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2006.54s)]
*  Do you know anything we can do to prevent these mini-strokes? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2009.3799999999999s)]
*  I wish I did, but I will soon, I hope. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2013.78s)]
*  Kewa suspects one thing that may cause them is low blood pressure, and she has some evidence. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2017.6599999999999s)]
*  While none of the factors from the original Leisure World study, vitamins, alcohol, caffeine, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2025.1s)]
*  seem to lower people's risk of getting dementia, the 90-plus study discovered that high blood [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2032.26s)]
*  pressure did. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2038.82s)]
*  If you have high blood pressure, it looks like your risk of dementia is lower. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2040.44s)]
*  Lower? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2046.22s)]
*  Than if you don't have high blood pressure. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2047.22s)]
*  High blood pressure, lower risk of dementia. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2049.14s)]
*  In a 90-year-old. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2052.18s)]
*  High blood pressure is still dangerous if you're younger. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2053.64s)]
*  Yet another reason, she says, it's so important to study the oldest old. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2057.2999999999997s)]
*  Most of what we know, we study in much younger individuals, in 50, 60, maybe 70-year-olds, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2062.22s)]
*  and then we just kind of assume that the same thing should happen in older people. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2069.34s)]
*  And you're saying we shouldn't? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2073.54s)]
*  I think we shouldn't. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2074.62s)]
*  Take this next counterintuitive finding, this time in the 90-plus subjects who have no dementia. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2076.62s)]
*  We're finding out that if you die without dementia in this age group, about half the [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2083.4s)]
*  time you still have plaques and tangles in your head. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2089.08s)]
*  No. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2091.96s)]
*  So you can exhibit Alzheimer's and not have plaques and tangles half the time and the [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2092.96s)]
*  reverse? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2097.76s)]
*  Both directions. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2098.76s)]
*  You're fine and you do have plaques and tangles? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2099.76s)]
*  So what do you make of that? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2101.36s)]
*  One possibility is that plaques and tangles have nothing to do with it. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2103.1600000000003s)]
*  But it might be that plaques and tangles are very, very important, but just a 90-year-old [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2107.76s)]
*  who has them and didn't develop thinking problems has some way of getting around them that maybe [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2111.96s)]
*  all the rest of us would like to know. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2116.96s)]
*  So now they're looking at people with no signs of dementia, like Ruthie Stahl, Lou Tirado, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2119.12s)]
*  Sid Shero, and Jane Whistler, to see if they have plaques and tangles but are not affected [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2125.0s)]
*  by them. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2130.8s)]
*  There's a new type of PET scan that for the first time makes it possible to find plaques [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2132.1600000000003s)]
*  during life. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2137.88s)]
*  So the 90-plus study is engaged in the delicate task of putting 99-year-olds like Jane Whistler [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2140.88s)]
*  into scanners. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2147.6s)]
*  Sid Shero, at 92, hopped right in. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2149.56s)]
*  Jane and Sid both have very, very, very good thinking, as you saw. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2152.96s)]
*  Yes, definitely. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2156.6800000000003s)]
*  And it turns out that one of their scans is positive and one is negative. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2158.62s)]
*  She showed them to us, one on top of the other. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2162.32s)]
*  Yellow and red indicate the presence of amyloid plaque. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2165.7200000000003s)]
*  This is Miss Whistler and this is Mr. Shero. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2169.2s)]
*  Well, I'm surprised, having talked to him, that I'm seeing yellow and red here. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2172.24s)]
*  Kind of stunning. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2178.3999999999996s)]
*  Hello, Mr. Shero! [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2180.3999999999996s)]
*  Dr. Kewas! [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2182.52s)]
*  So what does that mean for Sid? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2184.08s)]
*  The positive scan means statistically he's at greater risk of cognitive decline. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2186.2799999999997s)]
*  But Dr. Kewas says the fact that he's doing so well in spite of the plaque in his brain [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2192.08s)]
*  and his stroke means he may have that something protective and special that could help the [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2197.6400000000003s)]
*  rest of us. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2203.48s)]
*  She says they'll be keeping a close watch on him. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2204.96s)]
*  If it's unclear that the pathology hooks up with what you're seeing, what does that mean [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2207.8s)]
*  in your mind? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2214.04s)]
*  I think we're looking for too simple an answer. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2215.6000000000004s)]
*  I think we want one thing to explain Alzheimer's. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2218.36s)]
*  Look at something different, like what makes skin wrinkle. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2223.04s)]
*  Well, I mean, getting older makes skin wrinkle. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2226.2s)]
*  Being in the sun too much makes skin wrinkle. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2229.48s)]
*  Not taking care of your diet. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2232.68s)]
*  And you put all those together and they all contribute. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2234.96s)]
*  And I think it might turn out to be the same for our thinking, especially in late life. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2238.52s)]
*  That it's not just Alzheimer's pathology from plaques or not just micro-infarcts, but the [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2243.3599999999997s)]
*  number of these hits that you take and after a while you can't withstand them all. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2248.68s)]
*  Let me hold a chair for you. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2253.64s)]
*  There's one last thing we wondered about in the over 90 crowd, and that's romance. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2255.44s)]
*  Helen Weil, 92, and Henry Tornell, 94, both widowed, have been dating for three years. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2261.28s)]
*  So do you see each other every day, several times every day, once a day? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2268.92s)]
*  How does it work? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2274.0s)]
*  She gets one day off a week. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2275.0s)]
*  It's true. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2276.0s)]
*  Tuesday is one. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2277.0s)]
*  Tuesday is a day off. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2278.0s)]
*  It's my day off. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2279.0s)]
*  Helen and Henry love being part of the 90-plus study, and both have signed up to donate their [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2281.0s)]
*  brains after they die. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2286.68s)]
*  Henry has only one problem with the whole enterprise, what the study hasn't asked about. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2289.2s)]
*  I asked them, aren't you going to ask us any questions about our sex life? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2294.76s)]
*  And they said no. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2298.52s)]
*  Well, I will. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2299.52s)]
*  How's your sex life? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2300.52s)]
*  You brought it up. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2301.52s)]
*  See, he is funny. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2302.52s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2303.52s)]
*  I'm not laughing. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2304.52s)]
*  How's your sex life? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2305.52s)]
*  He's fussy. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2306.52s)]
*  He's fussy. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2307.52s)]
*  He's fussy. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2309.04s)]
*  He's fussy. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2310.04s)]
*  But is that part of, do you think that has something to do with? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2311.04s)]
*  I would say it has a big part. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2315.84s)]
*  Helen, we're very emotional. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2318.84s)]
*  We're very affectionate. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2322.24s)]
*  But do you think that sex is an important part of staying young? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2324.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2328.72s)]
*  Okay, are we all ready? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2329.72s)]
*  The 90-plus study has just gotten another five-year round of NIH funding to delve deeper [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2331.12s)]
*  into risk factors for specific types of dementia like those micro-infarcts and to search for [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2337.08s)]
*  genes that may be protective in their continuing search for the secrets of the oldest old. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2343.52s)]
*  I really believe that when we learn things from the 90-year-olds, they're going to be [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2350.44s)]
*  helping the 60 and 70-year-olds not just how to become 90-year-olds, but how to do it with [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2355.24s)]
*  style and as good a function as possible. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2361.2s)]
*  Well, obviously you've already started that by telling us that we should have some wine [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2364.16s)]
*  and we should have some coffee. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2368.68s)]
*  And socialize and exercise. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2371.4s)]
*  And gain weight. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2375.0s)]
*  And that's my favorite. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2376.2s)]
*  My favorite, too. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2377.2s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2378.2s)]
*  We're a nation living longer and longer. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2387.2s)]
*  Over the next 30 years, the number of Americans age 90 and above is expected to triple. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2391.0s)]
*  And an NIH-funded research study called 90-plus at the University of California Irvine is [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2397.4s)]
*  trying to learn all it can right now from a group of men and women who've already managed [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2403.84s)]
*  to get there. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2409.56s)]
*  Six years ago, we first reported on their first set of findings, factors associated [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2411.48s)]
*  with longer life. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2417.24s)]
*  Exercise, moderate drinking of alcohol and caffeine, social engagement, and our favorite, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2419.0s)]
*  putting on a few pounds as we age. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2427.0s)]
*  The 90-plus study's focus is now on memory and dementia. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2430.56s)]
*  What they've learned and what they haven't drew us back, as did the 90-plusers. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2435.3999999999996s)]
*  Take a quick look at when we first met them in 2014. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2441.72s)]
*  My birthday is February 7, 1918. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2446.92s)]
*  I was born in August 25, 1920, and I'm 93-plus. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2452.08s)]
*  June 15, 1918. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2458.04s)]
*  And it was, I'm sure, a lovely day. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2461.28s)]
*  The men and women we met six years ago had all agreed to be checked out by the 90-plus [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2465.56s)]
*  study team top to bottom every six months. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2470.96s)]
*  They have facial muscles. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2477.2799999999997s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2478.2799999999997s)]
*  How they walk. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2479.2799999999997s)]
*  How fast they can stand up and sit down. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2481.48s)]
*  And critically, how they think. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2486.0s)]
*  Now spell world backwards. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2488.68s)]
*  D-L-R-O-W. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2490.44s)]
*  Three. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2491.44s)]
*  They were an impressive and active group, a B-17 gunner in World War II, a fellow World [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2492.44s)]
*  War II vet who drove a convertible. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2502.74s)]
*  A 95-year-old speed walker. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2506.56s)]
*  Ballroom dancers. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2509.96s)]
*  I asked them, aren't you going to ask us any questions about our sex life? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2510.96s)]
*  And they said no. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2515.2400000000002s)]
*  And sadly, some who had begun to struggle with dementia. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2518.48s)]
*  What is today's date? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2522.8s)]
*  Today's date? [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2524.28s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2526.28s)]
*  Today's date. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2527.28s)]
*  What's the oldest person you have seen? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2533.08s)]
*  I've seen several 116-year-olds. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2535.28s)]
*  Neurologist Claudia Kewos, the 90-plus study's lead investigator, says studying the oldest [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2538.28s)]
*  old is increasingly important. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2544.96s)]
*  Half of all children born today in the United States and Europe is going to reach their [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2548.1200000000003s)]

*  Half? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2554.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2555.88s)]
*  Half the children born today are going to live to 100? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2556.88s)]
*  To 103 or 4. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2560.88s)]
*  You know, I don't feel a day older than I was yesterday. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2563.0s)]
*  They invited us back six years later, and we found some study participants, like Helen [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2566.16s)]
*  Weil, the ballroom dancer, thriving. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2571.84s)]
*  Then I do like so 10 times. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2575.36s)]
*  Now 99, Helen showed us how she exercises in her chair. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2578.92s)]
*  How you doing, Jeff? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2584.2s)]
*  Good to see what's going on, Lou. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2587.2s)]

*  Lou was using Zoom. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2593.9199999999996s)]
*  When he was a kid, most homes didn't have a radio. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2595.7599999999998s)]
*  Do you have an iPhone? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2598.16s)]

*  Yes. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2601.16s)]
*  Do you use Siri? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2602.16s)]
*  Yeah, I tell her every evening, wake me up at 6.30 tomorrow morning. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2603.16s)]
*  And she does? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2610.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2611.6s)]
*  Who is our current president? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2612.6s)]
*  President is Trump. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2613.6s)]
*  Who was the president before Trump? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2615.6s)]
*  Obama. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2618.6s)]
*  Because of COVID-19, the 90-plus study is doing cognitive tests by phone. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2619.6s)]
*  To subtract 7 from 100. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2626.6s)]
*  Lou and Helen aced them. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2629.6s)]
*  And keep subtracting 7. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2631.6s)]
*  Her memory is better than mine. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2633.6s)]
*  But one of our favorite 90-plussers from six years ago, Ruthie Stahl, is not so lucky. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2636.6s)]
*  Back then, at 95, she was zipping around in her lime green bug. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2643.6s)]
*  I am flying all over the place. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2649.6s)]
*  But today, she's not so lucky. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2651.6s)]
*  I'm not so lucky. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2654.6s)]
*  I'm not so lucky. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2656.6s)]
*  I am flying all over the place. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2659.6s)]
*  But today, at 102, she didn't remember our having met. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2661.6s)]
*  And what is your first name? [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2666.6s)]
*  Leslie. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2668.6s)]
*  That's a nice name. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2669.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2671.6s)]
*  Ruthie is as charming and upbeat as ever, but her memory is failing. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2672.6s)]
*  The current president or the president before him? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2678.6s)]
*  I'll take either. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2681.6s)]
*  No, I can't. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2682.6s)]
*  Do you remember your parents? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2684.6s)]
*  No. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2686.6s)]
*  No. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2687.6s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2688.6s)]
*  I don't remember them. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2689.6s)]
*  Is it frustrating when you can't remember? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2691.6s)]
*  No. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2695.6s)]
*  No. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2696.6s)]
*  It just passes on to something else. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2697.6s)]
*  Dr. Kewas says most people, probably even most doctors, are not so lucky. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2702.6s)]
*  Dr. Kewas says most people, probably even most doctors, would assume Ruthie's memory [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2709.6s)]
*  problems stem from Alzheimer's disease. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2714.6s)]
*  But scientists are finding out more and more about the complexities of what causes dementia. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2717.6s)]
*  You hear people say, she got Alzheimer's. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2723.6s)]
*  He has Alzheimer's. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2727.6s)]
*  When they really should say dementia. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2729.6s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2731.6s)]
*  Dementia is a loss of thinking abilities that affects your memory or language. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2733.6s)]
*  It's a syndrome. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2738.6s)]
*  It's a syndrome kind of like headache is a syndrome. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2739.6s)]
*  You can have a headache because you've got a brain tumor, or you can have one because you drank too much. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2742.6s)]
*  And it's the same with dementia. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2747.6s)]
*  We were sad to learn that some of the 90-plus participants we met in 2014 have passed away. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2749.6s)]
*  But by donating their brains, as Ted Rosenbaum did, they are very much still part of the study, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2756.6s)]
*  contributing some of its most fascinating and confounding results. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2763.6s)]
*  After a participant dies, the 90-plus team gathers to review mounds of data. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2769.6s)]
*  Now, because of COVID, they gather on Zoom. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2775.6s)]
*  Videos from visit two. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2779.6s)]
*  So tell me what you're going to do when you go home today. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2781.6s)]
*  Ted's test results showed years of memory problems as we had seen six years ago. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2784.6s)]
*  Give me a hint. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2792.6s)]
*  The 90-plus team concluded that Ted probably had Alzheimer's disease, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2794.6s)]
*  but then awaited results from their collaborators, a team of pathologists at Stanford University, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2799.6s)]
*  who independently examined Ted's brain. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2805.6s)]
*  They don't know anything except the brain they've got in front of them. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2809.6s)]
*  And then you come together. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2812.6s)]
*  And then we come together and it's like a reveal party. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2814.6s)]
*  The definition of Alzheimer's disease is having the proteins amyloid and tau, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2817.6s)]
*  often called plaques and tangles, in the brain. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2823.6s)]
*  Okay, the home stretch. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2827.6s)]
*  But when the Stanford team made their report, Ted's brain didn't have either. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2828.6s)]
*  As you may see without even swimming in, the section is clear, it's clean. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2834.6s)]
*  We're negative for beta amyloid here. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2837.6s)]
*  It actually looks awfully good. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2839.6s)]
*  It actually does, yes. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2841.6s)]
*  You sit around, you look at that. What do you conclude? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2842.6s)]
*  The only pathology we found in his head actually was TDP-43. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2845.6s)]
*  TDP-43, a breakthrough. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2850.6s)]
*  It's a newly identified cause of dementia, a protein originally found in ALS patients [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2854.6s)]
*  that KWAS now believes accounts for up to one in five cases of dementia in people over 90. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2860.6s)]
*  Can you find out if you have TDP-43 while you're alive? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2868.6s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2873.6s)]
*  And you can't find out if you have two other dementia-causing conditions either. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2874.6s)]
*  Tiny strokes called micro-infarcts, the damaged brain tissue, and hippocampal sclerosis, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2879.6s)]
*  a shrinking and scarring of part of the brain. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2887.6s)]
*  So it's likely that many people in their 90s who are diagnosed with Alzheimer's [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2890.6s)]
*  What year? Oh. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2895.6s)]
*  may actually have something else. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2897.6s)]
*  There's a whole lot of stuff that goes on in the brain that we have no way of diagnosing during life. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2901.6s)]
*  So we get a lot of those surprises. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2907.6s)]
*  But we also get surprises where people have an awful lot of pathology in their brain, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2909.6s)]
*  a lot of Alzheimer's disease, a lot of TDP disease, and they still turn out to be normal. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2915.6s)]
*  Let me hold a chair for you. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2923.6s)]
*  That's what happened with Henry Tornell, Helen Wilde's ballroom dancing partner, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2926.6s)]
*  who joked about studying sex over 90. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2931.6s)]
*  Henry died at 100 of cancer, mentally sharp as ever. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2934.6s)]
*  We should all be so lucky. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2939.6s)]
*  But his brain told a different story. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2941.6s)]
*  Beta amyloid, I don't even have to zoom in, fluoride, very positive, positive as well. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2944.6s)]
*  The Stanford team found the highest level of plaques and tangles and TDP-43, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2950.6s)]
*  TDP-43, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2957.6s)]
*  especially stunning since more than one pathology typically means more severe dementia. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2959.6s)]
*  So he was a huge surprise. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2965.6s)]
*  He was one of our surprising 90-year-olds who managed to have good cognition [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2967.6s)]
*  in the face of things in their brain that should cause dementia. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2972.6s)]
*  It used to be that when a person like Henry, with clear thinking, was found to have plaques and tangles, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2976.6s)]
*  scientists assumed dementia was just a matter of time. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2983.6s)]
*  But now they're thinking about it in a new way, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2987.6s)]
*  that maybe certain people have protection against dementia, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2990.6s)]
*  a phenomenon they're calling resilience. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2994.6s)]
*  To prove it though, they need to follow people who are still alive. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2997.6s)]
*  Enter convertible driving Sid Shiro from our story in 2014. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3002.6s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3007.6s)]
*  Sid had a PET scan back then for the study, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3008.6s)]
*  which revealed significant amounts of amyloid in his brain. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3011.6s)]
*  The question was, would dementia be around the corner, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3015.6s)]
*  or might Sid somehow be resilient? [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3019.6s)]
*  Happy birthday to you. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3023.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3027.6s)]
*  Sid turned 99 this summer. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3028.6s)]
*  How old do you feel? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3031.6s)]
*  I always say 69. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3033.6s)]
*  Sid has circulation problems that affect his breathing, but his memory? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3036.6s)]
*  Well, he told us about buying his first car 80 years ago for $18 in a pool hall. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3041.6s)]
*  A 31 Chevy convertible with a rumble seat. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3049.6s)]
*  A rumble seat! [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3055.6s)]
*  And I didn't know how to drive it. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3057.6s)]
*  You won it in a pool hall. Did you win it on a bet? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3059.6s)]
*  I didn't win it. I bought it. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3062.6s)]
*  You bought it? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3064.6s)]
*  I gave him $18. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3065.6s)]
*  Who sold a car for $18? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3067.6s)]
*  He needed the money to shoot pool. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3069.6s)]
*  So I know he's got at least two pathologies in his head. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3072.6s)]
*  I know he's got probably high amounts of Alzheimer's, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3075.6s)]
*  and I know he's got some vascular disease. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3078.6s)]
*  And we tested him just a couple weeks ago. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3081.6s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3084.6s)]
*  He did great. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3085.6s)]
*  Please tell me how many nickels in a dollar? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3086.6s)]
*  Twenty. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3089.6s)]
*  How many quarters in six dollars and 75 cents? [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3090.6s)]
*  Twenty-seven. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3095.6s)]
*  Wow, you are quick. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3097.6s)]
*  So is that resilience? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3099.6s)]
*  I think that is definitely resilience. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3101.6s)]
*  Sid might be what resilience is all about. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3103.6s)]
*  Could it be a gene? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3106.6s)]
*  It absolutely could be, or maybe even more likely, multiple genes or combinations of genes. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3108.6s)]
*  Here's my observation. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3113.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3115.6s)]
*  You knew more six years ago than you do now. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3116.6s)]
*  There are just so many questions that we don't know the answers to. More questions. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3120.6s)]
*  That is really a brilliant observation. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3126.6s)]
*  And what science is all about. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3129.6s)]
*  For every new answer, two new questions. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3132.6s)]
*  For every new discovery, like TDP-43 dementia, and especially resilience, new mysteries to solve. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3135.6s)]
*  So like its participants, the 90-plus study is keeping at it, trying to help the rest of us make it to age 102 with Ruthie's spirit, but memory intact. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3144.6s)]
*  It's a shame. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3157.6s)]
*  It's a shame. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3158.6s)]
*  Because there's a lot I could remember. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3159.6s)]
*  And I'll bet you had a wonderful life. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3162.6s)]
*  Oh, I have. It's still going on. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3165.6s)]
*  Thank goodness. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3168.6s)]
*  You never know who's going to be the one with the big idea. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3174.6s)]
*  History has shown it's not necessarily the person with the most impressive credentials. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3185.6s)]
*  A breakthrough can come from the least expected. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3190.6s)]
*  Perhaps like an 81-year-old eccentric from Massachusetts who toiled in isolation with no financial support for more than a decade. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3194.6s)]
*  His focus? A challenge that has stumped scientists for many years how to transform inedible plant life into environmentally friendly transportation fuels in a clean and cost-effective way. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3204.6s)]
*  This unlikely inventor calls himself messianic, as in the Messiah, and likes to say matter of factly that he is saving the world. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3219.6s)]
*  And that's what you think? [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3231.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3233.6s)]
*  You think I'm saving the world? [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3234.6s)]
*  I don't think I know that. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3235.6s)]
*  Who says things like that? Marshall Medoff does. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3237.6s)]
*  He's a man on a mission who decided one day that he was going to stop global warming. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3241.6s)]
*  When I realized what was going on here, I said this is an emergency. We've got to find new resources. We've got to find new ways of saving the universe in terms of global warming and so forth and so on. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3247.6s)]
*  What was your science education? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3258.6s)]
*  Zero. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3261.6s)]
*  So no degree in chemistry? [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3262.6s)]
*  No, of course not. I didn't have any degree in chemistry. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3263.6s)]
*  What's your IQ? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3266.6s)]
*  I have no idea about IQs. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3267.6s)]
*  Medoff has been called a genius. 25 years ago, he became obsessed with the environment and decided to abandon his business career and become an amateur scientist. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3271.6s)]
*  But while engineers, geologists, and ecologists with PhDs went to labs at MIT and Stanford, Medoff went to one of the country's most legendary settings for reflection. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3283.6s)]
*  Mr. Renout to Walden, which wasn't that far away. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3296.6s)]
*  You mean Walden Pond? [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3299.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3301.6s)]
*  The Row? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3302.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3303.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3304.6s)]
*  What I thought was the reason people were failing is they were trying to overcome nature instead of working with it. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3305.6s)]
*  He knew that there's a lot of energy in plant life. It's in the form of sugar molecules that once accessed can be converted into transportation fuel. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3310.6s)]
*  The key word is access. This sugar is nearly impossible to extract cheaply and cleanly since it is locked tightly inside the plant's cellulose, the main part of a plant's cellular walls. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3321.6s)]
*  What's so tantalizing is that sugar-rich cellulose is the most abundant biological material on Earth. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3336.6s)]
*  Cellulose is everywhere. I mean, there's just so much cellulose in the world and nobody had managed to use any of it. Couldn't get at it. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3344.6s)]
*  So that was your target? [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3352.6s)]
*  That was my target. So once I decided to do that, I said, wow, if I can break through this, we can increase the resources of the world maybe by a third or more. Who knows? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3354.6s)]
*  To figure out how to break through cellulose to get at the sugars, Marshall Madoff did something that most of us wouldn't dream of. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3364.6s)]
*  He buried himself away in seclusion for more than 15 years in a garage at a storage facility in the middle of nowhere. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3373.6s)]
*  I didn't have a phone there. Nobody can disturb me. And I have a pile of papers that I had collected. I started reading them. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3382.6s)]
*  The idea that you could solve this big problem with no science background? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3390.6s)]
*  Yeah. I was apparently, I must have had a very good mother who breastfed me an extra few months or something because I had a lot of security about the fact that I'd get it done. And I never had any doubts. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3394.6s)]
*  What about your private life? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3410.6s)]
*  No, I had to give that up. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3412.6s)]
*  You gave up your private life? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3414.6s)]
*  Yeah, of course, because I didn't see anybody from nine in the morning till night at night or later. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3415.6s)]
*  Alone in the garage, Madoff started churning out ideas and patenting them. So many, he needed help. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3421.6s)]
*  Boxes piled to the ceiling. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3429.6s)]
*  Boxes? And? [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3431.6s)]
*  I was shocked. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3433.6s)]
*  The way the place looked? [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3434.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3436.6s)]
*  Craig Masterman was Marshall Madoff's first hire 10 years ago. He's an MIT graduate in chemistry. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3437.6s)]
*  He hired me to build a lab. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3444.6s)]
*  So he hired you to help him prove what he was thinking in his head? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3446.6s)]
*  That's correct. I implement things. He thinks a lot. I implement a lot of things. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3451.6s)]
*  And you'll run it at 25 milliamp of beam power. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3457.6s)]
*  What Masterman helped implement was Madoff's novel idea of using these large blue machines called electron accelerators [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3461.6s)]
*  to break apart nature's chokehold on the valuable sugars inside plant life or biomass. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3470.6s)]
*  Machines like these are typically used to strengthen materials such as wiring and cable. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3478.6s)]
*  Madoff's invention was to use the accelerator the opposite way, to break biomass apart. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3485.6s)]
*  Maybe you can tell us how the electron accelerator works. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3491.6s)]
*  It's pretty simple. It's basically accelerated electricity. And so what happens is that they get accelerated downward where the biomass is. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3495.6s)]
*  And they ram into the biomass and rip it apart. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3506.6s)]
*  It doesn't sound that extraordinary when you hear it, except no one else had thought about it. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3509.6s)]
*  I think fantastic stuff is simple in hindsight. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3515.6s)]
*  And none of the big scientists who were working round the clock to figure out how to get the sugars out... [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3519.6s)]
*  No, they were all messing with things like sulfuric acid and steam explosion and crazy stuff like that, which is very expensive. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3524.6s)]
*  All that stuff's expensive. Electron beams are inexpensive. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3531.6s)]
*  His inventive use of the accelerators caught the attention of investors who saw a potential gold mine in the technology. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3535.6s)]
*  They gave Madoff's company, Zylaco, hundreds of millions of dollars, allowing him to scale up and build this factory in Moses Lake, Washington, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3543.6s)]
*  so he could turn his invention into reality. It's scheduled to be fully operational this spring. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3553.6s)]
*  Here, agricultural residue, like these corn cobs, is trucked in from nearby farms, ground up, blasted by the electron accelerator, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3561.6s)]
*  and then combined with a proprietary enzyme mix. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3572.6s)]
*  This process, Madoff's remarkable invention, releases plant sugars that he's now using to make products he claims will solve some of the world's most intractable problems, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3576.6s)]
*  affecting not just the environment, but also our health. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3588.6s)]
*  One of the plant sugars is called xylose, and Madoff says it could reduce obesity and diabetes since it is consumable and low in calories. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3593.6s)]
*  Xylose is called wood sugar, and it has an unusual property that your oral bacteria cannot use it, so it won't decay your teeth. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3604.6s)]
*  Sugar that doesn't decay your teeth. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3614.6s)]
*  Yes. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3615.6s)]
*  Hallelujah. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3616.6s)]
*  It's healthier sugar. It doesn't do the same things to you. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3617.6s)]
*  So you could drink all the coke. You don't have to drink diet coke anymore. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3621.6s)]
*  No. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3625.6s)]
*  And it would taste the same? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3626.6s)]
*  Yeah. Of course it tastes the same. It tastes like real sugar. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3627.6s)]
*  So I tried it myself. Trust, but verify. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3631.6s)]
*  If I did that, I wouldn't die? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3635.6s)]
*  No, you wouldn't die. It's just sweet. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3637.6s)]
*  Oh, very sweet. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3639.6s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3640.6s)]
*  Very sweet. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3641.6s)]
*  It's getting a little crowded in here, Craig. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3642.6s)]
*  With the investor funds, Madoff also opened a $45 million testing facility in Wakefield, Massachusetts, a far cry from the garage. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3644.6s)]
*  And he hired more than 70 scientists and engineers who have come up with a sugar-based product aimed at another impervious problem. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3655.6s)]
*  Some call it a plague, the accumulation of plastic debris. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3664.6s)]
*  You have said that plastic should be outlawed. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3669.6s)]
*  Yes, the plastics that are being used should be. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3672.6s)]
*  Because all they're doing is accumulating in this enormous amount of ocean that's being despoiled. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3675.6s)]
*  But if you take a plastic bag or a plastic bottle of diet Pepsi or whatever and throw it away, it could be there for 500 years. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3682.6s)]
*  More. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3693.6s)]
*  Most plastics are made from petroleum. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3695.6s)]
*  Madoff makes plastic from plants. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3698.6s)]
*  It seemed to us that his product was hard to distinguish from regular plastic except in one key way. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3701.6s)]
*  Chemical engineer David Jablonski says that Xylakos' bioplastic invention can be programmed to disintegrate over specific time spans, ranging from years to as quickly as 11 weeks. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3709.6s)]
*  You can just take this and you can find this is very degraded. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3725.6s)]
*  Oh, it's falling apart. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3728.6s)]
*  So in 11 weeks, it's already on its way to disintegrating. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3730.6s)]
*  That is correct. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3737.6s)]
*  Perhaps Madoff's most consequential discovery is how to extract the plant sugars and convert them into environmentally friendly biofuels, ethanol, gasoline and jet fuel. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3739.6s)]
*  And I'm told that you call this thing a still. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3752.6s)]
*  It is a still. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3754.6s)]
*  It's actually making alcohol right now. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3755.6s)]
*  Alcohol that you can drink or you can put in your car or you can do both. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3758.6s)]
*  We are on the road again. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3765.6s)]
*  So, Marshall, I am driving a huge truck on biomass fuel. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3769.6s)]
*  Doesn't feel any different than normal gas to me. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3776.6s)]
*  No, it wouldn't. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3778.6s)]
*  Madoff's ethanol is much better than regular corn ethanol in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, 77 percent better, according to a study that was independently reviewed. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3780.6s)]
*  It's a very Einsteinian solution. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3793.6s)]
*  Einsteinian, really? Like Einstein? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3797.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3800.6s)]
*  I was first a little bit skeptical. It seemed almost too good to be true. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3801.6s)]
*  You had never heard of him, I'm sure of that. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3805.6s)]
*  I had not heard of him. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3807.6s)]
*  Robert Armstrong, the former head of MIT's Chemical Engineering Department, joined Zylakow's board of directors after Madoff told him about the electron beam accelerator, his inventive way of breaking down biomass. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3809.6s)]
*  The electron beam is truly a game changer. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3824.6s)]
*  I was told that it's the holy grail, getting access to the sugars. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3827.6s)]
*  People at MIT are working on it, people in the national labs, but nobody's gotten it done yet. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3832.6s)]
*  Has Zylakow done it? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3837.6s)]
*  Zylakow has done it. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3839.6s)]
*  Yeah, he knew I did it, yeah. Of course, MIT couldn't get it done. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3840.6s)]
*  He's right about that. He outsmarted MIT. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3844.6s)]
*  And now he's lured some pretty powerful men to his board of directors, including former Shell Oil executive Sir John Jennings and three former cabinet secretaries, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3850.6s)]
*  Steve Chu of the Department of Energy, George Shultz, former Secretary of State, and former Defense Secretary William Perry. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3861.6s)]
*  Well, I thought he was another Thomas Edison. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3870.6s)]
*  Another Thomas Edison? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3873.6s)]
*  Another Thomas Edison, a genius, a very eccentric genius, but a genius who had come up with this totally revolutionary idea. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3874.6s)]
*  He definitely is a character. I come from a world of characters in my scientific world. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3882.6s)]
*  But he's not a scientist. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3888.6s)]
*  But he has all the attributes of many successful scientists. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3890.6s)]
*  You have to believe in yourself. You have to say, this is going to work. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3894.6s)]
*  Is there enough biomass to supply enough of this ethanol or gasoline in the world? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3899.6s)]
*  It can make a significant dent. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3907.6s)]
*  A possible 30 percent dent in the petroleum market, according to a report by the Department of Energy. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3910.6s)]
*  But the question is, can Marshall Madoff scale up his operation enough to compete with the oil industry? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3917.6s)]
*  What is in doubt in my mind is how long it's going to take. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3925.6s)]
*  Breaking into these huge industrial markets, established markets with established companies, that's going to be a big undertaking. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3929.6s)]
*  It won't turn off oil and gas overnight, obviously. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3935.6s)]
*  It won't turn off coal. It won't turn off nuclear. It won't turn off all the other sources of energy. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3940.6s)]
*  But it will find its place, and I think it will find it relatively quickly, because of all the boxes that it ticks. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3945.6s)]
*  One of those boxes is that silico's fuels could be easily dropped into the pumps at existing gas stations. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3952.6s)]
*  You wouldn't have to change anything. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3960.6s)]
*  I can just put it right in my car. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3962.6s)]
