# Killing Bin Laden | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [December 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE)
*  You are about to meet one of the men who shot Osama Bin Laden. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=0.0s)]
*  Mark Owen recently left the Navy's elite counterterrorism unit, SEAL Team 6. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=17.42s)]
*  Mark Owen is not his real name. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=23.36s)]
*  It is the name that he used to write a new book about the assault on Bin Laden's compound [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=24.84s)]
*  called No Easy Day. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=30.04s)]
*  Owen was on the helicopter that crashed into the compound. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=32.28s)]
*  He was the second man in Bin Laden's bedroom and he took the pictures of the body that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=36.2s)]
*  the world has never seen. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  Owen received a silver star for valor and a purple heart for a wound suffered in the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=43.44s)]
*  raid. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=48.2s)]
*  But despite all that, Owen told us in his only interview that No Easy Day is not about [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=49.2s)]
*  him. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=55.36s)]
*  He says it's a tribute to the hundreds of Americans who gathered intelligence, planned [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  and trained in the 10-year pursuit of the world's most wanted man. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=61.2s)]
*  Seal Team Six, he told us, just took care of the last 40 minutes. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=66.60000000000001s)]
*  Was this a mission, was the plan to kill Osama Bin Laden or capture him before you went [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=72.56s)]
*  in? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=79.68s)]
*  This was absolutely not a kill only mission. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=80.68s)]
*  It was made very clear to us throughout our training for this that hey, if given the opportunity, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=84.56s)]
*  this is not an assassination, you will capture him alive if feasible. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=92.04s)]
*  That was the preferred thing? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=98.74000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=100.0s)]
*  You would kill him alive if you could? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=101.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=102.44s)]
*  We're not there to assassinate somebody. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=103.44s)]
*  We weren't sent in to murder him. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=105.44s)]
*  This was hey, kill or capture. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=108.12s)]
*  We've never heard the story from someone who was there. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=110.36s)]
*  The raid, May 1, 2011, had been years in the making, but in the moment, the best laid plans [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=113.72s)]
*  failed, leaving a small team of Americans to improvise victory from near disaster. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=120.52s)]
*  This operation was one of the most significant operations in U.S. history and it's something [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=127.4s)]
*  that I believe deserves to be told right and deserves to go in a book and stand for itself. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=133.34s)]
*  You're in disguise as we do this interview today and I wonder why. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=140.08s)]
*  The focus shouldn't be on me. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=143.56s)]
*  The focus should be on the book. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=144.56s)]
*  I'm not trying to be special or a hero or anything. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=145.56s)]
*  I'm just trying to tell the bigger story. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  But you're in disguise also for your own security? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  Tell me about that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=155.24s)]
*  What concerns you? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=156.24s)]
*  The enemy has a long memory. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=158.08s)]
*  And so we spent a long time perfecting a new look for Owen. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=161.0s)]
*  Before each interview, the best artist spent four hours thoroughly changing his appearance. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=165.70000000000002s)]
*  We've used shadows to enhance the effect and we've altered his voice. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=171.56s)]
*  Chief Petty Officer Owen was in the Navy 14 years. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  He had read about the SEALs in junior high school and set his sights. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=181.08s)]
*  How many times have you been to war since 9-11? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=186.64s)]
*  I've done 13 combat deployments. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=188.64s)]
*  Afghanistan? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=191.64s)]
*  Afghanistan, Iraq, all over. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=192.64s)]
*  There are several SEAL teams but Owen rose to the very top. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=195.2s)]
*  A unit called the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, SEAL Team 6. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=199.48s)]
*  SEAL Team 6 is made up of a number of squadrons and I wonder why was your squadron chosen [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=205.76s)]
*  for this particular mission? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=211.64s)]
*  Was there something special about you? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=212.96s)]
*  Nope. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=214.56s)]
*  Certainly nothing special about me, nothing special about the 24 guys that were chosen, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=215.68s)]
*  nothing special about our squadron. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=219.84s)]
*  It really could have been any number of guys. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=222.24s)]
*  You just happened to be available for training? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=225.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=228.0s)]
*  In April 2011, they had just returned from Afghanistan when they were told to report [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=229.28s)]
*  to North Carolina for an exercise. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  Give me the lay of the land here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=237.04s)]
*  What do we see? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=238.24s)]
*  Owen walked into a top secret briefing room, saw a model of a compound and heard this from [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  his buddies. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=245.84s)]
*  What did they say? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=246.84s)]
*  They said, hey, we found Bin Laden. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=247.84s)]
*  We think we found Bin Laden and they want us to come up, you know, rehearse and come [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=250.04000000000002s)]
*  up with a plan. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=255.44s)]
*  If there's going to be a ground option approved, they want us to rehearse for one. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=256.44s)]
*  What did you think? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=260.68s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=262.24s)]
*  The mission was Operation Neptune Spear under the authority of the CIA. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=264.2s)]
*  The agency had tracked a Bin Laden courier to a curious compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=269.2s)]
*  They'd been watching the compound with satellites. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=276.68s)]
*  The house seemed too big for the neighborhood. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  There was no telephone connection. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=282.88s)]
*  The people there burned their trash. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=284.86s)]
*  There was a wall 12 feet high and a walled-in balcony. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=287.68s)]
*  Who lived up there? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=293.12s)]
*  They briefed us on the individual they were calling the Pacer. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=295.24s)]
*  The Pacer? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=298.03999999999996s)]
*  The Pacer. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=299.88s)]
*  So he would come out of the house and kind of walk around the yard to what was assessed [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=300.88s)]
*  to just be getting exercise. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=304.24s)]
*  Where did the Pacer pace? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=306.04s)]
*  Over here. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=308.32s)]
*  In this courtyard back here? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=311.08000000000004s)]
*  So he'd just kind of walk out in here and a lot of the vegetation out here was probably [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  purposely planted so surveillance couldn't see down on him. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=316.72s)]
*  And he would just go round and round and round? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=321.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=323.04s)]
*  He'd walk around the yard. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=324.04s)]
*  Sometimes he'd walk with the assessed to be a female. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=325.16s)]
*  They'd just walk around the yard. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=327.56s)]
*  He'd never stop to help anybody do any work. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=329.40000000000003s)]
*  If there was other people in the yard working, he never seemed to do any of that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=330.76000000000005s)]
*  It's almost above it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=334.36s)]
*  Above doing the manual labor. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=336.44000000000005s)]
*  He was the boss, whoever he was. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=340.16s)]
*  The Pacer had been in Abbottabad about five years. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=341.16s)]
*  It's a well-to-do city of one million people. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=345.44000000000005s)]
*  The compound was about a mile from the Pakistani Military Academy. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=348.26000000000005s)]
*  In terms of the inside of the house, how much did you know? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  Zero. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=358.04s)]
*  Zero. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=359.04s)]
*  So, once you went through the door, you didn't know what you were going to be facing? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=360.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=363.68s)]
*  But again, it goes back to that years of experience. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=364.68s)]
*  We've done this a million times. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=367.08s)]
*  Raids like this were common many nights in Afghanistan and Iraq. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=369.56s)]
*  And looking at the model, the SEALs didn't think of this as particularly challenging. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=373.92s)]
*  The tricky part was getting there. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=378.76s)]
*  The U.S. wasn't telling Pakistan so the helicopters could be shot down by Pakistan's modern [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=381.7s)]
*  air defenses. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=387.8s)]
*  The pilots were from the Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=389.44s)]
*  Two modified Blackhawks, call signs Chalk 1 and Chalk 2, would drop 24 SEALs and a Belgian [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=395.0s)]
*  Malinois combat dog named Cairo. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=402.7s)]
*  Chalk 1, which is the one I was on, was going to hover over the compound here. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=406.6s)]
*  We would drop the two fast ropes, slide down the ropes into the courtyard here, and then [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=411.38s)]
*  go about our business while Chalk 2 would land out here, just over here by the road, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  drop the external containment team off. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  They would provide security external. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=425.47999999999996s)]
*  We'd have two men and our combat assault dog would do a quick patrol of the perimeter, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=427.44s)]
*  down to the south and around, to make sure that there was no tunnels underneath the walls [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=433.52s)]
*  if somebody did hear us coming and had time to escape. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=438.88s)]
*  After dropping those guys off, the second healer was going to come up, hover over the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=441.38s)]
*  third floor, drop off the remaining guys. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=445.7s)]
*  They would then hop right down into the balcony, assaulting from the top down, and our guys [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=448.76s)]
*  would assault from the bottom up. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=453.06s)]
*  A few days after getting the mission, they had their plan, and so began weeks of rehearsals [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=455.1s)]
*  on a full-size version of the compound built in North Carolina. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=461.02s)]
*  How many times did you assault it? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=466.08s)]
*  How many times did you train on it? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=467.48s)]
*  A lot. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=469.21999999999997s)]
*  Between when we got the mission and when we left for Afghanistan, we probably, you know, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=470.54s)]
*  probably did a hundred times. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=475.74s)]
*  So how unusual was this kind of training? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=477.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, very unusual. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=480.74s)]
*  I've never had all the mock-ups. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=481.74s)]
*  I've never rehearsed for something for three weeks. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=484.34000000000003s)]
*  One rehearsal had an audience, the nation's highest ranking officer, Admiral Mike Mullen, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=487.36s)]
*  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the head of special operations, Admiral Eric Olson, and [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=493.18s)]
*  observers from the White House. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=499.18s)]
*  One of the things that I liked after the fact was I remember Admiral Mullen coming by and [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=501.90000000000003s)]
*  talking to each one of us, and then Admiral Olson as well, and I thought that was cool. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=506.14000000000004s)]
*  You know, they walked by, shook each of our hands, and said, hey, are you guys ready? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=509.74s)]
*  Can you guys pull this off? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=514.58s)]
*  And I'm pretty sure to a man, we all said yes, absolutely. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=515.58s)]
*  The team got several days off at home around Easter. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=520.4s)]
*  Then, in late April, about a month after they got the mission, they loaded on a plane bound [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=523.58s)]
*  for a U.S. base in Afghanistan. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=528.76s)]
*  The president wasn't convinced yet. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=531.3199999999999s)]
*  No one confirmed that Bin Laden was the pacer, so SEAL Team 6 was on standby. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=533.72s)]
*  One of the passengers on their plane was a CIA analyst who had spent five years on Bin [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=540.24s)]
*  Laden's trail. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=546.48s)]
*  I can't give her enough credit. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=548.08s)]
*  I mean, she, in my opinion, she kind of teed up this whole thing, and it was just, you [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=549.52s)]
*  know, wicked, smart, kind of feisty, and she was, you know, we'd always talk back and forth, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=557.2s)]
*  hey, what do you think the odds of this are? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=563.5200000000001s)]
*  What do you think the odds of that are? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=565.32s)]
*  And, you know, hey, you know, what do you think? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=567.32s)]
*  You think he's there? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=570.32s)]
*  She's like, 100%. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=571.32s)]
*  100% he's there. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=572.32s)]
*  And you thought what? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=573.32s)]
*  Well, we'll see. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=574.32s)]
*  Three days later, on April 30th, the president was telling jokes at the annual White House [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=576.72s)]
*  Correspondents' Dinner. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=581.7800000000001s)]
*  CIA Director Leon Panetta's belly laugh was heard all across the room. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=583.52s)]
*  Reporters in ball gowns and tuxedos had no idea that just a few hours before, President [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=588.84s)]
*  Obama had ordered Panetta to launch the raid. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=595.0s)]
*  Mr. Obama kept to a schedule, thinking that on this night, it was better to have reporters [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  drinking and laughing than asking questions. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=603.98s)]
*  When did you first hear that the president had approved your mission? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=607.92s)]
*  The commanding officer of our command walked in and said, hey, just got off the phone, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=612.44s)]
*  the mission's approved. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=616.2800000000001s)]
*  What did you think? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=617.6600000000001s)]
*  This is big. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=620.0400000000001s)]
*  This is cool. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=621.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm glad I'm a part of it. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=622.0400000000001s)]
*  The raid was supposed to be April 30th, but the weather was bad. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=624.08s)]
*  The next night, Vice Admiral William McRaven saw the men off. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=628.46s)]
*  He was a SEAL, and he had planned the mission as head of the Joint Special Operations Command. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=633.0400000000001s)]
*  Just before midnight, the Blackhawks started the sprint from the U.S. base in Jalalabad, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=639.3s)]
*  Afghanistan to Abbottabad, about 150 miles away. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=644.26s)]
*  The helicopters were blacked out against a clear, moonless night. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=648.74s)]
*  The Army pilots guided by night vision goggles flew high speed, treetop level, under Pakistani [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=652.74s)]
*  radar. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=659.66s)]
*  It was roughly an hour and a half. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=660.66s)]
*  After we took off, shut the doors, and the radio call I heard was, hey, we're over the [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=663.14s)]
*  border. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=670.6999999999999s)]
*  We're crossing the border in a pack stand. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=671.6999999999999s)]
*  And I remember thinking, wow, this is, okay, this is happening. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=672.6999999999999s)]
*  And I swear I glanced around the helicopter, and half the guys are sitting there asleep [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=676.9s)]
*  on the right end. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=681.78s)]
*  It's an hour and a half ride. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=682.78s)]
*  You guys got to catch a few Z's on the way in. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=683.78s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=686.22s)]
*  Your team is flying in to Osama bin Laden's compound, and they're asleep? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=687.22s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's your time to just kind of shut your eyes, relax, mentally walk through whatever [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=693.98s)]
*  you need to walk through. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=700.26s)]
*  It was about 1 o'clock in the morning, 66 degrees, 65% humidity, with calm winds. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=702.18s)]
*  At one minute, we opened the door, and I just kind of swung my legs out, and I'm sitting [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=709.3s)]
*  there looking down. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=713.34s)]
*  Wow, you know, this is a beautiful spot. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=714.34s)]
*  Houses with pools in the backyard, well-lit, manicured yards. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=718.82s)]
*  Like, wow, this is definitely not the mud huts of Afghanistan. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=722.98s)]
*  Somehow, there was a blackout in the neighborhood. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=727.22s)]
*  No one will say whether that was luck or design, but it meant ideal darkness for the SEALs [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=731.0s)]
*  with their night vision goggles. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=737.7s)]
*  You could see the compound coming. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=739.7s)]
*  You had the door to the Blackhawk open, and your legs were swung outside. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=741.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=746.88s)]
*  Make a little more room, be faster, quicker for everybody to get out and fast rope out [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=747.88s)]
*  of the helicopter so everybody's getting ready to fast rope. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=751.8s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, we banked hard 90 degrees. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=755.12s)]
*  Once we went hard 90, it was very apparent that something was wrong. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=758.2399999999999s)]
*  Owen doesn't know what went wrong, but pilots say that a chopper can lose lift when it drops [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=762.7199999999999s)]
*  into the turbulence of its own downdraft, and the turbulence would have been much worse [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=768.56s)]
*  because the downdraft was being magnified and reflected by the compound's walls. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=773.76s)]
*  These pilots are the best in the world. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=779.68s)]
*  You don't get better than these guys, and typically, they just, boom, they move right [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=782.0s)]
*  in and they stick it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=785.64s)]
*  It's like parking a car for these guys. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=786.64s)]
*  And it was a rough ride. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=789.4399999999999s)]
*  We were pretty low, tail rotor and everything happened to miss this wall here, and then [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=793.1999999999999s)]
*  we were just kind of sliding and falling out of the sky this way. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=798.36s)]
*  I was now in the front of the helicopter, although I was sitting on the left side, I [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=801.2800000000001s)]
*  was now in the front. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=804.9200000000001s)]
*  My buddy right behind me, he pretty much should have fallen out. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=806.4000000000001s)]
*  If it weren't for him hanging onto me, there's a good chance I would have been thrown from [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=810.5200000000001s)]
*  the helicopter. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=813.84s)]
*  As the helicopter is going down, what were you thinking? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=814.84s)]
*  This is going to suck. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=819.12s)]
*  You know, hey, wow. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=820.36s)]
*  The carefully rehearsed plan was out the window before the first boot hit the ground. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=822.48s)]
*  With one helicopter and half the SEALs crashing, the second helicopter abandoned the roof [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=827.68s)]
*  assault as too risky, and the SEALs began to improvise. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=833.02s)]
*  One thing was sure now, the people in the house knew they were coming. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=837.4s)]
*  The raid on Bin Laden's house was supposed to be straightforward. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=845.88s)]
*  Two helicopters, call signs Chalk 1 and Chalk 2, carried 24 members of SEAL Team 6. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=849.9599999999999s)]
*  Each man hauling 60 pounds of gear. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=856.98s)]
*  One group planned to slide down ropes onto the roof of the house. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=860.22s)]
*  Mark Owen's group planned to rope down into the courtyard. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=863.82s)]
*  But Owen's helicopter crashed, and now everything was changing for the most important counterterrorism [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=867.16s)]
*  assault in U.S. history. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=873.26s)]
*  Tell me about the crash. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=876.24s)]
*  The pilot mentioned, you know, I remember him mentioning in the rehearsals, he's like, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=877.86s)]
*  you know, if I have to ditch this thing, I'm going to try and put it down in this courtyard. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=881.26s)]
*  So that's exactly what he did. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=885.76s)]
*  You could tell, you could hear the helicopter winding up. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=887.24s)]
*  He was putting all the power on it he could, but it wasn't helping. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=889.4399999999999s)]
*  No, nothing. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=892.24s)]
*  Came in and impacted. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=893.52s)]
*  Boom. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=894.52s)]
*  Had the angle been more, the rotors would have hit the ground, snapped off, and caused [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=895.52s)]
*  us to roll. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=899.56s)]
*  Had the tail rotor hit, obviously it would have broken, caused us to break and roll. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=900.56s)]
*  The load bearing section of the tail landed precisely on the wall. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=904.6s)]
*  The strongest part of the tail just happened to land on the wall. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=908.66s)]
*  Yep. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=911.92s)]
*  And the angle happened to be perfect. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=912.92s)]
*  It all came down to inches, really, inches either way. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=914.44s)]
*  We stopped. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=918.24s)]
*  The main rotor blades are still turning. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=919.24s)]
*  I don't think he could recreate that if he tried. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=920.48s)]
*  Lucky. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=923.4000000000001s)]
*  Lucky. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=924.4000000000001s)]
*  But again, huge props to these pilots. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=925.4000000000001s)]
*  I mean, everybody wants to meet the guy who shot Menloan. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=928.0s)]
*  I want to meet the pilot. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=931.12s)]
*  I wouldn't be here if it weren't for him. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=934.2s)]
*  If the pilot had not brought your helicopter down intact, would the mission have failed? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=935.6s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=941.6400000000001s)]
*  Chalk 2 was on the ground. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=943.4399999999999s)]
*  And as soon as they saw us crash land, that Chalk 2 helicopter pilot saw that happen, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=946.28s)]
*  decided not to push the position to go to the roof. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=951.9599999999999s)]
*  And that's one thing that Admiral McCraven said in one of our very last rehearsals, briefs, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=954.7199999999999s)]
*  dry runs right there in Afghanistan before we launched. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=959.68s)]
*  He stood up and he said, hey, listen, don't try any fancy stuff. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=962.4399999999999s)]
*  Just get the guys on the ground and they'll figure it out. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=965.52s)]
*  You mention in the book that one of the Army pilots that was flying your team looked to [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=968.52s)]
*  you to be about 50 years old. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=974.04s)]
*  He was definitely a little older. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=975.92s)]
*  But I guess in this line of work, it's experience that matters. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=977.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he's probably been flying longer than I've been alive. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=980.48s)]
*  So nothing wrong with that. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=982.92s)]
*  They had planned to be on the ground 30 minutes, but now they were running late. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=985.68s)]
*  Owen's team landed in this courtyard, walled off from the house. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=990.0799999999999s)]
*  So your team does what? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=994.36s)]
*  I ran out here. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=995.8199999999999s)]
*  I turned around and look and I see the guys on the left side of the helicopter. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=996.82s)]
*  They're sitting right staring at the front door. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1000.5400000000001s)]
*  So they simply hop out and go right to the front door like nothing happened. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1002.6600000000001s)]
*  Go right to this door here. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1006.22s)]
*  The other helicopter landed outside the perimeter wall, dropped all of its seals and took off. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1008.62s)]
*  Now what's your objective? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1015.2600000000001s)]
*  What's your team supposed to do right now? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1016.7s)]
*  We are clearing and securing the southern compound. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1018.84s)]
*  You expect to find people in this building and you want to clear that building so the [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1020.74s)]
*  rest of the team can do what they need to do in here. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1025.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1027.8200000000002s)]
*  I think what seals are good at is what I consider pick up basketball. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1028.8200000000002s)]
*  We all know how to play the game. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1031.98s)]
*  You know, you hear the saying in the teams, can you shoot, move and communicate? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1032.98s)]
*  So we all know how to shoot. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1038.0s)]
*  We all know how to move efficiently and tactically and we can communicate clearly. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1039.0s)]
*  So when something goes sideways, we're able to play that pick up basketball and just kind [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1043.66s)]
*  of read off each other. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1048.5800000000002s)]
*  Now the seals were in several groups. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1050.1200000000001s)]
*  One group was outside the perimeter wall to make sure no one escaped. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1052.78s)]
*  The group that was supposed to rope to the roof was outside the wall looking for a way [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1057.12s)]
*  in. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1061.5s)]
*  Owen led his team to the outer building where they expected to find one of Bin Laden's couriers. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1062.5s)]
*  We got to the door. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1068.36s)]
*  Obviously we made tons of noise at this point. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1069.84s)]
*  It had taken a little longer to get there. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1072.24s)]
*  So you know, element of surprise is slipping away quickly. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1074.82s)]
*  We got to the double doors. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1078.72s)]
*  I tried it once real quick. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1081.1399999999999s)]
*  The door was locked. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1082.48s)]
*  My buddy who was with me is carrying a sledgehammer, pulls it out, gives it a couple good swings. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1083.6799999999998s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1087.8799999999999s)]
*  Door's not going anywhere. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1088.8799999999999s)]
*  Kind of solid metal. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1089.8799999999999s)]
*  So I'm like, okay, we're going explosive. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1092.34s)]
*  They'll carry explosive charges. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1094.4199999999998s)]
*  I pulled one off, got on my knee and started setting it and right as I was attaching it, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1095.8s)]
*  a round started coming through the door at us. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1101.5s)]
*  Somebody who started shooting at you from inside the house and the bullets were coming [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1103.58s)]
*  through the door. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1106.76s)]
*  Yep. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1107.76s)]
*  My buddy who was standing up started returning fire. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1108.8s)]
*  I could, yeah, I kind of rolled away from the door, blindly returned fire back through. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1112.44s)]
*  You couldn't see what was on the other side and then it went quiet. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1117.18s)]
*  Thankfully the SEAL that was there with me, that initially returned fire with me, spoke [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1121.1s)]
*  Arabic so he immediately started calling out to the people inside, started hearing the [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1124.94s)]
*  metal latch on the inside of the door. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1129.18s)]
*  What are they, are they going to come out with a suicide vest? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1131.02s)]
*  Are they going to throw a hand grenade out? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1133.02s)]
*  Are they going to, you know, spray their AK? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1134.42s)]
*  Fire opens up, a female holding a kid, a couple kids right behind her. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1137.26s)]
*  You got your finger on your trigger and you're looking at a woman with her children. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1141.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, split second. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1146.44s)]
*  I mean, we just received fire. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1147.72s)]
*  My buddy speaking Arabic, he's asking her, you know, hey, where's your husband? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1150.72s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1154.6s)]
*  And she replies back to him, he's dead, you shot him. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1155.6s)]
*  Owen didn't notice until later, but he was bleeding, a shoulder wound from a fragment [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1159.48s)]
*  of something in the firefight. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1164.72s)]
*  Yeah, I just got a little piece of frag in my shoulder from some of the rounds that [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1167.1799999999998s)]
*  came through. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1170.26s)]
*  It really wasn't a major wound at all, but I carry a set of bolt cutters to cut locks [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1171.26s)]
*  with. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1177.2199999999998s)]
*  When I got back, you know, checking my gears, any holes or anything, and I pull out the [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1178.2199999999998s)]
*  bolt cutters and I've got the bullet stuck in the handle. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1182.4599999999998s)]
*  So the bullet just missed me by a little bit and the handle stick up either side of my [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1184.9799999999998s)]
*  head. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1188.78s)]
*  Right, right by your neck. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1189.78s)]
*  But you don't consider that to be a big deal? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1191.62s)]
*  No, plenty of other guys have suffered much, much, much worse. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1193.76s)]
*  So it's not a big deal. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1197.8s)]
*  Within five minutes, Owen's team cleared the outer house. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1200.9199999999998s)]
*  More SEALs entered the compound and converged on the first floor of the main building. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1204.08s)]
*  Inside they found another courier with an assault rifle. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1209.76s)]
*  Those SEALs were in the process of shooting the second gunman. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1214.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1217.08s)]
*  And his wife jumped in front of him. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1218.08s)]
*  All the women on target were very hostile. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1220.04s)]
*  It's something very different than what we see in Afghanistan or Iraq. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1222.7s)]
*  You typically don't see the women that are this aggressive and hostile. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1225.8999999999999s)]
*  Even though the females had come out of this building and talked to us, they were still [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1230.1s)]
*  very combative and aggressive. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1234.58s)]
*  And we saw that throughout the entire compound, even all the way up on the third floor. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1237.1s)]
*  They secured the ground floor and then the second floor. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1240.98s)]
*  The team continued to head up these stairs single file. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1244.3s)]
*  The first SEAL in line is called the Point Man. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1248.02s)]
*  Owen at this point was right behind him, number two, going up to the third floor. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1250.72s)]
*  The SEALs had been told they could expect one of Osama Bin Laden's sons. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1255.88s)]
*  Guys start making their way up the stairs and it's quiet, it's pitch black in the house, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1261.3600000000001s)]
*  no lights, all night vision. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1267.2s)]
*  Get to the second floor. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1269.28s)]
*  Intel had said, we think that Khalid, his son, lives on the second floor. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1270.68s)]
*  This is Osama Bin Laden's son. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1276.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1278.3200000000002s)]
*  The guy in front of me who's Point Man, he sees the head pop out and disappear really [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1279.46s)]
*  quick around the corner. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1283.54s)]
*  It's like, okay, you know, what do you, who is it? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1284.54s)]
*  What do you think, I don't know. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1289.06s)]
*  He literally whispers, not amped up, not yelling, not anything. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1291.3s)]
*  He whispers, hey Khalid, Khalid. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1295.86s)]
*  Whispers Khalid's name. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1298.9399999999998s)]
*  Doesn't know if it's Khalid or not. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1301.9399999999998s)]
*  Khalid literally looks back around the edge of the hall and he shoots him. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1304.02s)]
*  What was Khalid thinking at that time? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1309.7s)]
*  Look around the corner, curiosity killed the cat. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1312.1799999999998s)]
*  I guess Khalid too. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1316.3799999999999s)]
*  It had been 15 minutes since the crash. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1318.3s)]
*  It was now about 1 15 a.m. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1320.98s)]
*  Give me a sense of what this scene is like in there. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1324.46s)]
*  I mean, are these guys yelling and charging up the stairs? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1327.4199999999998s)]
*  Is there a lot of action? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1331.3799999999999s)]
*  How's it unfolding? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1332.54s)]
*  You know, it's not like the movies. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1333.54s)]
*  Movies make it out to be, you know, loud and crazy and everybody's yelling. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1335.68s)]
*  This is what we do. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1340.28s)]
*  We're really good at it. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1342.08s)]
*  And so it's quiet, calm, like we've done it a million times before. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1343.12s)]
*  We have a saying, you know, don't run to your death. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1347.52s)]
*  So nice and slow and we head up the stairs. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1350.24s)]
*  Khalid is dead on this landing. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1353.52s)]
*  The point man is stepping past Khalid and now you're number two in the stack. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1356.56s)]
*  You're right behind the point man. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1362.28s)]
*  Yep. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1363.8s)]
*  Kind of trying to look around him, hear him take a couple shots, kind of see ahead. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1364.6999999999998s)]
*  Somebody disappear back into the room. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1369.6599999999999s)]
*  The point man had seen someone stick his head out a door and shot him just the way he'd [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1371.2199999999998s)]
*  shot Khalid. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1376.34s)]
*  Yep. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1377.34s)]
*  What did you do then? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1378.34s)]
*  Inside the room I could see a body laying on the ground. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1380.3s)]
*  Over him was two females real close to the door. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1383.98s)]
*  They looked up and saw the point man. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1388.02s)]
*  He steps in to the room, literally rushes the two women, grabs one under each arm and [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1391.02s)]
*  pushes them back against the far wall. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1397.02s)]
*  So if they did have a suicide vest on and they did blow themselves up, that they wouldn't, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1399.06s)]
*  that that wouldn't affect the rest of the guys. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1404.62s)]
*  But it would have killed him. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1406.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1408.38s)]
*  You stepped into the room and saw the man lying on the floor. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1411.66s)]
*  What did you do? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1415.34s)]
*  Myself and the Nexus Salter Inn, we both engaged him several more times and then rolled [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1416.98s)]
*  off and then continued clearing the room. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1422.3600000000001s)]
*  When you say you engaged him, what do you mean? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1424.24s)]
*  Fired. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1427.1200000000001s)]
*  You shot him? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1428.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1429.1200000000001s)]
*  He's still moving? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1430.1200000000001s)]
*  A little bit, but you couldn't see his arms, couldn't see his hands. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1431.1200000000001s)]
*  So he could have had something, could have had a hand grenade or something underneath [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1434.28s)]
*  his chest. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1437.28s)]
*  So after Osama bin Laden is wounded, he's still moving, you shot him twice? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1438.28s)]
*  A handful of times. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1443.76s)]
*  A handful of times and the seal in the stack behind you also shot Osama bin Laden and [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1445.78s)]
*  at that point his body was still. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1452.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1454.58s)]
*  Did you recognize him? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1455.58s)]
*  No. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1456.58s)]
*  You know, everybody thinks it was like, you know it's him. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1457.58s)]
*  No. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1461.26s)]
*  To us at that time, it could have been anybody. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1462.26s)]
*  Maybe this was another brother, maybe this is a bodyguard, maybe. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1463.98s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1466.82s)]
*  The point is, is to just continue clearing. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1467.9s)]
*  By now, 20 minutes had passed. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1471.26s)]
*  Every single thing the woman with the CIA had told them on the plane had been right, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1474.2s)]
*  but time was running out. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1479.28s)]
*  Throughout the raid, the remaining helicopter was in the air. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1481.04s)]
*  It only had enough gas to stay for 30 minutes or so. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1484.24s)]
*  Pakistani neighbors had discovered the seals posted outside the compound wall and it couldn't [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1487.68s)]
*  be long before the Pakistani military would know they were there. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1493.48s)]
*  One seal was charged with keeping an eye on his wristwatch and calling out the dwindling [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1497.96s)]
*  time on the radio. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1502.88s)]
*  20 minutes. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1504.5s)]
*  15. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1505.5s)]
*  10. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1506.5s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1507.5s)]
*  As time was slipping away, Mark Owen and a couple of other members of SEAL Team 6 kneeled [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1512.66s)]
*  around a mangled body on the third floor of the house in Abbottabad, Pakistan. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1518.14s)]
*  Everything the CIA analysts told them about the raid on Osama bin Laden's house had checked [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1523.94s)]
*  out exactly as she said. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1528.66s)]
*  What was this bin Laden? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1532.56s)]
*  You know, in my mind, he looked way younger than I thought he was going to be. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1535.08s)]
*  His beard wasn't gray at all. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1539.36s)]
*  I've studied lots of photos of him and, you know, they were always gray. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1540.72s)]
*  His beard was dark black. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1545.64s)]
*  Identifiably, he was very tall, so okay, you know, you can kind of chalk that up as something. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1547.6s)]
*  Bin Laden was about 6'4". [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1553.0s)]
*  His nose, to me, was something that I could kind of identify. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1555.56s)]
*  So, you know, kind of looking at the profile shots and everything, I was like, okay, I [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1559.08s)]
*  was pretty sure that was him. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1562.98s)]
*  But I'm not willing to make that call. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1564.58s)]
*  Certainly not at that point. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1567.9399999999998s)]
*  Not willing because Owen says they suspected the president was listening at the White House [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1569.62s)]
*  and he was right. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1574.98s)]
*  The helicopter crash had been reported up the chain of command. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1576.54s)]
*  Owen says the SEALs wanted proof before anyone said anything on the radio about killing Osama [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1580.1399999999999s)]
*  bin Laden. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1586.74s)]
*  They turned to one of the SEALs in the room who spoke Arabic. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1588.04s)]
*  So he moved out to where the women and kids were, grabbed one of the younger kids, says, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1591.76s)]
*  hey, who is that inside? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1596.6399999999999s)]
*  She says Osama. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1598.12s)]
*  Osama who? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1599.6399999999999s)]
*  Osama bin Laden. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1600.6399999999999s)]
*  The child? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1602.6s)]
*  The child. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1603.6s)]
*  Identified him. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1604.6s)]
*  No. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1605.6s)]
*  Grabbed one of the females, asked her again, said, hey, who is that? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1606.6s)]
*  She said Osama bin Laden. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1608.92s)]
*  So does a cheer go up among the SEALs? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1610.32s)]
*  You start shaking hands, patting each other on the back? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1612.8799999999999s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1615.28s)]
*  All business, one o'clock here. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1616.34s)]
*  So we call up the commanding officer. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1618.22s)]
*  He comes upstairs, looks at the body. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1620.82s)]
*  We give him what we have so far. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1623.02s)]
*  Hey, here's what he looks like. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1624.02s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1625.7s)]
*  He's tall. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1626.7s)]
*  Women and kid confirm it. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1627.7s)]
*  He took one look. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1628.86s)]
*  Said, okay, I think that's him. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1629.86s)]
*  The commander used the code word for bin Laden, Geronimo, as he passed the message to Admiral [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1632.34s)]
*  McRaven. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1638.02s)]
*  For God and country, he said, I pass Geronimo, Geronimo, E-K-I-A, which stands for enemy, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1639.42s)]
*  killed in action. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1649.24s)]
*  Twenty minutes had passed. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1651.88s)]
*  Ten minutes left on the schedule. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1653.5600000000002s)]
*  We wanted to collect DNA samples. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1655.5600000000002s)]
*  We wanted to take photographs of them. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1658.3600000000001s)]
*  And then we wanted duplicate copies of that. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1660.3600000000001s)]
*  So obviously we're taking the body out. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1662.48s)]
*  But if a helicopter got shot down on the way out and it had the body, we wanted the other [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1665.2s)]
*  helicopter to have DNA and photos so they'd have some sort of evidence that said, hey, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1669.36s)]
*  we do have them and here it is. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1674.2199999999998s)]
*  You wanted duplicates of everything? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1675.62s)]
*  Yeah, just in case. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1676.9799999999998s)]
*  You thought of everything? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1677.9799999999998s)]
*  We tried. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1678.9799999999998s)]
*  One seal took blood and saliva samples. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1679.9799999999998s)]
*  Owen took the pictures. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1683.82s)]
*  I figured these were probably some of the most important photos I'd ever taken in my [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1685.74s)]
*  life. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1688.9399999999998s)]
*  So, you know, make sure I do it right, get good angles and all this other stuff. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1689.9399999999998s)]
*  You know, you got to clean off the face as identifiable as possible. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1693.58s)]
*  So one of my buddies had a camelback with some water in it, got some, you know, spread [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1700.28s)]
*  some water on him, took a sheet off the bed, kind of wiped the blood off and then took [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1705.8799999999999s)]
*  photos. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1709.4399999999998s)]
*  Wiping the blood off of Osama Bin Laden's face. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1710.4399999999998s)]
*  Camelback is one of those backpacks that has a water bladder in it and you use it to drink [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1713.8799999999999s)]
*  water out of, but you used it to wash his face. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1718.0s)]
*  When you shot pictures of his face in a profile, can you describe what they look like? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1721.36s)]
*  They're pretty gruesome. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1727.08s)]
*  Well, when you say gruesome, what are we talking about? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1728.08s)]
*  He had a bullet wound in the head, so that gruesome. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1730.9599999999998s)]
*  Two seals took the body downstairs and zipped Bin Laden into a bag. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1737.56s)]
*  In the bedroom, Owen found an assault rifle and a pistol on a shelf. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1742.4199999999998s)]
*  And some people would argue that, you know, why did that point man take those shots? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1747.86s)]
*  Well, immediately the first door we went to, my team was engaged by enemy fire through [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1753.58s)]
*  the door. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1759.56s)]
*  So automatically we know we're going into it, an enemy compound, shots being fired back [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1760.56s)]
*  at us immediately. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1767.2199999999998s)]
*  AK found next to Khalid on the stairs, all those boxes have been checked that if a guy [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1768.62s)]
*  sticks his head around the corner, he very easily could have a gun. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1775.1399999999999s)]
*  You don't wait to get that AK or the grenade thrown down the hall or the suicide vest. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1778.86s)]
*  So in the split second, that's when he engaged. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1785.1599999999999s)]
*  He did have a gun, but he didn't use it. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1788.36s)]
*  And I wonder what you make of that. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1791.7s)]
*  I think in the end, he taught a lot of people to do, you know, martyr themselves and he [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1796.58s)]
*  masterminded the 9-11 attacks. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1803.24s)]
*  But in the end, he wasn't even willing to roger up himself with a gun and put up a fight. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1805.2s)]
*  So I think that speaks for itself. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1810.28s)]
*  Back on the second floor, the SEALs were grabbing computers, disks, flash drives, videotapes, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1813.44s)]
*  more priceless intelligence than they could carry. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1819.7s)]
*  There was so much stuff in this house. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1822.76s)]
*  The guys were just stuffing this stuff in garbage bags? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1824.88s)]
*  We had carried bags with us, but we filled all these bags up. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1827.92s)]
*  So you just find an old gym bag on target, dump out whatever's in it and use that. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1831.4s)]
*  As we were running out, I look over at my buddy. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1837.4s)]
*  He's got a bag of stuff in one hand, like Santa Claus running out of there, but a bag [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1839.4s)]
*  full of goodies in one hand that he'd collected and a computer terminal in the other. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1843.5s)]
*  The plan had been to be on the ground for 30 minutes, but now they were a few minutes [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1849.6000000000001s)]
*  late. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1854.24s)]
*  It was after 1.30 a.m. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1855.24s)]
*  Now things are starting to pick up outside. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1857.3600000000001s)]
*  People have obviously woken up at this point. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1859.4s)]
*  They're coming over to investigate what's going on. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1862.24s)]
*  They were the neighbors, and they had a lot of questions for the SEALs standing guard [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1864.68s)]
*  outside the wall. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1869.3600000000001s)]
*  So that's where things could get real dynamic for that team outside. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1871.3200000000002s)]
*  Everybody wants to know what was going on inside. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1874.64s)]
*  That team had way more responsibility than just about anybody else because they were [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1877.1200000000001s)]
*  dealing with all the what-ifs outside. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1881.2800000000002s)]
*  What if the police showed up or the military? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1885.4s)]
*  We're running out of time. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1888.72s)]
*  We've got to get going. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1889.72s)]
*  There's neighbors approaching. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1890.72s)]
*  The interpreter that was out here said, hey, there's a police operation going on here. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1892.0400000000002s)]
*  Go back to your homes. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1896.2s)]
*  And they'd simply go back away. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1897.6000000000001s)]
*  Among the unfinished business was the crashed helicopter. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1899.88s)]
*  It was a secret design loaded with secret gear. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1903.44s)]
*  They had to blow it up. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1907.0600000000002s)]
*  A message was passed to their explosives expert called the EOD man. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1908.5600000000002s)]
*  Prep it to blow, they said. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1913.36s)]
*  But the it in the message was a little vague. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1915.4399999999998s)]
*  The EOD guy thinks he means prep the house to blow. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1919.12s)]
*  So there we are in the middle of this. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1925.52s)]
*  And he's like, OK, Roger that. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1927.1999999999998s)]
*  Prep it to blow. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1928.4799999999998s)]
*  So he's running around the first floor of the house setting his charges, getting ready [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1929.4799999999998s)]
*  to blow up the house. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1932.56s)]
*  And somebody looks over and is like, dude, what are you doing? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1933.6s)]
*  He's like, I'm prepping it to blow. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1936.56s)]
*  He's like, not the house, the helicopter. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1937.76s)]
*  Well, he hadn't got the word that there was a helicopter even down. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1940.48s)]
*  He's like, what helicopter? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1943.3600000000001s)]
*  The one in the courtyard. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1945.3600000000001s)]
*  Go take a look. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1946.3600000000001s)]
*  So he runs outside, sees the helicopter, and then and then they proceed to rig it to blow. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1947.0800000000002s)]
*  It was past time to go. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1953.68s)]
*  Two large helicopters called CH-47s filled with reinforcements and fuel had been standing [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1955.72s)]
*  by during the raid. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1962.76s)]
*  The remaining Blackhawk would return for half of the SEALs. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1964.3600000000001s)]
*  A CH-47 would pick up the rest. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1967.92s)]
*  The Blackhawk that's picking us up lands first. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1971.1200000000001s)]
*  We run through the field carrying the body in the body bag, load the remaining Blackhawk, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1974.68s)]
*  and then we slowly lift off and move away. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1981.64s)]
*  While they're waiting for the 47 to come in, the timer on the charges is ticking down. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1984.92s)]
*  The explosion on this helicopter is coming. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1990.3200000000002s)]
*  How much time have they got? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1993.1200000000001s)]
*  Not much left. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1994.16s)]
*  Minutes. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1994.8400000000001s)]
*  They're under 30 seconds. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1995.3600000000001s)]
*  They're running down. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1996.48s)]
*  The team leader that was in charge of the demo team, he gets a hold of the commanding [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=1998.04s)]
*  officer, gets him on the radio talking to their 47, tells the 47 to do a go around as [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2001.96s)]
*  he's doing the go around of the south. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2008.4s)]
*  Boom, the charge goes. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2010.56s)]
*  Our Blackhawk's already gone. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2012.16s)]
*  This explodes, big huge explosion. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2014.2s)]
*  The 47 comes right back around, lands, the guys load on, and now they're airborne. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2017.52s)]
*  We're done. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2023.48s)]
*  We're clean from the target. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2024.48s)]
*  That glow at the compound was the helicopter on fire. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2026.68s)]
*  The SEALs were on the ground about 38 minutes, which meant their Blackhawk had been in the [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2033.04s)]
*  air waiting a little longer than planned. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2037.92s)]
*  Sure enough, I'm sitting in the helicopter and you turn around and look in the cockpit [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2041.52s)]
*  and I see flashing red lights. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2045.16s)]
*  Well, I'm not a pilot, but anything flashing red in a vehicle is typically not good. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2046.92s)]
*  Those gas gauges were about to run out of fuel. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2053.08s)]
*  During their escape, the SEALs were forced to land in Pakistan. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2056.64s)]
*  One of the CH-47s was waiting on the ground and refueled their Blackhawk. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2061.64s)]
*  The Pakistanis didn't get you on the way in, but your concerns are going to get you on [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2066.84s)]
*  the way out. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2070.04s)]
*  Sure, we've got to get out of here. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2071.04s)]
*  When did you know that you were out of Pakistan? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2072.56s)]
*  They radioed over, came on over the radio, said, hey, we're back in Afghanistan. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2074.56s)]
*  And you thought what? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2079.76s)]
*  Big sigh of relief, and wow, we might have actually pulled this off. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2080.76s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2085.88s)]
*  Was there ever a point, Mark, in which you shook hands with each other, slapped each [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2086.88s)]
*  other on the back? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2091.4s)]
*  Yeah, once we landed, everybody kind of hugged and high-fived and took a couple photos and [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2092.4s)]
*  you know, it was our five minute, hey, cool, we pulled this off, good job, and then it [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2098.04s)]
*  was back to work. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2103.76s)]
*  In his book, Owen describes how they loaded the body onto a pickup truck and brought it [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2105.48s)]
*  to a hangar where Vice Admiral McRaven, head of Joint Special Operations Command, was waiting. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2110.28s)]
*  They unzipped the bag. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2116.2000000000003s)]
*  Standing nearby was that CIA analyst who had spent years on Bin Laden's trail. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2117.96s)]
*  Miss 100%, the woman who told you that she was 100% certain that they had a son of Bin Laden. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2124.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2129.88s)]
*  So, we're all in the hangar. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2130.88s)]
*  Immediately we saw her and she started crying. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2133.4s)]
*  It was a pretty significant event in her life, I'm sure. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2136.1200000000003s)]
*  Six hours later, the president announced it to the world. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2141.36s)]
*  Tonight, I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2145.16s)]
*  conducted an operation that killed Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2150.6s)]
*  Yeah, we watched it live. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2155.48s)]
*  They had some TVs set up in the hangar that we were at and literally still in your camouflage [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2158.68s)]
*  uniform, our gear kind of set to the side and we heard it was coming on and we went [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2164.56s)]
*  and gathered around and watched the address. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2169.48s)]
*  What did you think? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2172.12s)]
*  Now the world knows that we've got them. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2173.3599999999997s)]
*  When you landed back in the United States, what did you think of all the media coverage? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2183.52s)]
*  It was all surreal because this had all been so hush hush leading up to it. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2188.04s)]
*  We went and did it. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2192.96s)]
*  Now it was the biggest news story ever. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2193.96s)]
*  We got on a bus. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2196.6s)]
*  They drove us back to work. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2198.08s)]
*  I didn't even go in. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2199.52s)]
*  They told us we had a couple days off and I grabbed my keys, went and got my truck and [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2200.92s)]
*  I put it in the book. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2206.04s)]
*  I hit Taco Bell on the way home, hit the drive through, a couple tacos and ate it in my car [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2208.88s)]
*  right there and then drove home. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2216.52s)]
*  You were part of the team that killed Osama Bin Laden and the first thing you do when [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2218.68s)]
*  you get back to the United States is go to Taco Bell. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2222.44s)]
*  Two tacos and a bean burrito. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2225.12s)]
*  It's routine. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2226.8s)]
*  Life has been anything but routine for Mark Owen since the publication of his book was [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2227.8s)]
*  announced. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2234.6000000000004s)]
*  We'll have that when we come back. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2235.6000000000004s)]
*  Days after returning from the raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan, Mark Owen's squadron boarded an [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2241.6400000000003s)]
*  ancient C-130 transport plane for one more mission. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2247.8s)]
*  The men wondered why the plane was so old. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2252.1600000000003s)]
*  Then they found out the plane had been used in 1980 in the failed attempt to rescue the [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2255.64s)]
*  American hostages in Iran. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2262.12s)]
*  Somebody thought it was a fitting piece of American history to carry the men to their [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2264.7999999999997s)]
*  secret meeting with the President of the United States. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2269.48s)]
*  The terrorist leader who struck our nation on 9-11 will never threaten America again. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2274.2s)]
*  President Obama was making a speech at Fort Campbell, Kentucky and he met with the Bin [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2280.3199999999997s)]
*  Laden team privately. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2284.44s)]
*  All of the men would receive a silver star for valor. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2286.56s)]
*  Did the president ask you guys which ones of you had shot Osama Bin Laden? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2290.6s)]
*  Yeah, he asked. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2295.68s)]
*  He asked who was the one and we told him we wouldn't tell. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2296.92s)]
*  You wouldn't tell him, why not? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2300.36s)]
*  Pulling a trigger is easy. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2301.84s)]
*  You know, a couple pounds of pressure on your trigger finger and I've done it millions of [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2302.84s)]
*  times and it's not that hard. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2305.68s)]
*  So it's not about who that one person was, it's who was by the team or the helicopter [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2308.64s)]
*  pilots or the intel folks that teed this whole thing up. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2313.56s)]
*  Who cares who the one person is, doesn't matter. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2318.2799999999997s)]
*  I wonder in writing this book whether you're worried that some of your fellow SEALs will [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2320.96s)]
*  be angry with you. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2325.32s)]
*  I've had nothing but an outpouring of support from the guys who know me. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2327.0s)]
*  To quote one of my friends, he said, hey, if anybody can tell this story and do it right, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2330.2s)]
*  it's you and I'm not taking that, I'm trying to toot my own horn. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2333.88s)]
*  They know I'm doing it right. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2336.68s)]
*  You say in the preface to the book that if a reader is looking for secrets, this isn't [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2337.86s)]
*  their book. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2343.46s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2344.46s)]
*  I'm not talking secrets. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2345.46s)]
*  I'm not talking tactics. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2347.26s)]
*  I don't even get into any of that stuff, but I really try and give the reader a sense of [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2348.66s)]
*  of what it's like to be to be there. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2352.9s)]
*  Publicly, the Pentagon is not happy about no easy day. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2355.98s)]
*  They have a differing account of Bin Laden's final minutes, saying that he was first shot [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2359.78s)]
*  when the SEALs were inside his bedroom. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2364.42s)]
*  This book. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2367.5s)]
*  Spokesman George Little said last week that Owen signed a secrecy agreement as a SEAL [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2368.5s)]
*  and should have submitted his book for editing by the government. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2373.74s)]
*  And the author is a material breach of his secrecy agreements with the United States [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2377.34s)]
*  government. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2380.62s)]
*  We believe that sensitive and classified information is contained in the book. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2381.62s)]
*  I don't think I could be any clearer than that. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2386.34s)]
*  But Owen insists there is nothing in the book that compromises the secrets of the United [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2388.62s)]
*  States or the safety of the SEALs. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2393.18s)]
*  And there was one more thing that he wanted to say. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2396.3s)]
*  The release of the book was timed to the anniversary of 9-11. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2399.1200000000003s)]
*  My worry from the beginning is, you know, it's a political season. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2403.98s)]
*  This book is not political whatsoever. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2407.5s)]
*  It doesn't badmouth either party. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2409.9s)]
*  And we specifically chose September 11th to keep it out of the politics. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2414.46s)]
*  You know, if these crazies on either side of the aisle want to make it political, shame [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2419.98s)]
*  on them. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2425.38s)]
*  The Bin Laden raid was Mark Owen's last. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2427.02s)]
*  A few months later, he went to New York and saw ground zero for the first time. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2430.02s)]
*  Our team played a small little piece. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2436.82s)]
*  Some people would argue bigger, but, you know, to us, it's very, we were just doing our job. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2439.1200000000003s)]
*  It's not a big deal. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2442.9s)]
*  We were just lucky to be at the right place at the right time. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2443.9s)]
*  But then going to New York and where the World Trade Center stood at one point, and it was, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2446.1800000000003s)]
*  it just very, very emotional. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2451.9s)]
*  Nearly 3,000 people were killed right there alone. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2454.62s)]
*  It was emotional and it was like, you know what, I'm ready to move on, full circle. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2456.82s)]
*  Your team had avenged those deaths. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2464.82s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2467.82s)]
*  When word of the book No Easy Day came out last month, a cable news channel learned Mark [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2471.06s)]
*  Owen's real name and reported it. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2476.54s)]
*  Since then, others have reported his name. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2479.7400000000002s)]
*  We will not. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2482.14s)]
*  Owen intends to donate most of the profits from the book to charities that support families [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2484.6600000000003s)]
*  of fallen troops. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2488.38s)]
*  He wanted us to know that he thinks of what he's written as a public service to get the [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2490.06s)]
*  history straight and as a tribute to every Navy SEAL wherever they may be serving tonight. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw0OEDiHTE&t=2494.82s)]
