# Stories About Architecture and Architects | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [October 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0)
*  If you're yearning for something that rises above the dysfunctional politics of Washington, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=0.0s)]
*  we have just the thing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=18.92s)]
*  288 feet above, in fact. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=20.6s)]
*  Tomorrow marks the 150th anniversary of the completion of the Capitol Dome. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=23.48s)]
*  It's hard to imagine America without this crowning achievement, but when you hear the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=29.74s)]
*  story of how it was created, it becomes hard to imagine that our dome exists at all. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=34.22s)]
*  We were given amazing access for this story, and you're about to see the dome like you've [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=39.86s)]
*  never seen it before. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=45.66s)]
*  George Washington knew what he wanted, a building so grand that no one could ever move the Capitol [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=50.62s)]
*  from his city. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=56.94s)]
*  He'd still find it on Jenkins Hill, where he laid the cornerstone. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=58.46s)]
*  And he might admire the dome, which was built later, for what it overcame. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=62.620000000000005s)]
*  Built by men who despised each other, topped by a statue of freedom cast by a slave, through [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=68.14s)]
*  war and rivalry the dome kept rising. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=74.6s)]
*  And that's American character that runs deep below the skin. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=78.54s)]
*  This is when we go from that beautifully, richly decorated Capitol to the battleship [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=84.14s)]
*  gray industrial part of the Capitol building. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=89.18s)]
*  Stephen Ayers holds the title architect of the Capitol. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=93.38s)]
*  He takes care of the dome and everything below. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=96.98s)]
*  This is all original. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=100.34s)]
*  It's all 150 years old. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=101.34s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=102.82s)]
*  All of this was designed by Ayers' predecessor, Thomas Walter, who proposed a dome no one [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=103.98s)]
*  had asked for. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=110.34s)]
*  This is the Capitol that George Washington knew, and it's still the center of the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=112.1s)]
*  Capitol building today. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=116.66s)]
*  Walter won a competition to expand the House and Senate sides to hold all of the politicians [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=118.53999999999999s)]
*  coming in from the new states. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=124.83999999999999s)]
*  But then, Walter thought the original dome looked too small, so he drew another. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=127.3s)]
*  He posted it on the wall in his office. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=133.66s)]
*  And members of Congress would often come by and see that, and it just stuck immediately. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=136.82s)]
*  Didn't even have a cost estimate, didn't know how they were going to construct it, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=142.78s)]
*  how they were going to build it, how they were going to design it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=146.9s)]
*  Yet, it was so beautiful and so wonderful, everyone just knew immediately that they had [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=149.66s)]
*  to do it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=155.34s)]
*  Walter drafted it after the great marble domes he'd seen in Europe, only to discover that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=156.9s)]
*  the building couldn't support the weight. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=162.1s)]
*  So he conjured an illusion. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=165.14s)]
*  Everything, every column, every ornament, is cast iron, painted to look like stone. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=167.26s)]
*  The weight was cut in half. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=173.85999999999999s)]
*  This is from 1863, and you can see it's signed by Thomas Eustace Walter. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=175.98s)]
*  His drawing in the archive reveals there are two domes, an inner dome with a ceiling painted [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  with an apotheosis of George Washington ascending into heaven, and the outer dome ascending [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=187.39999999999998s)]
*  into the sky. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=194.52s)]
*  We are climbing atop this inner dome, the apotheosis of Washington fresco by Constantino [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=195.98000000000002s)]
*  Bramidi. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  That's right below us. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=205.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=206.5s)]
*  We're on top of that now. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=207.5s)]
*  That's exactly right, and this is the level that we go outside. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=208.5s)]
*  This is the top. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=212.10000000000002s)]
*  This is the top. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=213.10000000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=218.10000000000002s)]
*  What a beautiful view. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=222.5s)]
*  It's about 30 stories, and because D.C. outlawed skyscrapers back in 1910, you can see forever. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=225.84s)]
*  For the record, the Washington Monument, still being refurbished, is nearly twice as tall. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=233.66s)]
*  So there's the National Mall. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=239.6s)]
*  They're taking the scaffolding down off the Washington Monument. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=240.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=243.6s)]
*  You can see the Potomac River and Anacostia Rivers coming together. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=244.6s)]
*  Stephen, what did it mean to have this dome completed very near the end of the Civil War? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=248.54s)]
*  To me, it's a measure of our endurance, of our will to succeed, and our will to get it [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=255.45999999999998s)]
*  done and our will to stay together as a country. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=261.38s)]
*  It took enormous will. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=265.28s)]
*  In Congress, the first vote on the dome passed 71 to 70. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=266.88s)]
*  A critic called it a great mistake. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=271.34s)]
*  And then came the Civil War. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=274.5s)]
*  Not the war you're expecting. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=276.53999999999996s)]
*  This was the war between the greats, the brilliant architect versus the genius in charge of construction, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=278.28s)]
*  Army Captain Montgomery Meggs. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=285.21999999999997s)]
*  He was incredibly honest, very efficient. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=287.7s)]
*  Bill Allen was the historian in the Office of the Architect who told us that despite [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=291.5s)]
*  Meggs' virtues, he was obsessed with winning fame. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=296.21999999999997s)]
*  And the way that he chose to do this was to put his name. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=301.17999999999995s)]
*  Every place that it occurred to him where it could go. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=306.2s)]
*  It went on the bricks of the D.C. Aqueduct and on its stairs. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=309.44s)]
*  M.C. Meggs even etched his name on copper plates and laid them between the stones of the Capitol. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=314.32s)]
*  In case of two, three thousand years later, the Capitol became an archeological site, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  the archeologists would discover these plates and know exactly who built the Capitol Extension. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=327.44s)]
*  But the last straw came when Meggs claimed authorship of the dome, signing his name to Walter's drawings. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=334.84s)]
*  The two men stopped talking and raised their pens like swords. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=341.82s)]
*  The letters are well worth reading. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=346.17999999999995s)]
*  They are amazing. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=348.97999999999996s)]
*  We found them in the archive. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=351.02s)]
*  Meggs, you're welcome to assume the authorship of the Pyramids of Egypt. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=352.78s)]
*  You have no right to the new dome. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=357.44s)]
*  Walter, if I'm not the architect of the new dome, I'd like to know who is. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=359.9s)]
*  I shall be glad never to receive another line from you. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=364.18s)]
*  Meggs, I have the honor to inform you that your services are dispensed with. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=368.08s)]
*  He fired him. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=374.32s)]
*  He tried to. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=375.82s)]
*  Walter very calmly writes back and says, I would like to remind you that my appointment is at the pleasure of the President of the United States. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=377.04s)]
*  The work slowed, but planning continued, including a debate about what to put on top. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=386.04s)]
*  They decided that they would have a statue that would speak of freedom. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=391.62s)]
*  Historian Lonnie Bunch researched the project for Congress. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=395.54s)]
*  And they went to a young American in Rome who was studying, and he came up with this idea to create a statue that had the look of America. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=399.74s)]
*  Describe her to me in your mind's eye. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=410.18s)]
*  Well, she is this beautiful woman who has some Native American features, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=413.35999999999996s)]
*  is capped by this beautiful headdress as a reminder that this is a country that was different because it was built first and foremost around the issue of freedom. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  And one of the men instrumental in casting the statue was a slave named Philip Reed. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=430.52s)]
*  Philip Reed was an enslaved man who was owned by someone who owned a foundry here in Washington. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=436.34s)]
*  And that when the statue initially plaster came back to the United States, there was a concern about how do you take it apart? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=443.34s)]
*  Philip was really one of the people who knew how to do this. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=452.38s)]
*  He came up with the idea of how to separate the model, how to then cast the model. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=455.21999999999997s)]
*  He led the people who were making the cast of the bronze statue. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=460.46s)]
*  But freedom would be grounded in 1861 when the real civil war began. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  Montgomery Meigs left to become quartermaster general, supplying the army with all that it needed for victory. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=471.44s)]
*  But all the money for construction was diverted to the war. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=478.64000000000004s)]
*  One of my favorite stories that I'd love to tell my friends is that Lincoln ordered the dome to continue as a symbol that the nation would continue. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=482.40000000000003s)]
*  And that story turns out to be false. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  Matt Wozniowski, a historian for the House, told us it was the contractor, James Fowler Kirtland of New York, that resumed work without pay. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=495.26s)]
*  They'd delivered 1.3 million pounds of cast iron and didn't want to see it rust away. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=506.26s)]
*  Lincoln didn't mind. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=511.76s)]
*  He has the famous line that if the people see the capital going on, it will be a sign that we intend the union shall go on. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=513.86s)]
*  This is the Rotunda. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=521.86s)]
*  You're walking between statues of Washington and Jefferson. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=524.4399999999999s)]
*  It's just off this room that you find the office of the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, who administers a lot of what he calls the campus. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=528.4399999999999s)]
*  You ever not look up? Do you ever take this for granted? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=537.4399999999999s)]
*  Never. Listen, for a guy who grew up mopping floors in my dad's bar, it's a pretty humbling experience. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  You've come up in the world, just a little. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=551.74s)]
*  We went up in the world from the floor of George Washington's original capital to the heights of the inner dome. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=553.74s)]
*  Told you it'd be beautiful up here. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=560.74s)]
*  This is the Apotheosis of Washington by Constantino Brumidi. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=562.74s)]
*  I understand that somewhere in here the artist painted the face of the architect who designed the dome. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=567.74s)]
*  It's right over here. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=577.04s)]
*  Thomas Walter is the one in the long white beard. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=578.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=582.04s)]
*  The scenes depict American hard work and ingenuity, and 180 feet below, 21st century citizens look up at Washington rising at the center of the city, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=583.04s)]
*  laid down by he and urban planner Pierre Laenfont. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=593.04s)]
*  Look how Laenfont laid out this city with these radiating streets, Maryland and Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=598.04s)]
*  The capital right in the center. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=605.3399999999999s)]
*  Right in the middle. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=606.3399999999999s)]
*  And everything proceeds from here. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=607.3399999999999s)]
*  And you put the capital atop this hill, and that's how you create this iconic symbolism. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=609.3399999999999s)]
*  It was a symbol for the whole nation that the Union would endure. Now your job is to make the dome endure. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=615.3399999999999s)]
*  Up here you can see what is hidden from a distance. The dome is falling apart. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=622.3399999999999s)]
*  Your guys bring in pieces into the office and say, hey boss, here's what I found. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=629.64s)]
*  You can see the level of rust behind it that is just eating away at the cast iron. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=634.64s)]
*  Even worse, there are more than 1300 serious cracks in the dome. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=640.64s)]
*  Architect Stephen Ayers is starting a massive repair project. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=645.64s)]
*  He showed us how they'll cover the dome with scaffolding for the next two years, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=649.64s)]
*  replace the rusted parts and stitch the cracks together with metal sutures. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=654.9399999999999s)]
*  Minority leader Nancy Pelosi helped Congress put up nearly 60 million for the work. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=659.9399999999999s)]
*  A lot of people think that you guys can't agree about anything. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=665.9399999999999s)]
*  And yet everybody came around the idea of refurbishing the dome. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=668.9399999999999s)]
*  This capital belongs to the American people. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=673.9399999999999s)]
*  It is this place for them to visit as the most identifiable symbol of democracy that there is. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=676.9399999999999s)]
*  On December 2nd, 1863, the dome was topped with the Statue of Freedom. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=684.24s)]
*  And below, Congress had been working on Freedom II. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=690.24s)]
*  It had passed an Emancipation Act for the District of Columbia. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=693.24s)]
*  When Philip Reed helped cast the Statue of Freedom, he was a slave. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=698.24s)]
*  By the time it's placed on top of the dome, he's a free man. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=703.24s)]
*  He is free. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=708.24s)]
*  What happens to him is that he symbolizes so many of the enslaved African Americans [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=709.54s)]
*  who looked at that dome and saw it as a place of possibility, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=714.54s)]
*  saw it as a place that said, here is the freedom that we deserve. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=719.54s)]
*  The titanic struggle that crowned the capital is largely forgotten now. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=724.54s)]
*  The house will be in order. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=729.54s)]
*  But next time you look on political gridlock and wonder whether anything can get done, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=732.54s)]
*  remember how much can rise above the fractured politics of Washington. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=737.8399999999999s)]
*  The motion is adopted. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=742.8399999999999s)]
*  Almost exactly four years ago, the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris caught fire. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=756.8399999999999s)]
*  It was one of those 21st century moments that people around the world experienced together, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=762.14s)]
*  staring in horror at live video on their smartphones and televisions. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=767.14s)]
*  For the people of France, it was especially traumatic, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=772.14s)]
*  because Notre Dame has been a powerful symbol, both sacred and secular, since medieval times. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=776.14s)]
*  French President Emmanuel Macron pledged that Notre Dame would be reopened by the end of 2024. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=782.14s)]
*  He couldn't have known then how hard it would be to keep that promise. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=789.4399999999999s)]
*  But on this Easter Sunday, four years later, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=794.4399999999999s)]
*  the resurrection of the great cathedral seems within reach. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=797.4399999999999s)]
*  Flames tore through the roof of Notre Dame on the evening of April 15, 2019, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=805.4399999999999s)]
*  and spread with incredible speed and ferocity engulfing her 200-foot spire. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=810.74s)]
*  Jean-Louis Jurgeland is the man now in charge of restoring Notre Dame. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=819.74s)]
*  And a lot of people in France cry, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=826.74s)]
*  because they feel that something very deep in the soul of France, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=831.74s)]
*  in the spirit of France, was about to collapse. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=837.04s)]
*  Only a heroic effort by the Paris Fire Brigade saved Notre Dame from collapse, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=843.04s)]
*  as a few staffers raced through falling embers to rescue precious relics. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=848.04s)]
*  Philippe Villeneuve, the cathedral's chief architect, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=855.04s)]
*  was out of town that night and raced back to Paris. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=858.04s)]
*  He was devastated by what he saw. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=861.04s)]
*  I've said that the little boy who was in love with the cathedral [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=864.3399999999999s)]
*  and the architect who was in charge of it died that day. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=869.3399999999999s)]
*  And another man took over and said, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=873.3399999999999s)]
*  I have to save the cathedral. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=875.3399999999999s)]
*  It's my mission. It's my duty. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=878.3399999999999s)]
*  Villeneuve now shares that duty. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=881.3399999999999s)]
*  If he's the artist who knows every inch of stone in Notre Dame, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=883.3399999999999s)]
*  retired army general Jurgeland is the commander, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=888.3399999999999s)]
*  called back to meet that five-year deadline. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=891.64s)]
*  I will relax only when this will be done. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=894.64s)]
*  What does this cathedral mean to the people of France? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=898.64s)]
*  The cathedral, Notre Dame de Paris, is in some way the heart of France. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=902.64s)]
*  For the Catholic, of course, for the Christian, but for everybody. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=907.64s)]
*  All the great events of France in some way or another took place here in the cathedral. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=911.64s)]
*  Napoleon crowned himself emperor in Notre Dame in 1804. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=917.9399999999999s)]
*  In 1944, as Paris was liberated from Nazi occupation, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=922.9399999999999s)]
*  General Charles de Gaulle braved sniper fire to enter the cathedral. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=927.9399999999999s)]
*  In many ways you could say that she's the people's palace. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=934.9399999999999s)]
*  Agnès Poirier is a journalist and author [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=938.9399999999999s)]
*  who lives and works just across the river Seine from Notre Dame. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=941.9399999999999s)]
*  She and her neighbors watched the most horrifying moment the night of the fire, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=946.24s)]
*  the collapse of that imposing spire. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=950.24s)]
*  I remember the scream of the crowd saying no, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=957.24s)]
*  as if they couldn't conceive such a thing. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=960.24s)]
*  That spire meant so much to Philippe Villeneuve [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=965.24s)]
*  that he had it tattooed on his arm. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=969.24s)]
*  They say that I have Notre Dame in my skin, he told us. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=972.54s)]
*  It's very practical because when I have to explain how the spire fell, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=976.54s)]
*  it's always better to show that from here to there it tipped over. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=981.54s)]
*  The huge spire made of oak and covered in lead tiles [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=986.54s)]
*  crashed through two of the stone vaults which formed the ceiling of Notre Dame, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=991.54s)]
*  leaving gaping holes at the top and heaps of broken stones. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=996.54s)]
*  The second element was the kind of stool. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1001.8399999999999s)]
*  The top priority was to shore up the Grand Cathedral's weakened structure. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1004.8399999999999s)]
*  Huge temporary wooden supports were placed under the surviving stone vaults [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1010.8399999999999s)]
*  of her ceiling and under the flying buttresses [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1015.8399999999999s)]
*  to save this prime example of medieval engineering. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1018.8399999999999s)]
*  We have to check every stone in the cathedral, every pillar. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1022.8399999999999s)]
*  At the same time a huge decontamination of the cathedral [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1026.84s)]
*  project was mounted to remove lead tiles that had melted from the burning roof and spire [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1031.1399999999999s)]
*  and all the toxic lead dust spread by the fire. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1037.1399999999999s)]
*  Four years on, workers still take extraordinary precautions against lead poisoning. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1041.1399999999999s)]
*  We had to wear disposable hazmat suits to enter the cathedral. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1047.1399999999999s)]
*  Tons of rubble had to be removed. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1051.1399999999999s)]
*  Paintings and stained glass windows were taken away for restoration. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1054.1399999999999s)]
*  And twisted steel scaffolding erected for ongoing restoration work had to be dismantled. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1058.44s)]
*  So you were in the process of restoring the spire when the fire broke out in 2019. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1065.44s)]
*  Did your restoration project have anything to do with the fire breaking out? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1071.44s)]
*  An investigation is still underway, Philippe Villeneuve told us, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1080.44s)]
*  and no cause of the fire has been identified. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1084.44s)]
*  But personally, it's unbearable. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1087.74s)]
*  This fire never should have happened, and it did. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1090.74s)]
*  Inevitably, I feel responsible. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1093.74s)]
*  At that point in our interview, Villeneuve switched to English with a rueful smile. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1097.74s)]
*  In reality, I'm totally destroyed. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1103.74s)]
*  Really? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1110.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1111.74s)]
*  I so want to rebuild Notre Dame, it's because I want to rebuild myself. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1113.04s)]
*  The fire's deeply emotional impact on Philippe Villeneuve was mirrored around the world. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1119.04s)]
*  Nearly a billion dollars in private donations have been pledged to rebuild Notre Dame, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1128.04s)]
*  most of it from France, 50 million dollars from Americans. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1133.04s)]
*  I know many people in the United States contributed. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1138.04s)]
*  They can't contribute again. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1141.34s)]
*  They can continue to contribute. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1142.34s)]
*  The cash is always running, if I want, give me money, I need. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1144.34s)]
*  In the weeks immediately following the fire, all sorts of ideas were floated [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1148.34s)]
*  for how centuries-old Notre Dame might be given a touch of avant-garde. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1153.34s)]
*  And all those architects throughout the world said, yes, let's have a roof garden, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1159.34s)]
*  let's have a golden torch, let's have a titanium spire. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1163.34s)]
*  Even I, for 20 seconds, I thought, hmm, to add some 21st century genius to Notre Dame, why not? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1168.6399999999999s)]
*  Chief architect Philippe Villeneuve had a very simple answer, why not? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1177.6399999999999s)]
*  An historic monument, a cathedral, is not something to be played with, he told us. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1185.6399999999999s)]
*  Notre Dame had been standing for 850 years with a wooden frame and a lead roof. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1190.6399999999999s)]
*  So wood is the way to go. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1196.94s)]
*  In the end, President Macron and a special committee agreed to rebuild Notre Dame [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1199.94s)]
*  exactly as she had been, and with the same materials, stone, wood and lead. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1205.94s)]
*  How is it that the traditionalists won out? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1212.94s)]
*  Well, I think wisdom won. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1216.94s)]
*  Notre Dame's signature spire was a fairly recent addition. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1220.94s)]
*  Images of the cathedral from the mid-1800s show her without a spire and in an advanced state of decay. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1225.24s)]
*  The cathedral was in great disrepair, was it not? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1232.24s)]
*  It was about to collapse, but of neglect, not of fire. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1236.24s)]
*  There were even proposals to demolish Notre Dame before the cathedral crumbled on its own. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1241.24s)]
*  Instead, the French government hired a young architect named Violette Le Duc. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1246.24s)]
*  He created that famous spire. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1251.24s)]
*  So you are rebuilding the spire exactly as Violette Le Duc? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1254.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1258.54s)]
*  Are you using his original drawings? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1259.54s)]
*  We were lucky, he said, because it was extremely well documented. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1263.54s)]
*  We have the drawings of Violette Le Duc, the sketches, the surveys. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1267.54s)]
*  We have everything needed to be able to remake it. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1271.54s)]
*  A thousand French oak trees were felled for the new spire, then fine-cut by carpenters in eastern France. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1275.84s)]
*  In other workshops around the country, the cathedral's organ, the largest in France, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1281.84s)]
*  and many of its stained glass windows were restored. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1287.84s)]
*  How many workers and craftsmen do you have on this project? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1291.84s)]
*  If we take into account all the people in France, it's about one thousand people. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1294.84s)]
*  How long have you been here? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1300.84s)]
*  About one thousand people. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1303.1399999999999s)]
*  Allons-y. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1305.1399999999999s)]
*  On the plaza in front of Notre Dame, a huge tent has been erected, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1306.1399999999999s)]
*  where stonecutters and sculptors are recreating Gothic gargoyles and adornments damaged in the fire. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1311.1399999999999s)]
*  Philippe Villeneuve supervises every detail. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1319.1399999999999s)]
*  I'll make them put their fingers on the layers of the original sculpture, he said, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1326.1399999999999s)]
*  and then on the layer they're sculpting. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1331.44s)]
*  So he wants you to feel it, not just look at it. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1334.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1338.44s)]
*  And that works? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1339.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think so too. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1340.44s)]
*  Dane LeBlanc is just 23 years old, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1342.44s)]
*  sculpting and chiseling to recreate a floral detail carved hundreds of years ago. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1346.44s)]
*  We try to remake things identically, she said, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1352.44s)]
*  but we are also trying to understand the intention of the original sculptors, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1356.74s)]
*  so we look at the traces left by their tools. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1361.74s)]
*  We were given rare access to the painstaking restoration of Notre Dame [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1367.74s)]
*  as workers and artisans revived the cathedral's exterior [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1372.74s)]
*  and the towers of the cathedral. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1376.74s)]
*  and her interior. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1378.74s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1380.74s)]
*  The cathedral's great rose windows have been meticulously cleaned. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1382.04s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1387.04s)]
*  And every inch of stone coated with latex, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1390.04s)]
*  which, when peeled away, leaves the surface gleaming. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1393.04s)]
*  We found restorers, Mathilde Meire and Aude Massimi, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1399.04s)]
*  working on painted stone sculptures, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1403.04s)]
*  depicting scenes from the life of Christ. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1405.04s)]
*  How old is this? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1408.04s)]
*  This part of the cathedral, she said, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1412.04s)]
*  was built at the beginning of the 14th century. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1415.04s)]
*  These sculptures are medieval. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1418.04s)]
*  The restorers are carefully wiping every surface [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1421.04s)]
*  with small cotton swabs dipped in a water-based cleaning solution. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1425.04s)]
*  So I think you have to have a lot of patience. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1429.04s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1433.04s)]
*  Yes, she says, you have to be calm and know that it will take time, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1435.04s)]
*  but it's a pleasure. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1440.34s)]
*  You can see she's wiping away the sentries. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1442.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1445.34s)]
*  A 600-ton maze of scaffolding has been built inside Notre Dame [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1446.34s)]
*  to support all the work, especially the rebuilding of the spire. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1451.34s)]
*  General George Land took us up through it, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1455.34s)]
*  two-thirds of the way on a construction elevator. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1458.34s)]
*  We reached the top climbing steps and ladders. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1463.34s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1467.34s)]
*  We were standing 100 feet above the cathedral floor, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1469.6399999999999s)]
*  in exactly the spot where the flaming spire collapsed. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1473.6399999999999s)]
*  Four years ago, there was nothing here but a vast hole. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1477.6399999999999s)]
*  The drama took place here, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1481.6399999999999s)]
*  and we have to rebuild the vault of the transept. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1483.6399999999999s)]
*  The spire will be there, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1486.6399999999999s)]
*  66 meters high. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1488.6399999999999s)]
*  At the top of the old 200-foot spire [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1491.6399999999999s)]
*  sat a copper sculpture of a rooster, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1494.6399999999999s)]
*  the symbol of the French people. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1496.6399999999999s)]
*  The day after the fire, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1498.94s)]
*  Philippe Villeneuve found it on a lower roof, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1500.94s)]
*  a bit mangled but miraculously untouched by the flames. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1503.94s)]
*  It has been left as it was found [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1507.94s)]
*  and will be put on display in the restored cathedral. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1509.94s)]
*  Can I tell you, Villeneuve says, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1514.94s)]
*  that I plan to put a new rooster [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1516.94s)]
*  on top of a new spire one year to the day [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1518.94s)]
*  before the reopening of the cathedral? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1521.94s)]
*  There will still be scaffolding, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1524.94s)]
*  and the frame of the spire will again be in the sky of Paris. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1526.94s)]
*  And the spire will rest reposé. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1530.94s)]
*  Rest? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1535.94s)]
*  Rest on these four pillars you see here. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1536.94s)]
*  You see? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1539.94s)]
*  It will be magnificent. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1540.94s)]
*  Magnificent, yes. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1542.94s)]
*  For the glory of God and France. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1543.94s)]
*  We Americans spend 90% of our time inside of buildings, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1546.94s)]
*  yet most of us give little thought to the role [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1550.94s)]
*  architecture plays in our lives and our health. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1553.94s)]
*  Tonight we bring you a story about a group of award-winning young architects [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1556.94s)]
*  who have set out to create a new model of architecture. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1561.94s)]
*  Not a particular style of building, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1565.94s)]
*  but a style that is a way of building a new architecture. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1568.94s)]
*  Not a particular style of building, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1572.94s)]
*  but a way of thinking about how to build, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1575.94s)]
*  who should build, using what, and for whom. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1577.94s)]
*  Their non-profit firm based in Boston is called MASS, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1581.94s)]
*  short for Model of Architecture Serving Society. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1586.94s)]
*  And they were inspired early on by the work of Dr. Paul Farmer, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1590.94s)]
*  who passed away unexpectedly just months after our story first aired last fall. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1595.94s)]
*  Though trained at Harvard, MASS' founders say they learned [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1601.94s)]
*  the most important lessons of architecture [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1605.94s)]
*  during time they spent in, of all places, Rwanda. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1608.94s)]
*  Rwanda is a country many people know for one thing, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1615.94s)]
*  the 1994 genocide that killed more than 800,000 people. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1619.94s)]
*  Today, Rwanda is at peace, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1625.94s)]
*  a bustling nation of 13 million working hard to lift its population out of poverty. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1628.94s)]
*  There are construction projects all around the country, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1635.94s)]
*  several of them being designed by MASS. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1638.94s)]
*  Though started by Americans, the head of its team in Kigali today [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1642.94s)]
*  is Rwandan architect Christian Benimana. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1647.94s)]
*  I heard that when MASS started, there was no word for architect in your language. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1650.94s)]
*  And there is still no word for architect. You have an expression. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1656.94s)]
*  Umuhanga, umuguhanga, inuboko. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1659.94s)]
*  Meaning? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1663.94s)]
*  Expert in the creation of buildings. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1664.94s)]
*  Benimana told us he dreamed of creating buildings even as a little boy. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1668.94s)]
*  But with no school of architecture in post-genocide Rwanda, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1673.94s)]
*  he had to study in China, in Mandarin. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1677.94s)]
*  Michael Murphy, MASS's executive director, had a very different path to architecture. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1682.94s)]
*  I studied English literature. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1687.94s)]
*  Well, that's going to get you foreign architecture. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1689.94s)]
*  Murphy's life took a sharp turn after college [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1692.94s)]
*  when his father was diagnosed with cancer given just a few weeks to live. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1696.94s)]
*  Murphy rushed back to Poughkeepsie, New York, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1701.94s)]
*  to their old home that his dad had spent weekends restoring. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1704.94s)]
*  I said, what can I do while I wait here on death watch? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1709.94s)]
*  And so I started working on the house. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1711.94s)]
*  And after three weeks, he was still alive. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1713.94s)]
*  Six weeks, we started working together. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1716.94s)]
*  After a year and a half, I fully restored the building. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1718.94s)]
*  He was fully in remission. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1721.94s)]
*  And he said, you know, working on this house with you, it saved my life. It healed me. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1723.94s)]
*  Whoa. Wow. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1727.94s)]
*  And then I said, well, I have to be an architect now. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1729.94s)]
*  When he came in wearing these silver cowboy boots. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1732.94s)]
*  Alan Ricks and Murphy became fast friends [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1737.94s)]
*  as first year students at Harvard's Graduate School of Design. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1740.94s)]
*  But as they dove in, both found something wanting in the curriculum. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1744.94s)]
*  We were learning about the heroism of architecture, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1749.94s)]
*  the beautiful sculptures, the names of the famous architects. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1753.94s)]
*  But not so much about how architecture could help people and communities. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1756.94s)]
*  During first semester, Murphy went to a talk by one of his idols, Dr. Paul Farmer, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1761.94s)]
*  who had founded the nonprofit Partners in Health [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1767.94s)]
*  to provide medical care for the neediest populations around the world. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1770.94s)]
*  He said, we're building hospitals, we're building clinics, we're building schools. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1775.94s)]
*  And so when I went up to him afterwards to ask, you know, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1778.94s)]
*  who are the architects that you're working with? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1781.94s)]
*  He said, you know, architects have never asked us [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1783.94s)]
*  how they could be of service to what we're doing. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1785.94s)]
*  So we often have to do it ourselves. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1787.94s)]
*  Why weren't architects attracted to working with you? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1790.94s)]
*  I mean, a lot of them care about the poor. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1794.94s)]
*  They certainly do. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1796.94s)]
*  But the way the incentive structure is set up is, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1797.94s)]
*  hey, you give us money, we'll design something for you. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1799.94s)]
*  So when Murphy offered to volunteer on a Partners in Health project in Rwanda [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1802.94s)]
*  the following summer of 2007, Dr. Farmer said, bring it on. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1807.94s)]
*  We gave him some very humble projects. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1812.94s)]
*  You're smiling. It must be pretty good. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1814.94s)]
*  He asked me if I would design a little laundry building. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1817.94s)]
*  A laundry building? Well, how did the laundry look? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1820.94s)]
*  It looked pretty good. It still looks good. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1824.94s)]
*  So good he called Michael Murphy a few months later [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1826.94s)]
*  and asked if he could help design a brand new hospital [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1829.94s)]
*  for a remote district of 350,000 that didn't even have a doctor. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1832.94s)]
*  You're still a student. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1838.94s)]
*  Still a student. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1839.94s)]
*  So I looked around my classmates, said this crazy call came in. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1840.94s)]
*  Can anyone help me? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1844.94s)]
*  You said yes right away without hesitation. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1845.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, who wouldn't? What an opportunity. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1848.94s)]
*  But when Dr. Farmer said their first design looked like an army barracks, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1851.94s)]
*  Murphy decided to take a year off and move to the site called Butaro [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1855.94s)]
*  where Farmer gave him three challenges he says have defined Mass's work to this day. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1860.94s)]
*  The hospital should be beautiful, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1866.94s)]
*  building it should help as many local people as possible, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1868.94s)]
*  and it should have natural airflow to prevent the spread of diseases like tuberculosis [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1872.94s)]
*  that often ran rampant in enclosed wards and waiting rooms. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1878.94s)]
*  Let me show you this image. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1883.94s)]
*  Murphy showed us the design they came up with to move fresh air naturally through each ward. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1884.94s)]
*  That's simple physics where air moves from the lower to higher area. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1891.94s)]
*  Beds would go in the middle, giving every patient a beautiful view. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1895.94s)]
*  Beauty matters. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1900.94s)]
*  The spaces around us that are designed with beauty say that we matter as individuals. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1902.94s)]
*  If I were a doctor, wouldn't I say, I care about beauty, but I want a heart monitor first? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1907.94s)]
*  Why make this a choice between a heart monitor and beauty? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1913.94s)]
*  Surely we can have both. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1917.94s)]
*  What they couldn't have, heavy equipment like front end loaders that were too costly to get to the site. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1919.94s)]
*  And so we asked, could we dig it by hand? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1926.94s)]
*  And we dug the foundation by hand. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1928.94s)]
*  Employ more people, and shocker, we did it faster and cheaper than if we had the front end loader. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1931.94s)]
*  How many people actually worked on this project total? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1938.94s)]
*  Over 4,000 people worked on the project. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1942.94s)]
*  And instead of trucking in materials, they decided to use volcanic stone [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1944.94s)]
*  that farmers here consider a nuisance because they have to clear it from their fields. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1950.94s)]
*  You see the stone everywhere, but normally it's just piled up. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1955.94s)]
*  And we thought this would be a really valuable material in the U.S. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1959.94s)]
*  Could we use it in a different way? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1964.94s)]
*  They designed the whole hospital facade with it, hiring dozens of local masons and spawning a new industry. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1966.94s)]
*  This woman, who trained at Butaro, is now a forewoman with a team of masons she trains. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1975.94s)]
*  In the amount of hours they spent doing this. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1982.94s)]
*  Christian Benimana, back from Shanghai, was impressed by the thought given to the process of building [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1985.94s)]
*  and by giving so many people work, improving the local economy. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1991.94s)]
*  It is critical for us to have prospect for a better future. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=1995.94s)]
*  And give people pride in Rwanda. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2000.94s)]
*  That's very important to me because it makes me proud as well. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2004.94s)]
*  He joined the team and helped design housing for doctors at the hospital. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2008.94s)]
*  Very quickly we had a lot of work because there weren't many other people doing this. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2013.94s)]
*  They decided to become a nonprofit architecture firm to work on projects that otherwise couldn't afford high-priced designs. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2018.94s)]
*  They've built a maternity care center in Malawi, a cholera hospital in Haiti, schools. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2027.94s)]
*  All with the same principles of airflow, beauty and creating jobs. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2034.94s)]
*  A decade later they have a staff of over 200, more than half of them, Rwandan. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2039.94s)]
*  This tree is even more beautiful close up. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2045.94s)]
*  We visited Butaro Hospital last summer. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2048.94s)]
*  Its central courtyard felt part medical center, part public gardens. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2051.94s)]
*  And its covered outdoor waiting room and hallways, in this time of COVID, felt prescient. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2056.94s)]
*  This entire hospital is designed around that simple idea that airflow, air movement, are the basic premise that we should design our buildings around, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2063.94s)]
*  and in particular our hospitals, so that patients don't transmit airborne diseases to each other. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2071.94s)]
*  Four hours to the south we went to see Mass's largest project yet, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2077.94s)]
*  a 69 building campus for a brand new College of Agriculture funded by American philanthropist Howard Buffett. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2082.94s)]
*  This space is really, we want to create a hub. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2091.94s)]
*  It's spectacular. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2094.94s)]
*  Where Mass is pushing its philosophy to the limit, as Alan Rick showed us, just about everything here, from the earthen walls, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2095.94s)]
*  the lines you see are the layers. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2104.94s)]
*  to the furniture, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2106.94s)]
*  the woven backrests of these chairs, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2107.94s)]
*  is being made locally. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2109.94s)]
*  Under Christian Benimana's leadership, Mass started a furniture division to collaborate with local artisans on creative designs, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2111.94s)]
*  instead of ordering from a catalog. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2120.94s)]
*  It's one thing to go to Dubai and Turkey and China and Europe and pick a chair from a showroom, put it on a flight and bring it here. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2123.94s)]
*  It's another thing to figure out a system that can create more opportunities for growth. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2131.94s)]
*  And if you're thinking Mass's model could never work in the U.S., [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2137.94s)]
*  Michael Murphy wasn't sure either until he was challenged by a community leader back home. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2141.94s)]
*  They said, you're doing all this work in Haiti and Rwanda, when are you going to come back to your hometown and work with us in Poughkeepsie? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2148.94s)]
*  We need a lot of help. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2153.94s)]
*  Poughkeepsie, like many once thriving industrial cities, has seen factories close. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2154.94s)]
*  Its downtown choked off by highways. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2162.94s)]
*  Its storefronts boarded up. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2165.94s)]
*  To top it off, its creek flooded during Hurricane Irene. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2167.94s)]
*  We had just been in one of the most rural places in the world, and we had seen a hospital change the economy. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2172.94s)]
*  I said, why can't we do that same thing here in Poughkeepsie? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2179.94s)]
*  So Mass opened a small office on Main Street and got to work. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2182.94s)]
*  Converting the city's old trolley barn into an art space and designing housing. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2188.94s)]
*  It's helping turn this old building into a food hall. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2194.94s)]
*  We're going to save this building. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2198.94s)]
*  And converting this long abandoned factory into a new headquarters for the environmental group Scenic Hudson. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2199.94s)]
*  If you look up, you can see that this whole opening was once a window. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2206.94s)]
*  That was a window? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2210.94s)]
*  That was all a window. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2212.94s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2213.94s)]
*  Murphy says old buildings like this were designed to let in fresh air. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2214.94s)]
*  But with the invention of air conditioning, big windows became a liability. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2219.94s)]
*  So we shrunk them and sealed our buildings airtight. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2224.94s)]
*  This is a sort of devil's bargain because it has made all of our buildings have really limited airflow. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2228.94s)]
*  And hence during COVID, we were all very vulnerable. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2235.94s)]
*  We saw it with the nursing homes. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2239.94s)]
*  And the prisons. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2241.94s)]
*  Do you think that COVID will change architecture for everybody? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2242.94s)]
*  Everyone around the world is going through a shift in their understanding of the buildings around us. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2247.94s)]
*  That they may make us sicker. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2253.94s)]
*  That they could make us healthier if they were better designed. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2255.94s)]
*  Mass's new design will reopen the windows. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2260.94s)]
*  And like a cutting edge version of the hospital in Rwanda, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2263.94s)]
*  use a solar powered system to heat and cool air at each window, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2267.94s)]
*  eliminating traditional air conditioning and heating entirely. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2272.94s)]
*  And they have a plan to transform that flooding creek that's become something of a garbage dump. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2277.94s)]
*  Some gutters, we get shopping carts. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2284.94s)]
*  What is that, an air conditioner? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2287.94s)]
*  Mass landscape architect Sierra Bainbridge came here with ideas about widening the creek to help with flooding. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2289.94s)]
*  But also, if you're taking a holistic view of the problem, then the solution also begins to be a holistic view. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2297.94s)]
*  Mass came up with designs to turn the blighted creek into beautiful park space that would run all through Poughkeepsie. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2306.94s)]
*  Each project has to not solve for that one thing. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2314.94s)]
*  We have to be thinking about how can we make design have the biggest possible impact. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2316.94s)]
*  It's a lesson Mass believes can apply in many American cities. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2320.94s)]
*  They have projects now in Cleveland, Birmingham, and Santa Fe. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2325.94s)]
*  And their gospel of architecture-serving society has reached inside that ivory tower whose teachings they once found lacking. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2330.94s)]
*  In 2021, Murphy taught lessons he learned in Rwanda back at Harvard. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2340.94s)]
*  There's some clear simplicity to it. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2345.94s)]
*  There's things we have to build. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2347.94s)]
*  There's people we have to hire. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2349.94s)]
*  There's materials we have to use. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2351.94s)]
*  And if you think about the whole thing as a design project, you can have a lot more impact. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2353.94s)]
*  In June, Mass was awarded the highest honor given by the American Institute of Architects, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2358.94s)]
*  its 2022 Architecture Firm Award. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2365.94s)]
*  At age 45, Chris Downey had pretty much constructed the life he'd always wanted. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2378.94s)]
*  An architect with a good job at a small housing firm outside San Francisco, he was happily married with a 10-year-old son. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2384.94s)]
*  He was an assistant little league coach, an avid cyclist, and then doctors discovered a tumor in his brain. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2392.94s)]
*  He had surgery and the tumor was safely gone, but Downey was left completely blind. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2401.94s)]
*  As we first reported in 2019, what he has done in the decades since losing his sight as a person and as an architect [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2409.94s)]
*  can only be described as a different kind of vision. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2418.94s)]
*  Several mornings a week as the sun rises over the Oakland Estuary in California, an amateur rowing team works the water. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2425.94s)]
*  It's hard to tell which one of them is blind, and Chris Downey thinks that's just fine. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2434.94s)]
*  It's really exciting to be in a sport where nobody looks in the direction they're going. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2441.94s)]
*  You face this way in the boat, you're going that way. So, even Stephen. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2446.94s)]
*  We were just talking about that whole exterior composition. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2452.94s)]
*  It's not exactly even Stephen in this design meeting where Downey is collaborating with sighted architects on a new hospital building. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2456.94s)]
*  But he hasn't let that stop him. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2464.94s)]
*  So, here you are in a profession that basically requires you to read designs and draw designs. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2468.94s)]
*  You must have thought in your head, that is insurmountable. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2476.94s)]
*  No. I never thought that. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2480.94s)]
*  You never thought the word insurmountable. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2482.94s)]
*  Lots of people, friends that were architects, and anybody else would say, oh my God, it's the worst thing imaginable, to be an architect and to lose your sight. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2484.94s)]
*  I can't imagine anything worse. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2492.94s)]
*  Downey came to realize that the creative process is an intellectual process. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2495.94s)]
*  It's how you think. So, it just needed new tools. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2499.94s)]
*  New tools? Downey found a printer that could emboss architectural drawings so that he could read and understand through touch. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2503.94s)]
*  They look like normal prints, normal drawings on the computer, but then they just come out in tactile form. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2513.94s)]
*  So, it is like Braille, isn't it? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2519.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2521.94s)]
*  And he came up with a way to sketch his ideas onto the plans using a simple children's toy, malleable wax sticks that he shapes to show his modifications to others. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2522.94s)]
*  And he says something surprising started to happen. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2534.94s)]
*  He could no longer see buildings and spaces, but he began hearing them. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2538.94s)]
*  The sounds, the textures, and the sound changes because there's a canopy overhead. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2544.94s)]
*  You can sense that we're under a canopy? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2549.94s)]
*  Yes. It's all a matter of how the sound works from the tip of the cane. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2551.94s)]
*  I was fascinated walking through buildings that I knew sighted, but I was experiencing them in a different way. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2555.94s)]
*  I was hearing the architecture. I was feeling the space. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2564.94s)]
*  It sounds as if you began almost enjoying, in a way, being the blind architect. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2568.94s)]
*  Sort of this excitement of, I'm a kid again. I'm relearning so much of architecture. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2575.94s)]
*  It wasn't about what I'm missing in architecture. It was about what I had been missing in architecture. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2582.94s)]
*  Is that sufficiently different? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2589.94s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2590.94s)]
*  Chris Downey's upbeat attitude doesn't mean that he didn't go through one of the most frightening experiences imaginable and struggle. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2591.94s)]
*  He and his wife Rosa were living in this same home with their son Renzo, then 10, when Downey first noticed a problem while playing catch with Renzo. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2601.94s)]
*  The ball kept coming in and out of sight. The cause turned out to be a tumor near his optic nerve. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2611.94s)]
*  Surgery, to remove it, lasted nine and a half hours. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2619.94s)]
*  He says his surgeon had told him there was a slight risk of total sight loss, but that he'd never had it happen. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2623.94s)]
*  When he first came out of surgery, he was able to see. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2630.94s)]
*  But then things started to go wrong. The next day, half his field of vision disappeared, and then... [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2635.94s)]
*  The next time I woke up, it was all gone. It was just black. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2643.94s)]
*  It's complete and total darkness. No light. You can't see anything. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2647.94s)]
*  No light. It's dark. It's all dark. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2652.94s)]
*  After days of frantic testing, a surgeon told him it was permanent, irreversible, and sent in a social worker. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2655.94s)]
*  She says, oh, and I see from your chart you're an architect, so we can talk about career alternatives. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2664.94s)]
*  Career alternatives. Right away. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2670.94s)]
*  And been told I was officially blind for 24 hours. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2673.94s)]
*  And she's saying you can't be an architect anymore. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2676.94s)]
*  And she's saying we can talk about career alternatives. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2678.94s)]
*  I felt like these walls were being built up around me. Just like, yeah, you're getting boxed in. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2680.94s)]
*  Alone that night in his room, Downey did some serious thinking about his son and about his own father, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2686.94s)]
*  who had died from complications after surgery when Downey was seven years old. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2694.94s)]
*  I could quickly appreciate the wonder, the joy of, I'm still here. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2700.94s)]
*  It was actually joy? [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2706.94s)]
*  Yeah. It's like, I'm still here with my family. My son still has his dad. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2708.94s)]
*  You know, your eyes are tearing up. You know that. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2714.94s)]
*  Yeah. Sorry. I always have a hard time talking through that. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2716.94s)]
*  He knew that how he handled this would send a strong message to Renzo. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2720.94s)]
*  I had been talking with him about the need to really apply himself. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2726.94s)]
*  At the age of 10, it's that point where if you want something, you really have to work at it. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2730.94s)]
*  And here I am, facing this great challenge. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2735.94s)]
*  So motivated to set an example, he headed back to work only one month later. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2738.94s)]
*  This was the most healthy thing about Chris. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2744.94s)]
*  Brian Bashan is executive director of the nonprofit Lighthouse for the Blind [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2747.94s)]
*  and Visually Impaired in San Francisco and is blind himself. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2751.94s)]
*  He waited a few days until the stitches were out of his skull, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2756.94s)]
*  and 30 days after brain surgery, he was back in the office thinking, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2760.94s)]
*  okay, there's got to be a way to figure this out, and I'm going to figure it out. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2765.94s)]
*  Bashan's organization, the Lighthouse, helps people new to vision loss learn how to figure things out. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2769.94s)]
*  Let's try the first line. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2776.94s)]
*  When someone becomes blind, the odds are 99% they've never met another blind person. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2777.94s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2783.94s)]
*  Yeah, that really is true. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2784.94s)]
*  Blind people need those role models. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2786.94s)]
*  How to be blind, how to hold down a job, how to live an independent life. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2788.94s)]
*  Specifically, how to work in the kitchen, safely. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2793.94s)]
*  How to navigate public transportation. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2797.94s)]
*  How to use screen reading software to listen to emails as quickly as the rest of us read them. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2801.94s)]
*  Did you understand that? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2810.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2811.94s)]
*  Wow. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2812.94s)]
*  And most critically, how to get around in the world alone. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2813.94s)]
*  Downey learned that at the Lighthouse. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2817.94s)]
*  When you first crossed a big street like this on your own, was it terrifying? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2820.94s)]
*  It was absolutely terrifying. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2825.94s)]
*  I can totally imagine. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2827.94s)]
*  I remember that day, stepping off the curb, you would have thought I was stepping into raging waters. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2829.94s)]
*  Take a deep breath and go for it. You've got to push through it. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2835.94s)]
*  Within a few months, he was traveling the streets on his own and getting back to normalcy with his son. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2839.94s)]
*  The first Father's Day came up. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2846.94s)]
*  Rosa was like, so what do you want to do? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2848.94s)]
*  You want to go on a picnic, go on a nice lunch? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2850.94s)]
*  I want to play baseball with Renzo. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2853.94s)]
*  With Renzo. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2856.94s)]
*  Renzo was like, he popped up. I could feel him jump to the edge of his chair. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2857.94s)]
*  Baseball? You want to play baseball? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2862.94s)]
*  Dad would throw to me and I'd play like I was playing first base. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2864.94s)]
*  How could he throw the ball to you? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2868.94s)]
*  I'd just call out, I'm over here. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2870.94s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2872.94s)]
*  And he'd point and I'd say, yeah, that's right, and then he'd throw it at me. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2873.94s)]
*  But that's something I really loved about our relationship. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2877.94s)]
*  He quickly was looking for possibilities. He wasn't seeing you can't do that. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2880.94s)]
*  He was like, well, why not? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2885.94s)]
*  All right, here we go. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2887.94s)]
*  Downey seems to have a knack for finding windows when doors slam shut. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2888.94s)]
*  Just nine months after going blind, the recession hit and he lost his job. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2893.94s)]
*  But he got word that a nearby firm was designing a rehabilitation center for veterans with sight loss. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2899.94s)]
*  They were eager to meet a blind architect. What are the chances? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2906.94s)]
*  You had to believe that God's hand came down. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2912.94s)]
*  It took my disability and turned it upside down. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2915.94s)]
*  All of a sudden, it defined unique, unusual value that virtually nobody else had to offer. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2920.94s)]
*  Nobody? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2928.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2929.94s)]
*  Starting with that job, Downey developed a specialty, making spaces accessible to the blind. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2930.94s)]
*  He helped design a new eye center at Duke University Hospital, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2936.94s)]
*  consulted on a job for Microsoft, and signed on to help the visually impaired [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2940.94s)]
*  find their way in San Francisco's new and much-delayed four-block long Transbay Transit Center, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2946.94s)]
*  which we visited during construction. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2954.94s)]
*  If you're blind, you don't drive. All right? [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2956.94s)]
*  You don't like it when we drive. So, you know, we're committed transit users. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2959.94s)]
*  So the question was, how on earth do you navigate this size of facility if you're blind? [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2963.94s)]
*  His solution? Grooves set into the concrete, running the entire length of the platform. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2970.94s)]
*  Now, we'll just follow this, following those grooves. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2977.94s)]
*  With a subtle change from smooth to textured concrete to signal where to turn to get to the escalators. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2981.94s)]
*  Would you like to give it a try? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2988.94s)]
*  Okay. I know to go straight because of this line, and I feel, oh my, oh my. So it's pretty obvious. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2990.94s)]
*  I can hear the difference from here. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=2998.94s)]
*  It's something sighted people may never notice, and that's precisely the point. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3000.94s)]
*  Downey believes in what's called universal design that accommodates people with disabilities, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3005.94s)]
*  but is just as appealing to people without them. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3012.94s)]
*  It's the approach he used for his biggest project yet, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3016.94s)]
*  consulting on the total renovation of a new three-story office space for his old training ground, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3019.94s)]
*  the lighthouse for the blind. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3026.94s)]
*  Coming into blindness need not be some dreary social service experience, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3028.94s)]
*  but rather more like coming into an Apple store, thinking that there might be something fun around the corner. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3033.94s)]
*  One of Downey's ideas was to break through and link the three floors with an internal staircase [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3039.94s)]
*  that sighted people can see and the blind can hear. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3046.94s)]
*  In blindness, it's so wonderful to be on the ninth floor and hear a burst of laughter up on the eleventh floor [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3050.94s)]
*  or to hear somebody playing the piano on the tenth floor. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3057.94s)]
*  For the hallways, Downey chose polished concrete because of the acoustics. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3061.94s)]
*  I can hear the special tap of somebody's cane or the click of a guide dog's toenails. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3066.94s)]
*  Click of a dog's toenail? Well, is that good or bad? [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3072.94s)]
*  That's great. It's like you're seeing somebody coming down the hall. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3077.94s)]
*  I know the sound of individual people who work here by the way they use their cane or the kind of walk they have. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3081.94s)]
*  You can really distinguish between people by how they tap their cane. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3088.94s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3093.94s)]
*  If you hadn't had Chris working on this building, a blind architect... [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3094.94s)]
*  It wouldn't have been as rich or so subtle for sure. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3099.94s)]
*  Spring 2018 marked the ten-year anniversary of Downey losing his sight. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3102.94s)]
*  So what did he do? He threw a party, a fundraiser for the lighthouse, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3108.94s)]
*  where he's been student, architect, and now president of the board. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3114.94s)]
*  Maybe a slightly bizarre thing, celebrating my ten-year blind birthday. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3118.94s)]
*  But when you're 55 and you have a chance to be ten again, you take it. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3123.94s)]
*  I get the feeling that you actually think you're a better architect today. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3128.94s)]
*  I'm absolutely convinced I'm a better architect today than I was excited to the north. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3134.94s)]
*  If you could see tomorrow, would you still want to be able to feel the design? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3140.94s)]
*  If I were to get my sight back, it would be...I don't know. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3145.94s)]
*  I would be afraid that I'd sort of lose what I've really been working on. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3151.94s)]
*  I don't really think about having my sight restored. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3155.94s)]
*  There'd be some logistical liberation to it, but will it make my life better? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3158.94s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3164.94s)]
*  It's a story as old as cities themselves. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3175.94s)]
*  Prosperity comes to town and triggers a building boom. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3178.94s)]
*  In modern San Francisco, rows of skyscrapers have begun lining the downtown streets [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3181.94s)]
*  and recasting the skyline, monuments to the triumph of the tech sector. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3185.94s)]
*  Leading this wave, the Millennium Tower. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3190.94s)]
*  58 stories of opulence, it opened in 2009 to great acclaim, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3193.94s)]
*  then the tallest residential building west of the Mississippi. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3197.94s)]
*  Though priced in the millions, the inventory of posh apartments moved quickly. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3200.94s)]
*  Yet for all its curb appeal, the building has quite literally one fundamental problem. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3204.94s)]
*  It's sinking into mud and tilting toward its neighbors. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3209.94s)]
*  Engineering doesn't often make for rollicking mystery, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3213.94s)]
*  but San Francisco is captivated by the tail of the Leaning Tower and the lawsuits it spawned. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3216.94s)]
*  It's a story positioned, albeit at an angle, somewhere between civic scandal and civic curiosity. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3221.94s)]
*  An illustration of what can happen when zeal for development overtakes common sense. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3228.94s)]
*  When the fog rolls in over San Francisco, the skyscrapers live up to the name. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3238.94s)]
*  The Transamerica Pyramid, long the gem of this skyline, now dwarfed, quaint as a cable car. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3243.94s)]
*  The new Salesforce Tower stands as the tallest building in town. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3249.94s)]
*  Nearby, Facebook just took out the city's largest lease on this building. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3253.94s)]
*  And across the way, the Millennium Tower at 301 Mission Street. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3258.94s)]
*  645 feet of reinforced concrete wrapped in glass. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3262.94s)]
*  Inside the $550 million construction, as advertised, lavish condominiums flush with amenities, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3267.94s)]
*  attracting tech barons and venture capitalists. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3275.94s)]
*  San Francisco royalty, former 49ers quarterback Joe Montana, bought here. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3278.94s)]
*  It's a wonderful location. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3283.94s)]
*  So did Jerry and Pat Dodson. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3285.94s)]
*  Eight years ago, they paid $2.1 million for a two-bedroom and planned to live out their retirement, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3287.94s)]
*  enjoying the sweeping view from the 42nd floor. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3292.94s)]
*  Everything I had read indicated that it was the best building in San Francisco. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3296.94s)]
*  It had won numerous awards. It had particularly won awards for construction, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3301.94s)]
*  which was very important if you're thinking of moving into a high-rise. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3305.94s)]
*  Initially, no buyer's remorse? [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3309.94s)]
*  No, not at all. I mean, in fact, buyer euphoria. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3311.94s)]
*  One feature the Dodson's hadn't counted on... [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3315.94s)]
*  These devices are what? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3318.94s)]
*  They're stress gauges. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3319.94s)]
*  ...dozens of stress gauges dot the walls of the Millennium Tower's basement. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3320.94s)]
*  They measure, in millimeters, the slow growth of cracks along the columns that rise up from the building's foundation. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3324.94s)]
*  There's enough of them, a spiderweb of cracks, that you have to be concerned about what's going on underneath. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3331.94s)]
*  These cracks are one of the only visual clues that there's anything profoundly wrong here. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3338.94s)]
*  These are the rounds you do now. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3343.94s)]
*  Yeah, I've been told by structural and geotechnical engineers that I should be watching. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3345.94s)]
*  Both an engineer and a lawyer, Dodson makes daily rounds of the basement looking for signs of deterioration. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3351.94s)]
*  It's a routine he's kept since the Homeowners Association called a meeting of residents in May of 2016. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3358.94s)]
*  They just said we should be there and made a sign in which alerted us at that time that there was something serious. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3364.94s)]
*  So what was the nature of that meeting? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3371.94s)]
*  It was the first time we were told that the building was sinking and was tilting. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3373.94s)]
*  Engineers for the tower's developer have tracked sinking here since the day the foundation was poured in 2006. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3379.94s)]
*  Nothing unusual about that. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3385.94s)]
*  Here's what is unusual. Their data shows the Millennium Tower sinking 17 inches so far and tilting 14 inches to the northwest. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3387.94s)]
*  Let me ask you this. What do you think is going on? Why is this happening? What can be done about it? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3396.94s)]
*  Once news got out, local politicians seized on the story. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3401.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3404.94s)]
*  And the very engineers celebrated for the building's design suddenly were being compelled to explain why the building was moving. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3405.94s)]
*  If you'd like to speak, please do approach the mic. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3412.94s)]
*  When the Millennium hearings opened to public comment, it brought some livelier moments. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3415.94s)]
*  I think what's needed here in the city by the bay where everybody thinks everything's okay, but they might want to hear what I've got to say. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3420.94s)]
*  This after all being San Francisco, a city once described as 49 square miles surrounded by reality. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3428.94s)]
*  Aaron Peskin has a certain vitality himself. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3435.94s)]
*  A longtime city supervisor, he starts most days with a swim in the bay, then meets constituents at a North Beach coffee shop where the Millennium Tower is a popular topic. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3440.94s)]
*  Peskin is leading hearings into what is causing the trouble. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3451.94s)]
*  You subpoenaed some of the engineers involved with Millennium Tower. Why? [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3455.94s)]
*  We don't generally like to subpoena people. That power has not been used by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors for some quarter of a century. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3459.94s)]
*  25 years you've never issued a subpoena before. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3467.94s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3469.94s)]
*  When you got them in here, what'd you learn? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3470.94s)]
*  Their answers were less than satisfactory. Nobody has owned up to why this building is not performing. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3472.94s)]
*  Some homeowners aren't waiting around to find out. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3480.94s)]
*  Andrew Falk and Frank Jernigan, who worked at Google when it was still a startup, got all the answers they needed when they rolled a marble across their floor. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3483.94s)]
*  We didn't do it but once and this is what we got. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3491.94s)]
*  We were shocked when that thing stopped, turned around and started rolling back, back to where the building is tilting. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3494.94s)]
*  The Northwest side. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3503.94s)]
*  I thought, we don't know if this building is going to stand up in an earthquake. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3505.94s)]
*  And so I became severely frightened of that and we got out and we left. We left really most all of our belongings. We just left. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3509.94s)]
*  The couple sold their apartment earlier this year and moved to a two-story home in the Pacific Heights neighborhood. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3520.94s)]
*  We sold it for approximately half of what it was valued at before this news came to light. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3526.94s)]
*  You lost seven figures on the sale of this apartment. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3532.94s)]
*  That's right. I would say we lost three to four million dollars. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3537.94s)]
*  Speaking of astronomical figures, half a world away in a suburb of Amsterdam, San Francisco's sinking tower came across the radar of Peter Morykiewicz, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3541.94s)]
*  an engineer who worked with the European Space Agency to track earthquakes. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3553.94s)]
*  Using signals from a satellite 500 miles above the earth, Morykiewicz measures ground movements around fault lines. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3558.94s)]
*  In 2016, he happened to be studying the Bay Area when something caught his eye. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3565.94s)]
*  This is obviously downtown San Francisco. What do the green dots represent? [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3570.94s)]
*  Green dots represent stable. No displacement or no significant displacement. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3574.94s)]
*  Stable structures. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3579.94s)]
*  Stable structures, yeah. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3580.94s)]
*  And the red dots? [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3581.94s)]
*  Few red dots means something's going down. Something's settling, something's subsiding, something's sinking. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3582.94s)]
*  Did you know what it was? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3588.94s)]
*  No. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3589.94s)]
*  Had you heard of Millennium Tower before this? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3590.94s)]
*  No. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3592.94s)]
*  Ever been to San Francisco? [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3593.94s)]
*  No. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3594.94s)]
*  What can you tell us about the rate of sinking? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3595.94s)]
*  It's in a ballpark of between 1.5 to 2 inches a year. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3598.94s)]
*  1.5 to 2 inches a year? [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3602.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3604.94s)]
*  And there's nothing to suggest the sinking and tilting are slowing down, much less stopping. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3606.94s)]
*  But is it dangerous? [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3611.94s)]
*  As recently as this past summer, the city of San Francisco and its engineers asserted that building is safe even in the event of an earthquake. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3613.94s)]
*  Even so, and this is a central theme to this saga, there are as many opinions about the trouble with the Millennium Tower as there are engineers in the Bay Area. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3621.94s)]
*  There's a lot of things about this building that are unprecedented. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3630.94s)]
*  Jerry Cawthon, one of those local engineers, did not work on the tower but has worked on nearby projects. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3633.94s)]
*  Some thinking for buildings is acceptable, right? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3639.94s)]
*  Some is. They actually anticipated over the life of the building it would sink about 4 to 5 inches. That's like a hundred year life. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3643.94s)]
*  This is double and triple that. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3651.94s)]
*  Yeah. I don't think they...they obviously didn't anticipate anything like this close to it. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3653.94s)]
*  By they, Cawthon means Millennium Partners, brand-name developers with high-end skyscrapers all over the country. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3659.94s)]
*  Cawthon says their big mistake was building Millennium Tower out of concrete instead of steel. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3666.94s)]
*  Concrete is often cheaper and it's just as good, but it is a lot heavier, so you've got to design your foundation and your subsurface to support that higher weight. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3672.94s)]
*  What lies beneath the surface at 301 Mission Street is critical to the story. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3682.94s)]
*  It fell to Millennium's geotechnical engineers to analyze the ground below and design an appropriate foundation. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3687.94s)]
*  They went with a foundation driven 80 feet deep into a layer of dense sand, and the city approved the plan. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3693.94s)]
*  Larry Karp is a local geotechnical engineer. He did not work on the tower either, but specializes in Bay Area soil conditions. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3701.94s)]
*  What is under the ground here? [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3709.94s)]
*  What is under the ground here at the surface is rubble from the 1906 earthquake. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3711.94s)]
*  Brick and sand and debris, everything you can imagine is down here. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3716.94s)]
*  You have to go 200 feet below the Millennium Tower through layers of history in the ground, [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3722.94s)]
*  below landfill from the time of the Gold Rush, sand, mud and clay, to reach solid rock or bedrock. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3728.94s)]
*  Karp says the fact that the tower's foundation isn't anchored in bedrock, well, that's a problem. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3735.94s)]
*  For a big heavy building, a concrete building, those foundations have to go deeper. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3740.94s)]
*  For a building like this, they have to go to bedrock. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3745.94s)]
*  Otherwise, he says, the structure will sink into less sturdy layers of sand and mud. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3748.94s)]
*  And because it doesn't sink or settle uniformly, you get tilting. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3754.94s)]
*  Look at the whole line. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3758.94s)]
*  Karp told us he can see the tilt from the middle of Mission Street a few blocks away. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3760.94s)]
*  We couldn't see it, so we asked Jerry Cawthon if he could. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3765.94s)]
*  It's very hard to see. It's not enough of a tilt to see. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3768.94s)]
*  This is not like the Leaning Tower piece of land. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3772.94s)]
*  And there it is, the inevitable comparison to that greatest engineering gaffe of them all, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3775.94s)]
*  not the landmark any present-day developer wants to be associated with. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3781.94s)]
*  Millennium Partners declined our request for an on-camera interview, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3786.94s)]
*  but pointed out their tower was built to code. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3790.94s)]
*  They blamed their neighbors, specifically construction of the Transbay Terminal, [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3793.94s)]
*  San Francisco's answer to Grand Central Station, right next door. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3797.94s)]
*  Transbay declined an on-camera interview, too, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3801.94s)]
*  but told us Millennium had already sunk 10 inches before work began on their project. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3804.94s)]
*  And right on cue, here come the lawyers. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3810.94s)]
*  Lawyers for Millennium Partners, for the Transbay Terminal next door, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3813.94s)]
*  for the towers' structural engineers and geotechnical engineers, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3817.94s)]
*  for the architect and the builder, for the homeowners' association, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3821.94s)]
*  and for the city and, yes, even for Joe Montana. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3825.94s)]
*  There are 20 parties to various Millennium tower lawsuits and counting. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3829.94s)]
*  It takes a half an hour just to take attendance of the lawyers in the courtroom, literally. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3834.94s)]
*  A lot of billable hours. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3838.94s)]
*  Courtroom, circus aside, we asked Aaron Peskin, the city supervisor, [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3841.94s)]
*  simply, what's going on here? [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3845.94s)]
*  Everybody is afraid to tell the truth, because if we get to the bottom of this, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3848.94s)]
*  they are worried that it is going to, in some way, [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3853.94s)]
*  slow down the building boom that is happening in San Francisco. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3857.94s)]
*  Time is money in construction, and we don't want to stop this frenzy. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3861.94s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3865.94s)]
*  This drama has hardly had a chilling effect. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3869.94s)]
*  Everywhere you look in downtown San Francisco, they're building another skyscraper. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3872.94s)]
*  And the latest must-have amenity for all these new constructions, bedrock. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3879.94s)]
*  In what might be the first act of building-on-building bullying, [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3884.94s)]
*  tech giant Salesforce stuck it to Millennium via Twitter. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3888.94s)]
*  Bedrock, baby. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3892.94s)]
*  You think that was in reference to what's going on across the street? [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3894.94s)]
*  I don't think it was in reference. I know it was in reference, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3897.94s)]
*  because I know the people who built that building. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3899.94s)]
*  The city still doesn't require all skyscrapers to go to bedrock, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3902.94s)]
*  but the city has made some changes to prevent another tower from leaning. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3906.94s)]
*  More review of foundations for new tall buildings, for one. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3910.94s)]
*  As for the Millennium tower, on this, almost everyone agrees. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3914.94s)]
*  It needs to be fixed. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3918.94s)]
*  What do we do with a tilting, sinking building? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3920.94s)]
*  I've heard freeze the ground. Perpetually freeze the ground. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3922.94s)]
*  Perpetually freeze the ground. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3926.94s)]
*  They've talked about removing 20 stories from the top of it to reduce its weight. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3928.94s)]
*  It's lopping off the top 20 stories. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3933.94s)]
*  That sounds like a horrible mess. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3935.94s)]
*  I think more likely, the surest way is to get it on piles to rock. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3937.94s)]
*  Bedrock. There may be no avoiding it. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3942.94s)]
*  The parties are in mediation debating just how to drill down to bedrock [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3945.94s)]
*  under an existing skyscraper with 1,000 people living upstairs. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3949.94s)]
*  And then there's the indelicate question, who pays for all this? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3954.94s)]
*  I am hopeful that the city and Millennium and the Homer Association [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3959.94s)]
*  will implement a fix in the near term and fight about the money later. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3965.94s)]
*  But time's ticking. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3970.94s)]
*  Over the years, we've done stories on all sorts of people. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3989.94s)]
*  But to our knowledge, we have never done one on a late middle-aged man [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3993.94s)]
*  who dresses in biker gear with visible tattoos and sterling silver skull rings. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=3997.94s)]
*  And certainly not one who also happens to be fluent in French [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4002.94s)]
*  and English, but who has a very strong sense of humor. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4006.94s)]
*  And I think that's a very good way to do it. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4010.94s)]
*  I think that's a very good way to do it. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4013.94s)]
*  And certainly not one who also happens to be fluent in French [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4015.94s)]
*  and advanced mathematics. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4019.94s)]
*  No, Peter Marino is one of a kind. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4021.94s)]
*  If you follow the worlds of art, architecture, and high fashion, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4024.94s)]
*  you probably know he is a serious player in all of them. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4028.94s)]
*  A tastemaker for some of the richest, most sophisticated people in the world, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4031.94s)]
*  many of whom would agree Marino's appearance is actually [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4036.94s)]
*  one of the least interesting things about him. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4040.94s)]
*  At first glance, you might mistake him for the bouncer at a leather bar, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4044.94s)]
*  a professional wrestler, or the frontman for a village people tribute band. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4048.94s)]
*  But here in Paris, at a reception for the Biennale, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4053.94s)]
*  one of the oldest art and antique fairs in the world, [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4056.94s)]
*  Hi, how are you? [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4059.94s)]
*  Peter Marino is instantly recognized. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4061.94s)]
*  I'm a big fan of him. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4065.94s)]
*  Oh, thank you, thank you, madam. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4067.94s)]
*  and actively courted by people you might think would run the other way. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4068.94s)]
*  A master. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4072.94s)]
*  But behind the threatening keep-your-distance façade [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4074.94s)]
*  Monsieur, venez expliquer tout. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4077.94s)]
*  is an amusing, ironic, highly accomplished artist and businessman [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4080.94s)]
*  with a sensitive soul. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4085.94s)]
*  His talents are demonstrated in the beauty and breadth of his design work [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4088.94s)]
*  and architecture, in contradict his carefully considered public image [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4092.94s)]
*  of a beast on a motorcycle. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4097.9400000000005s)]
*  People make first judgments about people based on their appearance. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4099.94s)]
*  There's an old saying, the clothes make the man. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4104.94s)]
*  How about the older statement, don't judge a book by its cover? [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4107.94s)]
*  But you want people to judge you by this look. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4111.94s)]
*  This is your look. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4114.94s)]
*  Absolutely not. It's a decoy. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4115.94s)]
*  A decoy. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4117.94s)]
*  Sure. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4118.94s)]
*  Would you think you're talking to a bright architect looking at a guy like me? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4119.94s)]
*  You still know calculus and trig and all of that stuff? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4122.94s)]
*  Had to, had to get my license, and you've got to keep your license up to date. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4125.94s)]
*  You have to take 18 credits a year. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4128.94s)]
*  That's the hardest part. You've got to keep taking courses. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4130.94s)]
*  Dude, they don't let you forget it. Yeah. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4132.94s)]
*  The arts and fashion worlds have always had a high tolerance for eccentricity. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4135.94s)]
*  Take Tom Wolfe in his white suits, Carl Lagerfeld's dark glasses and fingerless gloves, [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4140.94s)]
*  and Lady Gaga. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4146.94s)]
*  On your left, on your left eye. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4148.94s)]
*  There is no question that Marino's signature look has made him one of a handful [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4150.94s)]
*  of living architects actually recognized by the media. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4154.94s)]
*  One of your good friends said that you like the shock value. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4158.94s)]
*  Like you like the fact that people say, what's with him? [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4161.94s)]
*  I like more the fact that I like to think out of the box. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4166.94s)]
*  Thinking out of the box goes along with dressing out of the box and living out of the box. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4169.94s)]
*  If you want to come up with a really original design idea, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4174.94s)]
*  and you want to capture a whole new design direction, [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4179.94s)]
*  perhaps the best way to arrive at that is not by acting and thinking and doing like everybody else. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4182.94s)]
*  That's all. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4188.94s)]
*  If the get-up was simply a publicity gimmick, Marino would have disappeared decades ago. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4189.94s)]
*  His work would not be regularly featured in Architectural Digest and other glossy magazines. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4195.94s)]
*  And the firm that bears his name would not be occupying two floors [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4201.94s)]
*  and 16,000 square feet of some of the most expensive office space in New York, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4205.94s)]
*  which is furnished with museum-quality artwork all for Marino's private collection. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4211.94s)]
*  Paintings and sculpture, modern art and antiquities, all juxtaposed in perfect harmony. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4217.94s)]
*  This is quite a room. Quite a reception area. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4223.94s)]
*  What is this piece? [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4227.94s)]
*  This is 2003 Anselm Kieffer. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4229.94s)]
*  And this? [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4232.94s)]
*  This is Gandharan, 3rd century AD. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4233.94s)]
*  Gandharan? [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4235.94s)]
*  This is the site from Gandharan, and it's the region just on the Silk Road [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4236.94s)]
*  where the Chinese culture and the Indian culture just met with the Greek culture. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4240.94s)]
*  Art is at the center of Marino's universe, and his knowledge of it is encyclopedic. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4245.94s)]
*  He not only collects it, he curates it and commissions it for his projects. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4250.94s)]
*  It covers nearly every inch of wall space. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4255.94s)]
*  In his here, he says not to impress his clients, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4258.94s)]
*  but to inspire the staff of 150 designers and architects, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4261.94s)]
*  with whom he turns out between 50 and 100 projects a year. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4264.94s)]
*  Design-wise, I look at everything. If I don't personally design it, I'll review it. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4269.94s)]
*  I'm the kind of creative director of the firm. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4273.94s)]
*  You're a bit of a control freak. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4276.94s)]
*  You'd have to ask the staff for that. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4278.94s)]
*  Bordering on the tyrannical. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4281.94s)]
*  You'd have to confirm that with the staff. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4283.94s)]
*  Do you see yourself as a tyrannical boss? [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4286.94s)]
*  No, I only care about the work, and I am not tyrannical personally in any way, shape or form, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4288.94s)]
*  but I am absolutely passionate about the quality of the work. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4295.94s)]
*  And so are the clients that can afford him, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4300.94s)]
*  who mostly come from the world's wealthiest one-hundredth of one percent, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4303.94s)]
*  encompassing the Glitterati and the Emirati. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4307.94s)]
*  This is a residential project we're building on the top of Los Angeles. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4310.94s)]
*  It's a large site assembled from over seven homes, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4314.94s)]
*  and this is in construction. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4317.94s)]
*  And what is this structure? [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4319.94s)]
*  This is for the subterranean parking. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4320.94s)]
*  And this is a private home? [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4323.94s)]
*  This is a private home. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4324.94s)]
*  And can you tell us anything about the owner? [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4327.94s)]
*  No. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4329.94s)]
*  It's Marino's default answer. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4331.94s)]
*  He won't comment about his clients, which have reportedly included the likes of multi-billionaires David Geffen and David Koch, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4334.94s)]
*  as well as Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4342.94s)]
*  This home in Milan, we're told, was done for Giorgio Armani. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4346.94s)]
*  I like my clients. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4350.94s)]
*  All of my clients say, you do your talented, but your best virtue is your discretion. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4352.94s)]
*  They really don't want to be talked about. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4357.94s)]
*  This Hamptons beach house was designed for a young hedge fund manager and his wife [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4360.94s)]
*  in this ski chalet in Lebanon with ocean views for a Swiss banker. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4365.94s)]
*  But for every private client Marino won't speak about, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4371.94s)]
*  somewhere in the world he is unveiling a project that is the talk of the town. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4374.94s)]
*  Like Boone the Shop, a multi-brand luxury shopping center that takes up two downtown blocks in Seoul, South Korea. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4380.94s)]
*  No expense was spared. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4388.94s)]
*  It's all white Greek marble. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4390.94s)]
*  These are trapezoids, like they fell to space. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4392.94s)]
*  It's an interesting building because the entire inside is rough concrete. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4396.94s)]
*  He says it was built for the family that controls Samsung. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4399.94s)]
*  It's fair to say you work with some of the richest people in the world, right? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4403.94s)]
*  Yes. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4407.94s)]
*  Do they need to be treated a different way? [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4408.94s)]
*  If they need to be treated a different way, no one's told me. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4410.94s)]
*  I remember when I was meeting certain royal families, if I had to behave a certain way. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4417.94s)]
*  Like you better tell me what I'm supposed to say and do. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4427.94s)]
*  And they went, the way you look it doesn't really matter, just be yourself. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4429.94s)]
*  And I went, okay, okay. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4434.94s)]
*  Those partnerships can produce some unusual optics. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4436.94s)]
*  We watched this meeting with Sydney Toledano, the CEO of Christian Dior, [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4439.94s)]
*  who is one of Marino's biggest clients and biggest fans. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4444.94s)]
*  They have collaborated on dozens of Dior boutiques all over the world. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4448.94s)]
*  Toledano is used to working with big egos and difficult people, [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4453.94s)]
*  but says Marino is not one of them. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4457.94s)]
*  I never had the impression that it was complicated because he always finds a solution. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4460.94s)]
*  And he's very professional. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4466.94s)]
*  How important is it to your business? Or how important has he been to your business? [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4468.94s)]
*  He has been key. Don't tell him. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4471.94s)]
*  He understands Dior. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4474.94s)]
*  He understands Dior. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4475.94s)]
*  Toledano sees Marino's look as an artistic presentation of his personality. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4477.94s)]
*  He doesn't even mind the fact that Marino also works for most of his competitors. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4482.94s)]
*  This is a new building we'll be building for Chanel. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4487.94s)]
*  So you've got Chanel up here. You've got... [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4489.94s)]
*  Louis Vuitton. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4492.94s)]
*  Louis Vuitton. Who else? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4493.94s)]
*  Dior, Hublot, Zegna. We do Zegna worldwide. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4495.94s)]
*  We do Bulgari. We're opening a new one in London in December. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4499.94s)]
*  Fendi, if you just saw the Fendi, on 57th in Madison. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4504.94s)]
*  For decades, Marino has been the architect of choice for nearly all of the top fashion designers and luxury brands [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4507.94s)]
*  and is widely credited with reimagining the use of retail space, [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4514.94s)]
*  moving away from boxy department stores and into elegant boutiques. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4518.94s)]
*  His work lines the most conspicuous avenues and boulevards of the world. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4524.94s)]
*  It's a third of his business. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4528.94s)]
*  Every store is unique, and each one distills the essence and the look of the company it was built for. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4530.94s)]
*  A sense of travel and luxury for Louis Vuitton, the timeless classic look for Chanel. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4536.94s)]
*  How did you get them to all come to you? [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4542.94s)]
*  It's the old question, why do they all go to you? [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4545.94s)]
*  Steve, would you go to a knee doctor who had done two knee operations if you need an operation, [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4548.94s)]
*  or one who had done 300 successfully? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4553.94s)]
*  Who would you go to? That's why they come to me. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4556.94s)]
*  Marino's work ethic and personality are rooted in Queens, the New York neighborhood where he was born 67 years ago, [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4561.94s)]
*  the only son in a middle class Italian family. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4568.94s)]
*  In high school, he excelled in art and graduated from Cornell University in 1971 with a degree in architecture. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4572.94s)]
*  He learned the trade from the very best, serving apprenticeships with IM Pei and Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4580.94s)]
*  But he picked up the ways of the wealthy and the value of celebrity from another master, artist Andy Warhol, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4587.94s)]
*  who always considered business one of the finer forms of art. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4593.94s)]
*  He certainly knew how to get attention. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4597.94s)]
*  The blonde wig, dude that was so good. The blonde wig, it's pretty hard to beat. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4599.94s)]
*  Marino did some early work for Warhol and hung out at his New York studio called The Factory, [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4606.94s)]
*  which was a magnet for music and movie stars, socialites and royalty. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4611.94s)]
*  Bob Colicello was the editor of Warhol's interview magazine when Marino first walked through the door. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4616.94s)]
*  What was he like? He had little bow ties and he was very properly dressed. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4622.94s)]
*  You know when he was funny, he was talented. You could see that right away. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4628.94s)]
*  Colicello, now a contributing editor at Vanity Fair Magazine, and Isabelle Ratazzi, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4633.94s)]
*  the former model and longtime friend of Marino, think he has changed very little from those ironic factory days [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4638.94s)]
*  of Campbell Soup Cans and pop art parodies of fame. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4645.94s)]
*  Peter fed right into that. I mean we were all on the same sort of wavelength, you know. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4649.94s)]
*  Tongue in cheek. Tongue in cheek. A lot of what we were doing was very tongue in cheek. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4654.94s)]
*  And Peter I think is still very tongue in cheek. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4658.94s)]
*  Totally. He's enjoying it. It's a way to have fun at other people's expenses sometimes. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4660.94s)]
*  I think Peter deep down more than anything is an artist. He has an incredible sense of aesthetics. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4666.94s)]
*  He loves beauty and anything in art and music. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4674.94s)]
*  It's on display at Marino's 12-acre estate where every summer there is a lavish party for friends [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4680.94s)]
*  to introduce young and up-and-coming classical musicians. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4686.94s)]
*  It's hosted by Peter and Jane Trapnell, his waspy wife of 33 years, [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4694.94s)]
*  a charming and accomplished costume designer who friends say is an essential part of the equation. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4699.94s)]
*  She's too smart to be interviewed. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4704.94s)]
*  But you've been married a long time. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4707.94s)]
*  33 years. That's great. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4709.94s)]
*  Don't look like the perfect couple if you know what I mean. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4712.94s)]
*  It's a good marriage because each of us is what we are, allows the other one to be themselves [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4718.94s)]
*  and appreciates each other for the right reason. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4725.94s)]
*  It's rare that you'll find people who don't try to change the other person [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4727.94s)]
*  and let everyone be what they are. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4732.94s)]
*  What's this? [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4736.94s)]
*  The only other constant in Marino's life, as you may have guessed, are motorcycles, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4738.94s)]
*  his latest prominently displayed on the project board. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4742.94s)]
*  This is my Super Duke KTM 1290. It's very fast. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4745.94s)]
*  You're supposed to say, does Jane sit on the back? Ha ha. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4751.94s)]
*  Does Jane sit on the back? Ha ha. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4754.94s)]
*  Absolutely not. She's in the back of a car and driver and she's with the two dogs. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4756.94s)]
*  Marino finds cars claustrophobic. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4764.94s)]
*  He has a half a dozen bikes, has ridden them all over the country, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4767.94s)]
*  and regularly uses them to commute between New York and his home on Long Island. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4770.94s)]
*  It's his release and the core of his identity. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4775.94s)]
*  Alone, on the road, where he can take in the air and the light and the space. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4778.94s)]
*  All part of living life outside the box. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6or_ALzG0&t=4783.94s)]
