# CARE Court; Bankrolling the Ukraine War; Sloths | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [September 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU)
*  You've used words like you're outraged, you're disgusted by what's happening on the streets. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=0.0s)]
*  I am because I see what everybody else sees. I try to walk my kids to the park and have a difficult [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=11.92s)]
*  time navigating the sidewalk. That's California Governor Gavin Newsom talking about the largest [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=16.4s)]
*  homeless population in the country. One in four of California's homeless has a serious mental health [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=21.6s)]
*  issue and the crisis has bred fear in communities as violent crime rises. What can be done about it? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=27.36s)]
*  The state has a plan called Care Court and that's our story tonight. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=33.76s)]
*  The U.S. has spent more than 70 billion dollars on Ukrainian aid. We were surprised to learn that, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=41.12s)]
*  among other things, that funding covers the salaries of 57,000 first responders and the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  teams that train the rescue dogs who help look for survivors after Russian airstrikes. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  The U.S. is also subsidizing Ukrainian small businesses so they can pay their employees, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=60.4s)]
*  many of whom have family members on the front lines. How do you feel about that? Grateful. Great. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=66.08s)]
*  So the two toads I always say look like a cross between a wookie and a pig because they've got [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=76.0s)]
*  that sort of beepable nose and then these ones have the sort of you know beetles haircuts and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=79.92s)]
*  Mona Lisa smiles. Behind that ringer for Ringo, Cook says, is a secret. Being nature's couch potato [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=85.92s)]
*  is the reason Sloths have survived for more than 60 million years in spite of, well, themselves. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=93.68s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. I'm Bill Whitaker. I'm Anderson Cooper. I'm Sharon Alfonsi. I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. I'm Scott Pelli. Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=109.6s)]
*  On any given night, more than 170,000 people are living on California's streets or in its shelters. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=123.52s)]
*  It's the largest homeless population in the country fueled by a lack of affordable housing [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=129.92s)]
*  and the state's failure to provide adequate mental health care. One in four has a serious mental [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=135.04s)]
*  illness. It's a crisis that's bred fear in communities as violent crimes rise. And this past [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=140.64s)]
*  week, Sacramento's top prosecutor sued California's capital city for allowing it to, quote, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=146.72s)]
*  collapse into chaos. That's the landscape Governor Gavin Newsom says he's trying to change, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=152.4s)]
*  starting this fall with a controversial new plan on track to cost billions. It's called Care Court, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=158.32s)]
*  because it brings mental health care into the courtroom. Now judges will order people to get [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=164.8s)]
*  help and counties to provide it under a new law that emphasizes accountability and consequences. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=170.0s)]
*  We met with Governor Newsom and found him to be fired up and fed up. Change has its enemies. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=176.56s)]
*  I get it. But one thing you cannot argue for with all due respect to all the critics out there is [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  you can't. And in the absence of alternatives, what the hell are we going to do to address this [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=190.08s)]
*  crisis? It is a crisis overwhelming cities across the country, but California has been hit the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=196.0s)]
*  hardest. And Governor Gavin Newsom says it is desperation, born out of scenes like this, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=202.32s)]
*  that drove the idea for Care Court. You've used words like you're outraged, you're disgusted by [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=208.24s)]
*  what's happening on the streets. I am, because I see what everybody else sees. I try to walk my [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=214.4s)]
*  kids to the park and have a difficult time navigating the sidewalk. It's a fail first system, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=218.48s)]
*  not a care first system, which means you have to end up in the criminal justice system before [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=224.32s)]
*  finally someone provides support and a bed and a solution. We've got to change that and that's [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=229.12s)]
*  what we're doing. Congratulations everybody. Here's how it will work. A person referred to Care Court [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=233.44s)]
*  for a severe mental illness is evaluated. If they have an untreated psychotic disorder, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=238.56s)]
*  like schizophrenia, a judge can order a mental health treatment plan, including medication, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=243.68s)]
*  therapy, and a place to live. The governor believes the new civil court system will help [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=248.96s)]
*  thousands get off the streets and make everyone safer by helping people before they become a [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=254.4s)]
*  danger to themselves or others. You think Care Court could be the solution that could save [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=259.52s)]
*  someone's life? I don't think that I know it. It's very familiar what we're doing, even though it's [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=265.36s)]
*  novel and new and bold. Novel, new, and bold. So it's an experiment? No, it's not. When people [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=270.0s)]
*  get their meds, when people get support, we know we can turn people's lives around. This is eminently [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=276.64s)]
*  solvable. But what if someone ordered by a judge to get help doesn't think they need it? They'll [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=282.4s)]
*  have access to a public defender and can refuse treatment. They won't be sent to jail. But there [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=287.76s)]
*  is a catch. If someone in Care Court does refuse, a judge could refer them for conservatorship. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=293.52s)]
*  An extreme outcome that strips them of rights and forces them to comply with treatment. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=299.36s)]
*  This is where he would go. Anita Fisher hopes Care Court will be a lifeline for people like her son, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=304.56s)]
*  Farrow Degree, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia while serving in the army [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=311.2s)]
*  22 years ago. He's now 45. Tell me a little bit about Farrow. Farrow is the kindest, even from a [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  little boy. His report card used to say, joy to have in my class. And some of the things that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=325.68s)]
*  we've gone through, you couldn't have paid me to believe. For nearly two decades, Fisher has worked [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  as a mental health advocate in San Diego. My son is one of those individuals. Running support groups [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=338.24s)]
*  and classes for hundreds of families when their lives are derailed by a loved one's mental illness. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=344.8s)]
*  A lot of times he even can get very agitated. And then he starts to self-medicate, whether it's [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=350.32s)]
*  alcohol or street drugs. And that takes it to a whole different level. You sometimes feel like [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=358.0s)]
*  your son goes missing in those moments. Yes. We would try to have the conversation with him about, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=364.64s)]
*  you know, have you stopped your medication? And he said, well, they said, I don't need this [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=371.28s)]
*  medication. I was like, okay, who is they? And I know that it's the voices. What's this like [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=376.24s)]
*  as a mom for you? It's devastating. Supporters back Care Court because the new law allows families [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=382.56s)]
*  and others like law enforcement and first responders to petition a court to help them get [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=391.2s)]
*  someone into treatment. Until now, Fisher says there has been little recourse, like last year [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=396.08s)]
*  when her son stopped taking his medication. For seven months, she called for a psychiatric [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=402.24s)]
*  intervention, but without her son's consent, she says her attempts were ignored. When I saw him, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  I had to call his name. He'd be wrapped in blankets. Farrow became homeless and Anita spent days [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=413.92s)]
*  searching for him at local spots near their home. When you would find Farrow on these days, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=421.44s)]
*  what kind of condition was he in? He was just very psychiatrically ill. He would be, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=427.52s)]
*  I'm fine. But no, he wouldn't look fine at all. Your son would be convinced that he was fine [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  mentally, that he didn't need his meds. How do you convince him otherwise? What has to happen? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=440.24s)]
*  He ends up arrested. It's almost, we have to wait for that to happen. And last October, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=446.08s)]
*  he was arrested for vandalism. In custody, he received medication and enrolled in a treatment [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  program. Farrow declined to be interviewed on camera, but he described to us on the phone how [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=458.4s)]
*  difficult it can be to live with his illness. Constant overthinking. Your brain is always racing. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=463.76s)]
*  Your inner voice is always talking, racing, racing. No peace. Never any silence and peace. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=469.76s)]
*  What do you think would have happened to him had he not had that treatment? Every single time, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=476.88s)]
*  I have to start in my mind preparing a funeral. I have to get my heart and myself and my family [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=481.84s)]
*  ready, you know, that will he make it this time? It's not, it's not easy. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=491.2s)]
*  With California voters overwhelmingly ranking homelessness as a top concern, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=499.28s)]
*  we have a crisis. Last year, the CARE Act sailed through the state legislature with near unanimous [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=503.76s)]
*  and bipartisan support. It's the main thing to do. But opponents pointed the threat of conservatorship [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=508.8s)]
*  where people can be locked up and treated without their consent. And more than 50 advocacy groups [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=514.96s)]
*  condemn CARE Court as a costly mistake, likely to do real harm. Some of the words that have been [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=520.4s)]
*  used to describe CARE Court, coercive, backwards, harmful, are any of those fair? You laugh. I laugh. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=526.08s)]
*  I don't laugh dismissively. Those are talking points that have been on rewind for decades and [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=533.76s)]
*  decades, and I'm frankly exhausted by them. Someone could end up in conservatorship, and that is a [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=542.16s)]
*  very big deal. Isn't CARE Court saying comply or else? We have people end up in conservatorship all [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=547.76s)]
*  the time. And I get why people don't want to see more of those. But we have that system already. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=553.2s)]
*  And here's all I ask. Prove us wrong. Don't assume us wrong. Your compassion's not superior [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=559.6s)]
*  to our compassion. But that's a big gamble when you're talking about conservatorships, people's [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=566.0s)]
*  lives. Prove us wrong. Exact opposite. Wait and see. The gamble is allowing more people to die [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=571.28s)]
*  under our watch. The gamble is more families struggling, suffering. How dare we? We see it [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=576.72s)]
*  as a pipeline to conservatorship, the greatest deprivation of civil liberties short of the death [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=582.16s)]
*  penalty. Eve Garrow is a homelessness policy analyst for the ACLU of Southern California. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=588.48s)]
*  What are the individual rights that you think someone would be stripped of under CARE Court? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=594.5600000000001s)]
*  The right to determine, for example, what medications go into your body. There's no [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=598.96s)]
*  forced medication in CARE Court. There's no forced medication, but when there's pressure [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=604.5600000000001s)]
*  and coercion, you're more likely to potentially comply with treatment that actually isn't meeting [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=609.84s)]
*  your needs. Governor Newsom says that you're defending the status quo. The administration [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=616.0s)]
*  likes to propose this false dichotomy that either we force people into treatment [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=622.0s)]
*  or we let them die on the streets. You don't feel like that's what's at stake here? I don't feel [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=629.36s)]
*  like that's what's at stake because obviously there's a third alternative. Garrow says that [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=634.88s)]
*  alternative is for the state to provide comprehensive care for all Californians with [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=640.08s)]
*  mental health disabilities. Is that realistic? Yes, it is. If we invest in those services [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=644.64s)]
*  instead of investing in a new court system, of course it is. A lot of people will hear you and [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=651.92s)]
*  say, Eve, clearly the current situation is not working. Aren't we at the point where we have to [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=657.28s)]
*  try something else? I agree completely with that, but the something else we need to try is not a [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=664.3199999999999s)]
*  civil court system. We went with Garrow to the notorious Skid Row in Los Angeles, a county where [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=670.0s)]
*  one in eight of the nation's homeless people live. For years on and off that included Markeisha [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=676.0s)]
*  Babers, a 28 year old who told us she has several serious mental health conditions, including bipolar [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=681.68s)]

*  a therapist or if I can, you know, get some mental health services or help and there are really none [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=694.0s)]
*  or if you do find one it's like, oh well the waiting list is six months before you can actually [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=699.44s)]
*  talk to a therapist. Six months? Oh yeah, yeah absolutely. Do you feel like you're getting [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=703.2800000000001s)]
*  medication that you need? Absolutely not. What has to happen in order for you to get that? Honestly, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=708.96s)]
*  I would have to be committed into a mental health hospital because going into places that offer like [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=713.9200000000001s)]
*  volunteer services or they're backed up or they don't have enough space or my insurance doesn't [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=718.8800000000001s)]
*  cover some of the stuff that I need. When I say the word care court to you, what comes to your mind? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=723.76s)]
*  Medical incarceration. It's just another way to mass incarcerate people and instead of it just [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=730.08s)]
*  being like criminal, it's medical now. What would you like to be done? I think there just needs to [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=735.6s)]
*  be way more attention to services and prevention rather than the consequences of not having those [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=742.16s)]
*  services. This year the Newsom administration invested about 17 billion dollars to fight [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=750.08s)]
*  homelessness and treat mental illness. Chance, there's hope. But leaders in many counties say [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=755.76s)]
*  money earmarked for care court is nowhere near enough for the thousands of people expected to [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=761.12s)]
*  land in the system. Spare me honestly, I'm a little indignant by this rhetoric. The only thing limiting [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=766.08s)]
*  people is an unwillingness to be accountable and I'm just done with it. But are you overly optimistic [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=773.44s)]
*  on this one? This is a very taxed system and you're expecting it to take on a lot more. I'm [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=778.0s)]
*  done with the excuses. You should be done as a taxpayer. Everyone watching should be sick and [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=784.16s)]
*  tired of the excuses. There's plenty of money in this space. Yet even with California facing the [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=788.48s)]
*  highest debt in the nation, Governor Newsom is asking voters to approve billions more for housing [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=793.92s)]
*  and he admits that without enough, care court will not work. You're promising here that anybody who [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=799.6s)]
*  goes into care court will have some kind of housing attached to that. Well I'm not promising [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=806.88s)]
*  anything here. I'm promoting a promise where there's accountability at the local level. I'm [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=812.16s)]
*  not the mayor of California. I'm the governor. And those local governments, if they don't comply, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=818.56s)]
*  will be held accountable. Absolutely. Foundationally what care court is about is about [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=823.4399999999999s)]
*  accountability at all levels. Worth the billions of dollars that you're going to end up spending on [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=828.48s)]
*  the back end. We could save taxpayers billions of dollars and save lives. By December, care [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=834.24s)]
*  court will launch in eight California counties including Los Angeles and San Diego where Anita [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=840.48s)]
*  and Farrow live. By the end of next year, it will be statewide. What does a successful care court [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=845.8399999999999s)]
*  look like for Farrow? I hope he will never have to use it and I hope that if it does that he even [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=852.88s)]
*  sees it as a positive experience where his voice is heard. If you have to, will you initiate care [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=860.4s)]
*  court proceedings? Absolutely. I have no hesitation. It is trauma for the family to keep going through [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=867.28s)]
*  that with their loved one. Is part of this that voters are so fed up with what they see on the [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=875.52s)]
*  streets of their cities that as a politician you've got to clean up those streets? Yeah well that's [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=882.16s)]
*  generally the case but that's not the inspiration for care court. But is there a political factor in [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=887.68s)]
*  this for you? As an electoral strategy I'm turned out. That's not the issue. The politics here [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=892.4s)]
*  is compassion. The politics is purpose. What happens if care court doesn't work? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=898.4799999999999s)]
*  Then we learn from it. Biggest risks that we don't take one. Last month Marquisha Babers, the woman [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=903.12s)]
*  who was living in a Los Angeles shelter and told us she struggles with mental illness, was reported [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=909.28s)]
*  missing by her family. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=914.48s)]
*  Does Governor Gavin Newsom have presidential ambitions? Is that a yes or a no? That was [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=921.04s)]
*  at 60minutesovertime.com sponsored by Pfizer. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=926.9599999999999s)]
*  Now Holly Williams on assignment for 60 minutes. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=936.0s)]
*  The US has sent more than 70 billion dollars worth of aid to Ukraine since Russian troops crossed its [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=940.08s)]
*  border last year. But now a battle is brewing in Washington over the Biden administration's request [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=945.6800000000001s)]
*  for over 20 billion dollars more. Many Republicans in Congress are opposed. Hardliners in the House [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=952.48s)]
*  want to cut off all funding. Others are demanding more oversight. We went to Ukraine to get some [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=960.08s)]
*  answers for the people who were bankrolling the war. American taxpayers. How exactly is your money [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=966.72s)]
*  being spent? And who's watching the weapons and the cash to make sure they end up where they're intended? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=973.6800000000001s)]
*  Our first stop, a forest 15 miles from the front line in eastern Ukraine. These are US made Bradley [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=983.2s)]
*  fighting vehicles. Steel clad behemoths hidden beneath the canopy in a makeshift workshop that's [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=991.28s)]
*  difficult for Russian drones to spot. Ukraine's 47th Mechanized Brigade was only formed last year, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=999.12s)]
*  but its soldiers have seen some of the deadliest fighting in this war. The Bradley's armour was [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1008.0799999999999s)]
*  designed to protect American infantry troops moving through combat zones. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1014.4s)]
*  Now it's doing the same thing for Ukrainians. Wow, look at that. This machine survived a land mine [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1022.0s)]
*  and shrapnel from a Russian missile. Yeah, it's done some damage but it's still in one piece. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1029.12s)]
*  What happened to the guys who were inside? Are they safe? Yeah, I suppose they are safe in their life. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1034.8s)]
*  The US has sent 186 Bradleys here at a cost of around two million dollars a piece. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1042.32s)]
*  So it's saving your guys lives. Yes. Do any other vehicles save lives in that way? In my opinion [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1051.28s)]
*  and from my experience this is the best vehicle I have ever seen. You're all hidden here in the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1058.48s)]
*  forest? Yeah. Lieutenant Olexander Shershin is a former sales manager and a father of two who [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1064.56s)]
*  enlisted on February 24th 2022, the same day Russia invaded his country. What are those US weapons [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1071.04s)]
*  doing to the Russian military? What impact are they having? We can destroy them faster. We can [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1081.04s)]
*  see them far away. They're afraid really even. They're afraid of the American weapons? Yeah, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1087.76s)]
*  of course. How do you know that? Sometimes we can take prisoners and they tell what people [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1094.8s)]
*  are talking about inside their companies, their brigade. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1102.32s)]
*  The US has spent just over 43 billion dollars on military aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1108.32s)]
*  That's equivalent to about five percent of the American defense budget. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1116.56s)]
*  European countries combined have contributed around 30 billion. American rocket launches [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1121.04s)]
*  are now reaching deep into Russian occupied Ukraine and the Patriot air defense system [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1127.4399999999998s)]
*  is shielding millions of Ukrainian civilians from air strikes. Where would the Ukrainians be right [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1134.1599999999999s)]
*  now without US weapons? How much of their country would they have lost? Without that sort of aid I [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1140.24s)]
*  think Ukraine would have been probably overrun, defeated, certainly would have lost a lot more. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1145.84s)]
*  Lieutenant General Ben Hodges served as the commander of the US Army in Europe. He retired [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1153.36s)]
*  in 2017 and is now an advisor to NATO. Hodges told us the Biden administration has failed to [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1159.6s)]
*  explain to Americans what they're getting for their dollar in Ukraine. If you think about it, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1167.28s)]
*  Russia has been for decades and still is an existential threat for Europe and the United [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1173.36s)]
*  States. I mean just listen to what their leaders say, look at the thousands of nuclear weapons, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1178.8s)]
*  they clearly will keep going if they're not stopped. Sounds like you're saying stopping [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1183.04s)]
*  Vladimir Putin in Ukraine directly benefits every American. Absolutely. This war is about so much [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1187.68s)]
*  more than just Ukraine. Is this a high point for American foreign policy? It will be after Russia [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1195.28s)]
*  has been defeated. American taxpayers are financing more than just weapons. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1204.24s)]
*  We discovered the US government's buying seeds and fertiliser for Ukrainian farmers [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1211.36s)]
*  and covering the salaries of Ukraine's first responders, all 57,000 of them. That includes [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1217.84s)]
*  the team that trains this rescue dog named Joy to comb through the wreckage of Russian strikes [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1225.84s)]
*  looking for survivors. And the US also funds the divers who we saw clearing unexploded [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1232.16s)]
*  ammunition from the country's rivers to make them safe again for swimming and fishing. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1240.96s)]
*  Russia's invasion shrank Ukraine's economy by about a third. We were surprised to find that [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1247.2s)]
*  to keep it afloat, the US government is subsidising small businesses like Tatiana Abramova's knitwear [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1253.1200000000001s)]
*  company. These are Ukrainian town, that's Kiev I recognise. Yeah, you see, yeah. Especially in the [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1261.44s)]
*  condition of war, we have to work. We have to pay taxes, we have to pay weight, salary to our [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1268.16s)]
*  employees. We have to work. Don't stop. Why does that help Ukraine win the war? Because economy is [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1276.4s)]
*  the foundation of everything. American officials from USAID, the agency in charge of international [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1284.4s)]
*  development, helped Abramova find new customers overseas. In the midst of war, her company is [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1291.12s)]
*  supporting over 70 families. We realised that it's the aids from governments, but it's the aids from [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1298.8799999999999s)]
*  the heart of every ordinary American person. How do you feel about that? Grateful. Great. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1307.28s)]
*  Great. In total, America's pumped nearly $25 billion of non-military aid into Ukraine's economy [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1317.76s)]
*  since the invasion began. And you can see it working at the bustling farmers market on John [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1326.8799999999999s)]
*  McCain Street in central Kiev. People of Ukraine, this is your moment. The late senator is revered [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1333.04s)]
*  in Ukraine because he pushed the US government to start sending arms to the country after Russia [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1341.92s)]
*  first invaded back in 2014. While in Kiev, we learned that three of McCain's former colleagues [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1347.6s)]
*  were also in town. Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal and Republican [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1354.7199999999998s)]
*  Senator Lindsey Graham. They don't normally agree on much. Together though, they're some of the [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1360.7199999999998s)]
*  staunchest supporters of US funding for Ukraine's resistance. They're on track to break the Russian [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1366.6399999999999s)]
*  army. And the only way they could possibly lose is if we pull the plug on them. The wreckage of [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1373.1999999999998s)]
*  Russia's war machine was on display for Ukraine's Independence Day celebrations, even as almost a [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1380.3999999999999s)]
*  fifth of the country remains under occupation. People ask me, is it worth it? Here's what we've [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1386.7199999999998s)]
*  gotten for our investment. We haven't lost one soldier. We reduced the combat power of the [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1393.1999999999998s)]
*  Russian army by 50 percent. Not one of us has died in that endeavour. This is a great deal for [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1398.88s)]
*  America. You've previously said that it's the best money we've ever spent. That's still true? Since [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1405.3600000000001s)]
*  we helped Churchill stand up to the Nazis. We have to have confidence that the dollars we're [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1410.96s)]
*  spending are actually being spent in defense of the nation. All of that is important, but that's why [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1417.1200000000001s)]
*  we're here. The senators and other US officials told us there have been no substantiated cases [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1424.08s)]
*  of American weapons being diverted. The United States Department of Defense ought to be telling [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1430.96s)]
*  the story about oversight. We're monitoring, we're following every piece of equipment. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1436.0s)]
*  There has been no diversion, no evidence of misappropriation. This is an American success [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1441.6799999999998s)]

*  most corrupt country in Europe. Only Russia scores lower. You have to get rid of this cancer, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1461.68s)]
*  which is corruption, because otherwise we're not going to survive. Alexandra Yustinova was [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1468.48s)]
*  an anti-corruption activist and is now an outspoken member of Ukraine's parliament. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1475.76s)]
*  She chairs a government commission that tracks all military aid coming to Ukraine. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1483.52s)]
*  These javelins provided by the United States. She filmed this video for us inside what she called [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1488.56s)]
*  a top secret warehouse storing American javelin anti-tank missiles. We have online databases with [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1494.0s)]
*  the serial numbers of every American piece of weapon that your embassy has access to. They can [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1502.0s)]
*  come type in let's say a javelin or a Heimers and see in which brigade it is and then go check it [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1507.44s)]
*  if they don't believe. So the U.S. officials are going to the front line. We are letting them. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1513.6s)]
*  Sometimes they may be sending people. Sometimes they are going to the logistics centers to see [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1517.52s)]
*  whether it is there or not, whether it's available. That may be true now, but a report from the [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1522.48s)]
*  Pentagon's inspector general last year found the U.S. government was unable to monitor weapons [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1528.24s)]
*  transfers in the early months of the war, in part because the American embassy's staff was evacuated. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1534.24s)]
*  Criminal groups in Ukraine stole some weapons and equipment from the country's military, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1541.2s)]
*  though they were later recovered by Ukrainian intelligence services. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1546.16s)]
*  Yustinova claims that today systems are in place to make sure that never happens again. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1550.48s)]
*  So what are the stakes for Ukraine in making sure that U.S. supplied weapons don't go missing? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1556.24s)]
*  I can tell you that this is the number one priority for us because we're not stupid to [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1562.64s)]
*  shoot ourselves on the leg. We understand we would never made it without the United States [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1567.1200000000001s)]
*  and we are not going to make it without the United States. An American hotline for Ukrainians to [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1572.24s)]
*  report misuse of assistance from U.S. aid saw a ten-fold increase when these posters went up across [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1577.44s)]
*  the country earlier this year. American officials are now investigating four criminal cases [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1584.4s)]
*  involving non-military aid. And 170 Ukrainian government officials, including high-ranking [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1590.72s)]
*  military officers, have been charged in corruption cases so far this year for crimes like embezzlement [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1598.0800000000002s)]
*  and accepting bribes. Yustinova told us she considers that good news. If we didn't have [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1604.96s)]
*  anyone arrested, then that would be a question when people see all these corruption scandals [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1611.76s)]
*  but nobody goes to jail. So this life or death battle that Ukraine is fighting has made people [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1617.04s)]
*  here less tolerant of corruption? Yes. 100% of the Ukrainian budget now is being spent on the army. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1623.6s)]
*  It's someone's bulletproof vest, it's someone's helmet or someone's armed vehicle that was not [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1629.6s)]
*  there in time to save the lives. I think this tolerance is close to zero because they understand [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1638.0s)]
*  that now corruption kills. Ukraine is losing U.S. weapons on the battlefield but Lieutenant [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1643.28s)]
*  Shershin told us that's the only way they're losing them. Has anything gone missing? In my situation, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1651.52s)]
*  in my company, in our battalion, I don't know the case like this. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1659.68s)]
*  As the war grinds towards its third year, Ukrainians are dying in trenches, in the streets [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1669.6000000000001s)]
*  of their cities and in their own homes. The country's fighting for its survival, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1676.64s)]
*  bankrolled in large part by U.S. taxpayers. The outcome may be decided by America's willingness [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1686.72s)]
*  to keep paying. Some Americans say we're very sympathetic to you Ukrainians but we're going [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1694.16s)]
*  through tough times at home and we just can't afford to keep on supporting you. Ukrainians [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1701.6000000000001s)]
*  pay their lives and I believe and I hope that their lives cost much more than money, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1708.64s)]
*  much more than taxpayers' money. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1718.8s)]
*  This stopwatch has long been the symbol of 60 minutes but any measure of time is pointless [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1721.92s)]
*  for the subject of our next story, the slow moving sloth. You might think these distant relatives of [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1739.04s)]
*  the armadillo would make the perfect meal for just about anything faster and yet somehow sloths have [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1745.04s)]
*  been hanging on in one form or another for 64 million years. To understand this quirky animal, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1750.8s)]
*  we hung out with a quirky zoologist. Lucy Cook has been documenting the strange lives of sloths [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1757.76s)]
*  for 15 years. Cook was our guide on a trip to Costa Rica where scientists are making new [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1763.9199999999998s)]
*  discoveries about a creature that's turned survival of the fittest upside down. This is an area where [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1769.76s)]
*  there are lots of sloths so that we have that on our side. The first thing we learned about sloths [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1777.36s)]
*  is that it's hard to spot them in the wild. We were warned to keep our eyes on the ground for poisonous [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1782.9599999999998s)]
*  snakes as Lucy Cook scanned the treetops. The sloth is a master of disguise. It blends into the canopy [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1788.7199999999998s)]
*  and can easily be mistaken for a tuft of leaves. They tend to to hunker down when it rains so [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1796.7199999999998s)]
*  making it even harder to see them. Our luck improved on the beach. Oh there's one up there! [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1803.1999999999998s)]
*  She's just in the nook of the tree looking a bit like a termite hump and she's hunched over so what [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1810.1599999999999s)]
*  we're looking at is her back. That is not the side of the sloth we went all the way to Central [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1816.08s)]
*  America to see. So Lucy Cook took us to an animal sanctuary to get a better view of the two species [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1822.1599999999999s)]
*  of sloth that live here the bradipus and the two-toed. So the two-toed I always say look like [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1828.8s)]
*  a cross between a wookie and a pig because they've got that sort of beepable nose and then these ones [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1834.48s)]
*  have the sort of you know beetles, haircuts and and Mona Lisa smiles. Behind that ringer for Ringo, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1839.44s)]
*  Cook says, is a secret. Being nature's couch potato is the reason sloths have survived for more than [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1846.56s)]
*  60 million years in spite of well themselves. Their eyesight is lousy, their hearing not much [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1852.8s)]
*  better. In a tree they can move like a Tai Chi master to avoid the eyes of hungry birds of prey [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1860.6399999999999s)]
*  but on the ground Cook says gravity removes any shred of dignity. Even with a hurricane [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1868.08s)]
*  strength tailwind a sloth will top out at a half mile per hour. The first people that describe [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1874.6399999999999s)]
*  the sloths, the conquistadors that first observed them, they said terrible things. One said it was [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1880.72s)]
*  the stupidest animal that he'd ever seen and another said one more defect would make its life [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1885.92s)]
*  impossible and they just they just didn't understand them you know. Cook says what those early explorers [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1890.72s)]
*  didn't understand and what is frankly hard to believe when you watch the effort it takes for a [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1898.08s)]
*  sloth just to blink is that this hairy ninja is uniquely built to survive. Why so slow? Why do they [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1903.68s)]
*  move so slow? Because they're saving energy. They're vegetarians and leaves don't want to be eaten [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1911.8400000000001s)]
*  any more than antelope do right so they create a lot of toxins so the sloth can digest those toxins [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1917.6000000000001s)]
*  but only very very slowly. They don't want to process them fast and so they're all about burning [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1924.3200000000002s)]
*  as little energy as possible. Sloths spend about 90 percent of their lives hanging upside down [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1930.4s)]
*  and typically only climb to the ground for bathroom breaks once a week. With habits like that and nails [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1936.48s)]
*  like this you can understand why they are solitary creatures and prefer to be alone until they don't. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1943.2800000000002s)]
*  What they do is the females will climb to the top of a tree when they're in heat and scream for sex. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1950.8000000000002s)]
*  Really low key. Really low key but they scream in D sharp like that's the they make this I mean I'll do it and [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1957.2s)]
*  he may well on the strength of my impersonation let's see if Teddy who's a boy [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1963.76s)]
*  who's twice ready. Exactly let's just see if he goes okay I'm gonna do it. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1969.44s)]
*  That's right exactly let's just see if he goes okay I'm gonna do it. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1973.44s)]
*  I've actually seen bradipussis having sex it's the only thing they do quickly I mean it was [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1982.96s)]
*  I was shocked but then afterwards both male and female retreated and had the deepest snooze. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1988.3200000000002s)]
*  Behind Lucy Cook's cheeky sense of humor is a hefty resume. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=1996.56s)]
*  She has a master's degree from Oxford and published four books including two on slots. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2000.24s)]
*  She's also hosted wildlife programs for the BBC and National Geographic. The photos Cook takes [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2007.6s)]
*  on her expeditions have gone viral leading to donations for conservation and crowds at [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2014.0s)]
*  lectures that mix biology with stand-up. We humans are obsessed with speed. We idolize animals like [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2020.16s)]
*  the cheetah capable of doing nought to sixty in three seconds flat well so what. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2029.12s)]
*  Are they cute are they so ugly they're cute? Oh no they're cute surely but then I mean I [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2039.1999999999998s)]
*  think a naked mole rat's cute so you're asking the wrong person. You're like a beetleist animal. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2044.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah bats hyenas I mean there's like a whole list of animals that I think you know just have [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2049.92s)]
*  extraordinarily strange and wonderful lives and and just to me just add to the richness of [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2055.92s)]
*  of the universe. Just look how one of those bee list animals can leave Lucy Cook starstruck. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2064.88s)]
*  You guys have got to see this. As we were making our way through the Costa Rican rainforest Cook [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2071.44s)]
*  noticed this. What looks like fluffy golf balls she realized was a cluster of something we'd [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2077.84s)]
*  never heard of. Come and have a look. The elusive Caribbean white tent-making bats. Look [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2084.16s)]
*  they're they're they're bats but they're white and they and they live in these leaves. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2091.44s)]
*  I like my heart rate's gone right up I'm going to start pouring in sweat and I might start crying [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2095.44s)]
*  actually because it's just so I mean it's just a miracle of evolution I mean it's just why like why. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2099.3599999999997s)]
*  That sense of wonder that's about as exciting as it gets has made Lucy Cook a compelling advocate [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2105.6s)]
*  for sloths. Like them she looks at the world from a different point of view. Your latest book is [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2112.0s)]
*  called Bitch on the do apologize I really like you and your work but yeah my book's called Bitch. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2118.4s)]
*  In it Cook challenges the narrative that in the animal kingdom males are usually dominant and [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2127.68s)]
*  promiscuous while females are submissive and monogamous. She traveled the world to collaborate [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2132.88s)]
*  with scientists and study dozens of animals reporting how killer whale pods are led by post [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2139.92s)]
*  menopausal orcas and how tyrannical matriarchs control meerkat society. Her re-examination flips [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2146.16s)]
*  parts of Charles Darwin's theories upside down. Charles Darwin's a hero of mine I studied [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2153.44s)]
*  evolutionary biology but he was a Victorian man and so when he came to brand the female of the species [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2159.04s)]
*  she came out in the shape of a Victorian housewife. Passive, coy, chaste you know we were [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2168.08s)]
*  sort of a feminine footnote to the macho main event basically. I can hear people saying is this [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2175.4399999999996s)]
*  biological whulkness? Well it would be if it wasn't true. So you just have to ask the hyena for example [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2181.8399999999997s)]
*  the female spotted hyena if she's passive and coy and she'll laugh in your face after she's bitten [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2188.72s)]
*  it off you know it's like. Challenging conventional wisdom is a large part of Lucy Cook's crusade to [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2193.28s)]
*  improve the reputation of sloths but there is a more somber kind of rehabilitation she wanted to [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2199.52s)]
*  show us. This is the Toucan rescue ranch near Costa Rica's capital San Jose. So sloths are [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2205.92s)]
*  incredibly strong. They care for sloths nearly killed by power lines. How are the sloths injured? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2213.52s)]
*  So most of the time it's through electrocution where it'll just look like this straight vine [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2220.08s)]
*  you know going through the forest and so they'll grab a hold of that and then become electrocuted. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2225.2799999999997s)]
*  Leslie Howe was an occupational therapist who started the ranch 19 years ago. Now she has a [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2229.68s)]
*  team of six veterinarians to treat the electrical burns. Millions of years of evolution could not [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2235.12s)]
*  prepare the sloths for human sprawl but the vets told us they believe the sloth's slow metabolism [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2240.96s)]
*  somehow allows them to recover from injuries that might kill other creatures. The Toucan rescue [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2247.6s)]
*  ranch also takes in orphans. This is little Gio and this is Marilyn and then we have Landon here. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2254.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh he's a toddler. He's a toddler and this is our tiniest little Benji. Okay now my ovaries have [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2262.3199999999997s)]
*  cracked. It can take up to two years for the orphans to be ready to go back into the wild. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2269.2s)]
*  We watched as a female named Nisarro was prepared for release. She was given a final checkup and a [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2278.72s)]
*  tracking collar before getting a lift to a promising tree. Off she goes. And if she falls [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2284.96s)]
*  asleep in the middle of the release. Is that a bad thing? There she goes. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2292.88s)]
*  It's a scary one. Mission Impossible has nothing on this. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2302.7200000000003s)]
*  With that high drama behind us we headed down the Caribbean coast with Lucy Cook [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2310.32s)]
*  to visit another British scientist. Becky Cliff is conducting the first population study of sloths [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2315.44s)]
*  ever. That might seem like low-hanging fruit. It is not. Why is it so hard to get scientific data [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2322.16s)]
*  on sloths? They've evolved over the last 64 million years to be masters of disguise right. They are so [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2329.6s)]
*  good at pretending to be coconuts and bird nests then they're hiding from the very people who are [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2337.2s)]
*  trying to trying to help them. Neither of the sloth species in Costa Rica is officially considered [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2342.56s)]
*  endangered. But Cliff says her staff is suddenly seeing fewer sloths and some are suffering from [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2348.4s)]
*  an illness she suspects may be related to climate change. We're getting extreme periods of hot dry [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2354.1600000000003s)]
*  weather and then extreme periods of prolonged cold and rain and that is not what sloths have evolved [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2361.52s)]
*  to survive in. What we're discovering is that the microbes in the sloth's stomach that they use to [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2368.4s)]
*  digest the leaves they eat when the sloth gets too cold those microbes die so even though the [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2373.68s)]
*  sloth might be eating and looking well it's not digesting its food properly so they're losing [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2379.44s)]
*  energy and they're getting very weak. It sounds like they're starving to death but with a full [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2384.64s)]
*  stomach. That's exactly it. It's a really strange phenomenon that I think only happens in sloths but [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2389.2799999999997s)]
*  it's happening here. For Cliff to collect data she has to collect sloths. Which branch is she? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2394.88s)]
*  That's the full-time job for her colleague Devar Leon. He climbed barefoot up a three-story high [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2402.32s)]
*  tree covered in biting ants, snatching the sloth, then lowering it in a bag. Come on little one, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2409.2000000000003s)]
*  hi. That's impressive. So do you have to do that every time you want to get a sloth down? This is [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2416.0s)]
*  easy. Yeah. The stuffed sloth she's holding is not a gimmick. It was used to comfort the real one [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2421.6000000000004s)]
*  as we helped replace a memory chip in a tiny backpack the sloth wears. Oh you're very strong. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2427.68s)]
*  Very strong and then lean her back a little bit. Come on sweetie. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2434.16s)]
*  I'm going to clip those little things up. This is like dressing a baby. Yeah. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2440.56s)]
*  Done. What kind of information does this give you? We collect a lot of manual data in terms of what [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2446.16s)]
*  type of tree she's in, how high in the tree she is. There's also a data logger inside here which [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2453.76s)]
*  collects a lot of information about her behavior so even her micro body movements are being recorded [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2459.6000000000004s)]
*  inside there. There we go. Yeah that's a girl. 32 sloths will get backpacks and be returned [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2465.76s)]
*  slowly to the wild. Lucy Cook told us she hopes this study will provide a deeper understanding [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2474.0800000000004s)]
*  of an animal we can be too quick to judge. What can we learn from this sloth? We can learn how to [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2480.4s)]
*  be more slow and sustainable ourselves because we need to. You know we're destroying this planet at [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2487.12s)]
*  a an alarming rate and part of that is because of our addiction to speed and convenience. So if we [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2494.1600000000003s)]
*  took a few carefully slowly digested leaves out of the sloth's book you know we might save this [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2500.8s)]
*  beautiful planet and all of the amazing creatures that live on it. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2509.36s)]
*  The last minute of 60 minutes is sponsored by United Health Care. There for what matters. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2522.8s)]
*  Now an update on a story we first reported in April. Bill Whittaker spoke with January 6th [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2532.7200000000003s)]
*  writer Ray Epps. Epps and his wife were in hiding after the former marine and oath keeper [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2538.16s)]
*  became a target of tv conspiracy theorists offering no evidence they painted Epps as an FBI informant [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2543.44s)]
*  inciting the crowd. Did anyone from the federal government direct you to be here at the peace [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2550.56s)]
*  circle at this time? No. No one from the FBI? No. Your old comrades with the oath keepers? No. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2560.3199999999997s)]
*  Conspiracists called it suspicious that Epps wasn't charged for his role. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2570.0s)]
*  That changed this past week. Ray Epps pleaded guilty to entering a restricted area on the [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2574.3199999999997s)]
*  Capitol grounds. I'm Cecilia Vega. We'll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Mi_uy0gU&t=2579.84s)]
