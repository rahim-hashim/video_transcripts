# Reports on immigration and the U.S.-Mexico border | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [December 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ)
*  When he was less than a year old, Alejandro Mayorkas and his family came to the United [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=0.0s)]
*  States as refugees, fleeing Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=18.32s)]
*  Today, he's the first immigrant to head the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=22.7s)]
*  His portfolio includes everything from counterterrorism and cybersecurity to overseeing the Coast [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=28.04s)]
*  Guard and Secret Service. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  But it's what he's done, or not done, about the large number of migrants crossing the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=35.72s)]
*  U.S. border with Mexico that's prompted protests by migrant advocates and fiery attacks by [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=40.68s)]
*  Republicans who want to impeach him. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Tonight, you will hear from Secretary Mayorkas about the efforts to push him out of office [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  and why he refuses to call the situation on the southern border a crisis. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  Early morning is often the busiest time for illegal crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=61.68s)]
*  The day we went out with the U.S. Border Patrol near El Paso, Texas, was no exception. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  Before meeting the Cabinet Secretary in charge of securing the borders, we got a view from [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=74.72s)]
*  the field. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=79.88s)]
*  The Border Patrol reported over two million apprehensions in the past year, a record high. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=81.44s)]
*  Some migrants surrendered themselves to border agents with the intention of seeking asylum. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=87.28s)]
*  But the DHS estimates another 600,000 people evaded agents and entered the U.S. illegally, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=91.8s)]
*  the highest number in over a decade, which is why Secretary Mayorkas' testimony before [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=99.44s)]
*  Congress last fall raised a few eyebrows. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=105.36s)]
*  Secretary Mayorkas, do you continue to maintain that the border is secure? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  Yes, and we are working day in and day out to enhance its security, Congressman. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=112.8s)]
*  What the American people see is a border that looks to be chaotic, that looks to be porous. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, let's, I mean, the number of people that are arriving at our border is at an extraordinary [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=125.52s)]
*  height. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=133.04s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=134.32s)]
*  But that is not unique to the southern border of the United States. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=136.02s)]
*  There is a tremendous amount of movement throughout the hemisphere and, in fact, throughout the world. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=140.14000000000001s)]
*  The chief of the Border Patrol, Raul Ortiz, testified before Congress that some areas [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=146.10000000000002s)]
*  of the border are in a crisis situation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=150.5s)]
*  Do you agree? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=153.18s)]
*  I think that we face a very serious challenge in certain parts of the border. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=154.18s)]
*  Do you view what's happening right now on the border as a crisis? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=158.74s)]
*  I view it as a significant challenge. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=161.9s)]
*  Why won't you say the word crisis? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=164.3s)]
*  Because I have tremendous faith in the people of the Department of Homeland Security, and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=166.54s)]
*  a crisis speaks to me of a withdrawal from our mission, and we are only putting more [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=171.1s)]
*  force and more energy into it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=179.54s)]
*  Good morning, Secretary Mayorkas. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=181.66s)]
*  A lot of force and energy is now being directed at Secretary Mayorkas on Capitol Hill. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=183.38s)]
*  When you open up the border to the worst illegal immigration in our nation's history, people [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=189.22s)]
*  die. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=193.86s)]
*  This past week, Republicans took aim at the secretary, blaming him personally for the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=195.52s)]
*  drug deaths of Americans, the rape of migrant children and more. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=201.5s)]
*  How many murderers have you released into America? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=206.52s)]
*  Senator, I'm not aware of any murderer whom we've released into the... [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=208.8s)]
*  So you don't know? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  Senator, let me say something. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=215.52s)]
*  If you take a look at... [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=216.52s)]
*  No, no, you don't get to give a speech. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=217.52s)]
*  Congress seems to be more interested in impeaching you than passing immigration reform. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=219.8s)]
*  One member of Congress said he'd like to arrest you for negligent homicide for the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=224.3s)]
*  deaths of young people from fentanyl. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=228.06s)]
*  Nether compared you to Benedict Arnold. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=230.46s)]
*  I disregard that type of rhetoric. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=232.78s)]
*  I'm focused on the mission. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=236.9s)]
*  Do you think they're just trying to get you to resign? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=239.02s)]
*  I'm not going to resign. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=241.16000000000003s)]
*  I love public service. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=243.34s)]
*  I think it's an incredible honor to be a part of it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=245.54000000000002s)]
*  How often do you and President Biden discuss the situation at the border? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=250.24s)]
*  There's a perception that the president doesn't want to talk about the border. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  That's a false impression that I consider to be also political rhetoric. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  I was with the president when he visited the border. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=265.32s)]
*  I've spoken multiple times with the president. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=269.72s)]
*  I of course speak with the White House team on a regular basis and with my colleagues [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=272.72s)]
*  in the cabinet. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=280.04s)]
*  The problems at the border didn't start with the Biden administration and likely won't [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  end with it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=286.24s)]
*  Congress hasn't passed major immigration reform in nearly three decades. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=287.92s)]
*  Secretary Mayorkas is asking Congress for additional resources on the southern border. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  This is the first year since 2011 that we have added to the Border Patrol 300 more agents. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=298.44s)]
*  The fiscal year 2024 budget calls for 350 more Border Patrol agents, more than $100 [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=306.68s)]
*  million in technological investments. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=313.48s)]
*  Is there anything that's off the table that you won't do to secure the border? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=316.8s)]
*  Well the president, as I think you know very well, said we are not going to construct more [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=320.8s)]
*  a wall that costs billions and billions of dollars that is immovable and that is already [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=327.28s)]
*  beginning to corrode. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=334.67999999999995s)]
*  Secretary Mayorkas joined the Biden administration with a resume seemingly well suited for the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=337.23999999999995s)]
*  job. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=342.08s)]
*  He'd been the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles and deputy director of homeland security [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=343.08s)]
*  under President Obama. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=348.0s)]
*  He was also a refugee whose Romanian mother and Cuban father fled Cuba when he was an [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  infant. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=355.35999999999996s)]
*  I understand deeply the yearning of parents to give their children opportunities that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=356.44s)]
*  America offers. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=364.48s)]
*  We are a nation of laws. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=366.6s)]
*  If people qualify under the law then we embrace them. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  If they don't then we return them. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=373.32s)]
*  The first weeks in office the Biden administration halted deportations for 100 days, stopped [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=376.68s)]
*  border wall construction and suspended the remain in Mexico policy. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=381.68s)]
*  Critics say it all added up to putting a come in we're open sign on the door. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=386.56s)]
*  I don't think that the more than million people last year that we removed or expelled would [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  consider the border open. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=395.91999999999996s)]
*  But the messaging, was the messaging wrong there that you know we're open? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=397.94s)]
*  That wasn't our messaging. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=402.88s)]
*  But that was the messaging. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  But that's what migrants were getting. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=405.71999999999997s)]
*  I always remember something that we are not the only source of messages that the migrants [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=408.88s)]
*  receive. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=413.68s)]
*  We have smuggling organizations that exploit the migrants and those smuggling organizations [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=414.84s)]
*  engage in mis and disinformation. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=422.56s)]
*  In December according to border patrol figures an average of 1800 migrants a day crossed [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=426.48s)]
*  the border into the El Paso area overwhelming the city. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=432.2s)]
*  To manage the increasing flow of migrants from crisis stricken Nicaragua, Haiti and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  Cuba President Biden expanded the use of a public health law known as Title 42, invoked [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=441.78000000000003s)]

*  Mexico has agreed to allow to return up to 30,000 persons per month. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=453.18s)]
*  At the same time the administration unveiled new pathways for migrants to enter the US [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=459.02s)]
*  legally. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=464.34000000000003s)]
*  The people in this line at a border crossing in El Paso scheduled an appointment with [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=465.72s)]

*  It's both. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1555.04s)]

*  This summer, an image of desperation was captured on the bank of the Rio Grande. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1582.36s)]
*  If you saw the photo, you may never forget it. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1587.0s)]

*  But tonight, you'll hear from the only person who knows the story behind that photo, including [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1608.14s)]
*  the moment she saw her husband and daughter swept away. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1613.3000000000002s)]
*  Her name is Tanya Avalos, and last month in El Salvador, she told us her story. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1617.1000000000001s)]
*  This is the photo that appeared on the front page of newspapers. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1623.74s)]

*  That's her with her husband Oscar and daughter Valeria. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1638.98s)]
*  It was taken on Valeria's first birthday. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1642.5s)]
*  Tanya had not spoken to anyone about what happened to them, but she told us she wanted [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1647.0600000000002s)]
*  to talk about her faith. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1651.6200000000001s)]
*  So that was our first question. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1653.38s)]
*  Tell me about your faith and how your faith has kind of guided you through the last few [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1655.76s)]
*  months. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1659.5s)]
*  First, I'd like to thank God above all for the opportunity he's giving me to share a [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1661.5s)]
*  message with the world so they can see and think that sometimes bad decisions are really [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1669.66s)]
*  painful. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1683.02s)]
*  Tanya and Oscar met five years ago. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1684.34s)]
*  She told us she was attracted to his quiet confidence. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1687.38s)]
*  Ask anyone what's Oscar like, and they'll tell you wonderful things about him. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1691.0600000000002s)]
*  God gave me a good man. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1696.8200000000002s)]
*  He would say to me, I want to be a father. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1699.14s)]
*  I want to be a father of a little girl. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1702.8200000000002s)]

*  I have to study. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1707.7800000000002s)]
*  And so at the end, we formed a family. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1710.0600000000002s)]
*  The daughter Oscar wanted so badly was born in July of 2017. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1714.64s)]
*  Tanya showed us family photos. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1720.16s)]
*  Oh, she looks like daddy, too. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1721.96s)]
*  So cute. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1724.24s)]
*  Here she is, a year old, trying to learn to pronounce her own name, Valeria. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1725.24s)]
*  Tell me about Valeria. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1734.96s)]
*  My daughter was an extraordinary girl, very intelligent. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1737.2s)]
*  Everyone called her by her nickname, Kulochita, because she had curly hair. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1744.08s)]
*  She loved to dance. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1749.24s)]
*  I would go to work. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1751.28s)]
*  I had a job that took all of my time. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1753.28s)]
*  And I would say, for you, my love, for you, we do all this. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1757.32s)]
*  The young family lived on the outskirts of San Salvador in a suburb called San Martin. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1763.24s)]
*  It has the same problems as much of the country. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1772.24s)]
*  A third of its residents live on less than $5.50 a day, and gang violence is rampant. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1774.72s)]
*  El Salvador has the highest homicide rate of any country, not at war. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1781.76s)]
*  Tanya in Oscar's neighborhood was controlled by the Barrio 18 gang, which demands protection [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1788.04s)]
*  money from businesses and some people's paychecks. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1793.6000000000001s)]
*  Tanya worked at a Chinese restaurant, Oscar, at a pizza place. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1797.56s)]
*  They lived in this small house with his mother. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1801.92s)]
*  What were your dreams for your family? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1805.0400000000002s)]
*  What had you hoped? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1806.72s)]
*  Why did you leave home? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1807.72s)]
*  Our dream was to move our family forward. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1810.64s)]
*  Every human being has dreams. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1814.0s)]
*  Oscar was a person who would say, I don't want my mother to have to work. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1816.68s)]
*  I don't want my father to have to work. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1823.24s)]
*  I want us all to get ahead. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1826.3600000000001s)]
*  Oscar, 25 years old, sold his most valuable possession, his motorcycle. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1829.44s)]
*  And in March, the young family left El Salvador for the United States. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1835.2s)]
*  Their first stop was the city of Tapachula, on Mexico's border with Guatemala. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1839.8400000000001s)]
*  There, the family waited for a travel visa that would allow them to go through Mexico. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1845.32s)]
*  To support the family, Oscar worked at a food stand for $7.50 a day. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1851.72s)]
*  We stayed for two months in Tapachula. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1859.28s)]
*  Every day was a new day and a new challenge, but always in God's hands. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1862.88s)]
*  In Tapachula, Oscar met another Salvadoran, Milton Paredes. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1868.8s)]
*  The four of them decided to rent a room together and later to make the bus trip to the U.S. border. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1873.68s)]
*  Tanya told us they didn't have any money after they spent $300 on the bus tickets. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1879.92s)]
*  It took 32 hours to make the 1,000-mile trip. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1885.6s)]
*  They arrived in Matamoros, Mexico, in the early morning of Sunday, June 23. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1889.2s)]
*  The border town was a blistering waiting room for Central Americans hoping for asylum in the United States. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1896.16s)]
*  According to data from the Department of Homeland Security, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1903.04s)]
*  there was at least a two-month wait to see a U.S. immigration judge. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1906.4s)]
*  Even then, just two out of ten Salvadorans meet the threshold to be granted asylum. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1911.1200000000001s)]
*  Oscar, Tanya and Milton didn't know those odds when they got to Matamoros, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1918.0s)]
*  and they'd spent all of their money. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1922.3200000000002s)]
*  Soon after they arrived, they went to cross the main bridge [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1924.5600000000002s)]
*  that stretches over the Rio Grande to Brownsville, Texas. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1927.8400000000001s)]
*  But Tanya and Milton both told us they were stopped on the Mexican side by thugs [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1932.0s)]
*  who demanded $1,300 to pass over the bridge. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1937.1999999999998s)]
*  We probably spent a good amount of time walking around and thinking about what we were going to do. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1942.8799999999999s)]
*  So we thought, let's cross the river, because we don't have any money to pay someone [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1950.0s)]
*  to get us across to immigration. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1957.52s)]
*  Right then and there, we decided that we were going to cross the river. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1961.04s)]
*  This is where they went, the banks of the Rio Grande. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1968.08s)]
*  Known in Spanish as the Rio Bravo or Rough River, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1971.76s)]
*  here it's about 50 yards wide. America appeared to be in reach. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1975.36s)]
*  Tanya said they made the decision to swim across the river and enter the United States illegally. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1980.6399999999999s)]
*  We said to each other, the time is now. The time is now for us to do this. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1987.12s)]
*  Their improvised plan was to surrender to the U.S. Border Patrol once they got to the other side. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=1994.0s)]
*  Oscar swam across the river first to see if anyone would stop them. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2000.56s)]
*  He was signaling to us that no one was there. So then he came back, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2005.28s)]
*  because I was on the Mexican side with my daughter. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2010.32s)]
*  I said to him, I'm scared. And he said to me, everything's going to be fine. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2014.48s)]
*  The surface of the Rio Grande appears calm, but emergency responders in South Texas told us the [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2019.6s)]
*  river's current can be unpredictable and ferocious enough to suck you under. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2028.72s)]
*  Tanya couldn't swim, so they decided Milton, who was a strong swimmer, would carry her on his back. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2034.16s)]
*  Oscar decided to carry his daughter Valeria. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2040.72s)]
*  He put our daughter inside his shirt. Obviously, he couldn't carry her on top, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2044.48s)]
*  because she might fall off. But since he was thin and his shirt was very big, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2049.7599999999998s)]
*  our daughter fit perfectly inside. And he started to swim, and I followed behind him. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2056.08s)]
*  And I saw him doing okay. I mean, he was close, very close. And I noticed him starting to get [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2063.7599999999998s)]
*  frustrated. I could see that he was coming up and going under. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2071.12s)]
*  Tanya told us that in her panic, she was barely able to hold onto Milton as he turned back. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2079.2799999999997s)]
*  I swallowed so much water. I swallowed so much water. And I was desperate. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2086.24s)]
*  And I got out. I got out on the Mexican side. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2094.24s)]
*  And I could still see my husband there, struggling, struggling, along with my daughter. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2097.68s)]
*  I saw her. I saw her. And I said, my God, my Lord, please get them out of there. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2104.64s)]
*  And I just saw my husband giving me a glance. And then I couldn't see him anymore. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2117.2799999999997s)]
*  I could not see him anymore. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2127.04s)]
*  That's Tanya showing Mexican officers where she saw Oscar and Valeria last. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2132.32s)]
*  Divers suspended their search at sundown. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2138.0s)]
*  They took me to the migrant shelter in Matamoros. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2142.16s)]
*  When I walked in, I saw a lot of immigrants from different countries. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2145.84s)]
*  And I started telling them, don't sacrifice your children. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2152.56s)]
*  Pray to the Lord, and he will give you everything you want. But don't emigrate. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2157.84s)]
*  Oscar and Valeria's bodies were discovered the next morning, washed up on the Mexican side of [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2166.0s)]
*  the river. A photographer was there and snapped the now-famous photo, father and daughter in a [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2171.04s)]
*  final embrace. In the days that followed, the image became a global symbol of the crisis in [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2177.52s)]
*  America's southern border. The photograph that all of us saw this week should tear all of us up. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2184.64s)]
*  It prompted a brief moment of bipartisan reflection for a Congress deadlocked on immigration. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2193.2s)]
*  I hope that picture alone will catalyze this Congress, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2200.08s)]

*  That's because 17 years ago, Roberto and Helen, who was pregnant with their first child, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2561.6800000000003s)]

*  which mandated he be deported. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2591.2s)]
*  Your husband did break the law, didn't leave the country when he had told a judge that he would. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2593.12s)]
*  Why should he get special treatment when other people who have been waiting in line [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2600.24s)]
*  are trying to do it the right way? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2604.72s)]
*  My husband first of all broke the law because at the time when I was pregnant, I was very ill, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2606.56s)]
*  and he was at a high risk, either losing the baby or losing my life. So the decision he had to make [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2612.4799999999996s)]
*  was between me and the baby or him going back to Mexico. He chose us. But any other man, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2619.2799999999997s)]
*  what would they do in his shoes? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2625.6s)]
*  Helen says over the years they've spent more than $45,000 hiring attorneys to try to legalize [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2627.6s)]
*  Roberto's status. But it wasn't until three years ago that things started looking up for the [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2633.3599999999997s)]
*  barrisstains. Roberto obtained a temporary deferral of that deportation order, which meant he could [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2638.4s)]
*  get a work permit, a Social Security number and a driver's license. All he had to do was check in [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2644.48s)]
*  with the government once a year and prove he'd been in no trouble with the law. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2650.08s)]
*  He was excited. He says, I'm all legal now. I'm so good to go. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2654.7200000000003s)]
*  But it was still just a temporary status. He still had to check in with ICE every year. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2657.76s)]
*  Right. Exactly. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2660.88s)]
*  On February 6, shortly after President Trump signed his new executive order, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2662.96s)]

*  her husband would not be coming home. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2678.08s)]
*  He said, your husband is being detained because he is a fugitive. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2680.64s)]
*  I said, my husband is a fugitive. My husband is not running from you. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2684.88s)]
*  You need not come knock on my door to look for my husband. He came to you. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2688.16s)]
*  Why this year he is a fugitive? What happened? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2692.48s)]
*  Roberto was doing everything he was supposed to do, so he was an easy target. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2695.2s)]
*  He wasn't hiding. He wasn't living in the shadows. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2698.64s)]
*  Right. And so they grabbed somebody who was following the rules. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2701.28s)]
*  Most of you voted for Donald Trump. He said he was going to do this. He's done this. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2704.64s)]
*  Why are you surprised? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2709.36s)]
*  Because this is not the person he said he would deport. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2711.6800000000003s)]
*  And why would you deport somebody like that when you got so many other bad people out there? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2714.0s)]
*  It just doesn't make sense to me. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2720.1600000000003s)]
*  ICE declined to give us an interview, but in a statement, the agency said Barristan [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2722.48s)]
*  was detained because of that final order of removal in accordance with federal immigration law. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2726.88s)]
*  James Carofano, a policy expert at the Heritage Foundation and a member of Mr. Trump's transition [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2732.8s)]

*  It's not that they're going out and they're looking for people who have done nothing, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2743.12s)]
*  but that we have an obligation to enforce the law. And if somebody comes across our path who's [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2747.44s)]
*  broken the law, then you know what? They're probably going to go because the message is [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2751.9199999999996s)]

*  You're saying that deporting somebody like Roberto Barristan, it does send a message to [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2759.68s)]
*  others who may be thinking about coming here illegally. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2764.16s)]
*  I think that's absolutely true. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2766.56s)]
*  The number of people caught trying to cross the southern border has dropped 60 percent in the [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2768.4s)]
*  first three months of President Trump's administration. Apprehensions are now at a 17-year low. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2773.36s)]
*  Analysts we spoke to believe the president's tough new policies have discouraged border [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2779.2799999999997s)]

*  The average cost of deporting someone like Roberto Barristan is about $11,000. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2790.16s)]
*  His odyssey through the immigration detention system gives you some sense why. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2795.2s)]
*  Over the course of two months, he was moved from Indianapolis to Brazil, Indiana, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2800.48s)]

*  His family often didn't know where he was going or why he was being moved there. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2814.72s)]
*  Tell me something. Did they tell you when they're going to deport you? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2819.04s)]
*  We were at the house one evening when Roberto called. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2822.08s)]
*  So wait a minute. They said, no, Roberto, they said they were going to take you to Mexico City. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2825.44s)]
*  So now they're changing again? Okay. I love you. Be careful. Bye. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2829.84s)]
*  Sounded scared. I'm scared like what's going to happen to me. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2835.6800000000003s)]
*  The irony of what's happened is not lost on Roberto's wife. Like a lot of her friends and [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2841.92s)]
*  relatives, Helen Berestain also voted for President Trump. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2847.52s)]
*  You voted for him. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2852.16s)]
*  I voted for him because he said, we're going to make our economy better. I did like that idea. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2853.28s)]
*  And I said to Roberto, I said, you know what? You know, you're getting a small business [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2859.04s)]
*  and that's going to help you with your taxes. But he said, okay, well, you don't think he's [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2862.8s)]
*  going to deport us, all people. And I said... [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2866.4s)]
*  Roberto actually raised that idea. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2868.4s)]
*  Yeah, he did. And I said, Roberto, come on now. You got your documents. You obey the law. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2869.84s)]
*  You haven't done anything bad. You're not a criminal. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2874.24s)]
*  Are there times when you feel that you've made a terrible mistake? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2877.2799999999997s)]
*  Like they say, you should read the fine print first before you make a selection. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2880.8799999999997s)]
*  I sort of listened closely to those debates. That was a mistake I made. I didn't listen. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2886.64s)]
*  The Berestain's children, eight-year-old Dimitri, 14-year-old Jasmine and 16-year-old Maria, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2894.3999999999996s)]

*  Maria, did you know he wasn't a U.S. citizen? [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2903.8399999999997s)]
*  No. I didn't know. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2906.64s)]
*  He makes this home a home and he makes a family a family because he's, you know, the father. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2909.7599999999998s)]
*  And when he's gone, when you take that away from a family, he's like, it's all going down. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2916.16s)]
*  Like for my mom, it's very hard. And for us, it's hard too. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2922.24s)]
*  What did he say to you when you were talking on the phone? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2926.0s)]
*  The first thing he said was, you got A's? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2928.0s)]
*  He was asking about your school. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2931.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I'm like, yeah. And he's like, okay, good. Because I want you to become a [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2932.4s)]
*  lawyer. I was like, yeah, I'm going to become a lawyer. An attorney, I'm going to be an immigration [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2936.56s)]
*  attorney. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2941.2s)]
*  Since Roberto Berestain's detention has been in the news, the restaurant has received threatening [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2942.88s)]

*  When you voted for Trump, you were voting for every bigot who's coming after you, said another. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2953.6s)]
*  You got people hating people left and right. This is not America. This is not the America [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2958.96s)]

*  On April 4th at 10 p.m., Roberto Berestain was taken to this border crossing and deported to [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2969.36s)]
*  Juarez, Mexico. He spent the night at a shelter run by the Catholic Church. We found him there [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2974.88s)]
*  the next morning. He told us he was praying to be reunited with his family and was still somehow [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2980.48s)]
*  optimistic. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2986.32s)]
*  Wherever I go, they're going to be with me. Everything's going to be okay. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2987.2000000000003s)]
*  Either way or other way, we're going to be together. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2992.1600000000003s)]
*  If I was told that peaceful immigrants that are trying are in the process of becoming an [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=2994.8s)]
*  American citizen would be deported, I would not have voted for Trump. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3002.96s)]
*  Some people say, look, legal immigrants are coming here and they're taking jobs. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3006.32s)]
*  That's not even the case with Roberto. He employs, what, 20 people? He's not taking jobs. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3010.6400000000003s)]
*  He's creating jobs. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3016.4s)]
*  Is it a good use of resources to deport someone like Roberto Berestain? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3018.6400000000003s)]
*  That is part of the overall public good of demonstrating not just to Americans but to [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3022.24s)]
*  people around the world that American immigration laws are going to be enforced. That's an important [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3026.9599999999996s)]
*  message. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3031.7599999999998s)]
*  So there's no room for discretion? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3032.4799999999996s)]
*  Look, I don't enforce the law. I don't say there's room for discretion. I'm saying I don't [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3035.2s)]
*  necessarily think that just because somebody was nice in the 20 years they live here that they have [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3038.7999999999997s)]
*  a right to live here. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3043.2s)]
*  Roberto Berestain's lawyers are challenging the validity of that old order of removal that led to [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3044.7999999999997s)]
*  his deportation to Mexico. They may also apply for a special waiver for him to reenter the U.S. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3050.56s)]
*  but that can take two to three years. If he's denied, he'll be banned from returning for a decade. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3057.2799999999997s)]
*  There is a peaceful rebellion growing against federal immigration law and the interpretation [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3074.24s)]
*  of that law by the Trump administration. More than 800 houses of worship across the country [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3080.08s)]
*  have volunteered to shelter illegal immigrants and their families who face deportation, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3086.0s)]
*  daring federal agents to step through their stained glass doors. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3091.84s)]
*  The churches and synagogues are joining more than 600 cities and counties that have declared [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3096.56s)]
*  themselves sanctuaries, ordering their police not to detain people if it's only because of [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3102.56s)]
*  their immigration status. In no other venue of the law has so much of the nation stood in defiance [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3108.32s)]
*  of Washington. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3115.52s)]
*  Philadelphia's Arch Street Methodist Church was built by Abraham Lincoln's favorite minister. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3123.92s)]

*  By baptismal covenant, there's a vow that's taken either on my behalf when I was baptized as a child [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3139.52s)]
*  or as an adult that I would take the power and the freedom that God gives me to resist evil, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3144.56s)]
*  injustice, and oppression in whatever forms they show themselves. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3150.48s)]
*  Well, in your view, what is this, evil, injustice, or oppression? [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3155.52s)]
*  It's injustice and oppression, all of which is evil. Yeah, when human beings, human rights are [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3159.52s)]
*  denied, when they can't stay with their family, when they can't work, when they can't participate [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3164.64s)]
*  in the community in which they have deep roots, all of those apply. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3169.7599999999998s)]
*  He's talking about Javier Flores Garcia, who has lived in the church basement for six months. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3174.8s)]
*  He came from Mexico illegally in 1997. He's a landscaper with a decade-old DUI on his record. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3181.7599999999998s)]
*  His other offense is crossing the border repeatedly. A judge ordered him deported, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3189.6s)]
*  but he moved here rather than leave his three children who were born citizens. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3195.44s)]
*  I think you have to keep fighting, and I'm doing this for my kids, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3202.16s)]
*  and I would do it again if it became necessary. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3205.52s)]
*  We're taking the leap of faith, right, in many respects, because we don't know what's going to [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3208.16s)]
*  happen. Federal agents can arrest Flores in the church, but U.S. immigration and customs [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3212.08s)]
*  enforcement, known as ICE, has a decades-long policy of avoiding places of worship, schools, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3219.2799999999997s)]
*  and hospitals. My advice would be they should come out of the basement of the churches [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3226.0s)]
*  and follow the law. Daniel Ragsdale is deputy director of ICE. He runs the daily operations [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3230.64s)]
*  and oversees 13,000 officers. So if they are to check in with ICE, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3237.12s)]
*  they should come and check in with ICE. Checking in with ICE is going to get them deported. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3241.68s)]
*  Checking in with ICE will follow the law, and in cases where there's a removal order, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3246.3999999999996s)]
*  of course we would execute it. How much concern do you have about separating families [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3252.8799999999997s)]
*  and deportations? As a human being, I know it is traumatic for folks, but I will also say that the [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3257.2799999999997s)]
*  rule of law is something that America is built on. But this seems to be the one area where the [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3264.3999999999996s)]
*  narrative about separating families gets a little bit ratcheted up. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3270.72s)]
*  You can understand why. Well, I can, but I would suggest that [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3275.6s)]
*  every person who has come to the United States illegally, just like if I went somewhere and [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3280.48s)]
*  resided in violation of law, I could expect at some point that sovereign country to [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3287.04s)]
*  want to remove me. We're rounding them up in a very humane way and a very nice way, and they're [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3292.16s)]
*  going to be happy because they want to be legalized. Before the election, candidate Trump told us he [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3296.72s)]
*  would deport all of an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants. And by the way, I know it doesn't sound [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3303.3599999999997s)]
*  nice, but not everything is nice. Now, President Trump says he's pursuing violent criminal immigrants [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3311.2s)]
*  first. You see what's happening at the border. All of a sudden, for the first time, we're getting gang [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3318.8799999999997s)]
*  members out. We're getting drug lords out. We're getting really bad dudes out of this country [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3323.04s)]
*  and at a rate that nobody's ever seen before. And they're the bad ones. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3329.68s)]
*  It's not just the bad guys. The fact is, in the Trump administration, according to ICE, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3334.88s)]
*  about 11,000 undocumented people with no criminal records have been detained so far. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3340.56s)]
*  That's twice as many as last year. Because of this, the number of religious institutions [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3346.88s)]
*  across the country offering sanctuary has doubled to 800. Just last week, this church in Buffalo, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3353.76s)]
*  New York offered sanctuary to a family of six from Honduras. The church has opened its doors to 40 [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3362.32s)]
*  illegal immigrants since January. When congregations in cities including Phoenix, Denver, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3369.28s)]
*  and Philadelphia give sanctuary, they are in open defiance of immigration law. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3376.0s)]
*  That leads me to wonder whether there's any internal conflict within you. I mean, you preach [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3383.76s)]
*  morals and yet you're breaking the law. There's no conflict. I think I've said this before, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3390.0s)]
*  that when a law breaks the backs of God's people, then it's time for us to think about breaking those [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3395.92s)]
*  laws. Trouble is, those laws never stop changing. And that's one reason the immigration debate is [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3402.48s)]
*  never settled. Since 1790, Congress has rewritten immigration law on average about every four years. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3411.92s)]
*  America imported Chinese labor to build the transcontinental railroad. And when it was finished, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3422.2400000000002s)]
*  Congress banned all Chinese. In World War I, nearly 20% of U.S. forces were not citizens. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3428.72s)]
*  In World War II, America begged more than four million Mexicans to come to work. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3438.0s)]
*  And in 1986, Ronald Reagan granted amnesty to illegal immigrants. Day one, my first hour in [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3444.0s)]
*  office, those people are gone. Mr. Trump blames immigrants for violence. He often fired up his [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3453.12s)]
*  rallies by raising the murder by an illegal immigrant of a woman in San Francisco, a sanctuary [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3461.2s)]
*  city. But according to the Department of Justice, the incarceration rate for illegal immigrants [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3467.3599999999997s)]
*  is one-third that of citizens. To lay criminality at the feet of immigrants is not only morally [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3473.7599999999998s)]
*  unfair, it is factually wrong. One of Jim Kenny's first acts as mayor was to declare Philadelphia [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3481.6s)]
*  a sanctuary, which means his police do not ask about citizenship and will not hold illegal [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3488.96s)]
*  immigrants if the only reason is that ICE wants to deport them. He says it violates the Constitution [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3494.96s)]
*  to hold people without a warrant. There are more than 600 cities, counties, and states that consider [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3501.8399999999997s)]
*  themselves sanctuaries. Two years ago, there were half as many. We've ordered a crackdown on sanctuary [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3508.32s)]
*  cities. President Trump is now trying to cut off federal funds from these sanctuary cities, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3515.36s)]
*  but he's been stopped so far by the courts. This is not us versus them. This is we upholding the [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3520.6400000000003s)]
*  Constitution of the United States of America and asking them to comply with it also by presenting [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3527.52s)]
*  us with the proper judicial warrant so we can release that person to their custody. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3533.44s)]
*  The feds are talking about taking your federal money away, and Mr. Mayor, I bet you can't afford [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3538.96s)]
*  that. No, but think about the conundrum that this presented. If you accept the assertion that [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3543.6800000000003s)]
*  undocumented immigrants cause crime, which I do not accept and I think it's wrong, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3551.6s)]
*  why would you defund police departments? Well, you know, there are people shouting at the [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3555.6800000000003s)]
*  television right now saying if they came illegally, they shouldn't be here. It's a [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3558.96s)]
*  terrible thing, but they shouldn't have come. Well, you know, Ellis Island opened in 1892. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3564.16s)]
*  The bulk of Irish diaspora came to America in the 1840s. We didn't have papers either. We were [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3569.12s)]
*  undocumented. There was an anti-Italian slur when I was growing up in my neighborhood called WOP. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3573.84s)]
*  That's without papers. If you come through the country without documents because you're starving [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3579.2s)]
*  in your country or you're being held hostage by drug dealers or you're afraid your children are [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3583.84s)]
*  going to be shot in the streets or on their farm, I think that that's self-preservation and [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3587.28s)]
*  self-survival. Any group of people would flock to America because that's been the historic place [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3591.6000000000004s)]
*  where people came to be saved. This is my country. I'm working hard. Sixto Paz would have been [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3597.44s)]
*  deported 10 months ago if he hadn't confined himself to Shadow Rock United Church of Christ [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3603.76s)]
*  in Phoenix. Good morning. Ismael Delgado moved in four months ago. We came to work. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3610.0800000000004s)]
*  Paz crossed illegally in 1985. Under the policy of President Reagan, he was granted a work permit, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3616.72s)]
*  which was revoked under the policies of George W. Bush. His four children are citizens by birth. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3623.92s)]
*  His youngest is five. I spent 32 years over here and I don't want to leave it alone. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3634.0s)]
*  And I paid my taxes for 28 years. Paid your taxes 28 years. Yes. There are people watching [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3641.04s)]
*  the interview who are saying you shouldn't have come here. When someone you got hungry, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3647.2s)]
*  you don't have a job, you don't have money. What do you want to do? I'm not come to United States [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3653.6s)]
*  to take vacation, man. I'm here because I had to. That's why I'm come over here [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3660.24s)]
*  and I respect all the law. I respect the people are working hard to do the best. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3671.52s)]
*  I got a clean record and I learned a lot over here. I learned a language. I don't speak very well, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3678.8799999999997s)]
*  but I'm working a lot and my son, my daughter is a professional. You have two older daughters who [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3688.0s)]
*  are medical assistants. They both graduated from college here in the United States. Yes, sir. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3696.4s)]
*  Sounds like the American dream. Yes. If the priority is serious criminal offenders, why are [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3701.04s)]
*  we seeing deportation orders for little old ladies and middle-aged men who've never committed a crime? [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3707.52s)]
*  That's a great question. So if someone who was placed in removal proceedings goes through that [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3713.12s)]
*  entire process, again, all the taxpayer expense and gets a removal order, if we encounter that [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3716.88s)]
*  person and that order has been litigated and challenged and due process has been met, it's [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3722.96s)]
*  odd that anyone would expect us to simply ignore all those decisions by lawyers, by judges, by [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3729.6s)]
*  federal court judges in some cases and simply say, we're going to make policy on the street and ignore [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3736.08s)]
*  it. One of the changes in the guidance from the Obama administration to the Trump administration [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3741.52s)]
*  is that president Trump's executive order prioritizes the removal of those who entered [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3745.92s)]
*  illegally. Well, that's everybody. That's 11 million people. We only have the same size [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3751.84s)]
*  workforce. There's just no way that that could simply be done in any rapid fashion, which is why [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3759.84s)]
*  we are still focusing on the folks that I talked about, which are people that present the greatest [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3764.88s)]
*  risk to public safety. Javier embodies the spirit of sanctuary. He and we together are sanctuary. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3769.2s)]
*  Do you worry that the government might take steps against sanctuary congregations across the country? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3777.68s)]
*  I do worry about that. I think it would be a huge breach of the age-old traditions of providing, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3785.4399999999996s)]
*  at least having some place in our civil society where there's an opportunity to challenge [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3794.64s)]
*  laws and policies and procedures that are creating more injustice than they are creating justice. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3802.96s)]
*  In rare cases, ICE officers have made arrests near schools and churches. A man was arrested [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3810.0s)]
*  in California, dropping his child at school, and in Virginia, several illegal immigrants were [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3816.7999999999997s)]
*  arrested shortly after walking out of this church, leaving many to wonder, where are the lines once [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3822.48s)]
*  the border's been crossed? Those are the laws that Congress has passed. I don't think it's anybody's [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3830.08s)]
*  question that if you don't have lawful status, that at some point you could be removed, [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3836.56s)]
*  and I think that's something that people should be aware of. And again, I think the president, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3844.32s)]
*  when he announced the program, was pretty clear about that. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw9isFmFjYQ&t=3847.68s)]
