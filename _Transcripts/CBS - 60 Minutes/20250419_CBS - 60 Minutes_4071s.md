# Stolen Babies | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc)
*  Ever since it went up in 1961, it was no secret. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=0.0s)]
*  East Germans knew if they tried to escape over the Berlin Wall, they would be shot. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=15.58s)]
*  Everybody knew it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=20.94s)]
*  But until the wall came down, what hardly anybody knew was that East Germans, who dared [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=22.2s)]
*  to defy the government, could have their children taken away and given to families to raise [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=27.36s)]
*  as loyal communists. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=32.8s)]
*  Children of the Berlin Wall is the story of that up to now dirty little secret. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=35.28s)]
*  In 1968, Gabrielle Jonin was a political dissident living in East Berlin when she learned she [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  was about to be arrested. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=47.8s)]
*  Her son's father was already in prison, accused of being a spy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=50.16s)]
*  But Gabrielle managed to escape by clinging to the bottom of a truck that was heading [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=54.76s)]
*  across the border. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=59.68s)]
*  Why didn't you take your son with you? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=61.08s)]
*  Because this way was so dangerous that only it's a miracle that I survived. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=64.52s)]
*  So how could I take my child there? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=69.88s)]
*  Gabrielle left her son, Todi, with her parents, hoping the East German government would let [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=73.6s)]
*  him join her in West Germany. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=78.7s)]
*  Instead, without telling her why, the police took the boy away, changed his name, and put [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=81.48s)]
*  him up for adoption. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=88.48s)]
*  Gabrielle took us to the spot where she last saw her three-year-old son on her birthday [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=92.32s)]
*  in 1969. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=96.8s)]
*  She was in West Berlin, and he was in the East. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=99.28s)]
*  A friend brought the boy to a spot just across the wall where his mother could see him. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=102.12s)]
*  It was just a wonderful possibility to see on my birthday my son. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=108.0s)]
*  And I did never know this would be the last time for 20 years then. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=113.0s)]
*  You're still feeling it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=117.64s)]
*  I can see this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=119.84s)]
*  That was September 18, 1969. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=122.92s)]
*  1969, yes. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=125.4s)]
*  Gabrielle Jonnen was the first victim of East Germany's practice of taking children from [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=127.8s)]
*  parents whose only crime was that they had opposed the politics of the communist government. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=132.67999999999998s)]
*  JÃ¼rgen Schmidt is the spokesman for the current German Ministry of Justice. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=139.16s)]
*  They used this form of forced adoption to scare political dissidents so that they always [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=143.72s)]
*  could say, if you don't act in the right way, it could be that we take your child away. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  Gabrielle remarried and had another son, but she continued her search for Todi. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=161.64s)]
*  The East German government wouldn't even tell her if he was alive. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=167.55999999999997s)]
*  They felt they had a right to take him away and have him brought up as a communist child [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=171.48s)]
*  in a communist country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=176.98s)]
*  And so Todi became Arne Gram, the child of Christel and Werner Gram, an infertile couple, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=178.83999999999997s)]
*  loyal party members. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=185.94s)]
*  On German television, Werner Gram described his first meeting with the boy at an orphanage. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  He came up to me and the first thing he said was, are you my daddy? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=195.27999999999997s)]
*  I said yes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=199.04s)]
*  He looked so nice and friendly. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=200.2s)]
*  I liked him right away. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=201.72s)]
*  We decided right then to take him. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=203.44s)]
*  What he didn't say was that he and his wife knew from the beginning that the child's mother [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=206.56s)]
*  was looking for him and wanted him back. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  They also never told Arne Gram he was adopted. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=214.9s)]
*  I had some memories about situations with my grandfather, my real grandfather. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=218.26000000000002s)]
*  And I asked my adopt parents for this and they said, you had a dream. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=226.02s)]
*  Arne learned the truth when he was a teenager and had turned against his communist upbringing. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=234.74s)]
*  He wanted to escape to the West. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=240.57999999999998s)]
*  And a relative who knew the family secret told him he had a mother in West Berlin. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=243.34s)]
*  Arne sent Gabrielle a picture of himself. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=249.66s)]
*  When I saw the picture, then it was this feeling. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=252.73999999999998s)]
*  Now I have him. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=256.5s)]
*  And this was a great day. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=258.42s)]
*  Then you spoke to him on the telephone. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=262.7s)]
*  Yeah, this was the next step. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=264.21999999999997s)]
*  I said, hello, Toti. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=266.86s)]
*  You are beautiful. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=268.94s)]
*  You look beautiful. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=270.42s)]
*  I said, you too. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=271.42s)]
*  But how can I call you? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=273.38000000000005s)]
*  Oh, no problem. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=275.3s)]
*  You call me mom, I told him. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=276.62s)]
*  He did. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=279.18s)]
*  Six months later, the East German government gave Arne Gram permission to go to West Germany. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=281.82000000000005s)]
*  After 19 years, mother and son were reunited. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=287.66s)]
*  Heike Solmann also lost her son six years ago and still doesn't know what happened to him. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=292.54s)]
*  The secret police arrested her in 1985 for plotting to leave the country and sent her [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=299.22s)]
*  to the Hohenegg prison where political dissidents were often incarcerated. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=305.18s)]
*  While she was there, authorities told her that her two-year-old son, Alexander, had [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=310.42s)]
*  been given to another family. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=315.62s)]
*  My life is over and I don't value my life. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=318.34s)]
*  I didn't want to live. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=322.02s)]
*  I went on a hunger strike for 12 days because life had no meaning for me anymore without [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=323.74s)]
*  my child. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=328.85999999999996s)]
*  Solmann was released from prison last year. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=330.58s)]
*  Her son Alexander is eight years old. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=333.7s)]
*  Do you know where your son is right now? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=336.97999999999996s)]
*  Do you know what family adopted him? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=339.26s)]
*  None. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=343.06s)]
*  Do you know if he's alive? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=344.58s)]
*  None. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=346.26s)]
*  Throughout all the years these women were looking for their sons, the dictator Erich [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=347.54s)]
*  Honecker was in power in East Germany. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=352.38s)]
*  His lawyer, Friedrich Wolff, denies, as he does, that there were ever any forced adoptions. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=355.42s)]
*  Do you believe if it could be proved that a mother had her child taken away from her [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=361.62s)]
*  merely because of the mother's political views, that someone should be punished for that? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=367.06s)]
*  Surely, if there is such a case, the person should be punished, but you won't find such [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=373.98s)]
*  a case. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=382.90000000000003s)]
*  But Marcus Zimmerman, a politician who turned against his East German upbringing, found [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=385.18s)]
*  evidence of eight cases in East Berlin right in the basement of the city's education ministry. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=390.02000000000004s)]
*  No one knows how many forced adoptions there were throughout the whole country. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=396.44000000000005s)]
*  This is way down here in the basement. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=401.46s)]
*  Along with thousands of files containing records of normal adoptions, Zimmerman found a separate [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=405.38s)]
*  packet on the top shelf, carefully wrapped in newspaper, that held the files of the forced [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=411.14s)]
*  adoptions. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=416.82s)]
*  According to the files, the youth authorities put the children in orphanages, then had the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=417.82s)]
*  courts take custody away from the parents and give it to the state, calling the parents [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=423.29999999999995s)]
*  unfit. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=428.34s)]
*  It was all legal under East German law. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=430.3s)]
*  At first I couldn't believe what I was reading. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=437.06s)]
*  It was like something that could have happened in the Third Reich. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=439.22s)]
*  The current German government says parents have just two more years to find their children. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=444.18s)]
*  Otherwise, the forced adoptions will be considered final. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=450.02s)]
*  That's because the government isn't sure that reuniting families is in the best interests [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=454.14s)]
*  of the children. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=458.9s)]
*  Take the case of Jeannette Grubel. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=460.65999999999997s)]
*  Seventeen years ago, when she was three, border guards caught her family trying to escape [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=462.78s)]
*  by car. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=468.17999999999995s)]
*  Her parents were sent to prison and she was sent to live with a more patriotic family. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=469.94s)]
*  I know that I was adopted, but I didn't know that it was a forced adoption because my adoptive [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=475.5s)]
*  parents told me that my real parents may be dead. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=484.5s)]
*  She finally met her real parents last year. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=488.8s)]
*  But the reunion has been difficult, both for Jeannette and for her parents. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=492.08s)]
*  They only have the memory of me as a little child. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=498.0s)]
*  And they couldn't find this little child in my person now when I was older. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=504.84000000000003s)]
*  When we asked her how this made her feel, she simply said, lost. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=511.90000000000003s)]
*  All of the reunions we heard about between parents and their children have been painful, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=518.28s)]
*  especially the reunion of the Schutze family. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=522.9599999999999s)]
*  Ilse and Dieter Schutze were separated from their baby daughter Svetlana twenty years [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=526.4399999999999s)]
*  ago after the East German government expelled them from the country. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=531.28s)]
*  They were told Svetlana would be sent to join them soon, but she never came. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=536.56s)]
*  Last year, after two decades of searching, they found her. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=542.48s)]
*  But she refused to speak to them, saying her adoptive parents told her the Schutzes [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=546.88s)]
*  had willingly abandoned her. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=551.48s)]
*  They decided to try again, and accompanied by cameras from Spiegel TV, they made the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=554.08s)]
*  600-mile drive from their home to the small town of Stasforth in what used to be East [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=560.08s)]
*  Germany, where Svetlana works in a daycare center. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=565.8s)]
*  When Svetlana appeared, her parents said, let's talk. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=574.68s)]
*  I don't want to, she answered. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=578.64s)]
*  Then her mother cried and begged her to listen to the truth. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=581.64s)]
*  You're accusing me of having left you behind, she said. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=585.8s)]
*  Please let me clear that up. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=589.04s)]
*  But Svetlana once again would have nothing to do with them. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=591.9599999999999s)]
*  The Schutzes were devastated by the exchange. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=597.7199999999999s)]
*  They say they only want their daughter to know that they love her and that she was taken [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=601.1s)]
*  against their will. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=605.76s)]
*  But this scene took place last May, and their daughter still refuses to speak to them. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=608.0s)]
*  Even Gabrielle Jonen and her son, Anna Graham, turned out to have some problems. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=617.08s)]
*  So it's not entirely a happy ending? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=622.62s)]
*  No. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=625.26s)]
*  After this big happiness was over, it was clear that he could not break the relation [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=626.68s)]
*  to his parents, that he could not look at me as a mother. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=632.6s)]
*  He told us he feels closer to the family that raised him. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=637.1s)]
*  My real mother on the West Side wanted a decision from me between her and my parents, and that's [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=641.04s)]
*  not possible. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=649.4s)]
*  At first, Arna moved in with his mother. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=651.62s)]
*  But it soon turned out, and this is as much a part of the tragedy as anything, that instead [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=654.38s)]
*  of adoring him, she wasn't even sure she liked him. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=660.28s)]
*  He certainly wasn't the person she would have raised. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=664.34s)]
*  Gabrielle loves literature. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=668.04s)]
*  She speaks five languages. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=670.0s)]
*  Her younger son, David, is an accomplished violinist who attended the best schools. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=674.28s)]
*  Arna was quite something else. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=680.9s)]
*  I was a bit disappointed. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=683.76s)]
*  By what? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=686.78s)]
*  Not at all very good educated. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=688.0799999999999s)]
*  Under his mother's influence, Arna went back to school. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=691.28s)]
*  But their relationship remains strained. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=694.76s)]
*  Gabrielle knows they will never be more than friends. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=697.64s)]
*  The parents we spoke to complained bitterly that former East German authorities still [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=704.4s)]
*  deny there ever was a practice of forced adoptions for political reasons. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=708.94s)]
*  There still has not been one person to admit any sense of guilt. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=713.58s)]
*  Not one person has been made to step forward and say, we did something morally wrong. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=717.82s)]
*  The person most parents blame is Margo Honecker, wife of the former dictator, Erich Honecker. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=723.3000000000001s)]
*  She was the head of the East German Youth Ministry, and everyone we spoke to believes [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=730.48s)]
*  she knew about the forced adoptions and approved them. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=735.64s)]
*  But she denies it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=738.8000000000001s)]
*  And remains a free woman because the new German government says she can't be arrested without [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=745.52s)]
*  solid proof she was involved. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=750.32s)]
*  But Gabrielle Yonan is not content to wait for the slow wheels of German justice to turn. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=755.52s)]
*  She went searching for the woman who signed her son's adoption papers. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=761.24s)]
*  Her name is Eva Krebs, and she found her walking down a street in East Berlin, retired from [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=765.86s)]
*  her job in the Youth Ministry, and collecting a government pension. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=771.9s)]
*  I've been waiting for 20 years, Gabrielle said, and I want to know why you did this [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=776.0600000000001s)]
*  to me. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=782.22s)]
*  Eva Krebs refused to answer. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=784.22s)]
*  But Gabrielle has found a way to make her talk. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=787.1s)]
*  She's taking Krebs to court. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=790.28s)]
*  They stole my son, the system won, I can say. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=792.28s)]
*  I did not get back my son as a son. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=797.4s)]
*  It's impossible for Ukrainian families to shield their children from the constant violence [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=810.16s)]
*  of Russia's war. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=814.52s)]
*  But tonight we'll tell you about a lesser known and perhaps more sinister danger they [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=816.16s)]
*  face, the Russian abduction of Ukrainian children. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=820.24s)]
*  In the chaos of war, exact numbers are hard to come by. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=824.4399999999999s)]
*  Officially, the Ukrainian government has documented more than 19,000 children taken by Russia, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=827.9399999999999s)]
*  but told us they worry the actual number could be closer to 300,000 children. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=834.14s)]
*  The International Criminal Court has charged Russian President Vladimir Putin and his commissioner [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=839.9s)]
*  for children's rights with the war crimes of unlawful deportation and transfer of children. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=844.62s)]
*  This summer, we followed one Ukrainian grandmother on an undercover mission deep into enemy territory [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=851.0s)]
*  to find her grandson before he completely disappeared. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=856.82s)]
*  Polina packed what little she could and caught a 20-hour train from Poland to Kiev to meet [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=867.82s)]
*  with a nonprofit called Save Ukraine. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=872.74s)]
*  They promised to help her find 9-year-old Nikita. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=876.46s)]
*  She traveled light, but carried the weight of a grandmother's worry. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=879.9000000000001s)]
*  He means everything to me. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=885.6600000000001s)]
*  He's my air, my sky, my water. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=887.5s)]
*  I live for him. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=890.4200000000001s)]
*  He's my life. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=891.9000000000001s)]
*  I love him very much. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=892.9000000000001s)]
*  Polina, who asked us not to use her last name, is in the process of filing for guardianship [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=895.38s)]
*  of her grandson. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=901.06s)]
*  She left Ukraine so she could work to support Nikita, who has special needs. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=902.6999999999999s)]
*  The Russian Federation stole him. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=909.22s)]
*  They abducted him. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=911.26s)]
*  Did the Russians ask anyone for permission to move Nikita? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=912.9s)]
*  Did they tell anyone they were moving him? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=918.5s)]
*  No, they didn't tell anyone anything. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=921.06s)]
*  They simply removed him and hid him. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=924.62s)]
*  Last October, Nikita was living in a boarding school for disabled children when the Russian [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=928.98s)]
*  authorities ordered all 86 kids there to be transferred deeper into Russian-controlled [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=933.38s)]
*  territory. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=938.5799999999999s)]
*  I came home after work. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=939.5799999999999s)]
*  I opened Instagram, and there was a picture of my child, Nikita, with a caption, Russia [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=942.5s)]
*  is taking children. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=949.06s)]
*  Polina says the Russians played a cruel game of hide-and-seek, moving Nikita at least three [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=951.06s)]
*  times in eight months, including to an orphanage in Russia. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=956.5s)]
*  What were those eight months like for you? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=961.14s)]
*  Really bad. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=964.3s)]
*  Really bad. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=965.5799999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't sleep at night. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=966.86s)]
*  I didn't want to go to work. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=969.74s)]
*  I didn't even want to live because I had no one to live for. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=971.86s)]
*  And then I found this website Save Ukraine on Facebook, and I called them. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=978.54s)]
*  The phones never seem to stop ringing at the Save Ukraine headquarters in Kyiv. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=983.54s)]
*  So far, they've rescued more than 200 kids, from kindergartners to teenagers. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=994.54s)]
*  We met the founder, Mikola Kuleba, at one of Save Ukraine's shelters for reunited families. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1001.9399999999999s)]
*  How long do the families stay here? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1007.38s)]
*  Up to three months. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1010.26s)]
*  Kuleba served as Ukraine's presidential commissioner for children's rights for nearly eight years. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1011.3s)]
*  Now he runs these secret rescue missions, which rely on an underground network of safe [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1018.06s)]
*  houses and volunteers, including Russians who opposed the war. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1023.12s)]
*  I can't tell you how many organizations involved and volunteers. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1027.42s)]
*  Dozens? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1032.74s)]
*  Maybe hundreds. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1033.74s)]
*  Hundreds. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1034.74s)]
*  Is there one piece of advice that every mother must know before she starts this journey? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1035.86s)]
*  We explain in them that Russians will intimidate you. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1042.06s)]
*  They will be doing everything to stop you, to provoke you. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1046.7s)]
*  That's why you should focus on your child. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1052.82s)]
*  Your goal is to take your child and not be afraid. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1056.54s)]
*  But it's hard not to be afraid. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1062.74s)]
*  These women have to travel alone while the men stay behind to fight. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1065.02s)]
*  Just before the mothers leave, they get a safety briefing where they learn how to craft [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1070.46s)]
*  cover stories for when, inevitably, they are interrogated by Russian forces. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1074.5s)]
*  When they return, their stories become evidence that Save Ukraine sends to the International [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1081.1399999999999s)]
*  Criminal Court. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1085.86s)]
*  Russia's goal, Kuleba says, is to steal the Ukrainian kids' future by erasing their past. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1089.86s)]
*  They are plans to destroy Ukrainian identity. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1096.62s)]
*  They brainwash them, indoctrinate them, russify them. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1101.02s)]
*  They have special classes for Ukrainian children when they teach them what is the Russian Empire, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1105.58s)]
*  what future they can have in Russia. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1113.54s)]
*  About Ukraine, it's only bad things. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1117.54s)]
*  What risk do these children pose to Russia if they come back home into Ukraine? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1120.42s)]
*  Every child is a war crime witness. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1125.6200000000001s)]

*  Vlad Rudenko was 16 when he was taken last October. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1132.8200000000002s)]
*  He says armed men showed up at his door while his mother, Tetiana Bodak, was out. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1136.5s)]
*  They told me, you need to pack your things. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1142.8200000000002s)]
*  I said, I will call my mom. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1145.34s)]
*  They said, don't bother. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1148.6599999999999s)]
*  You're coming with us anyway. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1149.8999999999999s)]
*  After that, Vlad says he was ordered to board a bus, part of a 16-vehicle convoy full of [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1152.1s)]
*  kids that drove to a camp in Russian-controlled Crimea. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1157.4599999999998s)]

*  But we've learned Russia often pressures poor Ukrainian parents to send their children to [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1167.1399999999999s)]
*  schools and these camps, where the kids spend their days with Russian children. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1174.1s)]
*  Images of happy kids are the propaganda Russia wants the world to see. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1178.98s)]
*  But several Ukrainian kids told us what happens in these camps is less about recreation and [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1184.98s)]
*  more about indoctrination. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1190.78s)]
*  They are told repeated lies, like Ukraine lost the war and their parents don't want [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1193.1799999999998s)]
*  them. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1198.1s)]
*  Vlad secretly sent his mother this video and said speaking Ukrainian, talking about Ukraine [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1202.98s)]
*  or even wearing Ukraine's colors was forbidden. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1208.62s)]
*  Every morning at a camp like this, Vlad told us that Ukrainian children were forced to [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1214.06s)]
*  sing the Russian national anthem. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1218.66s)]
*  Vlad refused to fall in line. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1221.34s)]
*  One night he decided to take down the Russian flag. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1223.6399999999999s)]
*  And then what happened? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1227.3799999999999s)]
*  They came over and told me to pack up. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1229.3s)]
*  They said we are going to the detention ward. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1231.86s)]
*  So we went to the ward and I said, I'm not staying here, I'll break everything in here. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1235.7s)]
*  They told me we'll call a psychiatric hospital for you then. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1241.86s)]
*  But in the end they locked me up anyway in the detention ward for five days. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1246.02s)]
*  You were in isolation for five days? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1250.4199999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1253.58s)]
*  One more day and I probably would have hanged myself. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1256.1399999999999s)]
*  Tatiana, what do you think when you hear that? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1259.3799999999999s)]
*  I can't. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1263.6999999999998s)]
*  I just can't find the words because there is a lot of things he didn't tell me. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1264.6999999999998s)]
*  And maybe I'm scared to find out something that I'd better not know. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1271.54s)]
*  By the time Tatiana rescued Vlad with Save Ukraine's help, she had lost eight months [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1278.06s)]
*  with her son. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1283.1s)]
*  Did he look different to you? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1284.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1286.6599999999999s)]
*  I remember he left as a kid, but then when I met him again, I saw a man with an adult [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1288.22s)]
*  vision of life. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1296.6200000000001s)]
*  His eyes just gave him up. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1298.6200000000001s)]
*  Polina couldn't risk losing any more time with Nikita. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1302.0600000000002s)]
*  The night before she left, she gathered gifts for her grandson. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1307.9s)]
*  This bus station was as far as our cameras could go, but nine days in, she managed to [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1313.66s)]
*  call while we were with the Save Ukraine team. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1318.8200000000002s)]
*  A translator relayed her harrowing trip. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1323.1000000000001s)]
*  I was moving there in a car throughout that minefield. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1325.7s)]
*  There was a heavy smell of dead bodies there. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1330.46s)]
*  What Polina couldn't tell us over the phone was that she and Save Ukraine hatched a plan [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1334.3600000000001s)]
*  to get past a border checkpoint near the school in occupied territory where Nikita was held. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1339.5s)]
*  She pretended to be an aid worker. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1345.5s)]
*  Her driver recorded as she walked into the building. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1347.9s)]
*  The director asked me, how did you get here? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1351.9s)]
*  I told him, I'm a volunteer. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1356.8600000000001s)]
*  I came here from Poland and brought you some humanitarian aid. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1358.8600000000001s)]
*  I needed to say something to be able to see Nikita and figure out a way to get him out [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1362.8200000000002s)]
*  of there. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1368.46s)]
*  This was the only way to do it. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1370.22s)]
*  And then she finally identified herself as Nikita's grandmother and gave the school [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1372.94s)]
*  director a Ukrainian document authorizing her to take Nikita home. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1377.6200000000001s)]
*  He refused. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1382.5s)]
*  The director said to me, he's mine, I'm his guardian. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1384.8600000000001s)]
*  And I said, but I'm his grandmother. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1390.6200000000001s)]
*  You have no right because he has a biological grandmother who will take him back. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1394.1399999999999s)]
*  This is my child. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1399.5s)]
*  Last year, Vladimir Putin changed the law to make it easier for some Ukrainian children [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1402.5s)]
*  to receive Russian citizenship, allowing them to be adopted by Russian families. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1407.3s)]
*  And Putin's top deputy in charge of children's rights, Maria Lvova-Balova, posted these videos [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1412.62s)]
*  of what she described as Ukrainian orphans with their adoptive parents. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1419.9399999999998s)]
*  Lvova-Balova herself says she adopted a 15-year-old Ukrainian boy from the occupied city of Mariupol. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1424.9799999999998s)]
*  Polina showed us the documents that led her to believe Nikita was also about to be adopted. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1433.02s)]
*  So this is the Ukrainian birth certificate, born in Ukraine, Ukrainian child. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1439.2199999999998s)]
*  And this is what Russia made. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1444.5s)]
*  And this, what does this say? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1446.5s)]
*  It says that he's a citizen of the Russian Federation. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1450.78s)]
*  It's almost hard for me to get my head around this. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1453.58s)]
*  Your grandson is a Ukrainian citizen. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1456.6599999999999s)]
*  And you're telling me you believe the Russians were on the verge of giving him to a Russian [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1459.82s)]
*  family, of adopting him out to another family. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1466.58s)]

*  Yes. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1471.58s)]
*  She says the school called her Ukrainian documentation fake and demanded a DNA test. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1472.58s)]
*  They kept Polina waiting for the results. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1479.14s)]
*  For 70 days, she refused to back down. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1481.98s)]

*  Lvova-Balova said to me, would you like to stay with us in the Russian Federation, maybe? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1521.06s)]
*  We will give you some money. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1527.54s)]

*  Don't be nervous, ma'am. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1666.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1667.4s)]
*  I'm so proud of you, Steve. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1668.4s)]
*  Mary Reid was unmarried back in 1943, and just moments after giving birth to her son, she [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1671.54s)]
*  was told to sign some routine papers. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1676.84s)]
*  Could you read them at the time? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1679.76s)]
*  Were you capable of reading and understanding what... [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1681.52s)]
*  I don't, because I think they probably just got me when I was the flu. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1684.12s)]
*  You know, and I'd see it, you know, and everything. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1688.44s)]
*  She was groggy, but she signed. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1691.52s)]
*  Just like a woman named Georgia Tan told her to. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1693.7s)]
*  Tan was well known as the director of the Tennessee Children's Home Society, and she [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1696.6200000000001s)]
*  promised she'd look after the baby until Mary was out of the hospital. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1701.1000000000001s)]
*  But that is not what happened. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1704.6200000000001s)]
*  You went to the Tennessee Children's Home Society to try to get the baby? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1706.3400000000001s)]
*  I sure did, uh-huh. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1709.9s)]
*  They wouldn't give me no kind of information or records, nothing. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1711.3400000000001s)]
*  What, they just turned you away? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1714.74s)]
*  They sure did, uh-huh. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1717.78s)]
*  It was only then that Mary learned those routine papers were actually adoption papers. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1719.98s)]
*  She had been duped into giving up her son. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1724.76s)]
*  And even though she went to court to try to get him back, it was no use. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1727.2s)]
*  Years later, when a lawyer named Robert Taylor was appointed to investigate, he discovered [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1731.6s)]
*  Georgia Tan had forced a lot of young mothers to sign papers when they were too sedated [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1735.68s)]
*  to know what they were signing. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1740.6s)]
*  That's absolutely true. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1742.32s)]
*  And I've had the mothers tell me that. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1744.56s)]
*  Now they would come, and if they were unsedated and tried to hold on to their babies after [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1747.12s)]
*  the baby was born, then Georgia Tan would step in and say, well, you don't want people [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1753.32s)]
*  in your hometown to know about this, do you? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1758.62s)]
*  But Tan would never tell those mothers what she planned to do with their babies. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1761.3s)]
*  The parents thought they were going to be held in safekeeping, and before they could [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1765.12s)]
*  do anything, the babies had been sold and sent to New York or California. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1769.02s)]
*  And that is just what happened to Mary Reed's son. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1773.54s)]
*  Less than a week old, he was sold to a family in New Jersey. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1776.26s)]
*  They named him Steve Popper. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1780.42s)]
*  He grew up knowing he was adopted from the Tennessee Children's Home Society, but never [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1782.2s)]
*  knowing the truth about how he was taken from his birth mother. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1786.46s)]
*  He says he always believed he had been unwanted, abandoned. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1790.02s)]
*  I never had any desire to find my birth mother or birth father because of the fact that I [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1793.5s)]
*  felt if they put me up for adoption, they didn't want me. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1798.14s)]
*  So why should I want to find them? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1801.76s)]
*  But then this past summer, he read a magazine article about the scandal and he investigated. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1803.54s)]
*  And he discovered that his mother never meant to give him up, that she had fought to get [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1808.74s)]
*  him back. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1812.8999999999999s)]
*  It was like a bombshell. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1813.8999999999999s)]
*  But here I was condemning this woman for giving me up all these years and never wanting to [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1816.6s)]
*  find her, and when in fact it was just the opposite. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1821.46s)]
*  I was taken from her and she was trying to get me back. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1824.58s)]
*  She did want me. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1828.32s)]
*  That discovery led Steve Popper to search and search. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1829.74s)]
*  And finally he was able to learn his birth name and then he found his mother. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1833.14s)]
*  I got her on the phone and she said, oh honey, I've been waiting for this day all my life. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1838.5s)]
*  Ever since you were born, I've been waiting for this day. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1843.5800000000002s)]
*  And he said, mom, if I get a chance, I'm going to get down there and see you. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1845.9s)]
*  The first chance I get, oh, I'll never tell you. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1850.3400000000001s)]
*  I was just crying and shaking all over. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1852.42s)]
*  I was so excited. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1854.5400000000002s)]
*  At a house decorated with yellow ribbons, Steve Popper was welcomed home. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1855.98s)]
*  He and his family exchanged photo albums and began to catch up on those lost years. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1860.74s)]
*  And now there is another photo in the album. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1866.02s)]
*  For one family, a happy ending and a new beginning. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1872.54s)]
*  But what about all the other families torn apart by Georgia Tann? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1876.46s)]
*  For during the 1940s, Tann took hundreds, maybe thousands of babies from their birth [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1880.3s)]
*  mothers, mostly women who were poor or uneducated and so couldn't fight back. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1884.8600000000001s)]
*  And then she would place the babies with childless couples who would pay up to thousands of dollars. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1889.98s)]
*  Tann told those parents the money was just to cover expenses. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1895.82s)]
*  But in truth, most of the money went into Georgia Tann's pocket. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1898.8600000000001s)]
*  Tann printed slick brochures to advertise the children. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1903.5s)]
*  At holiday time, she'd plant newspaper stories offering Christmas babies available for adoption. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1906.8600000000001s)]
*  She shipped babies from coast to coast on late night flights and then would distribute [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1912.76s)]
*  the babies to waiting parents in the lobby of a hotel like the Biltmore in Los Angeles. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1917.06s)]
*  She provided children to Hollywood celebrities like June Allison and Joan Crawford got her [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1921.94s)]
*  twin girls from Tann too. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1926.34s)]
*  Tann's baby business grew and she needed more and more children. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1928.94s)]
*  So she turned to a good friend, a juvenile court judge named Camille Kelly, who was well [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1932.42s)]
*  connected in Memphis city government. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1937.42s)]
*  She had a stooge down in the welfare department when someone would apply for assistance because [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1939.9s)]
*  they'd lost their job. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1945.98s)]
*  This person would get their name, get in touch with Camille Kelly. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1947.3400000000001s)]
*  Camille Kelly would send a deputy out, pick them up, take them back, award custody to [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1951.1000000000001s)]
*  Georgia Tann and Georgia Tann would sell them. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1957.14s)]
*  They were gone before you could do much. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1959.1000000000001s)]
*  Tann seemed to care little about the qualifications of the adoptive parents. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1961.7s)]
*  Many were abusive. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1965.5800000000002s)]
*  And she also cared little about conditions in her own orphanage. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1967.02s)]
*  Despite the publicity photos, medical care there was almost non-existent. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1970.6599999999999s)]
*  During an epidemic of diarrhea, more than 40 babies died. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1975.9399999999998s)]
*  But the adoptive parents knew nothing of the conditions at the home, nor for that matter [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1979.86s)]
*  just where their babies were coming from. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1983.82s)]
*  There was an inmate up at the Western State Hospital for the Insane that had babies just [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1986.3s)]
*  every year. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1991.54s)]
*  No one knew who the father was or the fathers, whether they were other inmates or whether [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1992.8799999999999s)]
*  they were attendants. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1997.2199999999998s)]
*  But she placed them out as being healthy children. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=1999.3799999999999s)]
*  It was Taylor's investigation in 1950 that put Georgia Tann and the Tennessee Children's [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2002.26s)]
*  Home Society out of business. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2006.98s)]
*  Georgia Tann died just as the results of the investigation were being made known. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2009.06s)]
*  Judge Camille Kelly died a few years later. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2014.3s)]
*  Neither had been prosecuted. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2016.78s)]

*  She helps adoptees track down their birth families. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2024.06s)]

*  to have indulged in fraudulent and destructive enterprise, they simply closed the books and [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2036.6200000000001s)]
*  hid it away? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2043.3s)]
*  Closed them up, sealed them up. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2045.54s)]

*  Fur coats, chauffeur-driven limousines, gambling trips to Cuba, summer cottage on the Mississippi [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2198.2s)]
*  Gulf Coast, social status with Hollywood movie stars. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2203.84s)]

*  Sure, it is. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2248.64s)]
*  I mean, because of secrecy, and that's what makes all of this possible. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2249.64s)]
*  Because once those records are sealed, that's it. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2255.88s)]

*  As a postscript to the story of Pat Flaughtower, she was desperate to find her parents, but [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2265.56s)]
*  for years her records were sealed too. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2269.92s)]
*  So we contacted private investigator Catherine DeYounger. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2272.92s)]
*  Working with a few clues that were available, she was able to track Pat's father to Los [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2276.64s)]
*  Angeles. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2280.72s)]
*  Incredibly, he lived just a few miles away from Pat. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2281.72s)]
*  I was told by someone who was friendly with him in California in those later years that [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2285.36s)]
*  he had come out there to find his children. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2291.12s)]
*  And that's what he did. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2293.92s)]
*  He looked and looked for all the years that he was there. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2295.28s)]
*  And here was one of his children just living within the same Los Angeles area. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2297.52s)]
*  But that discovery came too late. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2303.16s)]
*  Pat's father and mother had died. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2305.08s)]
*  But she was able to find an older cousin who knew her parents well. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2307.92s)]
*  He remembered Pat too. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2311.36s)]
*  And on a farm in Louisiana, she met W.J. Smith and his wife Nettie Mae for the first time. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2313.2400000000002s)]

*  She was pretty. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2320.84s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2321.84s)]
*  She was pretty. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2322.84s)]
*  She was a beautiful woman. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2323.84s)]
*  And your daddy, he wasn't no bad looking gentleman. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2324.84s)]
*  And they loved you a lot. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2327.44s)]
*  Pat has been reunited with a brother and her sister. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2329.56s)]
*  And finding W.J. and his family has helped too. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2332.48s)]
*  But nothing can compensate her for the fact that she never had a chance to show her mother [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2335.52s)]
*  and dad what kind of person she grew up to be. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2339.42s)]
*  It was really important to me to let our parents know that I turned out okay. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2343.1000000000004s)]

*  So my gift to them would be, I'm a very successful businesswoman, I feel. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2360.96s)]
*  Something to be proud of. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2368.1200000000003s)]
*  Instead of the stigma of what they've lived with. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2371.1200000000003s)]

*  Save the baby from the subversive germ of the baby's parents and grandparents. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2665.16s)]
*  That's right. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2671.88s)]
*  She remembered Patricia in the brief moments after her baby was born before he was taken [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2673.2999999999997s)]
*  away. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2678.48s)]
*  There was a beautiful and healthy baby boy, almost blonde, and she told me his name is [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2679.48s)]
*  going to be Rodolfo. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2688.76s)]
*  And she was smiling. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2692.2400000000002s)]
*  Patricia Rosenblit was never seen again, nor was her husband. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2696.64s)]
*  Her mother Rosa spent years searching police stations, hospitals, and orphanages for baby [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2700.2400000000002s)]
*  Rodolfo. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2705.68s)]
*  You and the other grandmothers have found 64 children. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2707.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2711.08s)]
*  You must be pretty good detectives. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2712.08s)]
*  How do you do it? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2714.44s)]
*  Yes, we are detectives. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2715.44s)]
*  We call each other detectives. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2718.18s)]
*  We call each other Sherlock Holmes. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2719.9199999999996s)]
*  But the search for her own grandchild Rodolfo was anything but elementary. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2722.52s)]
*  Rosa became a founding member of the Abuelas, or grandmothers of the Plaza de Maggio. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2727.7999999999997s)]
*  She spent years searching for him. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2733.3999999999996s)]
*  She was joined by her granddaughter, Rodolfo's older sister Mariana. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2735.74s)]
*  She was in her early 20s when 60 Minutes interviewed her. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2740.3799999999997s)]
*  I have a lot of hope that he comes to realize that he's been living a lie and that he would [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2744.3799999999997s)]
*  come looking for me. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2749.3599999999997s)]
*  25 years later, we return to Buenos Aires. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2751.2999999999997s)]
*  Today Mariana is 47 years old. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2754.66s)]
*  Rosa is 105. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2757.58s)]
*  In 2000, just days after our initial report aired, Mariana received an anonymous tip about [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2759.62s)]
*  a man who might be her brother. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2768.1s)]
*  His name? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2770.64s)]
*  Guillermo Gomez. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2771.64s)]
*  He was working at a fast food restaurant in a Buenos Aires suburb. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2773.2599999999998s)]
*  So she went to visit him. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2777.24s)]
*  You've been envisioning this moment for basically your whole life. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2779.16s)]
*  What was the emotion? [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2782.98s)]
*  At that moment I felt, I felt disassociated. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2783.98s)]
*  I had a feeling of peace and relief and that everything would be okay. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2789.02s)]
*  You're 21 years old, you're working in a fast food restaurant and all of a sudden one day [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2792.94s)]
*  a young woman comes in to see you. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2798.9s)]
*  What happened that day? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2802.2599999999998s)]
*  First of all, she asks me my full name. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2804.7s)]
*  Most people don't go around asking people on the street their full name, with their [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2807.34s)]
*  whole identity, right? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2811.06s)]
*  That seemed strange to me. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2813.1s)]
*  I denied that I was her brother. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2814.92s)]
*  I had a document with a different name and birth date. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2816.74s)]
*  I didn't believe it. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2819.3799999999997s)]
*  I didn't understand it. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2820.58s)]
*  It was a brief encounter, but before departing Mariana left him a book with photographs of [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2822.18s)]
*  the disappeared, including her parents. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2827.2999999999997s)]
*  When Guillermo saw the photograph of her father Jose, he was stunned. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2830.3799999999997s)]
*  It's like in a science fiction movie, when you see a picture of yourself in the past. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2836.54s)]
*  It was a picture of me in the past. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2841.02s)]
*  I felt that Mariana's father didn't just look similar, but identical. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2843.38s)]
*  You felt that in your heart? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2848.1800000000003s)]
*  Yes, you could say that. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2849.7000000000003s)]
*  A photograph of a man that looked like him was one thing, but a DNA test could confirm [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2851.58s)]
*  his real parentage. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2856.7000000000003s)]
*  Did you hope it turned out one way or the other? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2858.58s)]
*  I was very afraid. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2860.7000000000003s)]
*  At that moment, I didn't know who I was. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2862.1400000000003s)]
*  The results? [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2864.86s)]
*  Guillermo and Mariana were siblings. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2865.86s)]
*  They tried to cut through time. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2868.5s)]
*  It wasn't even a reunion, just a union. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2870.74s)]
*  But soon Guillermo learned the awful truth. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2873.8999999999996s)]
*  The couple who had raised him, Francisco Gomez and his wife Dora, had not only seized him [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2876.5s)]
*  after his mother Patricia's murder, but Gomez, who worked in Argentina's Air Force Intelligence, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2882.3399999999997s)]
*  had taken part in Patricia's capture. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2888.3799999999997s)]
*  How did it feel when you learned that not only were the people you thought were your [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2891.7799999999997s)]
*  parents for the first 20 years of your life weren't your parents, but also they had abducted, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2894.62s)]
*  and they had appropriated you? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2899.06s)]
*  It's a very, very confusing time because it's like all the ties that you have at that moment [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2901.94s)]
*  are cut and you're absolutely alone. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2907.2200000000003s)]
*  From that moment of revelation, Guillermo's life cleaved into two parts, the lie and the [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2910.86s)]
*  painful search for truth as he rebuilt his identity and learned about his real parents [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2916.6600000000003s)]
*  whom he would never meet. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2922.38s)]
*  What is it like for you to see these pictures here? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2924.3s)]
*  It's necessary so that those who come here know they aren't just a number. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2928.18s)]
*  They aren't just a grave that doesn't exist, you know? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2931.98s)]
*  They were people. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2934.98s)]
*  They were people that had a life that was interrupted. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2936.2599999999998s)]
*  They had dreams. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2938.94s)]
*  They were ordinary people like the rest. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2940.3799999999997s)]
*  The Esma death camp achingly marks where he was born, and it's the site of his mother's [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2943.3399999999997s)]
*  death sentence just days later. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2949.18s)]
*  The worst thing is what happened to me here, in this place. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2952.54s)]
*  That was the worst. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2955.8799999999997s)]
*  Where we are right now. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2957.04s)]
*  Of course. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2959.2400000000002s)]
*  The worst is that I was born in captivity like a zoo animal. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2960.6800000000003s)]
*  My mother was also kidnapped. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2964.12s)]
*  I was separated after three days. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2965.88s)]
*  I was disappeared for 21 years. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2968.0s)]
*  I'm a contradiction because I'm a disappeared person alive. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2970.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm a person who was missing without knowing I was missing. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2974.84s)]
*  Guillermo says his childhood was unhappy and that Gomez was violent. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2979.6s)]
*  He sometimes hoped Gomez wasn't his real father. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2983.68s)]
*  Guillermo felt differently about Dora, who'd always tried her best, he says, to take care [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2986.8799999999997s)]
*  of him. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2991.68s)]
*  It seems to me something complicating this even more is that you have differentiated [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2992.68s)]
*  between how you feel about the man who raised you and the woman who raised you. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=2998.04s)]
*  Well they were two completely different people. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3003.6s)]
*  I grew up being afraid of him, running away from him. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3006.3999999999996s)]
*  And she, for a long time, was practically my whole world. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3010.48s)]
*  She was the person I called Mom. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3014.18s)]
*  Dora, the woman who raised you. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3015.88s)]
*  I see her and I love her and I need her in my life. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3018.2400000000002s)]
*  The only thing I wished for the person I had called Mom was for nothing to happen to her, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3022.0s)]
*  for her not to go to jail. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3027.04s)]
*  But for Mariana and Rosa, Guillermo's relationship with Dora was a constant source of conflict. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3029.36s)]
*  It felt like a betrayal. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3035.08s)]
*  They wanted consequences. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3036.78s)]
*  Every day, every morning when she woke him up, she knew she had stolen someone else's [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3039.88s)]
*  son. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3044.6800000000003s)]
*  And I don't forgive that. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3045.8s)]
*  They stole a brother from me. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3047.0s)]
*  And they stole him for all my life. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3049.36s)]
*  Don't forgive and forget. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3052.44s)]
*  Gomez appeared in court in 2016. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3055.8s)]
*  And on the witness stand, Guillermo faced him and made one final plea. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3058.8s)]
*  I told him I needed to stop being in constant mourning for the death of my parents. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3064.92s)]
*  And that I needed to know when it happened, who had been responsible for their deaths [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3069.8s)]
*  and where their remains are. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3074.1600000000003s)]
*  And he chose to say nothing. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3075.92s)]
*  That's what he chose as his last act of cruelty, to say nothing. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3078.48s)]
*  Gomez was sentenced to 12 years in prison for Guillermo's abduction. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3083.28s)]
*  Dora was sentenced to three. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3087.6000000000004s)]
*  After the trial, the siblings presented a unified front with their grandmother Rosa. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3090.4s)]
*  But their relationship was all but doomed from the beginning. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3095.0400000000004s)]
*  So little in common apart from DNA. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3098.64s)]

*  The bottom line is, having been raised separated, not living together, we could never get over [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3117.56s)]

*  experimental play to a packed audience. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3154.0s)]

*  So what's broken is broken. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3198.42s)]

*  their unwed mothers and put them up for adoption, often without the mother's consent. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3276.48s)]
*  The women were shamed into surrendering their babies by their families and a powerful church. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3282.48s)]
*  Last month, Pope Francis apologized for those forced adoptions. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3288.4s)]

*  John Campitelli was born Piero Davi in 1963 in Italy. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3357.6s)]
*  His mother Francesca was unmarried and forced by her family to give him up. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3362.72s)]
*  He was sent to a Catholic-run institution for the children of unwed mothers. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3368.16s)]
*  Shunned and disgraced, Francesca handed her baby to the nuns. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3372.84s)]
*  Immediately, her name was stripped from the birth records. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3377.6800000000003s)]
*  With the stroke of a pen, Piero Davi became an orphan. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3381.1200000000003s)]
*  Campitelli showed us the church documents that changed his life. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3386.36s)]
*  They abandoned him since birth and their whereabouts are unknown. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3390.6000000000004s)]
*  They knew damn well where my mom was. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3394.5600000000004s)]
*  I mean, she showed her documents when she handed me over. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3396.5600000000004s)]
*  So this is an outright lie. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3399.36s)]
*  A lie John Campitelli has spent his life unraveling. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3401.04s)]
*  As soon as he was declared an orphan, he was eligible for adoption and a US visa. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3405.12s)]
*  He says his mother told him she had no idea. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3411.04s)]
*  She had every intention of coming back for him. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3414.56s)]
*  She said, I never signed a paper anywhere saying that I was willing to give you up. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3417.76s)]
*  She thought placing you in the institution was temporary? [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3424.12s)]
*  She thought that it would be her right to be able to get me back someday [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3427.88s)]
*  once she got her life together. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3431.56s)]
*  She never signed you away? [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3432.88s)]
*  No, she said, I placed you because I couldn't keep you at that point in time [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3435.2000000000003s)]
*  because of the family situation. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3439.32s)]
*  But I never consented to the adoption or to the fact that you would leave Italy [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3440.92s)]
*  and you'd be far from me for the rest of my life. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3446.08s)]
*  Piero Davi was one of thousands of children born out of wedlock [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3448.6000000000004s)]
*  that the Vatican repackaged as orphans. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3453.28s)]
*  The Church arranged the visas, helped by a 1950 US law that broadened the definition of orphan [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3456.44s)]
*  to include a child with one parent, but one who couldn't provide care. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3462.6s)]
*  With that leeway, the orphan program boomed. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3467.64s)]
*  For Piero's mother and thousands like her, it was devastating to learn the child [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3471.2400000000002s)]
*  she'd entrusted to the Church had disappeared. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3476.2000000000003s)]
*  It seems that many of these mothers had no idea that their children were being sent [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3479.68s)]
*  to the United States. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3485.88s)]
*  Could they do anything about it? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3487.56s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3489.1600000000003s)]
*  You can't send a baby to the United States and then tell the adoptive parents [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3490.7200000000003s)]
*  that the birth mother wants the child. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3494.76s)]
*  Author Maria Larino uncovered the Vatican's orphan program in her book, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3497.76s)]
*  The Price of Children. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3502.4s)]

*  Larino told us the program hinged on a consent form [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3510.2000000000003s)]
*  The mothers were supposed to sign severing all rights to the child. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3513.72s)]
*  But Larino told us doctors or lawyers sometimes signed the consent without telling the mother. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3518.16s)]
*  Others were deliberately misled. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3524.64s)]
*  There were women who were trapped into this situation and tremendous pressure to relinquish their children. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3527.2799999999997s)]
*  There were women who were tricked, who signed forms they didn't understand. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3533.52s)]
*  And in the worst cases, there were women who were told their child had died. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3538.52s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3542.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's so horrible. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3545.0s)]
*  The thinking I've been told was that it was an easier psychological closure to tell a birth mother [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3548.48s)]
*  that her child had died than to let her know that her child had been given up for adoption. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3557.16s)]
*  So representatives of the Church were telling these mothers that their children had died [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3563.4s)]
*  When in fact they had not and they had been sent to the United States? [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3568.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3572.64s)]
*  Larino told us many more women were told they could get their children back. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3573.64s)]
*  She found letters from distraught mothers pleading for their return. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3578.8399999999997s)]
*  Now these are letters that were found in the archives? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3583.24s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3585.72s)]
*  This is a letter to Reverend Landy, Monsignor Landy. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3586.72s)]
*  I beg that my children be repatriated. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3590.04s)]
*  If I cannot again see my children, I will shorten my life. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3592.52s)]
*  I find myself deceived and I do not even know how. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3596.04s)]
*  Monsignor Landy was Andrew Landy, an American priest living in Rome who ran the orphan program. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3599.64s)]
*  Landy's boss had the ear of the Pope. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3606.84s)]
*  In 1951, Pope Pius XII personally saw the first children off. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3609.8s)]
*  Thousands more would follow. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3615.68s)]
*  How could they be defined as orphans? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3618.28s)]
*  I know. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3620.4s)]
*  How could they be defined as orphans if they still have a mother or in many cases a father still alive? [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3621.48s)]
*  Yes, and to talk to the adopted children today, they get very angry to say, I'm not an orphan. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3628.84s)]
*  I spent years searching for my parents, but it was a linguistic construction. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3635.32s)]
*  The church charged $475 per child, about $4,500 today. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3639.76s)]
*  But Larrino told us the demand from eager American Catholics grew so fast that Monsignor Landy sent local priests to scour the countryside for more children. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3647.2s)]
*  The correspondence shows that they traveled throughout Italy looking for cases for children to send. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3658.24s)]
*  Literally looking for babies born out of wedlock. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3664.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3668.7999999999997s)]
*  They actually turned into a machine looking for babies to send to the United States. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3669.3199999999997s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3674.6s)]
*  John Campitelli told us he had a loving family in New York. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3676.0s)]
*  But when he found out he was adopted, he says he became obsessed with finding his birth mother. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3680.12s)]
*  There were few clues. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3686.2s)]
*  Even his surname Davi was a dead end, invented by the state to cut all ties. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3687.96s)]
*  Finally, he persuaded an Italian newspaper to publish his story. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3694.16s)]
*  And then a breakthrough. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3698.72s)]
*  Someone knew his mother. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3700.84s)]
*  In 1991, he spoke to her for the first time. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3702.92s)]
*  She said, all right, are you Piero? [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3707.56s)]
*  Well, no, I'm John. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3710.6s)]
*  Oh, no, I'm really Piero. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3712.6800000000003s)]
*  OK, I'm your son. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3714.7200000000003s)]
*  So you were nervous. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3716.6400000000003s)]
*  I was really nervous because it's something that I always wanted to do. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3717.92s)]
*  But when the moment comes, you're like... [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3721.2400000000002s)]
*  Kind of tongue-tied. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3723.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I was tongue-tied. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3725.0s)]
*  I finally get to talk to the person that actually gave birth to me, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3726.88s)]
*  that held me, that had breastfed me for two or three days in the hospital. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3730.92s)]
*  So I know that she loved me. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3735.2000000000003s)]
*  What was her voice like to you? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3737.2000000000003s)]
*  It brought me to tears, I must admit. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3739.2000000000003s)]
*  And we said we were never going to let go of each other from then on. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3741.6800000000003s)]
*  Two months later, he was on a flight to Italy. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3746.6400000000003s)]
*  We had exchanged photographs, but I said, I didn't need a photograph. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3749.84s)]
*  Because I saw that lady there in front of me, and I said, that's my mom. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3753.6000000000004s)]
*  She looks identical to me. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3756.6s)]
*  And after 28 years, I can say that, you know, I just ran over to her and I embraced her. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3758.4s)]
*  I said, Mom, finally, I kissed her. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3763.44s)]
*  I said, Mom, no one had to tell me who you were. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3765.44s)]
*  I knew who you were. I just had to look at you. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3768.4s)]
*  Campitelli moved to Italy and learned Italian to speak to his birth family. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3770.64s)]
*  But he told us that didn't undo the suffering the church had caused. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3775.56s)]
*  I felt that my whole life was based on a lie. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3780.64s)]
*  They told her that they would take care of me. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3783.2s)]
*  And that was a lie. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3786.96s)]
*  They got rid of me. They didn't take care of me. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3788.6s)]
*  They cut all relationship that I could possibly have with my birth family. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3790.68s)]
*  And they shipped me overseas. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3795.6s)]
*  I became a package for them. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3797.12s)]
*  To this day, the church insists the orphan program was the only chance for a new life for these children. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3798.72s)]
*  Lorino told us Monsignor Landy, who ran the program, died in 1999 without ever expressing any regrets. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3806.2s)]
*  I think that he believed in the merit of the program, that they were bringing children to good Catholic homes [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3814.7999999999997s)]
*  and that these children would be raised well in the United States. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3822.8799999999997s)]
*  How does that explanation sit with you now? [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3826.4399999999996s)]
*  Terribly. I mean, because this is how women were treated. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3829.08s)]
*  And this is why I think of them as disposable women. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3833.84s)]
*  Disposable? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3837.96s)]
*  Yeah. It's a terrible thing to give up your child. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3839.1600000000003s)]
*  But nobody was thinking about these women then. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3842.36s)]
*  Bella famiglia, mamma mia. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3845.88s)]
*  American adoptee Mary Rilotto travels off into Italy to see her birth family. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3847.96s)]
*  She told us she had a happy life growing up in Ohio. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3853.52s)]
*  But she says she longed for a large family, only to find out she had one. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3857.2000000000003s)]
*  It was 1992 when she first met Anna Maria, her birth mother. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3863.0s)]
*  The only thing I could do was stare and look at every inch of her for at least an hour. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3868.44s)]
*  And you're dumbfounded. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3873.32s)]
*  Not only does she look like me, but she acts like me. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3875.68s)]
*  I act like her. We're the same weight. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3878.48s)]
*  It's almost like this is my twin, but older. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3881.0s)]
*  I know exactly what I'm going to look like when I get older. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3883.36s)]
*  So now I pay attention to my health. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3886.2s)]
*  Mother and daughter say they're still learning about each other. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3889.2400000000002s)]
*  Rilotto told us it was years before she could ask the most painful question of all. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3892.96s)]
*  Why was she given away? [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3898.2400000000002s)]
*  I just needed to know her story, her truth, because no mother gives up their child so willingly without grief. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3900.44s)]
*  Do you now understand why she gave you up? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3908.84s)]
*  Because she didn't have a piece of bread she said to give us. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3912.04s)]
*  Poverty. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3915.64s)]
*  She didn't have clothes for us. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3916.28s)]
*  She was in a desperate situation, you know. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3918.0s)]
*  So instead of the church helping her maintain a house and feed her children, [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3921.12s)]
*  instead they took her children. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3927.7999999999997s)]
*  Grazie a GesÃ¹ Cristo. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3931.24s)]
*  Anna Maria is now 83. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3932.8399999999997s)]
*  Molto bello. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3935.3199999999997s)]
*  She agreed to speak with us if we withheld her last name. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3937.72s)]
*  Even decades later, the stigma of having children out of wedlock remains. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3941.68s)]
*  She told us about her other child, Christian, who was sent to a church-run institution when she became ill. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3947.0s)]
*  But when she went to pick him up, she says the nuns told her he had died. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3954.2400000000002s)]
*  I went into depression, Anna Maria told us. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3964.76s)]
*  I searched for him everywhere. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3967.84s)]
*  How did he die? [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3970.08s)]
*  Where was he buried? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3971.44s)]
*  Nobody could tell me. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3972.84s)]
*  Did you believe that your son was dead? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3974.36s)]
*  Something inside me didn't feel right, but I could do nothing about it. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3978.76s)]
*  Ciao, Christian. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3983.44s)]
*  But Christian had not died. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3984.48s)]
*  He told us he learned the truth about his mother at age 40. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3987.2400000000002s)]
*  Anna Maria says the church had put him up for adoption without telling her. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3992.04s)]
*  It was a swindle, she told us. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=3998.52s)]
*  They stole the child that they wanted. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=4000.7200000000003s)]
*  So what was it like for you when you found that Christian was in fact alive? [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=4003.16s)]
*  I have no words, she told us. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=4009.3199999999997s)]
*  There were lots of tears and hugs. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=4015.8399999999997s)]
*  The Vatican's orphan program ended in 1970, but the fallout continues, rippling across generations. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=4021.3199999999997s)]
*  Mary Rolato told us she never should have been sent to America. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=4029.2799999999997s)]
*  I think the church convinced her that it was the best thing for her. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=4034.0s)]
*  So instead of helping her, it was better for them to make money selling babies. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=4037.56s)]
*  That's all I can think of. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=4042.3999999999996s)]
*  So am I angry at the church? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=4043.9199999999996s)]
*  Hell yeah, I am. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=4045.9199999999996s)]
*  I would have a different life too. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=4048.04s)]
*  And while it might have been difficult, I still would have survived it without this [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=4049.9199999999996s)]
*  kind of grief that I have inside of me now. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4fmdGNKvc&t=4054.6s)]
