# Wall Street's Shadow Market; The Heroin Epidemic; Feeding Puerto Rico | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [December 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk)
*  On Friday, Congress finally passed and President Bush signed into law a financial rescue package [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=0.0s)]
*  in which the taxpayers will buy up Wall Street's bad investments. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=19.22s)]
*  The numbers are staggering, but they don't begin to explain the greed and incompetence [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=23.72s)]
*  that created this mess. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=27.72s)]
*  It began with a terrible bet that was magnified by reckless borrowing, complex securities, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=29.92s)]
*  and a vast, unregulated shadow market worth nearly $60 trillion that hid the risks until [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=35.660000000000004s)]
*  it was too late to do anything about them. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=41.96s)]
*  And it's far from being over. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=44.540000000000006s)]
*  It started out 16 months ago as a mortgage crisis. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=48.44s)]
*  Then it slowly evolved into a credit crisis. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=51.72s)]
*  Now it's something entirely different and much more serious. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=54.980000000000004s)]
*  What kind of a crisis is it today? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=58.64s)]
*  This is a full-blown financial storm and one that comes around perhaps one every 50 or [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=60.76s)]
*  100 years. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=67.44s)]
*  This is the real thing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=68.44s)]
*  Jim Grant is the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer and one of the country's foremost [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=69.72s)]
*  experts on credit markets. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=74.68s)]
*  He says it didn't have to happen. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=77.08s)]
*  This disaster was created entirely by Wall Street itself during a time of relative prosperity. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=80.04s)]
*  And they did it by placing a trillion-dollar bet with mostly borrowed money that the riskiest [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=86.72s)]
*  mortgages in the country could be turned into gold-plated investments. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=91.94s)]
*  If you look at how this started with the subprime crisis, it doesn't seem to be a good bet to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  put your money behind the idea that people with the lowest income and the poorest credit [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=103.52s)]
*  ratings are going to be able to pay off their mortgages. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=108.16s)]
*  The idea that you could lend money to someone who couldn't pay it back is not an inherently [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=111.25999999999999s)]
*  attractive idea to the layman, right? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=115.92s)]
*  However, it seemed to fly with people who were making $10 million a year. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=118.0s)]
*  With clients clamoring for safe investments with above-average return, the big Wall Street [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=122.54s)]
*  investment houses bought up millions of the least dependable mortgages, chopped them up [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=127.6s)]
*  into tiny bits and pieces, and repackaged them as exotic investment securities that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=132.24s)]
*  hardly anyone could understand. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=137.84s)]
*  This is actually the security. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=140.3s)]
*  This is the selling document for the security. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=142.16s)]
*  We looked at one of them with Frank Partenoy, a former derivatives broker and corporate [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=145.36s)]
*  securities attorney who now teaches law at the University of San Diego. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=149.68s)]
*  It's hundreds and hundreds of pages of very small print with a lot of detail here. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=154.16000000000003s)]
*  Think anybody ever read this stuff? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=160.0s)]
*  I doubt very many people read it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=162.12s)]
*  These complex financial instruments were actually designed by mathematicians and physicists [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=164.0s)]
*  who used algorithms and computer models to reconstitute the unreliable loans in ways [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=169.4s)]
*  that were supposed to eliminate most of the risk. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=175.32s)]
*  Obviously, they turned out to be wrong. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=180.56s)]
*  Because you can't model human behavior with math. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=181.56s)]
*  How much of this catastrophe had to do with the instruments that Wall Street created and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=183.88s)]
*  chose to buy and sell? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=189.16s)]
*  The instruments themselves are at the heart of this mess. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=193.16s)]
*  They are complex, in effect, mortgage science projects devised by these Nobel track physicists [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=196.52s)]
*  who came to work on Wall Street for the very purpose of creating complex instruments with [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=202.84s)]
*  all manner of detailed protocols on who gets paid when and how much. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  And the complexity of these structures is at the very center of the crisis of credit [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=213.96s)]
*  today. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  People don't know what they're made up of, how they're going to behave. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  But it didn't stop the rating agencies like Standard and Poor's and Moody's from certifying [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=223.2s)]
*  the dodgy securities investment grade. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=227.83999999999997s)]
*  And it didn't stop Wall Street from making billions selling them to banks, pension funds [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=230.92s)]
*  and other institutional investors all over the world. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=235.6s)]
*  But that was just the beginning of the crisis. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=239.01999999999998s)]
*  What most people outside of Wall Street and Washington don't know is that a lot of the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=241.78s)]
*  people who bought these risky mortgage securities also went out and bought even more arcane [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=246.28s)]
*  investments that Wall Street was peddling called credit default swaps. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=252.48s)]
*  And they've turned out to be a much bigger problem. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=256.44s)]
*  They are private and largely undisclosed contracts that mortgage investors entered into to protect [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=259.66s)]
*  themselves in case their investments went bad. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=265.2s)]
*  Part of a huge unregulated market that's multiplied the losses. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=268.72s)]
*  They've already helped bring down three of the biggest firms on Wall Street and threaten [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=272.44s)]
*  the ones that are left. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=276.96s)]
*  But before your eyes glaze over, Michael Greenberger, a law professor at the University of Maryland [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=279.32s)]
*  and a former director of trading and markets for the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=284.92s)]
*  says they're much simpler than they sound. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=290.08s)]
*  What is a credit default swap? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=292.88s)]
*  A credit default swap is a contract between two people, one of whom is giving insurance [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=294.68s)]
*  to the other that he will be paid in the event that a financial institution or a financial [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=301.38s)]
*  instrument fails. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=308.8s)]
*  So it's an insurance contract? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=310.32s)]
*  It is an insurance contract, but they've been very careful not to call it that because if [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=312.90000000000003s)]
*  it were insurance, it would be regulated. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=318.08s)]
*  So they use a magic substitute word called a swap, which by virtue of federal law is [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=321.16s)]
*  deregulated. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=327.56s)]
*  So anybody who was nervous about buying these mortgage backed securities, these CDOs, they [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=328.62s)]
*  would be sold a credit default swap as sort of an insurance policy. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=335.86s)]
*  A credit default swap was available to them, marketed to them as a risk saving device for [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=340.62s)]
*  buying a risky financial instrument. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=348.1s)]
*  But there was a problem. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=350.9s)]
*  Oh, there was a big problem. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=351.9s)]
*  What was the problem? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=353.14s)]
*  Well the problem was that if it were insurance or called what it really is, the person who [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=353.98s)]
*  sold the policy would have to have capital reserves to be able to pay in the case the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=360.66s)]
*  insurance was called upon or triggered. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=367.5s)]
*  But because it was a swap and not insurance, there was no requirement that adequate capital [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=370.26000000000005s)]
*  reserves be put to the side. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=376.78000000000003s)]
*  Now who was selling these credit default swaps? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=379.02000000000004s)]
*  Bear Stearns was selling them, Lehman Brothers was selling them, AIG was selling them. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=381.14000000000004s)]
*  You know the names we hear that are in trouble, Citi Group was selling them. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=386.26000000000005s)]
*  These investment banks were not only selling the securities that turned out to be terrible [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=390.54s)]
*  investments, they were selling insurance on them? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=396.46000000000004s)]
*  Well it made it easier to sell the terrible investments if you could convince the buyer [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=399.82s)]
*  that not only were they going to get the investment, but insurance. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=405.78000000000003s)]
*  But when homeowners began defaulting on their mortgages and Wall Street's high risk mortgage [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=409.46000000000004s)]
*  backed securities also began to fail, the big investment houses and insurance companies [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=414.1s)]
*  who sold the credit default swaps hadn't set aside the money they needed to pay off all [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=419.52000000000004s)]
*  the insurance contracts they'd written. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=424.28000000000003s)]
*  Bear Stearns was the first to go under, selling itself to JP Morgan for pennies on the dollar. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=426.8s)]
*  Then Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and when AIG, the nation's largest insurer, couldn't [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  cover its bad debts, the government stepped in with an 85 billion dollar rescue. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=437.96000000000004s)]
*  What role did the credit default swaps play in this financial disaster? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=443.72s)]
*  They were the centerpiece really. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=449.12s)]
*  That's why the banks lost all the money. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=450.8s)]
*  They lost all the money based on those side bets based on the mortgages. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=452.24s)]
*  How big is the market for credit default swaps? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=455.38s)]
*  We really don't know. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=458.16s)]
*  There's this voluntary survey that claims that the market is in the range of 50 to 60 [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=459.16s)]
*  or so trillion dollars. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=465.64s)]
*  It's sort of alarming that in a market that big we don't even know how big it is to within [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=468.0s)]
*  say 10 trillion dollars. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=472.4s)]
*  60 trillion dollars? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=474.2s)]
*  60 trillion dollars. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=475.2s)]
*  I know it seems incredible. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=476.52s)]
*  It's four times the size of the U.S. debt, but that's the size of the market according [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=477.68s)]
*  to these voluntary reports. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=482.84s)]
*  And the market's totally unregulated? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=485.4s)]
*  And this market is almost entirely unregulated. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=488.03999999999996s)]
*  The result is a huge shadow market that may control our financial destiny and yet the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=492.36s)]
*  details of these private insurance contracts are hidden from the public, from stockholders [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=496.8s)]
*  and from federal regulators. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=502.36s)]
*  No one knows what they cover, who owns them or whether or not they have the money to pay [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=504.28s)]
*  them off. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  One of the few sources of information is the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=510.08s)]
*  a trade organization made up of the largest financial institutions in the world. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=515.12s)]
*  Many of them are the very same companies that created the vast shadow market, lobbied to [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=520.76s)]

*  The CEO, Robert Pickle, says there's nothing wrong with credit default swaps. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=531.56s)]
*  The problem was the underlying mortgage securities. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=536.16s)]
*  Well, there's clearly something wrong with the system if all of these leverage bets, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=538.68s)]
*  hidden leverage bets, cause the collapse in the financial system. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=543.5999999999999s)]
*  It is something that we all need to look at and learn lessons from and we all need to [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=550.8399999999999s)]
*  work together to understand that and design a structure in the future that works more [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=554.88s)]

*  My point is the people that made these mistakes are the people you represent and your organization [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=561.36s)]
*  and many of them sit on the board. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=566.08s)]
*  I mean, if they didn't get it right, who would? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=570.12s)]
*  These people understand the nature of these products. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=577.2s)]
*  Well, obviously they didn't or they wouldn't have bought them. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=580.84s)]
*  They wouldn't have used them. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=584.4s)]
*  These are very useful transactions and people do understand the nature of the risks that [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=587.52s)]

*  Well, if they're so useful, how come they brought down the financial system? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=594.9200000000001s)]
*  Because perhaps they didn't understand the underlying risk and nobody really saw the [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=599.04s)]
*  effects that were going to flow through from the subprime lending situation. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=605.72s)]
*  That chapter is not over and there is much suspense and fear on Wall Street that there [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=610.8000000000001s)]
*  are other big losses out there that have yet to be disclosed. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=615.2s)]

*  loans. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=628.5200000000001s)]
*  The problem is Wall Street placed its huge bets and side bets with all those fancy securities [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=629.5200000000001s)]
*  on the 6% who are not. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=635.4000000000001s)]
*  We wouldn't be in any of this trouble right now if we had just had underlying investments [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=637.76s)]
*  in mortgages. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=642.84s)]
*  We wouldn't be in any trouble right now. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=643.84s)]

*  That's the most incredible thing about this crisis is that they pushed the button themselves. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=664.88s)]
*  They blew themselves up. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=670.44s)]
*  How much of this was just incompetence on the part of Wall Street, the people who ran it? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=672.0400000000001s)]
*  The truth is that on Wall Street a lot of people just weren't very good at their jobs. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=675.8000000000001s)]
*  It's as simple as that. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=681.2s)]
*  These people were being paid $50 to $100 million a year. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=682.5200000000001s)]
*  Some of them, the guys that were running the places. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=686.24s)]
*  There is no defending. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=688.7s)]
*  A trainee making $45,000 a year would have had the common sense not to bet the firm on [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=692.36s)]
*  mortgage contraptions that no one in the firm actually understood. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=700.0600000000001s)]
*  That is not a deep point to comprehend. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=703.62s)]
*  Somehow through, I will call it, a criminal neglect and incompetence, the people at the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=706.7s)]
*  top of these firms chose to look away, to take more risk, to enrich themselves and to [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=712.54s)]
*  put the shareholders and indeed the country itself, ultimately the country's economy [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=718.26s)]
*  at risk. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=723.14s)]
*  And it is truly not only a shame, it's a crime. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=724.7s)]
*  We requested interviews with top executives at Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=730.46s)]
*  Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and AIG. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=735.5s)]

*  It's one of the biggest problems in America today, the out of control heroin epidemic. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=745.22s)]
*  It's happening all over the country and forcing authorities to decide whether heroin [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=751.1s)]
*  should be treated as a medical or a legal problem. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=755.94s)]
*  Last year, we reported that heroin is spreading through the Columbus, Ohio suburbs. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=759.98s)]
*  Ohio has been hard hit by heroin and we selected Columbus because the area is middle America [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=764.7800000000001s)]

*  Now it's where drug dealers, many of them from Mexico, are marketing their cheap and [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=777.0200000000001s)]
*  increasingly powerful heroin. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=782.3000000000001s)]
*  We decided to go back to Ohio this year to see what is being done or could be done to [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=785.18s)]

*  We call this the death wall. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=800.18s)]
*  The death wall? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=801.8199999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=802.8199999999999s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=803.8199999999999s)]

*  It is incredible. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=826.98s)]
*  Many of the names are mothers, brothers, even grandmothers, relatives or friends of Angie's [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=828.18s)]
*  residents. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=833.86s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=845.42s)]
*  A new University of Cincinnati study says one in five Ohio residents knows someone who [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=846.42s)]

*  I've been involved in law enforcement for four decades and I've learned over those years [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=887.7s)]

*  Yes. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=977.02s)]

*  That's not my job. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=979.02s)]
*  My job is to be a judge. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=980.02s)]
*  Drug courts work. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=981.8599999999999s)]
*  Some people look at them and say, well, it's the judge becoming a social worker. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=984.7399999999999s)]

*  You had to do it. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1009.74s)]
*  Even when I didn't want to, like really using against my will. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1010.74s)]
*  Where'd you get the money? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1013.98s)]
*  Stealing, lying, cheating, using other people, ripping other people off. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1015.3s)]
*  I had no relationship with reality at all. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1021.66s)]

*  In Judge VanderKar's court, they both were given a new chance. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1031.98s)]

*  What's the gift? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1037.5s)]
*  Life, a new way to live, you know, and try to give me a little bit of some education [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1038.98s)]
*  on why I'm acting the way I'm acting, why I can't stop. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1044.98s)]
*  They didn't treat us like criminals. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1050.82s)]
*  I think that was a big thing. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1053.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1055.54s)]
*  After they passed random drug tests several times a week, went to therapy and stayed clean [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1056.62s)]
*  for more than a year, their drug-related criminal charges were wiped off the books. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1061.62s)]
*  Robert started a landscaping business. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1066.82s)]
*  Kaitlyn is in pre-med and wants to be a doctor. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1069.46s)]
*  It's freedom. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1072.8999999999999s)]
*  And if I had those charges, I wouldn't be able to continue on the path that I'm on now. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1073.8999999999999s)]
*  There are a lot of law enforcement folks who do see your behavior as criminal and who [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1081.02s)]
*  do think you should be in jail for what you were doing. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1090.18s)]
*  We did break the law, but I'm talking about branding someone a criminal for the rest of [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1096.1s)]
*  their lives. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1100.66s)]
*  It just doesn't work. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1102.1s)]
*  But it's been that way for years in many Ohio communities. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1104.06s)]
*  We went to Hardin County, one hour outside of Columbus. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1108.18s)]
*  I have eight felonies on my record that I will never be able to get rid of. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1112.26s)]
*  Hardin County is now experimenting with a drug court, but it didn't exist when Jenna [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1117.22s)]
*  Morrison first started using heroin seven years ago. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1122.24s)]
*  She's been arrested at least six times. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1125.98s)]
*  The prosecutor in Hardin County, Bradford Bailey, says he is overwhelmed by drug cases. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1131.22s)]
*  He takes a harder line than Judge VanderKar. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1137.02s)]
*  We're going to get them because they don't have the ability to say no. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1140.06s)]
*  They don't have the ability to stop using some of them. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1144.66s)]
*  They don't. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1148.18s)]
*  In 2011, Jenna Morrison overdosed and almost died. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1149.46s)]
*  Prosecutor Bailey charged her with felony heroin possession, internal possession. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1154.94s)]
*  I got charged with possession of heroin because I had it in my system. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1160.22s)]
*  She was charged with a felony for that. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1165.26s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1167.3s)]
*  It's a schedule one drug. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1168.3s)]
*  No one can have it in their possession under any circumstance, not even a decimal. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1169.78s)]
*  Isn't that a bit extreme? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1174.02s)]
*  No, that's the law of Ohio. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1175.62s)]
*  That's the law of the United States of America. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1178.06s)]
*  Jenna Morrison is no poster child for sobriety. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1180.18s)]
*  But Judge VanderKar told us prosecutors have discretion and it's unusual to charge addicts [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1183.52s)]
*  who've overdosed with possession because a drug is in their system, as prosecutor Bailey [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1188.4s)]
*  did. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1193.14s)]
*  Jenna sold a police informant, small numbers of pain pills, and a drug that helps wean [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1194.46s)]
*  addicts from heroin. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1198.74s)]
*  Bailey came down hard with nine counts of felony trafficking. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1200.5s)]
*  When Jenna and her sister stole cash and credit cards from their mother to support their heroin [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1204.3600000000001s)]
*  habits, Bailey charged them with felony theft. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1208.8600000000001s)]
*  I couldn't stop them. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1212.58s)]
*  I filed charges on my own daughters. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1214.06s)]
*  At her wits end, it was Tracy Morrison who called the police. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1216.18s)]
*  It resulted in five felony charges for one, three for the other. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1220.66s)]
*  Felony charges. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1225.8600000000001s)]
*  Felony charges. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1226.8600000000001s)]
*  See, I was thinking, because I'm naive, that a hundred bucks is petty theft. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1227.8600000000001s)]
*  Well, no, they got them for forgery and all these felonies. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1230.74s)]
*  And then they were trying to send them to prison. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1234.78s)]
*  And I just didn't even expect that to happen. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1237.3400000000001s)]
*  Since she first used heroin seven years ago, Jenna Morrison has been charged with 23 felonies. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1240.66s)]
*  Todd Anderson is her lawyer. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1247.3400000000001s)]
*  So they're taking these low level users and addicts charging all these felonies. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1249.18s)]
*  And then the problem is that they stack the sentences on them. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1253.8200000000002s)]
*  And then when they violate their probation, they're getting lengthy prison sentence for [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1257.1000000000001s)]
*  really being an addict. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1260.1000000000001s)]
*  The county prosecutor would say there's just no denying she broke the law. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1262.14s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1266.78s)]
*  But the issue is what we do with them and what's the sentence. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1267.78s)]
*  The sentence has got to be fair. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1269.8600000000001s)]
*  When we first met Jenna last year, she had kicked her heroin habit with the help of a [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1271.54s)]
*  new drug called Vivitrol, which blocks the effects of opioids in the brain. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1275.98s)]
*  She went back to school and was managing to take care of her children. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1281.06s)]
*  But she was still posted on prosecutor Bailey's website as a drug trafficker and she couldn't [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1284.8600000000001s)]
*  find a job. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1290.54s)]
*  Her mother says she got depressed and started using cocaine. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1292.06s)]
*  She recently was locked up again and the prosecutor charged her with five more felonies, making [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1296.44s)]
*  a total of 28. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1302.38s)]
*  18 have been dismissed, 10 remain on her record. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1304.46s)]
*  You think she's been treated fairly? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1308.98s)]
*  Where has she been untreated unfairly? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1311.14s)]
*  Everything she's done, she's chose to do. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1314.22s)]
*  We didn't tell her to do these things. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1316.76s)]
*  She chose to do felony crimes, not the state. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1318.9s)]
*  We're not giving her a free pass. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1322.14s)]
*  We don't give anybody a free pass. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1323.3400000000001s)]
*  But you also know that she's addicted to heroin. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1325.82s)]
*  I have a lot of people who are addicted to heroin. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1328.82s)]
*  Most of the people that are in our drug business, the illegal drug business, are addicted. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1330.86s)]
*  Prosecutor Bailey says the voters have told him they want drug addicts off the street. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1335.4599999999998s)]
*  But Scott VanderKar says law enforcement needs to recognize the old tough on drugs approach [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1340.3799999999999s)]
*  isn't working, that addicts like Jenna need help, not punishment. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1345.58s)]
*  He recently resigned his judgeship to help other communities in Ohio set up their own [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1350.4599999999998s)]
*  drug courts. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1355.02s)]
*  He meets with judges and elected officials like Greg Peterson, the mayor of Dublin, Ohio. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1356.4s)]
*  I don't want anybody in Dublin to have a problem and ever think I don't know where to turn. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1361.8400000000001s)]
*  But many parents in the Columbus suburbs told us they don't know where to turn, even if [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1368.14s)]
*  they can afford private health insurance to pay for rehab and detox programs. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1373.3600000000001s)]
*  Christie and Wayne Campbell's son Tyler was a star high school and college football player [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1378.64s)]
*  and a heroin addict. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1383.72s)]
*  He was in and out of rehab three times, short rehabs, because most insurance companies limit [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1385.84s)]
*  the length of inpatient treatment. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1392.6s)]
*  The last one that he was in was in there two weeks and the insurance company wanted to [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1394.8s)]
*  release him. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1399.36s)]
*  Christie convinced the insurance company to give Tyler two more weeks. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1400.9199999999998s)]
*  When he came home there was something obviously different, I mean, like he got it. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1405.48s)]
*  He was talking about the future. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1410.28s)]
*  Yes, this is midnight. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1411.8799999999999s)]
*  So we go to bed with the biggest sigh of relief that you could ever have. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1414.68s)]
*  It's over. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1420.76s)]
*  Tomorrow's going to be a great day. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1421.76s)]
*  But tomorrow never came. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1423.5600000000002s)]
*  Tyler went up to his bedroom, shot up and overdosed. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1425.92s)]
*  New beginnings, this is Angie. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1429.4s)]
*  At the new beginnings rehab facility, Angie Pelfrey told us what happened to Tyler is [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1431.48s)]
*  not unusual. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1437.0s)]
*  They get to a point to where they're not using, they go out and want to use maybe one more [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1438.68s)]
*  time, just one more hurrah and it takes their life because they go back to using the same [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1444.2s)]
*  amount that they did when they were ending the addiction. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1451.2s)]
*  Their tolerance goes down after two weeks of rehab. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1455.44s)]
*  They go home, shoot up the same amount they were using before. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1458.94s)]
*  Yes, and it's taken their lives. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1462.2s)]
*  And it's now an overdose. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1464.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1466.2s)]
*  Angie Pelfrey's facility is a faith-based program supported by a church and the local [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1467.2s)]

*  I'm not seeing an end to it anywhere. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1526.8400000000001s)]
*  We first met Chef José Andrés seven years ago in the wildly popular restaurant he'd [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1531.44s)]
*  opened in Beverly Hills. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1537.16s)]
*  Andrés was born in Spain, but America is where he became famous for his avant-garde [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1539.0s)]
*  approach to cooking. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1544.3200000000002s)]
*  He has nearly 30 restaurants here now, but he's barely set foot in any of them in the [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1546.04s)]
*  past two months, not since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1550.24s)]
*  Andrés went to the devastated island a few days after the storm to see how he could help. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1554.72s)]
*  He's not a disaster relief expert, so he began doing what he does best. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1559.88s)]
*  He found a kitchen, bought some ingredients, and began to cook. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1564.48s)]
*  It's a good Thanksgiving story because that first day, Andrés and his small team made [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1568.5200000000002s)]
*  about a thousand meals. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1573.3200000000002s)]
*  Since then, he's recruited an army of chefs and volunteers, and together they've served [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1575.4s)]
*  more than three million meals to the hungry people of Puerto Rico. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1580.4s)]
*  José Andrés is always on the move. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1589.88s)]
*  In the kitchen, which has become his base of operations in San Juan, he's a culinary [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1597.44s)]
*  commander rallying his troops. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1602.5400000000002s)]
*  Preparing meals for so many people is a massive undertaking, requiring trained chefs, thousands [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1609.6000000000001s)]
*  of volunteers, assembly lines of sandwiches, 900 on this table alone. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1615.84s)]
*  Good ham, good cheese, a lot of mayo. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1621.6799999999998s)]
*  There's a lot of mayonnaise here. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1625.08s)]
*  It's all the more remarkable because none of this was set up before José Andrés got [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1627.0s)]
*  to Puerto Rico two months ago. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1631.6799999999998s)]
*  I arrived Monday right after the hurricane, and I asked, who is in charge of feeding the [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1633.6399999999999s)]
*  people of Puerto Rico? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1639.3999999999999s)]
*  And they told me, everybody. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1641.96s)]
*  Everybody's in charge. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1645.24s)]
*  You know, when you have to feed an entire island, you need to have one, one person and [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1646.24s)]
*  one organization responsible. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1652.32s)]
*  There has to be a plan. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1654.44s)]
*  There has to be a plan, and somebody has to be responsible for achieving that plan. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1655.44s)]
*  Andrés came up with his own plan to feed as many of the island's nearly three and a [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1660.24s)]
*  half million people as possible. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1664.04s)]
*  He started with $10,000 of his own money in cash and pockets full of credit cards. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1669.32s)]
*  How do you arrive at a place, you know, you don't know where the food is, you don't know [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1676.44s)]
*  where access to water is? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1680.3799999999999s)]
*  How did you get off the ground here? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1682.6s)]
*  So for me, it was not difficult. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1684.52s)]
*  The first thing I do, you're a chef, you go and you try to find a kitchen. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1685.7s)]
*  Everybody was saying, there's no food, there's no food. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1689.68s)]
*  Well, that was not true. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1691.6399999999999s)]
*  The big food distribution companies had food because they had fuel, they had diesel. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1694.1399999999999s)]
*  They kept the refrigerators and the freezers working. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1698.76s)]
*  There was food here. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1701.48s)]
*  Plenty of food. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1702.96s)]
*  What was the problem? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1703.96s)]
*  The problem was the urgency of now. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1705.24s)]
*  It's a very simple thing when you're a cook. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1708.04s)]
*  When you're hungry, you gather the food, you gather your helpers, you begin cooking, and [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1710.28s)]
*  then you start feeding people. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1716.92s)]
*  He joined up with a local chef named Jose Enrique and other volunteers, cooking enormous [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1718.48s)]
*  pans of paella and stews in a parking lot in San Juan. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1724.68s)]
*  It wasn't long before they were making more than 100,000 meals a day. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1728.4s)]
*  How did you scale it up that quickly? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1733.68s)]
*  Well, you know one thing, when these moments happen, we have a tendency to think, oh, we [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1735.44s)]
*  have to feed 3 million people. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1740.92s)]
*  Almost the idea is impossible. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1742.64s)]
*  Seems overwhelming. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1745.16s)]
*  It's totally overwhelming, but all of a sudden imagine you began breaking this. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1746.3600000000001s)]
*  We're going to be doing now 25,000 meals. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1750.72s)]
*  And when you do it well for two days, you increase it to 50,000. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1753.24s)]
*  And when you do it well, you increase it to 100,000. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1756.3600000000001s)]
*  And all of a sudden you scale up in a way that is simple. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1759.84s)]
*  It's a big pan. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1764.3600000000001s)]
*  That's chicken, chickpeas. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1767.32s)]
*  We try to put a good amount of proteins, rice, every Puerto Rican. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1768.72s)]
*  I love rice. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1772.48s)]
*  Ingredients are often improvised. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1774.2s)]
*  They cook whatever they can buy. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1776.76s)]
*  Rice are improvised as well. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1779.52s)]
*  Jennifer Herrera says a prayer for Puerto Rico as she pours oil into each pan of rice. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1782.84s)]
*  The time it takes her to say God bless Puerto Rico is the exact amount of oil she says she [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1794.16s)]
*  needs. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1799.16s)]
*  How many blessings do you give Puerto Rico every day? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1800.16s)]
*  Thousands of blessings. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1802.68s)]
*  With the help of private donations and money from the federal government, Jose Andres' [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1804.2s)]
*  nonprofit organization, Rural Central Kitchen, has prepared more hot meals than any of the [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1808.4s)]
*  other bigger, more experienced disaster relief organizations here, like the Salvation Army [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1814.4s)]
*  and the Red Cross. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1819.76s)]
*  Most agencies, if they're giving out food, they're giving out MREs or snacks or not hot [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1822.76s)]
*  meals. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1828.24s)]
*  Americans should be receiving one plate a day of hot food. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1829.24s)]
*  That's not too much to ask in America. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1834.16s)]
*  An MRE is very expensive for the American taxpayer. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1837.28s)]
*  A hot meal is more affordable, it's cheaper, it's what people really need, it's what people [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1841.12s)]
*  really want. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1845.6399999999999s)]
*  They feel all of a sudden that you are caring for them, that America is caring for them. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1846.6399999999999s)]
*  You're not just giving calories, you're giving attention to people. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1851.68s)]
*  The calories are obvious, but this is a message of hope. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1855.66s)]
*  This is a message we care and be patient. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1859.16s)]
*  Things eventually will get better. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1862.04s)]
*  That message of hope is one Andres has been preaching for weeks on social media. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1864.78s)]
*  So great, we got the refrigerator and fresh produce. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1869.74s)]
*  Thank you, thank you, thank you. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1872.98s)]
*  Documenting his efforts to expand operations around the entire island. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1874.98s)]
*  At the height of the emergency, he had 18 kitchens going at once and used trucks, cars [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1879.6200000000001s)]
*  and anyone he could find to deliver meals. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1886.94s)]
*  All of a sudden I have Homeland Security helping us deliver sandwiches and water in [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1890.1s)]
*  the most difficult areas of the island. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1896.86s)]
*  I had cooks from the US Coast Guard helping us volunteering. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1900.82s)]
*  We were having so many different men and women coming from the federal government helping us. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1906.1s)]
*  There are still plenty of places that need the help. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1915.6599999999999s)]
*  In this community, an hour south of San Juan, there's no electricity. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1918.58s)]
*  This is the first hot meal this family has eaten in more than two weeks. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1924.3s)]
*  Andres' dedication has inspired others in Puerto Rico to set up kitchens of their own. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1930.86s)]
*  In a church perched in the mountains of Noguabo, Pastor Eliomar Santana and his parishioners [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1935.82s)]
*  cook hot meals for neighboring communities with the rice, beans and sausages Andres has [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1941.54s)]
*  provided them. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1946.82s)]
*  We have people here with no water, no lights. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1948.6200000000001s)]
*  They lost everything in their house and they have stopped thinking on that for helping others. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1951.74s)]
*  So even though some of your parishioners need help, they're still volunteering here? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1958.42s)]
*  Yeah, they're still volunteering. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1962.46s)]
*  They're still trying to help other people? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1963.78s)]
*  They're still trying to help other people. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1965.14s)]
*  Before delivering the food to a nearby housing project, Pastor Santana thanks God and then [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1971.26s)]
*  Jose Andres. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1976.8600000000001s)]
*  In the church, when you were praying, you thanked God first and second you thanked Jose [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1978.38s)]
*  Andres. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1983.14s)]
*  Yes, that's very important. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1984.14s)]
*  But I have to always say God first, then Jose. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1988.02s)]
*  Jose's in good company. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1992.5s)]
*  Andres' presence has not been without controversy. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1995.54s)]
*  He's been critical of the federal government's response to the hurricane and after attending [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=1998.58s)]
*  meetings with FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, he called their headquarters [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2002.74s)]
*  in San Juan the most inefficient place on earth. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2007.34s)]
*  Was that the frustration that it was just bureaucratic? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2010.6200000000001s)]
*  There were a lot of meetings and you felt like things weren't getting done? [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2013.3s)]
*  We were already feeding 100,000 people a day and I needed their help to make sure we had [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2016.38s)]
*  money to keep buying the food to keep feeding these never-ending lists of people in need. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2023.14s)]
*  And there is where, call it red tape. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2029.46s)]
*  FEMA did award Andres' World Central Kitchen two short-term contracts worth $11.5 million [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2033.5800000000002s)]
*  to provide 1.8 million meals. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2041.1000000000001s)]
*  But the agency refused to grant them a third, longer-term contract. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2044.14s)]
*  Andres thinks the overall response to disaster relief needs to change. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2048.46s)]
*  The people of the federal government are great people, but then it's red tape that sometimes [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2053.42s)]
*  doesn't allow that same people to be successful. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2058.94s)]
*  I didn't put the name emergency on FEMA. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2062.7400000000002s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2065.26s)]
*  But somebody's going to have to tell me the meaning of emergency. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2066.66s)]
*  To me, when we're talking about food, and this is the little thing I know, is that emergency [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2069.94s)]
*  in food means one thing. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2074.34s)]
*  People are hungry. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2076.82s)]
*  And when you're hungry, it's today. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2077.82s)]
*  FEMA says, look, to negotiate a big contract, there's a bidding process. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2080.78s)]
*  You have to have three different companies bidding on it, that there's federal government [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2084.58s)]
*  regulations. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2088.1s)]
*  You say that gets in the way of... [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2090.1s)]
*  Americans in Puerto Rico were hungry. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2092.5s)]
*  And we were not delivering food quick enough. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2095.22s)]
*  And what we did is we didn't plan. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2098.2999999999997s)]
*  We didn't meet. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2101.58s)]
*  We began cooking, and we began delivering food to the people in need in Puerto Rico. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2103.18s)]
*  And what we need to make sure is that next time we are not negotiating contracts, that [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2108.18s)]
*  next time the federal government is ready to do what they are supposed to do, next time [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2113.18s)]
*  something like this happens, maybe an earthquake, maybe another hurricane, or maybe a terrorist [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2117.58s)]
*  attack, we need to make sure we are ready, because the people of America don't deserve [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2122.02s)]
*  anything less. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2126.62s)]
*  Jose Andres' passion for disaster relief is a far cry from what excited him when we first [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2129.7799999999997s)]
*  met him in his restaurant in Beverly Hills in 2010. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2135.06s)]
*  Back then, he was leading a kind of culinary revolution, pioneering innovations in molecular [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2141.1s)]
*  astronomy, marrying science with food in surprising and playful ways. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2146.46s)]
*  Are you ready for this? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2151.46s)]
*  I believe your life is going to change forever. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2153.66s)]
*  This is going to change my life? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2157.2200000000003s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2160.2200000000003s)]
*  OK. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2161.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know why I keep doing stories about food, because I don't really eat much and [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2162.2200000000003s)]
*  never really think much about food. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2172.2200000000003s)]
*  But it's so interesting to me how for you, food is at the center of everything. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2174.58s)]
*  Understand, food touches everything. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2179.02s)]
*  Food is in our DNA. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2183.22s)]
*  Food touches the economy, food is science, food is romanticism, food is health. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2185.14s)]
*  Food has many of the opportunities to have a better tomorrow. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2193.54s)]
*  That philosophy is at the heart of Andres' humanitarian efforts around the globe. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2199.62s)]
*  He founded World Central Kitchen after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2204.9s)]
*  You know, I've been here more than 25 times to Haiti. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2210.2599999999998s)]
*  This past June, months before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, we met up with Andres in [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2213.22s)]
*  Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2218.24s)]
*  We should be having here the freshest fish every day. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2220.46s)]
*  He supports an orphanage here and has established a job training program for local chefs. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2222.7799999999997s)]
*  He's also spearheading an effort to reduce the widespread use of charcoal in cooking. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2228.1s)]
*  Long-term exposure to smoke from cooking indoors on fires kills an estimated four million people [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2234.7799999999997s)]
*  worldwide every year, most of them women and children. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2240.3399999999997s)]
*  Andres has provided cleaner-burning propane gas stoves to more than a hundred schools [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2245.58s)]
*  in Haiti, like this one in Port-au-Prince. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2250.3399999999997s)]
*  Focusing on stoves, on the idea of clean-cooked stoves, is not something that a lot of people [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2253.54s)]
*  think about. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2258.34s)]
*  I am a cook. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2259.34s)]
*  I feed a few, but I've always been super interested in feeding the many. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2260.34s)]
*  And when I've seen some of these women doing the change from the charcoal to the gas, everything [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2265.1s)]
*  changes around them. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2272.22s)]
*  When we see this woman cooking in the street with charcoal and we eat the plate of food, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2273.86s)]
*  we should all be asking ourselves, how that plate of food can really become an agent of [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2279.38s)]
*  change? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2284.5s)]
*  An agent of change? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2285.5s)]
*  A true agent of change, one plate at a time. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2286.5s)]
*  José Andres spent Thanksgiving in Puerto Rico, continuing to feed people one plate at a time. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2290.26s)]
*  This has been his biggest undertaking thus far. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2296.46s)]
*  Every time it's a rainbow, you know things are going to get better. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2299.5s)]
*  He's scaling back now as the need for emergency food relief here lessens, but he's already [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2302.7400000000002s)]
*  thinking about how he can do it better the next time disaster strikes. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LkONRQPsEk&t=2307.58s)]
