*  and share important intelligence about worldwide criminal activity. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=48.6s)]

*  I'm just trying to understand how a country that is being investigated for mass murder [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=59.32s)]

*  The United States federal prison system has 157,000 inmates in its custody. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=113.72s)]
*  It locks up some of the most dangerous and high-profile criminals in the world. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=119.32s)]
*  Serial killers and terrorists are among those inside its 122 prisons, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  which include supermax penitentiaries and minimum security camps. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  The cost to American taxpayers is more than $8 billion a year. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=133.84s)]
*  Tonight, we will take you inside the Federal Bureau of Prisons, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  an agency in crisis. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=142.12s)]
*  A series of government investigations has found the bureau's workforce [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  is dangerously understaffed, and inside its women's prisons, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=147.84s)]
*  there is an alarming pattern of abuse. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  Collette Peters is in charge of fixing the Bureau of Prisons. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=154.44s)]
*  She's the sixth director in six years. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  This is Aliceville, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  a low-security women's prison in rural Alabama, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  where more than 1,400 inmates are serving time. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=169.28s)]
*  People drive past prisons every day. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they're terrified of them. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=175.4s)]
*  Or they don't think about them at all. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=176.68s)]
*  Right? It's kind of like this forgotten zone. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=178.60000000000002s)]
*  I don't want people to forget about this place. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=181.08s)]
*  Collette Peters became director of the Bureau of Prisons in August 2022. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=182.88s)]
*  After a 20-year career in corrections, she's built a reputation as a reformer. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=187.8s)]
*  I love your poster. We are all stronger than we think, aren't we? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  Before becoming director, she was credited with shaping Oregon's state prison system [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=196.12s)]
*  by prioritizing staff mental health support [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=201.0s)]
*  and advocating for the compassionate treatment of inmates. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=203.8s)]
*  I have this very early memory in kindergarten [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  where an individual came in with a pocket knife [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=210.0s)]
*  and was marched to the principal's office. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=213.84s)]
*  And I just remember in that moment saying, I want to help him. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=216.8s)]
*  Many people in your custody are there because of horrific crimes. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=219.56s)]
*  Why do they deserve compassion? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=225.2s)]
*  Because 95% of them are going to come back to our communities someday. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=227.6s)]
*  And I want them to be productive, tax-paying citizens who no longer commit crimes. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=231.24s)]
*  But the Bureau of Prisons is so inadequately staffed, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=238.32s)]
*  it is struggling to fulfill its mission, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=241.48s)]
*  rehabilitating inmates and keeping its prisons safe. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=243.92s)]
*  Government watchdogs have documented disrepair in all of its institutions, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=248.4s)]
*  requiring more than $2 billion in fixes. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=253.2s)]
*  And employees rank the Bureau of Prisons [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=256.64s)]
*  the worst place to work in the federal government. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=258.96s)]
*  It's very rare for the media to be allowed inside a federal prison. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=262.04s)]
*  Why are we here? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=266.0s)]
*  I truly believe in transparency. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=267.32s)]
*  Are we perfect? No. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=269.24s)]
*  Do we have issues we need to resolve? Absolutely. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=270.64s)]
*  But I want people to see the good stuff. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=273.52s)]
*  We toured Aliceville with director Peters [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=275.96s)]
*  and saw where inmates live, learn new trades and work. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=278.64s)]
*  On this day, sewing sleeping bags for the military, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=283.08s)]
*  a coveted job because it pays $1.15 an hour. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=286.24s)]
*  You ladies are amazing. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=291.4s)]
*  And when you leave here, you're going to be incredible. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=293.4s)]
*  This ceremony is for inmates graduating from a faith-based program, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=296.56s)]
*  preparing them for life on the outside, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=300.44s)]
*  by connecting them with community leaders [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=303.2s)]
*  and teaching them life skills like anger management. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=305.4s)]
*  But the reality is nearly half of federal inmates [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=309.0s)]
*  will end up back behind bars or arrested within three years of getting out. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=312.08s)]
*  A lot of those faces in there who have so much promise and hope today [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  could end up right back in here. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=320.44s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think we have a lot of work to do [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  to dial down that recidivism rate. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=324.64s)]
*  We have to send fewer people to prison for shorter periods of time. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=326.32s)]
*  And then when they're here, do things like this. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=330.08s)]
*  You also have a major staffing issue [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=332.96s)]
*  and people can't get these classes that they need. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  Staffing was a problem before the pandemic. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  And so those recruitment efforts and those retention efforts have gotten hard. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=340.92s)]
*  How many correctional officers do you need on staff [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=345.2s)]
*  to get you out of this staffing crisis? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=348.04s)]
*  So we hope to have that real number for you and the public very soon. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=350.4s)]
*  That seems like a critical number. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=357.08s)]
*  How was that not on your desk when you took this job on day one [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=358.68s)]
*  and still not there a year later? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=361.96s)]
*  So the good news is this was a problem the Bureau was trying to solve [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=363.6s)]
*  before I got here and we're in the process of solving it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=367.4s)]
*  Director Peters says she expects to have the number of officers needed by October, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=370.08s)]
*  more than two years after taking office. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  But Shane Fozzi, the recently retired president of the Federal Prison Employees Union, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=377.44s)]
*  says he knows what that number is now. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=382.28s)]
*  We're short about 8,000 positions nationwide. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=384.91999999999996s)]
*  How bad is it? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=387.96s)]
*  It results in one of us losing our lives. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=388.96s)]
*  And it's that bad. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=392.59999999999997s)]
*  We can't continue with this course. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=394.79999999999995s)]
*  By the union's count, the Bureau of Prisons is down about 40% [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=396.96000000000004s)]
*  of the correctional officers it needs. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=401.12s)]
*  The less supervision you have, the more bad things happen. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=403.64000000000004s)]
*  Misconduct increases, violence increases. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=407.08000000000004s)]
*  And because there are not enough officers, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=410.64000000000004s)]
*  the Bureau relies on other prison staff to step in. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=412.88s)]
*  It's a controversial practice called augmentation. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=416.24s)]
*  Teachers, nurses, doctors, food service people, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=419.64s)]
*  the people that maintain facilities. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=424.08000000000004s)]
*  They're doing what now? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=426.24s)]
*  They're in a housing unit supervising offenders. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=427.68s)]
*  Do they have training in that? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=430.4s)]
*  They do. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=431.92s)]
*  But I can tell you, I'm no better a plumber than they are a correctional officer. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=433.52s)]
*  I can walk into a housing unit and tell you something's right or something's wrong. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=437.96s)]
*  You develop that over years of experience. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=442.12s)]
*  Let's break this down. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=444.52s)]
*  We are talking about HVAC repairmen and accountants who are now guarding inmates. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=445.56s)]
*  That doesn't sound safe. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=453.44s)]
*  So it is. So they have the exact same training as the correctional officers. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=454.96s)]
*  Now, what I will say is augmentation should only be used in the short term. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=458.4s)]
*  We've used this now to solve a long-term retention and recruitment problem. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  And that isn't right. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=468.96s)]
*  On this point, the union and management agree. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=470.47999999999996s)]
*  Prison staff, like teachers and doctors, need to be able to do their jobs [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  so that inmates don't lose access to critical services and programs. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=478.2s)]
*  There are buzz phrases, everybody's a correctional officer first. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=482.6s)]
*  That sounds good on paper, but if you take the teacher out of the classroom [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=485.68s)]
*  and nobody's teaching the offender the skills to go back out to society, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=489.0s)]
*  we're just back to warehousing people. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=494.08s)]
*  While we walked the halls of Aliceville, classrooms were packed, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=496.48s)]
*  but several inmates told us that much of what we saw in our tour was staged. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=500.36s)]
*  Am I getting a real look at what life is like in here today? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=505.44s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=509.64s)]
*  No, definitely not. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=511.64000000000004s)]
*  The staff is very disrespectful here. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=512.88s)]
*  Even though we made mistakes, when we're out here, we're not treated with respect. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=514.72s)]
*  Do you feel safe here? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=520.0400000000001s)]
*  Um, sometimes. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=521.76s)]
*  In prison is prison. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=522.76s)]
*  You feel what I'm saying? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=524.0s)]
*  Tell me about staffing. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=524.88s)]
*  There's short staff all the time. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=526.52s)]
*  There's times where you don't know if you're going to be able to go outside [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=528.6s)]
*  because somebody didn't come to work. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=531.08s)]
*  And if you were to speak up about some of these issues [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=532.84s)]
*  that you're telling me about, what would happen? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=535.52s)]
*  You're going to jail. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=538.0400000000001s)]
*  You're going to the shoot. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=538.84s)]
*  The shoot, short for Special Housing Unit, is the jail inside a prison, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=540.16s)]
*  where inmates are segregated from the general population [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=545.36s)]
*  and seldom let outside of their cells. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=548.4s)]
*  Make you nervous to talk to me right now? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=550.8s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=552.76s)]
*  The director is coming today. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=553.48s)]
*  What does she need to know about Aliceville? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=555.44s)]
*  Fix it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=557.48s)]
*  We need more education, more opportunity to grow and rehabilitate [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=558.16s)]
*  because we don't have that here. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=562.04s)]
*  I've talked to a handful of inmates here today and they say, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=563.52s)]
*  look, you're getting a cleaned up version of what life is really like. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=567.7199999999999s)]
*  I've been doing this work for a long time. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=571.3199999999999s)]
*  So I can see when things have been swept under the rug, if you will. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=573.7199999999999s)]
*  I'm not naive. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=577.5999999999999s)]
*  And when anybody comes to your house, you clean it up. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=578.7199999999999s)]
*  Of all the issues plaguing the Bureau of Prisons, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=581.64s)]
*  perhaps none is more disturbing than the rampant sexual abuse of female inmates [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=584.3599999999999s)]
*  by the male officers who are supposed to protect them. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=589.3199999999999s)]
*  Women are housed in nearly a quarter of federal prisons [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=592.56s)]
*  and a 2022 Senate investigation found that Bureau staff have sexually abused [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=595.8s)]
*  female prisoners in at least two thirds of those facilities over the past decade. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=601.08s)]
*  Aliceville is no exception. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=606.64s)]
*  Three officers have been convicted of sexual abuse since 2020, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=608.96s)]
*  including one who pleaded guilty earlier this month. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=612.92s)]
*  Those are just the cases that we know about. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=616.4399999999999s)]
*  How does this keep happening? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=618.52s)]
*  You can't predict human behavior. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=619.88s)]
*  But what I can tell you is the things that we're putting in place [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=621.56s)]
*  to manage to that misconduct, I think are the right things. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=624.88s)]
*  And sending a clear message that this type of behavior is egregious, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=628.24s)]
*  horrendous and unexcusable. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=632.2s)]
*  But female inmates at a women's prison in northern California [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=634.92s)]
*  accused Director Peters and the Bureau of Prisons of failing to protect them. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=638.24s)]
*  Its official name is Federal Correctional Institution Dublin, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=642.96s)]
*  but it's known by inmates and staff as the Rape Club. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=646.92s)]
*  Seven Dublin officers, including the warden and the chaplain, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=650.64s)]
*  have been convicted of sexually abusing nearly two dozen inmates from 2018 to 2021. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=654.52s)]
*  And this past August, eight inmates filed suit claiming sexual abuse continues to this day. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=661.08s)]
*  These are mothers, their daughters, their sisters. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=667.8000000000001s)]
*  Tess Corth worked as a correctional officer at Dublin for 25 years. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=672.84s)]
*  She resigned in 2022 after she says she was retaliated against for whistleblowing. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=677.16s)]
*  They train us in the red flags to look for. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=682.76s)]
*  And then when we report, hey, every red flag this guy meets, you need to go deal with this. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=685.28s)]
*  They don't do anything. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=692.2s)]
*  What was the chaplain doing that made you suspicious? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=693.32s)]
*  One time I came in on a weekend. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=695.96s)]
*  He didn't know I was there. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=698.5600000000001s)]
*  His office was dark. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=700.1600000000001s)]
*  It had an inmate in there with him. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=701.6800000000001s)]
*  And I don't know what they were doing. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=704.36s)]
*  That's a red flag. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=706.76s)]
*  Oh, definitely. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=707.96s)]
*  Former officer Corth says she reported the chaplain and other officers who she suspected [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=710.0s)]
*  of sexually abusing inmates to an internal affairs investigator, but was ignored for years [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=714.8000000000001s)]
*  until federal investigators stepped in. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=720.64s)]
*  What happened to the officers that you accused? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=723.2800000000001s)]
*  Most of them have been or in the process of being convicted. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=726.08s)]
*  And a lot of them are named in lawsuits right now. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=730.64s)]
*  How does that make you feel? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=735.76s)]
*  Good. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=737.48s)]
*  The Bureau of Prisons has a backlog of nearly 8,000 open misconduct investigations, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=738.92s)]
*  hundreds of which contain allegations of sexual abuse. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=744.36s)]
*  Director Peters hired more staff to tackle the backlog, but she says it will take two years [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=748.0s)]
*  to clear those cases. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=753.32s)]
*  In response to the Dublin lawsuit, Bureau of Prisons lawyers say inmates' claims have been [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=755.2s)]
*  investigated and that no threat remains. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=760.2s)]
*  We've done a tremendous job in the last year rebuilding that culture and [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=763.2s)]
*  creating a institution that is more safe where individuals feel comfortable coming [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=768.36s)]
*  forward and reporting claims. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=774.2s)]
*  You just use the phrase tremendous job in Dublin. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=776.6s)]
*  Eight inmates have filed a class action lawsuit and they've got testimony from more than 40 [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=780.48s)]
*  current and former Dublin inmates who say that the abuse is ongoing. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=786.72s)]
*  That means the process is working, that they have the ability to come forward. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=790.64s)]
*  They have the right to bring that class action lawsuit together. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=794.44s)]
*  These Dublin inmates say that they are facing retaliation for speaking out. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=797.48s)]
*  I have been very clear that retaliation will not be stood on my watch. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=801.0s)]
*  And so when allegations of retaliation come forward, they are investigated and we will [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=805.44s)]
*  hold those people accountable. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=810.08s)]
*  It's one thing for you to say that retaliation is not tolerated, but it sounds like it's [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=811.84s)]
*  actually still happening. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=816.5600000000001s)]
*  Again, I would say those are allegations. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=817.84s)]
*  I would like to be more grounded in fact around proven retaliation. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=820.12s)]
*  The fact is that an additional 19 staff members have been accused of abusing inmates. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=825.8s)]
*  The Bureau says those staff members have been put on leave, new management has been brought [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=831.4s)]
*  in and there are now working security cameras in areas where inmates were abused. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=836.0s)]
*  What are these victims owed? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=841.28s)]
*  To have individuals who are in our care who rely on us for their safety and security and [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=846.4799999999999s)]
*  to have that be violated. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=854.48s)]
*  I don't know that you can bring anything that would undo that wrong. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=856.36s)]
*  What about an apology? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=861.24s)]
*  The victims in Dublin say they've never received an apology. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=862.72s)]
*  Well, I will tell you that is our mission to keep them safe. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=865.76s)]
*  That is our job. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=871.0799999999999s)]
*  Is your job to apologize for what happened in Dublin? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=872.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't know that my job is to apologize. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=874.64s)]
*  Is it heartbreaking and horrendous to have something like that happened when you are [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=877.36s)]
*  proud of your profession as a corrections professional? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=882.1600000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=885.4000000000001s)]
*  In addition to the lawsuit filed this past August, more than 45 current and former Dublin [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=887.5200000000001s)]
*  inmates have filed lawsuits alleging sexual abuse by Bureau of Prison staff. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=892.96s)]
*  If you're a fan of crime novels and movies, you've probably heard of Interpol, the international [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=906.5600000000001s)]
*  police organization was started 100 years ago when 20 countries, including the U.S., [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=912.0999999999999s)]

*  crime and the country seeking the arrest. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1139.8s)]
*  The red notice is not an international arrest warrant. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1143.32s)]
*  That is also very often misunderstood. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1146.48s)]
*  How would you describe it? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1148.2s)]
*  It seems like it's a digital wanted poster. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1149.72s)]
*  Yes, it's an alert that we are disseminating that somebody is wanted by a member country. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1152.16s)]
*  Each notice is vetted by a task force Secretary General Stock created to make sure it doesn't [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1158.6000000000001s)]

*  But the vetting is not foolproof. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1171.28s)]
*  Some of Interpol's more repressive members take advantage of red notices using fabricated [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1174.16s)]
*  charges to locate, detain and extradite people they want to get their hands on, like political [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1179.56s)]

*  the constitution to believe them. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1247.48s)]
*  Does Interpol view all the information that comes out of all of them as equal? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1249.84s)]
*  This is one of our main frustrations is that Interpol don't penalize countries properly. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1254.88s)]
*  They want everyone in their club. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1260.14s)]

*  They've not suspended Russia. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1270.18s)]
*  So Russia is still an active member of Interpol. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1272.9s)]
*  Russia accounts for nearly half of the red notices Interpol makes public. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1276.0600000000002s)]
*  According to a Russian police official, its Interpol bureau in Moscow helped arrest and [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1280.7s)]

*  Members of Congress, human rights groups, and the European Union have labeled Russia [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1303.08s)]
*  a serial abuser of red notices. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1307.62s)]
*  So Russia is widely viewed as being fairly brazen in its attempt to manipulate the system. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1310.4399999999998s)]
*  The famous example that we often talk about is Bill Browder. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1315.76s)]

*  officials. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1337.3s)]
*  Magnitsky was arrested and died after being beaten in a Moscow prison. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1338.54s)]
*  Browder was convicted in absentia on suspect fraud charges. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1344.06s)]
*  The Kremlin turned to Interpol to bring him in. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1349.18s)]
*  So how many times by your count has Russia tried to arrest you by way of Interpol? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1352.5s)]
*  Eight times. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1359.54s)]

*  Every time I cross the border, my heart starts beating a little bit faster. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1474.9s)]
*  We asked Jurgen Stock why, after all this, Russia hasn't been suspended from Interpol, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1479.5s)]
*  especially considering the UN is investigating Russia for war crimes in Ukraine. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1485.6599999999999s)]

*  can be a member in good standing with Interpol. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1497.1599999999999s)]
*  Interpol introduced some measures when the conflict started to avoid any political abuse [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1501.1s)]
*  of our systems. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1508.5s)]
*  We also decided to keep, let's say, the channels of information open. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1509.94s)]
*  Russia is hardly the only country to use Interpol to do its dirty work. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1516.14s)]
*  Bahrain, for example, used Interpol to nab a professional soccer player, an outspoken [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1520.38s)]

*  He remains in prison awaiting extradition. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1539.58s)]

*  I don't know how to characterize the people who get caught up in this. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1560.1399999999999s)]
*  Are they collateral damage? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1564.6599999999999s)]
*  No, I would never call that collateral damage. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1567.02s)]
*  And we are investing all we can to ensure that every piece of information in our databases [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1569.6599999999999s)]
*  are compliant with our rules and regulations. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1576.2s)]
*  But you know, and we have heard, of incidents where people are languishing in jail because [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1578.54s)]
*  of erroneous information that was sent out by Interpol. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1586.42s)]
*  I'm not saying that the system is perfect. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1591.82s)]
*  We see wrong decisions on a national level and we have seen wrong decisions also in Interpol. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1594.72s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1599.84s)]
*  A small number of cases. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1600.84s)]
*  Interpol admits in 2022, 304 of nearly 24,000 wanted person alerts were found to violate [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1602.88s)]
*  its rules and were eventually denied or deleted. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1611.56s)]
*  The organization declined to share which countries were the worst offenders. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1615.18s)]
*  There are well documented cases against Russia, China, Turkey, United Arab Emirates for repeatedly [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1620.2s)]
*  abusing the Interpol notices. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1629.04s)]
*  Why not name and shame these countries? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1632.04s)]
*  Because we believe this is not in the interest of international police cooperation. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1636.42s)]
*  You need to have a platform where information is being collected from different parts of [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1640.38s)]
*  the world where criminal groups are operating. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1644.1200000000001s)]
*  We want to provide a channel even between states that have diplomatic difficulties or [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1646.82s)]
*  even are in conflict. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1651.74s)]
*  Our decision is not to police a member country in terms of their human rights agenda. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1653.58s)]
*  That's not our role as a technical police organization. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1658.06s)]
*  That's not justice though, it's not justice. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1661.0s)]
*  We get it right most of the time. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1662.5s)]
*  British barristers Rhys Davies and Ben Keith say if Interpol is to survive another 100 [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1663.86s)]
*  years, it must learn to police itself. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1670.3s)]
*  We are concerned about the rule of law and human rights and Interpol are concerned about [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1674.34s)]
*  trying to catch people who are allegedly criminals. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1677.86s)]
*  And only innocent people get caught up in the middle. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1680.06s)]
*  It feels a bit like that's the sort of price they're prepared to pay for catching the bad [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1682.74s)]
*  guys. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1686.9399999999998s)]
*  And we think that the price that is paid is far too high. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1688.1s)]
*  And lo before the flood the Lord said to Noah, make yourself an ark, bring out every kind [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1691.86s)]
*  of living creature. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1707.82s)]

*  But what happens today when disaster threatens animals? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1711.24s)]
*  A powerful force, a zoo, a foreign government, even the US Department of Justice, often calls [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1714.3s)]
*  from on high and enlists the services of one man, Pat Craig, founder of the Wild Animal [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1719.28s)]
*  Sanctuary in Colorado, who's emerged as the go-to guy for orchestrating high stakes rescues [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1725.0s)]
*  around the world. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1731.08s)]
*  Last spring, we accompanied this modern day Noah to his zoo in Puerto Rico for his most [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1732.7s)]
*  ambitious mission yet. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1737.2s)]
*  These lions were once literally the pride of Puerto Rico. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1741.6s)]
*  Housed at the Dr. Juane Rivero Zoo in the coastal town of Mayaguez, the only zoo on [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1745.14s)]
*  the island. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1750.7800000000002s)]
*  But after years of decline, mismanagement and neglect, this was the tableau that greeted [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1751.7800000000002s)]
*  Pat Craig and his wife Monica when they arrived here from Colorado. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1757.9s)]
*  What was your impression when you got to the zoo for the first time? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1762.2800000000002s)]
*  The animals were very, very sad looking and some of them were very, very sick. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1765.98s)]
*  I felt physically and emotionally overwhelmed. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1771.22s)]
*  And even while we were there, animals died almost on a weekly basis. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1775.58s)]
*  So that felt even worse because we're present and yet we were there too late. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1778.78s)]
*  Over the course of a decade, the US Department of Agriculture cited the zoo two dozen times [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1783.8600000000001s)]
*  for substandard conditions and animal mistreatment. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1788.82s)]
*  After hurricanes Irma and Maria ravaged the island, the zoo closed to the public in 2018. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1793.1000000000001s)]
*  For the more than 300 winged, scaled and four-legged residents still captive, the situation turned [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1799.26s)]
*  from bad to downright desperate. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1806.3799999999999s)]
*  We saw a zebra that had a horrible wound on her leg and her tail and she couldn't stand [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1809.26s)]
*  up. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1814.66s)]
*  We saw a pig that had a skin condition. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1815.66s)]
*  Her skin was just falling apart. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1817.86s)]
*  A mountain lion's untreated cancer had been allowed to spread all over its body. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1819.9s)]
*  Seeing the mountain lion suffering the way that he was, that broke my heart and not [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1824.78s)]
*  being able to, sorry. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1829.34s)]
*  Yeah, help him. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1832.34s)]
*  It was just so evident that this facility was way beyond repair. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1834.34s)]
*  The US Department of Justice, which enforces federal animal welfare laws in the states [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1840.22s)]
*  in Puerto Rico, agreed and in February staged an extraordinary intervention, sending a battalion [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1844.98s)]
*  of agents to the zoo to evacuate every single species to permanent homes on the mainland. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1851.18s)]
*  To lead this mission, to captain this arc as it were, the DOJ tapped wild animal sanctuary [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1857.8200000000002s)]

*  extraction. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1874.6200000000001s)]
*  Among the targets, seven lions sweltering in a concrete bunker. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1876.3s)]
*  And they never hooked up the power after the hurricane, and they never hooked up the [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1880.82s)]
*  power to the zoo. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1883.86s)]
*  Never. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1884.86s)]
*  Wait a minute, there's a zoo that's functioning with animals there and there's no power? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1885.86s)]
*  There's no electricity. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1889.5s)]
*  And then if you look at the pictures from the inside of their building, you know, it's [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1890.6599999999999s)]
*  the old steel bars, just like jail cells, all in a row. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1893.86s)]
*  When it came time to coax the cats out of their cages, Craig entered the lion's den. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1897.62s)]
*  Gather the lions, we're necessarily happy to see you and go with you. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1902.86s)]
*  What happened? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1907.1799999999998s)]
*  We're definitely defensive because they don't know who we are and what we're doing and why. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1908.26s)]
*  And so we show up and we're like, believe me, you got to trust me, we're trying to help [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1911.5s)]
*  you here. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1914.54s)]
*  Well, sweet talking didn't work. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1915.54s)]
*  So they deployed plan B, sedation. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1920.14s)]

*  Over the course of five months, Craig and his team of 20 used patience, prodding, pursuit. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1929.66s)]
*  And grape jelly to lure each animal into its custom built crate. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1937.22s)]
*  A camel, a kangaroo, a rhinoceros. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1944.38s)]

*  They were like, no, I don't think, I don't think that's right. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1978.98s)]
*  The animals belong here. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1982.3000000000002s)]
*  It was a sentiment shared by many in the community and at times resistance curdled into outright [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1984.8600000000001s)]
*  sabotage. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1990.7s)]
*  The rescue team had nearly wrangled Mundy, once a star attraction, into her transport [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1992.56s)]
*  crate, when suddenly... [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1997.9199999999998s)]
*  Out of nowhere, this elephant just flies up, tears out of there, starts running around. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=1999.6799999999998s)]
*  What do you think happened? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2005.12s)]
*  Well, I think somebody shot her with a BB gun, if you ask me. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2006.12s)]
*  And hit her in the rear end. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2008.76s)]
*  Hit her in the rear end just to make her hate that crate. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2009.76s)]
*  Now she thinks that crate did something to her. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2012.3999999999999s)]
*  We reached out to Puerto Rico's Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, which [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2015.08s)]
*  is responsible for the zoo. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2019.56s)]
*  In a statement, it said the animals were provided with comprehensive care and denied there was [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2021.76s)]
*  any neglect, blaming problems at the zoo on hurricane damage, limited resources and aging [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2026.5s)]
*  animals. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2033.56s)]
*  Once the transport was finally ready, a police escort to the airport. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2035.04s)]
*  Then the animals were loaded, one by one, onto charter flights bound for new homes Craig [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2040.04s)]
*  had arranged at sanctuaries across the U.S. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2045.28s)]
*  How do you ferry to safety an 8,000 pound elephant like Mundy? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2048.88s)]
*  On a 747 cargo jet, of course. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2053.6600000000003s)]
*  Departure brought a sigh of relief. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2057.44s)]
*  When she took off, I cried. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2060.4s)]
*  Because I said, thank you God, she's in, it's over, she's out of here. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2062.28s)]
*  There's no question about it anymore. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2067.32s)]
*  Pat and Monica Craig took as many of the rescues as they could back to their 1,200 acre facility. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2069.96s)]
*  A vast menagerie roams the grassy enclosures on the high plains of eastern Colorado. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2075.96s)]
*  Each of the 700 plus animals here came with a sad backstory, wagging their own tales of [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2081.64s)]
*  woe as it were. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2087.2000000000003s)]
*  Tigers kept in garages as pets. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2089.0s)]
*  Lions saved from a zoo in war-torn Ukraine. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2091.84s)]
*  Bears abused at a Korean medical facility. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2095.16s)]
*  Now 64, Craig got the idea for the place as a teenager in the 1970s, when a friend who [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2098.8s)]
*  worked at a zoo gave him a tour behind the scenes. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2104.6400000000003s)]
*  There were all these animals, lions and tigers, that were in small cages and he said these [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2107.0400000000004s)]
*  will be euthanized and I thought, wow, this is crazy, you know, these are healthy, they're [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2111.8s)]
*  not old, they're not sick. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2116.0400000000004s)]
*  Craig decided right then and there to open his own sanctuary on his parents' small Colorado [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2117.92s)]
*  farm. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2122.6000000000004s)]
*  With few regulations to guide him, he built the animal enclosures himself and scoured [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2124.0800000000004s)]
*  biology books for pointers. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2128.88s)]
*  Did you have any experience with lions and tigers? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2131.1200000000003s)]
*  No, none. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2134.12s)]
*  Did you have a degree in zoology? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2135.12s)]
*  No, I was just starting college back then, it was going to be a business degree. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2136.92s)]
*  And he quickly learned that lions and tigers are no house cats. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2140.6s)]
*  In the early years I was in the hospital more times than you could count. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2145.16s)]
*  It was like, okay, don't do that again, and you know, it's just so all those years of [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2148.12s)]
*  making mistakes and not getting killed. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2151.92s)]
*  What specifically does a mistake look like? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2154.3199999999997s)]
*  Pretty bad. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2156.6s)]
*  I've had my left arm almost completely torn off, I've had bit through the chest and collapsed [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2157.6s)]
*  lungs. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2161.04s)]
*  The animals Craig can handle, but on his missions to hostile environments around the world, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2162.56s)]
*  it's the people he often needs extra help managing. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2167.7999999999997s)]
*  Heavily armed federal marshals accompanied Craig when the Department of Justice dispatched [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2171.96s)]
*  him to retrieve maltreated big cats that had been kept by the notorious Tiger King, Joe [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2176.72s)]
*  Exotic, the unlikely Netflix sensation, and his associates. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2182.72s)]
*  These two are among the 141 animals Craig liberated and brought back here. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2188.44s)]
*  What kind of condition was Joe Exotic keeping these guys in in Oklahoma? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2193.56s)]
*  Well, you know, it was just all these really small cages that were just in line after line [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2197.76s)]
*  because it was a gigantic breeding operation primarily. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2203.2000000000003s)]
*  The rescue missions and the sanctuary operate on an annual budget of $34 million. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2206.6000000000004s)]
*  Funding comes mostly from private donations. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2212.32s)]
*  When animals arrive here, this is often their first stop, designed to minimize shock by [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2215.56s)]
*  mimicking the conditions they came from. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2221.2s)]
*  Here they're evaluated and given a treatment plan, whether it's medication or emergency [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2224.24s)]
*  surgery. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2229.2799999999997s)]
*  Craig and staff veterinarian Dr. Michaela Vettors introduced us to Chad and Malawi, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2230.2799999999997s)]
*  both rescued from Puerto Rico. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2235.72s)]
*  How confident do we feel about our locks here? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2237.2799999999997s)]
*  Confident. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2239.84s)]
*  This guy wants to get out. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2240.84s)]
*  She says, yeah. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2241.84s)]
*  This guy's ready to hang out with us. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2242.84s)]
*  They suffer from permanent neurological damage, likely caused by malnutrition, something Craig [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2244.32s)]
*  could spot just by looking. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2249.96s)]
*  You see how she keeps doing that? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2251.92s)]
*  Yeah, at the finagle. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2252.92s)]
*  But really she just doesn't have a control over it. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2253.92s)]
*  Head tilting at an angle. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2255.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2256.7200000000003s)]
*  We've had literally hundreds of lions that have come through that have had that kind [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2257.7200000000003s)]
*  of problem. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2260.56s)]
*  You've seen this before? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2261.56s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2262.56s)]
*  The sanctuary devises a special diet for each animal, which requires 100,000 pounds of food [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2263.56s)]
*  per week, mainly donated by nearby Walmarts. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2269.88s)]
*  Occasional cupcakes included. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2274.0s)]
*  When we met him, Mikey the bear, another asylum seeker from Puerto Rico, was midway through [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2276.24s)]
*  his rehab. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2281.0s)]
*  Right now he's in his lockout just so we can medically manage him. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2282.6s)]
*  What did you see the first time you saw him? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2286.36s)]
*  He was in a great deal of pain, very gingerly moving. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2288.72s)]
*  We assume he's got a great deal of arthritis, which we've provided medications for, and [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2292.56s)]
*  now he's getting around almost like a young bear. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2297.24s)]
*  Bringing animals like Mikey back to physical health is one thing. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2300.36s)]
*  Ministering to their emotional wounds is often a bigger challenge. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2303.96s)]
*  Having been raised in captivity, many of the animals arrive with what amounts to severe [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2307.76s)]
*  PTSD, and they must be taught to trust the humans caring for them. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2312.6800000000003s)]
*  They're already mad at people anyway because of whatever people had done. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2318.04s)]
*  I had one tiger years ago that anytime you came near you'd want to hit the fence and [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2321.6400000000003s)]
*  kill you. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2324.88s)]
*  What's the time table for trying to ease some of the trauma these animals have been through? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2325.88s)]
*  Some were beaten, some were starved, some were mentally tormented to a degree. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2330.6400000000003s)]
*  Every case is different. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2337.28s)]
*  Some of them will do it in a matter of days, some will be in a few weeks. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2338.88s)]
*  Doesn't that story imply however traumatic this may have been, it's not irreversible? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2342.0800000000004s)]
*  It's not irreversible. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2347.2400000000002s)]
*  The goal of all this rehab is to get these wild animals to act the part. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2349.0800000000004s)]
*  Remember Mundy? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2355.0400000000004s)]
*  At the zoo she had zero contact with other elephants for more than 30 years. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2356.2s)]
*  We accompanied Craig on a visit to a refuge in Georgia where he placed Mundy under the [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2361.7999999999997s)]
*  care of conservationist Carol Buckley. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2365.96s)]
*  This marked the first time Craig and the elephant had seen each other since Puerto Rico. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2369.24s)]
*  What do you notice? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2373.56s)]
*  Well first thing she just looks so much healthier and just her demeanor is so much calmer and [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2374.56s)]
*  nicer. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2380.04s)]
*  Every day when I would go see her in the zoo I just got it, it's hurt. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2381.04s)]
*  And then now to see this is just amazing, just truly amazing. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2384.6s)]
*  Hey pretty lady. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2388.08s)]
*  Buckley provides the care and feeding, but happily admits Mundy's real mentors are the [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2389.7999999999997s)]
*  other elephants here. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2394.7999999999997s)]
*  You're just the innkeeper, you're just the chef. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2395.7999999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2398.0s)]
*  Hey I just open and close doors and make sure the waters are running, you know. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2399.0s)]
*  And the other elephant knows what they need to learn and they're instructing them, it's [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2402.7599999999998s)]
*  fantastic. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAqHbu6iLw&t=2406.7599999999998s)]
