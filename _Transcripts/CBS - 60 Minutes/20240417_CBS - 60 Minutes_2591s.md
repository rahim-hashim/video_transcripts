# Scattered Spider; Knife; Tasmanian Tiger | 60 Minutes Full Episode
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [April 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0)
*  One of the costliest ransomware attacks in history happened here in Las Vegas, when English-speaking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=0.0s)]
*  hackers teamed up with elite Russian hackers. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=13.8s)]
*  It may be just the beginning. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=17.42s)]
*  How many people are involved? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=19.76s)]
*  There's thousands of people involved at this point. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=21.64s)]
*  Did people try to kill you? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=26.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=28.48s)]
*  Salman Rushdie has been a marked man for nearly half his life, and in 2022, a knife-wielding [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=29.48s)]
*  attacker almost killed him. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=35.44s)]
*  This is his first television interview. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=38.2s)]
*  One of the surgeons who had saved my life said to me, he said, first you were really [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=40.76s)]
*  unlucky and then you were really lucky. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=45.68s)]
*  I said, what's the lucky part? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=47.32s)]
*  He said, well, the lucky part is that the man who attacked you had no idea how to kill [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  a man with a knife. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=54.28s)]
*  This is a Tasmanian tiger, or was a Tasmanian tiger. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=57.98s)]
*  Most scientists believe the apex predator to be extinct, but like Bigfoot and the Loch [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=62.5s)]
*  Ness Monster, plenty of people believe otherwise, that this tiger is still roaming this beautiful [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=67.25999999999999s)]
*  island. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=72.46s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, was this a mighty howl like this? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=73.46s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=81.5s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=83.06s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=84.36s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=85.62s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=87.14s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=88.14s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelli. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=89.5s)]
*  Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=91.26s)]
*  In the past year, hospitals, pharmacies, tech companies, Las Vegas' biggest hotels and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=102.5s)]
*  casinos have been paralyzed by ransomware attacks in which hackers break into a corporate [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=107.9s)]
*  network, encrypt or lock up critical files, and hold them hostage until a ransom is paid. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=113.74s)]
*  It's a crime that has been growing more costly and disruptive every year. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=120.41999999999999s)]
*  Now, cybersecurity researchers fear it's about to get worse. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=124.82s)]
*  With the emergence of an audacious group of young criminal hackers from the U.S., UK, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=129.56s)]
*  and Canada, the FBI calls Scattered Spider. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=134.94s)]
*  More troubling, they have teamed up with Russia's most notorious ransomware gang. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=139.02s)]
*  This past September, one of the most pernicious ransomware attacks in history was unleashed [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=149.42000000000002s)]
*  on MGM resorts, costing the hotel and casino giant more than $100 million. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=154.78s)]
*  It disrupted operations at a dozen of the most renowned gaming palaces on the Las Vegas [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=162.42000000000002s)]
*  Strip. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=167.34s)]
*  MGM Grand, Aria, Mandalay Bay, New York, New York, the Bellagio. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=168.34s)]
*  Anthony Curtis is a Las Vegas fixture. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=177.62s)]
*  He's so good at counting cards, he's been banned from card games here. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=180.58s)]
*  He now publishes the Las Vegas Advisor, a monthly newsletter on all things Vegas. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=185.58s)]
*  Incredibly, when it happened, I was in an MGM property. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=192.1s)]
*  And it happened while we were having dinner and there just began to be a rumbling that [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=195.62s)]
*  something was going on. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=199.38s)]
*  When I went down into the casino, I could see then that slot machines were sitting dark, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=200.94s)]
*  people were scrambling around, the shutdown was starting to take effect. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=205.98000000000002s)]
*  Across the Vegas Strip, thousands of slot machines suddenly stopped paying out. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=209.46s)]
*  So all of a sudden now people are going, how do I get my money, what's wrong? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=215.54000000000002s)]
*  And the people were sitting there waiting and couldn't get paid. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=218.82s)]
*  Were they angry? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=221.62s)]
*  They were getting angry, yeah. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=222.62s)]
*  And this was just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=224.2s)]
*  Elevators were malfunctioning, parking gates froze, digital door keys wouldn't work. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=226.76s)]
*  As computers went down, reservations locked up and lines backed up at the front desks. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=233.48s)]
*  Anything that required technology was not working. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=239.72s)]
*  Sounds like chaos. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=243.56s)]
*  Nobody knew what to do. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  And including the employees, the employees just had to beg forgiveness and patience. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  It's corporate terrorism at its finest. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=251.68s)]
*  The company declined our interview request, but at a conference a month after the hack, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  MGM's CEO admitted the disruptions were devastating. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=260.16s)]
*  For the next four or five days, with 36,000 hotel rooms and some regional properties, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=265.2s)]
*  we were completely in the dark. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=270.76s)]
*  The hackers demanded $30 million to unlock MGM's data. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  The company refused, but they still paid a price. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=277.5s)]
*  $100 million in lost revenue and millions more to rebuild their servers. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=281.7s)]
*  So how did the intruders get in? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=288.46s)]
*  Through a technique of deception and manipulation called social engineering. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=291.38s)]
*  First, hackers zeroed in on an employee, gathering information from the dark web and open sources [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=295.74s)]
*  like LinkedIn. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=302.14s)]
*  Next, a smooth-talking hacker impersonating the employee called the MGM tech help desk [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=303.70000000000005s)]
*  and convinced them to reset his password. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=310.66s)]
*  With that, the hacker was inside MGM's computers and unleashed the destructive malware. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=314.58000000000004s)]
*  Anthony Curtis says it was the cyber criminals' version of an Ocean's Eleven heist. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=322.5s)]
*  They're doing it the old-fashioned way. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=328.26s)]
*  I mean, they're doing it the new way, but with the old-fashioned goal, they want to get the money. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=329.46000000000004s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=332.82s)]
*  I don't want to be too glowing like I like these guys, because they're just crooks, right? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=333.82s)]
*  But these hackers were able to turn the tables. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=340.42s)]
*  The casinos have their systems, they have their protections, they have their experts, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=343.22s)]
*  they have their security. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=347.66s)]
*  These guys are better. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=349.54s)]
*  Later, MGM's biggest competitor, CSRS, admitted it also suffered a social engineering attack [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=350.94s)]
*  around the same time, suspected by the same group. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=357.66s)]
*  But CSRS paid a ransom, reportedly $15 million, and suffered no disruptions. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=361.94s)]
*  From an FBI perspective, our position is we recommend a ransom not be paid, but we understand [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=369.42s)]
*  it's a business decision during a time of crisis. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=375.18s)]
*  Brian Vornedrin is head of the FBI's cyber division. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=378.18s)]
*  He told us ransomware attacks have grown increasingly brazen. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=382.18s)]
*  Any way you look at the numbers, it's a problem for the global economy, and for the U.S. economy, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=386.9s)]
*  and for the security of the United States. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=392.97999999999996s)]
*  There's estimates that global losses exceed $1 billion U.S. dollars per year. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=395.38s)]
*  Have you made any arrests in the Las Vegas cases? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=399.78s)]
*  We're not going to talk about specific cases or specific companies with... [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=403.26s)]
*  But he did point us toward the prime suspect. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=407.26s)]
*  When we talk about the actors behind some of the more recent ransomware attacks, the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=410.41999999999996s)]
*  name that's generally raised is Scattered Spider, and that's a criminal group that we [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=416.02s)]
*  have a lot of attention on because of the havoc they're wreaking across the United States. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=420.5s)]
*  Scattered Spider is what the FBI calls a loose-knit web of predominantly native English-speaking [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=425.82s)]
*  hackers responsible for the casino hacks and dozens more. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=431.85999999999996s)]
*  Their specialty is social engineering. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=436.46s)]
*  Part of their success is because they are fluent in Western culture, they know how our society [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=439.62s)]
*  works, they know what to say to get someone to do something. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=444.62s)]
*  Allison Nixon is chief research officer at Unit 221B, a cybersecurity firm that focuses [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=448.22s)]
*  on English-speaking cyber criminals. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=455.7s)]
*  She says Scattered Spider is just one of many illicit hacking groups, all part of a sprawling [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=458.86s)]
*  collection of online criminals calling themselves the community or the comm. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=465.54s)]
*  The comm is a subculture. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=471.58s)]
*  It is specifically an English-speaking youth subculture that has arisen in the past few [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=474.44s)]
*  years. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=480.6s)]
*  It's very new, but it's surprisingly disruptive. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=481.96s)]
*  Members of the comm have hacked into companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Electronic Arts. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=486.72s)]
*  How many people are involved? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=493.36s)]
*  Years ago it was maybe a few hundred people, but since 2018 the population has exploded [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=495.72s)]
*  because of the money coming into these groups. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=503.35999999999996s)]
*  And there's thousands of people involved at this point. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=506.64s)]
*  How are they connected? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=509.4s)]
*  They connect over the internet, social spaces where people hang out, gaming servers. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=510.52s)]
*  It's almost analogous to like maybe the back alley where the bad kids hang out, but on [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=517.66s)]
*  the internet. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=523.5s)]
*  How old are we talking about? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=524.5799999999999s)]
*  Males under the age of 25. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=526.38s)]
*  Under 25 down to how young? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=528.18s)]
*  Like 13, 14. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=531.44s)]
*  Involved in pulling off major crimes. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=533.9200000000001s)]

*  There was not only a language barrier, but also they kind of looked down on them and [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=603.62s)]

*  So there's a term, it's called ransomware as a service, that's been given to the structure [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=670.74s)]

*  DiMaggio says the Russian government provides a safe haven for ransomware gangs. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=734.98s)]

*  state, they don't get prosecuted. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=747.78s)]
*  It's not considered a crime. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=750.26s)]
*  It's not considered a crime to attack American businesses? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=751.74s)]
*  It's crazy, right? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=755.58s)]
*  That's how it works though. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=757.26s)]
*  So it's like they operate with impunity. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=758.26s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=760.1800000000001s)]

*  Russian ransomware has become such a threat, the elite cyber warriors at the National Security [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=765.5400000000001s)]
*  Agency have joined the fight. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=771.22s)]
*  Before retiring last month, Rob Joyce was NSA's director of cybersecurity. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=773.82s)]
*  He told us the colonial pipeline attack was a wake-up call. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=779.5s)]
*  It caused us to step back and decide that we had to put more resources into this foreign [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=784.0600000000001s)]
*  threat. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=789.74s)]
*  So one of the things NSA has, we have hackers and it really at times takes a hacker to defeat [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=790.74s)]
*  a hacker. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=796.86s)]
*  That's the value NSA can bring is we can identify people, specific people involved in some of [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=798.02s)]
*  these activities. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=803.98s)]
*  The NSA helped identify the Russian hacker responsible for the colonial pipeline attack [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=804.98s)]
*  And in January 2022, after months of negotiations, Russia arrested him and other accomplices. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=813.74s)]
*  But five weeks later, it all came undone. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=822.1s)]
*  Following the Ukraine invasion, those people were let out of jail. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=826.22s)]
*  So they're back in business? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=829.78s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=831.18s)]
*  And now they've teamed up with the young native English speakers of Scattered Spider. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=832.26s)]
*  The FBI's Brian Vorndrin calls it an evolution of cybercrime. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=837.82s)]
*  In the case of Scattered Spider, is it powerful that they are with Black Hat? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=842.8s)]
*  Of course. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=847.96s)]
*  I think that it's important to know that we are against a very capable set of adversaries. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=848.96s)]
*  They're very good at their work. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=854.96s)]
*  We're also very good at our work. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=856.4s)]
*  In January, the Bureau arrested a 19-year-old from Florida, Noah Urban, charged with stealing [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=858.2s)]
*  cryptocurrency. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=864.92s)]
*  He's pleaded not guilty. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=866.12s)]
*  Other investigators have tied him to Scattered Spider, but so far not to the casino heists. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=869.12s)]
*  The Scattered Spider hackers who did pull off the attack are still online, hiding in [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=875.64s)]

*  it gets worse. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=895.52s)]
*  And it feels like, as defenders, it's almost like we're winning every battle and losing [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=897.16s)]
*  the war. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=902.64s)]
*  Salman Rushdie has been a marked man for nearly half his life. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=912.16s)]
*  In 1989, Iran's leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, declared his novel, The Satanic Verses, blasphemous, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=916.16s)]
*  an insult to Islam, and called for the Indian-born writer's assassination. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=922.36s)]
*  Rushdie went into hiding with around-the-clock police protection for 10 years. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=927.64s)]
*  He eventually moved to the U.S. and thought he was safe. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=931.96s)]
*  But in August 2022, as he was about to speak at a literary festival in Chautauqua, New [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=935.5600000000001s)]

*  Rushdie, who's now 76, lost his right eye and came close to dying. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=944.88s)]

*  This is his first television interview since the attack. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=958.84s)]
*  You had had a dream two days, I think it was, before the attack. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=962.86s)]
*  What was the dream? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=967.96s)]
*  I kind of had a premonition. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=968.96s)]
*  I mean, I had a dream of being attacked in an amphitheater. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=969.96s)]
*  It was a kind of Roman Empire dream, you know, as if I was in the Coliseum. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=974.68s)]
*  And it was just somebody with a spear stabbing downwards and I was rolling around on the [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=980.68s)]
*  floor trying to get away from him. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=983.88s)]
*  And I woke up and was quite shaken by it. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=987.0s)]
*  And I had to go to Chautauqua, you know, and I said to my wife, Eliza, I said, you know, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=990.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't want to go. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=995.3599999999999s)]
*  Because of the dream? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=996.4s)]
*  Because of the dream. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=997.4s)]
*  And then I thought, don't be silly, it's a dream. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=998.4s)]
*  Salman Rushdie, one of his generation's most acclaimed writers, had been invited to the [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1000.8s)]
*  town of Chautauqua, close to Lake Erie, to speak about a subject he knows all too well, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1005.64s)]
*  the importance of protecting writers whose lives are under threat. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1012.0s)]
*  Did you have any anxiety being in such a public space? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1016.04s)]
*  Not really, because in the more than 20 years that I've been living in America, I've done [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1020.4799999999999s)]

*  Long time. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1031.44s)]
*  But you know, what happens in many places that you go and lecture is that they're used [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1032.44s)]
*  to having a certain degree of security, venue security. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1036.92s)]
*  In this case, there wasn't any. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1041.16s)]
*  The irony, of course, is you were there to talk about writers in danger. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1042.4s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1045.88s)]
*  And the need for writers from other countries to have safe spaces in America, amongst other [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1047.2s)]

*  For years, no place was safe for Salman Rushdie, whose sprawling 600 page novel, The Satanic [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1056.72s)]

*  death in 1989. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1074.48s)]
*  There were worldwide protests from London to Lahore. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1078.48s)]
*  The Satanic Verses was burned and 12 people died in clashes with police. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1082.1599999999999s)]

*  I thought probably some conservative religious people wouldn't like it, but they didn't like [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1097.08s)]
*  anything I wrote anyway. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1101.32s)]
*  So I thought, well, they don't have to read it. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1102.32s)]
*  Were you naive? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1105.4799999999998s)]
*  Probably. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1106.4799999999998s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's easy looking back to think, but nothing like this had ever happened [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1107.4799999999998s)]
*  to anybody. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1110.7199999999998s)]
*  And of course, almost all the people who attacked the book did so without reading it. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1111.84s)]
*  I was often told that I had intended to insult, offend people. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1117.28s)]
*  My view was, if I need to insult you, I can do it really quickly. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1121.44s)]
*  I don't need to spend five years of my life trying to write a 600 page book to insult you. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1124.92s)]
*  Rushdie was living in London when he went into hiding and for the next 10 years, the [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1131.64s)]
*  British government provided him with 24 hour police protection. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1135.84s)]
*  Did people try to kill you? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1140.0s)]
*  There were maybe as many as half a dozen serious assassination attempts, which were not random [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1141.8400000000001s)]
*  people. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1147.04s)]
*  They were state sponsored terrorism professionals. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1148.04s)]
*  After diplomatic negotiations, the Iranian state called off its assassins in 1998. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1151.04s)]
*  Rushdie finally came out of the shadows. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1156.8400000000001s)]
*  He moved to New York and for the next two decades lived openly. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1159.6000000000001s)]
*  He was a man about town. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1163.3200000000002s)]
*  He continued writing and became a celebrated advocate for freedom of expression. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1165.48s)]
*  So when he received the invitation to speak in Chautauqua in August 2022, he gladly accepted. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1170.68s)]
*  I was seated at stage right. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1177.04s)]
*  In his new book, Knife, he describes what happened next. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1179.0s)]
*  Then in the corner of my right eye, the last thing my right eye would ever see, I saw the [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1183.0800000000002s)]
*  man in black running towards me down the right hand side of the seating area. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1188.3600000000001s)]
*  Black clothes, black face mask. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1193.3200000000002s)]
*  He was coming in hard and low, a squat missile. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1195.6200000000001s)]
*  I confess I had sometimes imagined my assassin rising up in some public forum or other and [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1199.48s)]
*  coming for me in just this way. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1205.8400000000001s)]
*  So my first thought when I saw this murderous shape rushing towards me was, so it's you. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1208.8400000000001s)]
*  Here you are. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1215.96s)]
*  So it's you, here you are. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1217.8s)]
*  It's like you've been waiting for it. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1220.28s)]
*  That's what it felt like. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1222.48s)]
*  It felt like something coming out of the distant past and trying to drag me back in time, if [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1223.48s)]
*  you like, back into that distant past in order to kill me. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1228.64s)]
*  And when he got to me, he basically hit me very hard here. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1232.8000000000002s)]
*  And initially I thought I'd been punched. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1238.4s)]
*  You didn't actually see a knife. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1241.0800000000002s)]
*  I didn't see the knife. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1242.0800000000002s)]
*  And I didn't realize until I saw blood coming out that there would have been a knife in [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1243.0800000000002s)]
*  his fist. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1247.72s)]
*  So where was that stab? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1248.92s)]
*  Here. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1250.3200000000002s)]
*  In your neck? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1251.3200000000002s)]
*  In my neck, yeah. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1252.3200000000002s)]
*  Then there were a lot more. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1253.3200000000002s)]
*  First wounds, there was a big slash wound like this across my neck. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1255.32s)]
*  And there's a puncture stab wound here. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1259.9199999999998s)]
*  And then of course there was an attack on my eye. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1264.1599999999999s)]
*  Do you remember being stabbed in the eye? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1266.3999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1269.3999999999999s)]
*  I remember falling. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1270.3999999999999s)]
*  Then I remember not knowing what had happened to my eye. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1272.48s)]
*  He was also stabbed in his hand, chest, abdomen and thigh. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1275.52s)]
*  15 wounds in all. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1279.96s)]
*  He was both stabbing and also slashing. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1282.12s)]
*  I think he was just wildly... [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1284.4399999999998s)]
*  The attack lasted 27 seconds. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1286.6399999999999s)]
*  To feel just how long that is. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1289.56s)]
*  This is what 27 seconds is. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1291.9199999999998s)]
*  That's it. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1312.12s)]
*  That's quite a long time. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1322.32s)]
*  That's the extraordinary half minute of intimacy in which life meets death. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1323.6799999999998s)]
*  What stopped it from being longer? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1332.9199999999998s)]
*  The audience pulling him off me. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1335.12s)]
*  Strangers to you? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1337.2399999999998s)]
*  To this day I don't know their names. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1338.2399999999998s)]
*  Some of those strangers restrained the attacker while others desperately tried to stem the [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1340.44s)]
*  flow of Rushdie's blood. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1344.92s)]
*  There was really a lot of blood. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1346.52s)]
*  You were actually watching your blood. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1348.8s)]
*  I was actually watching it spread. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1349.8s)]
*  And then I remember thinking that I was probably dying. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1351.68s)]
*  And it was interesting because it was quite matter of fact. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1355.16s)]
*  It wasn't like I was terrified of it or whatever. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1358.96s)]
*  And yeah, there was nothing. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1362.0s)]
*  No heavenly choirs. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1363.14s)]
*  No pearly gates. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1365.26s)]
*  I mean, I'm not a supernatural person. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1366.26s)]
*  I believe that death comes as the end. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1369.2s)]
*  There was nothing that happened that made me change my mind about that. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1371.6000000000001s)]
*  You have not had a revelation. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1374.64s)]
*  I have not had any revelation except that there's no revelation to be had. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1376.2s)]
*  His attacker, the man in black, was hustled off the stage. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1380.72s)]
*  In the book, you do not use the attacker's name. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1385.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1388.92s)]
*  I thought, you know, I don't want his name in my book. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1389.92s)]
*  And I don't use it in conversation either. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1392.56s)]
*  That is important to you not to give him space in your brain. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1394.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1397.48s)]
*  I had 27 seconds together. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1398.48s)]
*  You know, that's it. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1400.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't need to give him any more of my time. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1402.28s)]
*  Paramedics flew Rushdie to a hospital in Erie, Pennsylvania, 40 miles away, where a team [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1406.16s)]
*  of doctors battled for eight hours to save his life. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1411.28s)]
*  When he finally came out of surgery, his wife, Eliza, a poet and novelist, was waiting. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1414.8s)]
*  And he wasn't moving and he was just laid out. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1419.68s)]
*  He looked half dead to you. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1423.52s)]
*  Yes, he did. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1425.28s)]
*  He was a different color. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1426.8s)]
*  He was cold. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1428.72s)]
*  I mean, his face was stapled, just staples holding his face together. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1429.72s)]
*  Rushdie was on a ventilator, unable to speak. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1436.52s)]
*  Eliza and the doctors had no idea whether the knife that had penetrated his eye had [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1439.76s)]
*  damaged his brain. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1444.76s)]
*  Someone from the staff said that we would use this system of wiggling the toes. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1446.6s)]
*  To communicate. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1452.96s)]
*  To communicate. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1453.96s)]
*  Was that the first question you asked to get a wiggle? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1455.1200000000001s)]
*  I think I said, Salman, it's Eliza. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1457.4s)]
*  Can you hear me? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1459.52s)]
*  And there was a wiggle. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1461.04s)]
*  And asked him, I think, can you, do you know where you are? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1465.28s)]
*  And he wiggled. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1468.32s)]
*  And it was very basic, simple questions. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1471.0s)]
*  You can't express yourself with any subtlety with your toes. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1474.04s)]
*  Which is your favorite thing. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1477.92s)]
*  After 18 days in the hospital and three weeks in rehab, Rushdie was discharged. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1482.6799999999998s)]
*  One of the surgeons who had saved my life said to me, first you were really unlucky [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1488.4399999999998s)]
*  and then you were really lucky. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1493.56s)]
*  I said, what's the lucky part? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1495.6s)]
*  And he said, well, the lucky part is that the man who attacked you had no idea how to [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1497.6399999999999s)]
*  kill a man with a knife. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1501.52s)]
*  You're not a believer in miracles. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1503.24s)]
*  But the fact that you survived, you write in the book, is a miracle. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1505.1399999999999s)]
*  This is a contradiction. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1508.76s)]
*  How does somebody who doesn't believe in the supernatural account for the fact that [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1510.88s)]
*  something has happened which feels like a miracle? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1515.0s)]
*  I mean, I certainly don't feel that some hand reached down from the skies and guarded me. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1516.96s)]
*  But I do think something happened which wasn't supposed to happen. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1522.24s)]
*  And I have no explanation for it. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1526.16s)]
*  His attacker was a 24-year-old from New Jersey who lived in his mother's basement. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1528.5800000000002s)]
*  He's believed to be a lone wolf. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1533.3600000000001s)]
*  He's pleaded not guilty to attempted murder and is awaiting trial. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1535.7s)]
*  In an interview, he told the New York Post he'd only read a couple pages of the satanic [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1539.86s)]
*  verses and seen some clips of Rushdie on YouTube. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1544.1799999999998s)]
*  He said he didn't like him very much because Rushdie had attacked Islam. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1547.78s)]
*  Does it matter to you what his motive was? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1553.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting to me because it's a mystery. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1555.78s)]
*  If I had written a character who knew so little about his proposed victim and yet was willing [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1559.78s)]
*  to commit the crime of murder, my publishers might well say to me that that's under-motivated. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1566.26s)]
*  You need to develop that character. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1571.6s)]
*  Yeah, not enough of a reason. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1572.6s)]
*  You know, not convincing. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1574.6s)]
*  But yet that's what he did. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1576.92s)]
*  Rushdie's Knife, his 22nd book, is one he initially did not want to write. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1579.44s)]
*  That was the last thing I wanted to do. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1584.92s)]
*  Because you didn't want this to yet again define you? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1586.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1589.48s)]
*  It was very difficult for me after the satanic verses was published that the only thing anybody [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1590.48s)]
*  knew about me was this death threat. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1593.94s)]
*  But it became clear to me that I couldn't write anything else. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1596.5s)]
*  You had to write this first? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1600.04s)]
*  I had to write this first. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1601.04s)]
*  I just thought, you know, I need to focus on, you know, to use the cliché, the elephant [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1602.04s)]
*  in the room. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1606.66s)]
*  And the moment I thought that, kind of something changed in my head. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1607.66s)]
*  And it then became a book I really very much wanted to write. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1611.3000000000002s)]
*  You say the language was my knife. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1614.42s)]
*  If I had unexpectedly been caught in an unwanted knife fight, maybe this was the knife I could [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1616.8600000000001s)]
*  use to fight back, to take charge of what had happened to me, to own it, make it mine. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1620.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, language is a way of breaking open the world. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1625.36s)]
*  I don't have any other weapons, but I've been using this particular tool for quite a long [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1632.4399999999998s)]
*  time. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1636.52s)]
*  So I thought this was my way of dealing with it. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1637.52s)]
*  It's been almost two years since the attack, and Rushdie is back home now in New York, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1640.96s)]
*  slowly getting used to navigating the world with one eye. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1646.24s)]
*  How much time did it take to kind of readjust? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1650.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm still doing it. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1651.8999999999999s)]
*  You still are? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1653.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1654.26s)]
*  Do you feel like you are a different person after the attack? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1655.26s)]
*  I don't feel I'm very different, but I do feel that it has left a shadow. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1657.82s)]
*  I think that shadow is just there. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1661.4199999999998s)]
*  And some days it's dark and some days it's not. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1663.8999999999999s)]
*  You feel less than you were before? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1667.54s)]
*  No, I just feel more the presence of death. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1669.2199999999998s)]
*  In an interview almost 25 years ago, you said of the fatwa, I want to find an end to this [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=1672.78s)]

*  all sorts of things. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2009.1200000000001s)]
*  Way beyond the guy with binoculars saying, I think I may have seen something. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2010.2399999999998s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2015.1999999999998s)]
*  He can't help notice. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2016.6799999999998s)]
*  No one ever quite captures a clear image. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2018.08s)]
*  Still, reported sightings come by the thousands. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2021.56s)]
*  Have you ever gotten a report or ever looked into something that gave you a little pause? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2025.3999999999999s)]
*  Yes, sometimes people are dead accurate with the times, the places, the distances, and [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2030.76s)]
*  the very good naturalists often don't exaggerate. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2038.76s)]
*  They take their skills very seriously, and it's very hard to say to those people, I don't [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2042.48s)]
*  think you saw a thalassein. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2049.48s)]
*  For the devoted army of seekers, the investment isn't just one of hope and time. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2051.16s)]
*  Each year, Richo spends more than he cares to admit dollars on trail cam batteries alone. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2056.08s)]
*  How much money have you sunk into this exception? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2062.84s)]
*  Sir, I wouldn't like to speculate, and please don't tell my wife. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2065.16s)]
*  Make it our secret. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2070.16s)]
*  It's our secret. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2072.16s)]
*  She often asks, and I go, don't get your hair done darling. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2073.16s)]
*  Go shopping. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2078.16s)]
*  Can I stop that one? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2079.16s)]
*  Can I stop that one? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2080.16s)]
*  Can you redo that one again? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2081.16s)]
*  In the bush, we met another enthusiast, Chris Rayberg, who flies down from mainland Australia [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2082.16s)]
*  and approaches the search in the manner of a CSI detective. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2090.64s)]
*  Apart from the cameras, I gather you've been scouring for prints, fur, even poo? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2094.84s)]
*  Yeah, everything. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2101.84s)]
*  So scats, footprints is a big one, and I found a series of 18, 19 individual steps in a track [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2102.84s)]
*  line that are an excellent match for Tassie Tiger. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2109.34s)]
*  Not only are they an excellent match, the quality of the prints is pristine. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2113.04s)]
*  Scats, keep an eye out, check it out. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2116.44s)]
*  What's the animal been eating? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2118.8s)]
*  No. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2119.8s)]
*  Yeah, and calls if you hear them. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2120.8s)]
*  There are even tracking collectives. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2122.94s)]
*  Richo was part of the Booth Richardson Tiger team. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2125.58s)]
*  Thank you for joining us on what we believe is a historic day. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2128.54s)]
*  Which made worldwide news in 2017 after calling a press conference to announce a sighting. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2133.7400000000002s)]
*  But when they provided this image as proof, Nick Mooney assessed it as a chance, but not [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2139.9s)]
*  an official confirmation. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2145.1s)]
*  What is the middle ground? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2147.06s)]
*  You can be right, you can be lying, or? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2148.06s)]
*  Or you can have an illusion. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2150.98s)]
*  And there's all sorts of ways that memory can be affected by time. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2152.58s)]
*  I've had lots of talks with psychiatrists and detectives trying to figure out this. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2159.54s)]
*  You really often have to make a choice, a personal call in the end. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2164.5s)]
*  To essentially tell them they're wrong and their mind is deceiving them? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2169.54s)]
*  You can't tell them that because you don't know. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2173.2200000000003s)]
*  Essentially, if you weren't there, you don't know. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2175.2200000000003s)]
*  Richo and all the other seekers won't have to wait long. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2177.34s)]
*  They won't even have to go into the bush if a group of tech investors and biologists [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2179.98s)]
*  deliver on their goal. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2184.7s)]
*  Andrew Pass counts himself among the Tassie Tiger transfixed. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2186.7s)]
*  He comes to the quest, though, armed not with binoculars, but a microscope in his tiger [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2190.94s)]
*  lap. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2196.18s)]
*  Envision that day when you're not just wearing it on a pen? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2197.18s)]
*  100 percent, yeah, 100 percent. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2199.7s)]
*  I think about it all the time, what it would be like to be in that landscape and just to [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2201.18s)]
*  see one walking past in the bush, an actual one rather than a crappy photograph. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2205.14s)]
*  Tell us exactly what you're doing. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2209.7799999999997s)]
*  We can't magically bring the Tasmanian Tiger back. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2211.74s)]
*  We have to start with a living cell and then engineer our thylacine back into existence. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2214.8199999999997s)]
*  So the way you do that is you find the closest living relative to your animal that has gone [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2221.58s)]
*  extinct. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2225.8999999999996s)]
*  And for us, that is a small, mass-appealed species called the fat-tailed dunart. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2227.18s)]
*  A developmental biologist at the University of Melbourne, Pasc has raised $15 million [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2231.8999999999996s)]
*  for a de-extinction project that recalls Jurassic Park. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2237.46s)]
*  In partnership with American company Colossal Biosciences, which counts, wait for it, Leonardo [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2241.62s)]
*  DiCaprio, Paris Hilton and even the CIA among its backers. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2247.78s)]
*  He's adamant he'll replicate the genome of a dunart, a mouse-like marsupial, and turn [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2252.38s)]
*  it into a much larger Tassie Tiger. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2257.26s)]
*  We'll let him explain. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2260.58s)]
*  We examine all of its DNA. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2262.26s)]
*  We compare that to the DNA of your extinct species, the Tasmanian Tiger, and we look [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2264.4s)]
*  at everywhere that those two genomes or those two piles of DNA, if you like, are different. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2268.8s)]
*  And once you've identified those differences, it's just a matter of then going in and making [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2274.84s)]
*  all of those edits to turn your fat-tailed dunart genome or cell into a thylacine cell. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2280.46s)]
*  And you're saying that dunart, that little field mouse marsupial dunart is closer than, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2286.64s)]
*  say, the Tasmanian Devil. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2292.2000000000003s)]
*  But that little dunart is a ferocious carnivore, even though it's very, very small, and it's [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2293.96s)]
*  a very good surrogate for us to be able to do all of this editing in. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2298.44s)]
*  A native of Minnesota, Chris Helgen is director of the Australian Museum Research Institute [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2302.64s)]
*  in Sydney. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2307.44s)]
*  He understands the push to de-extinct the Tassie Tiger. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2308.68s)]
*  This is one of my favorite mammals. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2312.52s)]
*  Really? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2314.48s)]
*  And I love all mammals. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2315.48s)]
*  I am a mammal guy. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2317.54s)]
*  This is a special, special animal. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2319.56s)]
*  He took us upstairs to his lab to show us why. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2322.84s)]
*  So this is Tasmanian Tiger of the 19th century. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2326.1200000000003s)]
*  See the stripes, see the thick tail, see this gaping mouth with the sharp teeth. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2330.6400000000003s)]
*  What do you make of this de-extinction effort with respect to the Tasmanian Tiger? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2335.84s)]
*  You know, I would be the first person to line up to see this animal if it could be somehow [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2340.4s)]
*  brought back from extinction. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2346.1600000000003s)]
*  Helgen is the skeptic, gently explaining that wishing Tassie Tigers were running rampant [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2348.04s)]
*  doesn't overcome science. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2354.08s)]
*  The idea that you could actually tweak the DNA of this mouth-sized animal into making [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2356.4s)]
*  this apex predator of Australia, it stretches imagination in many different ways. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2363.22s)]
*  This is an impossible project. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2370.82s)]
*  We all have optimism, we all have innovation. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2373.38s)]
*  What they're saying is we're going to modify the genome of a dunnart to create a genetically [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2375.58s)]
*  modified dunnart that might look a bit more like a thylacine. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2381.2s)]
*  Maybe we'll be able to tweak it genetically and it gets a bit bigger. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2385.1s)]
*  Maybe we'll be able to tweak it genetically and it has some stripes on it. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2388.98s)]
*  But there's about a thousand and one steps in between. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2392.9s)]
*  Helgen has thought about the source of the current Tassie Tiger passion and wonders how [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2396.7799999999997s)]
*  much of it is driven by remorse. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2401.14s)]
*  It's a special symbol about Australia and about what we've lost. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2404.04s)]
*  We've had a lot of extinctions here in the last 100, 200 years. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2409.0s)]
*  30 mammals alone. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2413.44s)]
*  So in the United States, only one or two mammal species have disappeared entirely. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2415.74s)]
*  So why are people taking this seriously and why are people investing so much in this? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2421.2599999999998s)]
*  So many people have the dream if we could just get this animal back. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2425.86s)]
*  It would help us think different about extinction or the guilt that we might feel of having [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2431.42s)]
*  removed such a special animal from the planet. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2436.52s)]
*  Whether they imagine it might be still hiding in Tasmania or in a lab to be reborn, there's [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2439.48s)]
*  this burning hope. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2446.6s)]
*  Richo reckons that if his countrymen in the DNA sequencing labs can resurrect a Tassie [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2448.76s)]
*  Tiger, good on him. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2453.84s)]
*  But regardless, he'll continue coming here. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2456.0s)]
*  With unshaken, he's certain this animal, most famous for being extinct, is not extinct at all. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2460.1s)]
*  If someone accused you of being obsessed, would you please guilty? [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2467.3s)]
*  Oh, sir, I'll put my hand up to that. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2470.58s)]
*  Your Honor, I am guilty. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2472.82s)]
*  You're a Tasmanian Tiger obsessive. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2473.82s)]
*  I am indeed. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2475.94s)]
*  It's been my love. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2476.94s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2478.9s)]
*  Why have you continued to search so long for this? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2479.9s)]
*  I just know it's there. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2482.62s)]
*  I do. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2483.62s)]
*  In my own heart, I know it's there. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4tj_DIYB0&t=2484.62s)]
