# Fall of Newspapers, Rise of Misinformation | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [April 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to)
*  It's hardly news that the newspaper business is on the ropes. Some papers have folded completely, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=0.0s)]
*  others have reduced the number of pages, virtually an entire industry in free fall. You may need [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  to easy access to the web, offering news practically as it happens. The most recent casualty is the New [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=26.6s)]
*  Orleans Times-Picayune, an institution that's seen the city through good times and the worst of times, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=33.68s)]
*  a part of the very fabric of a unique American city. Last October, the Times-Picayune began [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=39.84s)]
*  publishing only three days a week, making New Orleans the largest American city without a daily [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=46.96s)]
*  paper. Advanced publications owned by the Newhouse family decided on major surgery for the paper [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=53.279999999999994s)]
*  before the economics of publishing killed it outright. We visited New Orleans just prior to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=59.8s)]
*  the amputation. There's no doubt New Orleans is a city like no other. A wonderful ethnic cocktail, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=66.96s)]
*  a place that dances to its own rhythm, and a town devoted to its traditions, like the Times-Picayune, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=78.8s)]
*  the legendary newspaper that had published every single day in New Orleans for 175 years. The [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=87.2s)]
*  tradition of waking up in the morning and breaking that cup of coffee and opening up that paper, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  it seems to be going by the wayside. When you take away a venerable institution like the Times-Picayune, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  you really kind of take away a piece of the soul of a city. Mitch Landrieu, the mayor of New Orleans, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=104.32s)]
*  says the loss of a daily paper is a terrible blow to a city that has had more than its fair [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=109.0s)]
*  share of misfortune. People in the city were worried that it was going to send a message to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  the rest of the country that we want a big league city because we're not going to have a daily paper. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  But the facts of life are that newspapers are folding all over the country. It's a dying business. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=123.28s)]
*  It may be, but that doesn't mean people have to like it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  Norah Linneans may be outraged that the paper now publishes only three days a week, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=134.23999999999998s)]
*  but they still start those days with their coffee and beignets and their Times-Pic. Established in [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=139.44s)]
*  1837, it was called the Picayune because that's how much it cost. One Picayune, an old Spanish coin. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=146.48s)]
*  The paper became a civic watchdog, a nemesis of corrupt politicians like Huey Long. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=154.72s)]
*  Classic American writers like O. Henry and William Faulkner wrote for the paper. It won several [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=161.04s)]
*  Pulitzer Prizes most recently for its reporting of Hurricane Katrina. It has a central role that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=167.6s)]
*  newsmen like me dream of and it's hard to not have a crush on it. David Carr, a reporter who covers [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=175.44s)]
*  all things media for the New York Times, says the Times-Picayune was one of the few things that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=182.64s)]
*  worked in a city that generally doesn't. Schools aren't great. Public housing doesn't go very well. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=189.28s)]
*  They have problems with their police. They've always had a really good newspaper. If it works, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=195.68s)]
*  how come it's going under? Delivering a newspaper, like making it thump on your doorstep, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=201.52s)]
*  it's a really hard business. It's an expensive business. What the new houses did is said, you [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=208.0s)]
*  know what, this only really works three days a week, so let's cut to those three days. That's when [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=214.24s)]
*  it pays. As sad as it is to witness local newspapers die or slowly disappear, technology [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  and the economic facts are inescapable. The lumbering and expensive process of rolls of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=227.52s)]
*  newsprint being fed into gigantic presses that spew out tons of newspapers which must be loaded [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=234.24s)]
*  onto trucks that drive into the night to ultimately deliver the paper to doorsteps, diners, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=241.36s)]
*  and newsstands. It seems almost quaint when you consider that the same news, only fresher, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=248.96s)]
*  can be dispatched at the speed of light to millions at a fraction of the cost. And yet, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=255.28s)]
*  the Times-Picayune still showed a profit. I think that the Times-Picayune was making money, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=261.68s)]
*  but the trend lines for all of Newhouse's newspapers, including the Times-Picayune, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=268.96s)]
*  was down eight to ten percent every single year. So it's sort of an existential threat. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  So Steve Newhouse, chairman of the company's digital arm, announced a massive restructuring [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=280.56s)]
*  to build a viable future for the paper. The focus would shift to the paper's 24-hour website. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=286.64s)]
*  A print edition would be published only Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday. More than 200 people would [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=293.44s)]
*  lose their jobs, press operators, copy editors, photographers, and distinguished senior reporters. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=299.36s)]
*  The changes were called painful, but inevitable. Steve Newhouse declined to be interviewed. He [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=306.32s)]
*  referred us to Jim Amos, the highly respected longtime editor of the paper. Did you agree with [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=313.28s)]
*  the decision to start publishing only three days a week? Well, we've been grappling, as [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=320.16s)]
*  all metro newspapers in this country have, with what's happening to our industry. And that is [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=326.24s)]
*  a steady decline in circulation, a steady decline in print ad revenue. And the solutions, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=332.88000000000005s)]
*  there aren't many. One is to act as though nothing were happening and continue business as usual. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  To me, that's presiding over a gradual irrelevancy and a gradual death. What you're [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=348.4s)]
*  saying is that the patient was dying and the only way to save it was to cut off all four limbs and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=354.23999999999995s)]
*  replace it with an artificial one. The patient, and by that I would say the national patient, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=360.08s)]
*  has been in a lingering illness for a very long time. And some of the doctors are standing by [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=367.2s)]
*  and wringing their hands. And some are walking away and saying this is an incurable illness. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=374.16s)]
*  And others are actually trying operations that have a good chance of succeeding. The company is [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=380.88000000000005s)]
*  hoping that by reducing the number of publishing days at many of its 35 regional newspapers, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  it will drive readers to their websites. They are determined, determined to transform [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=396.24s)]
*  these newspapers into digital franchises. But if you think of most newspapers are in the emergency [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=403.84s)]
*  room, right, they're all wounded one way or another. And you pick the Times-Picayune, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=410.08s)]
*  really one of the stronger papers in America, and say, ah, we'll do major surgery on that one. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=414.79999999999995s)]
*  Seems odd. Did they anticipate the kind of outrage that the announcement produced? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=420.23999999999995s)]
*  They knew they were going to get some blowback. I don't think they expected the gale force wins, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=426.23999999999995s)]
*  the hurricane wins that came at them. I mean, people were frantic. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=431.36s)]
*  Advertisers declared their objections. Rallies were held for fired employees, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=437.36s)]
*  and Save the Picayune posters sprung up throughout the town. The city council passed a resolution [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  urging the owners to continue printing daily. An open letter was published where local worthies [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=449.36s)]
*  warned that the new houses were losing the trust of the community. If the new houses have given up [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=455.84s)]
*  on New Orleans as they have, why not just sell it? Don't hold us hostage. Anne Milling, a local [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=462.08s)]
*  philanthropist, is one of several prominent New Orleanians who supported the protest. She was [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=468.32s)]
*  joined by Gregory Amont, Archbishop of New Orleans, and Lois Eli, a writer and former Times-Picayune [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  columnist. Why this outrage over a newspaper cutting back? Part of what happened, particularly [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=481.2s)]
*  that to Katrina, was a sense of community. And the Times-Picayune was a big part of that. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  The paper published literally through hell and high water. Dozens of reporters kept the world [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=493.44s)]
*  informed about what was happening while even their own homes were flooded. In the aftermath, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=499.84s)]
*  the paper became a beacon of civic solidarity. We've recovered a great deal, but we still have [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=506.4s)]
*  a long way to go. There are serious issues before us that we need that daily watchdog voice. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=512.64s)]
*  Archbishop, this has more to do with mammon than with God. How come you got so deeply involved in [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=519.1999999999999s)]
*  it? I got deeply involved because I'm from New Orleans. I was born and raised here. I have a [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=525.36s)]
*  great love for the people in the city and our tradition. But besides that, I really am concerned [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=530.48s)]
*  about the elderly and the poor. This puts them in a very disadvantaged position. The reduced paper [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=536.64s)]
*  was portrayed as a bold step into the digital future. But New Orleans is one of the least [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=543.12s)]
*  wired cities in the country, with more than a third of the city without internet access. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  That's huge in terms of the population of this community. And you can say, well, maybe these [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=555.92s)]
*  people don't read the newspaper, but I can promise you, you can see people, black, white, young, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=561.12s)]
*  old, Hispanic, Vietnamese, buying newspapers at drugstores, grocery stores, sitting at coffee [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=566.72s)]
*  shops. People read the Times Pick You. Well, I think what the suggestion is that the future [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=572.3199999999999s)]
*  looks very bleak for the paper. Like any business, they go, look ahead. One of the puzzling things [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=578.16s)]
*  for me is that we know that there are others, specifically Mr. Tom Benson, who was willing to [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=583.2s)]
*  buy the paper. Tom Benson, a local billionaire, owner of the New Orleans Saints football team, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=588.08s)]
*  offered to buy the paper to keep it printing daily. He was told the paper was not for sale. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=594.1600000000001s)]
*  If someone is foolish enough to want to buy a newspaper and you're in the business of showing [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=600.8000000000001s)]
*  a profit, you'd think you would jump at the offer. Well, I think our owners are also in the business [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=606.72s)]
*  of newspapering and journalism and care about the preservation of the news report that we are going [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=612.24s)]
*  to be able to deliver in this town. I know that sounds terribly altruistic, but I've just seen so [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=618.88s)]
*  much evidence of that being the case. Did you expect that this decision would be made with such [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=626.0s)]
*  outrage? Well, I'm a product of this community. This is my hometown. I think I know it well. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=631.6s)]
*  And I understand the sadness. I understand the anger. And we all have something in common, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=637.5999999999999s)]
*  and that is that we're driven by a passion for this city. Lolis Eli, the former columnist, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=645.12s)]
*  has the passion but doesn't believe the abbreviated paper will satisfy it. How can half as many people [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=652.0s)]
*  cover the same amount of news with half as many resources? You fear for the quality of the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=659.12s)]
*  journalism. Though the owners promised an improved website and created new jobs to service it, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=664.0s)]
*  Eli says it's geared towards fun and games rather than watchdog journalism. Do you feel that a [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=670.64s)]
*  newspaper online is a toothless watchdog? It's not the same if I call you and I say, Morley, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=677.2s)]
*  I'm going to put this story online two weeks from now or three days from now. It's not the same thing. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=684.8s)]
*  There's no law of nature that says that that kind of journalism is inextricably linked to ink on [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=690.4s)]
*  paper. We fully intend to continue to produce the kind of public trust journalism for which [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=697.28s)]
*  they know us. New Orleans is a kind of reporter's delight. Yeah, of course it is. Yes. Yeah, I mean, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=704.32s)]
*  we tell good stories. We tell good stories. Oh, we make good stories. There's a lot of [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=710.72s)]
*  hanky panky goes on. Yes, sir. Do you think that the city and state are going to suffer because [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=714.64s)]
*  the watchdog isn't on watch in quite the same way? Right. I hope not. The more robust press we have, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=721.04s)]
*  the better everybody is. So I'm hoping that that is not going to suffer. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=727.6s)]
*  The great steel presses of the times, Pekeun, are mostly silent now, reduced to working less than [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=731.84s)]
*  half the time. The question is, will it become less than half of what it once was? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=738.4s)]
*  And there are rumblings that an even larger Newhouse newspaper, the Cleveland Plain Dealer, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=746.9599999999999s)]
*  founded in 1842 and with a circulation close to 300,000, could soon be next. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=752.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=768.4s)]
*  Newspaper industry in state of decline, not exactly a stop the presses headline. For two decades now, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=777.28s)]
*  owing largely to the loss of advertising revenue to Facebook and Google, fewer and fewer Americans [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=784.0s)]
*  get their news, comics, and sports from all those gazettes and tribunes and journals. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=789.6s)]
*  But that doesn't tell the whole story. As we first reported in February, there is an additional [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=794.8s)]
*  threat, hedge funds and other financial firms that own nearly a third of the daily newspapers [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=799.92s)]
*  in America. And these new owners are often committed not to headlines and deadlines, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=805.4399999999999s)]
*  but to bottom lines. One fund in particular has been called by some in the industry a vulture, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=810.4799999999999s)]
*  bleeding newspapers dry. It all prompts the question, as local newsrooms and local news [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=816.4s)]
*  coverage shrivel up, to what extent does democracy shrink with it? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=822.0s)]
*  Behind the marching band and baton twirlers at the annual 4th of July parade in Pockstown, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=829.28s)]
*  Pennsylvania, you'll find a one-man band. Reporter Evan Brand, snapping photos, taking notes, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=834.4s)]
*  and gathering quotes. The paper comes out tomorrow. Tomorrow? Every day. Tell me all about what you're [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=842.64s)]
*  doing here. We're just looking forward to a great 4th of July. For the last 24 years, he's [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=849.04s)]
*  chronicled this community of 23,000 for the local newspaper, the Mercury, J-A-S, which at one time [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=853.28s)]
*  had dozens of reporters. Now, Brand is literally the last reporter standing in Pockstown. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=860.3199999999999s)]
*  When a community like this loses their local reporters, what else are they losing? It reminds [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=868.64s)]
*  us all about shared experiences. You know who died. You know who graduated from high school. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=874.72s)]
*  You know whose kid had a great game. You know, those are all important elements about holding [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=880.96s)]
*  people together. Describing the soul of a community. Sure. Brand took us to the old headquarters of the [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=887.52s)]
*  Mercury. Punching above its weight, the Mercury won a Pulitzer Prize in 1979 and another in 1990. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=895.04s)]
*  Now it looks like this. My desk was right about here and the editor sat up there. The sports guys [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=902.88s)]
*  were along here. The photographers were in the back. Anyone could walk in the front door and say, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=911.52s)]
*  I need to talk to a reporter. My sewer is backing up and the township isn't doing anything about it. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=917.12s)]
*  Can you do something? Behold the new Mercury headquarters. We're going up to the Mercury [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=921.68s)]
*  newsroom. Brand's turned his attic into a command center. That's where the magic happens. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=927.04s)]
*  It's here that he scrambles to cover Pockstown, 20 surrounding towns and nine different school [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=934.16s)]
*  districts. Overworked and overwhelmed, Brand has seen his industry battered by all sorts of forces, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=939.8399999999999s)]
*  disappearing classified ads, people getting news for free online. But he says the worst culprit is [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=947.68s)]
*  the hedge fund Alden Global Capital, which bought the Mercury in 2011 and has since sold the paper's [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=953.36s)]
*  building and slashed newsroom staff by about 70 percent. Severe even by the standards of the [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=959.2s)]
*  newspaper sector that has seen an astounding 57 percent job loss since 2008. In 2017, after another [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=965.6800000000001s)]
*  round of layoffs, Brand says he felt angry and wanted answers and accountability. So he paid a [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=974.48s)]
*  visit to the Hampton summer home of Heath Freeman, the 41-year-old president of Alden Global Capital, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=980.32s)]
*  and knocked on the door. What did you want to say to him? What I settled on is what value do you [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=986.32s)]
*  place on local news? And I'm not talking about money. What value do you place on? Brand recalls [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=992.32s)]
*  that a woman let him in. Behind her, he caught a glimpse of Freeman, who walked away. You never [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=999.5200000000001s)]
*  got to ask him that question. I did not. This secretive hedge fund, their website shows this [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1004.88s)]
*  single photo, started building its print empire over the last decade and now owns more than 200 [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1010.4s)]
*  newspapers, making it the country's second largest newspaper owner behind Gannett. Alden's rapid [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1016.64s)]
*  takeover and cuts have alarmed U.S. lawmakers. In 2019, 21 senators wrote to Heath Freeman, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1023.6s)]
*  asking him to abandon his newspaper killing business model. Freeman, though, has doubled [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1030.4s)]
*  down. Last year, Alden made a play for Tribune Publishing, home to historic papers like The [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1035.76s)]
*  Baltimore Sun and the Chicago Tribune. This is an attack on our democracy. Gary Marks and David [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1041.44s)]
*  Jackson spent 30 years as investigative reporters at the Chicago Tribune, a paper that has won 27 [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1047.6000000000001s)]
*  Pulitzer prizes. Local and regional newspapers are so important to our communities, to holding [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1054.4s)]
*  our leaders accountable. They're not just going after some business that is trying to make money. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1062.72s)]
*  They admit the Tribune had been crippled for years by bad management, but after seeing Alden [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1068.88s)]
*  buy the Denver Post and then gut staff by 70 percent, the journalists were worried the hedge [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1074.0800000000002s)]
*  fund would do irreversible damage. So what did you do? We fought back. That's what we did. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1079.36s)]
*  Dave and I just decided that we are going to throw everything we possibly can, use all our [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1085.52s)]
*  investigative and repertorial skills to save this organization that is so important we felt to the [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1090.24s)]
*  future of this city we love, Chicago. So this investigative team, accustomed to exposing [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1097.52s)]
*  corruption and injustice, acting as watchdogs on local government, they turn their attention [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1103.6s)]
*  to their potential new owners. You've said when Alden Capital arrived, it was an existential [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1108.64s)]
*  threat. Why is this firm particularly nefarious? Well, Alden has sort of a playbook of going into [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1114.4s)]
*  a distressed newsroom and selling off the real estate and property equipment, things like that, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1122.0s)]
*  and second of all, diminishing the resources that the reporters have. Leak company financials show [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1129.3600000000001s)]
*  in 2017 Alden built in profit margins as high as 30 percent at certain papers, more than double [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1136.32s)]
*  industry standard. In recent filings, the New York Times company reported 10 profit margins. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1143.44s)]
*  These are executives from a hedge fund who live in a very wealthy lifestyle. They're not taking [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1149.68s)]
*  the profits and using them to build the Tribune. What's your response to someone who'd say, look, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1157.52s)]
*  this is capitalism? Well, we've always been aware that we're doing journalism in a capitalist [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1163.28s)]
*  democracy and we've always embraced that, but we felt that Alden didn't recognize the civic trust [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1170.0s)]
*  that's embedded in this profit-making machine. Jackson and Marx say what they learned about [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1177.44s)]
*  Alden only fueled their sense of urgency. So in 2020, putting their jobs at risk, they wrote an [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1183.04s)]
*  op-ed in the New York Times pleading for a philanthropist foundation, anyone to step forward [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1189.2s)]
*  to save their paper. One man tried, Maryland hotel magnate Stuart Banem, a lifelong subscriber to the [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1194.64s)]
*  Baltimore Sun. Banem committed 200 million dollars and we followed him last year scrambling to put [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1201.76s)]
*  together a deal to buy Tribune Publishing. We've done the due diligence, we just need a buyer. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1207.92s)]
*  Banem couldn't find a partner. Last year, Alden bought Tribune Publishing for more than 600 million [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1213.6000000000001s)]
*  dollars and two days later started offering buyouts to Tribune employees. More than 40 [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1219.92s)]
*  have since left the Chicago Tribune, including one-fourth of the newsroom. Freeman declined our [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1225.5200000000002s)]
*  repeated request to sit down with 60 Minutes, but his public relations team sent us letters he wrote [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1232.0s)]
*  to other newspaper owners that state, Alden is committed to providing robust, independently-minded [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1237.52s)]
*  local journalism and that it's time for tech giants to start paying for the billions of dollars [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1243.28s)]
*  they're making off of news publishers content. The newspaper crisis didn't begin with Alden, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1248.56s)]
*  and this is not the only financial firm in this sector, but Alden is often held up as the worst [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1254.8s)]
*  actor. One study conducted by the University of North Carolina in 2018 found that some Alden-owned [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1260.48s)]
*  newspapers had cut staff at twice the rate of their competitors. Stephen Waldman is a former [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1266.8s)]
*  journalist. In 2011, he studied the decline of the local news industry for the Federal [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1272.56s)]
*  Communications Commission. He says that in the absence of local reporting, there's evidence of [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1277.28s)]
*  increased corruption by local officials. One example he points to, Bell, California. When the [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1282.24s)]
*  local newspaper there shut down, scandal ensued. Thank you, thank you very much. The elected [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1288.8s)]
*  officials just kept voting themselves pay raises to the point where the city manager was making [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1294.48s)]
*  eight hundred thousand dollars just because there was no one there. I'm guessing there's nothing [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1299.52s)]
*  specifically corrupt about Bell, California that wouldn't replicate in any of a thousand other [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1305.1200000000001s)]
*  towns. Pretty much through all of human history and throughout the world, when you have power [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1309.68s)]
*  that isn't watched, it tends to get abused. Waldman says it's not just that local news has [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1314.4s)]
*  been hollowed out, it's what has replaced it. The vacuum was filled by national cable news [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1320.48s)]
*  and social media and very opinionated polarizing material. Waldman believes in flooding communities [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1329.04s)]
*  with local reporters. In 2017, he co-founded Report for America, a program that sends print, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1336.56s)]
*  radio and television journalists to newsrooms in underserved communities across the country. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1343.2s)]
*  We brought together five reporters. I'm Chrisanna Mink, I'm a pediatrician and also a health [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1348.6399999999999s)]

*  I'm an investigative reporter that covers poverty in West Virginia. Chris Jones, a Marine Corps [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1360.0s)]
*  veteran, covers domestic extremism in Appalachia. Grace and Doctor covers race and equity in Charlotte. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1365.76s)]
*  These studies that show that people trust local media more than national media doesn't sound like [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1372.8s)]
*  that surprise you, those results. And these are our neighbors, you know? I mean, we're not writing [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1378.48s)]
*  about someone I'm never going to talk to again. They're people before they're interview subjects. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1384.1599999999999s)]
*  This is Jones on January 6th. He had cultivated such a level of trust from his sources that he [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1389.9199999999998s)]
*  was one of the few reporters covering the insurrectionists as they stormed the U.S. Capitol. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1395.9199999999998s)]
*  I got a lot of calls immediately after the 6th from a lot of different like news organizations, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1400.96s)]
*  people who wouldn't answer an email from me, you know, a week prior. You were the local journal, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1407.52s)]
*  you had the sources, you had the relationships. A lot of national media is coastal and it stays [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1411.68s)]
*  coastal unless there's a big news event and then they fly the reporters in, write the story and [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1417.04s)]

*  care for each other. The version of Facebook that exists today is tearing our societies apart and [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1758.96s)]
*  causing ethnic violence around the world. Ethnic violence including Myanmar in 2018 [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1765.12s)]
*  when the military used Facebook to launch a genocide. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1771.6799999999998s)]

*  that I had felt and I had seen how high the stakes were in terms of making sure there was [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1795.28s)]
*  high quality information on Facebook. At headquarters she was assigned to civic [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1801.2s)]
*  integrity which worked on risks to elections including misinformation. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1806.0s)]
*  But after this past election there was a turning point. They told us we're dissolving civic integrity. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1811.04s)]
*  Like they basically said oh good we made it through the election there wasn't riots [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1819.3600000000001s)]
*  we can get rid of civic integrity now. Fast forward a couple months we got the insurrection [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1822.64s)]
*  and when they got rid of civic integrity it was the moment where I was like [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1827.8400000000001s)]
*  I don't trust that they're willing to actually invest what needs to be invested to keep Facebook [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1833.7600000000002s)]
*  from being dangerous. Facebook says the work of civic integrity was distributed to other units. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1839.5200000000002s)]
*  Haugen told us the root of Facebook's problem is in a change that it made in 2018 to its algorithms, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1847.5200000000002s)]
*  the programming that decides what you see on your Facebook news feed. So you know you have [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1856.08s)]
*  your phone you might see only 100 pieces of content if you sit and scroll off for you know [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1862.32s)]
*  five minutes but Facebook has thousands of options it could show you. The algorithm picks from those [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1867.6s)]
*  options based on the kind of content you've engaged with the most in the past. And one of [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1874.24s)]
*  the consequences of how Facebook is picking out that content today is it is optimizing for content [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1880.8s)]
*  that gets engagement or reaction but its own research is showing that content that is hateful [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1886.6399999999999s)]
*  that is divisive that is polarizing it's easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1893.12s)]
*  emotions. Misinformation angry content is enticing to people and keeps them on the platform. Yes. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1899.52s)]
*  Facebook has realized that if they change the algorithm to be safer people will spend less time [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1908.88s)]
*  on the site they'll click on less ads they'll make less money. Haugen says Facebook understood [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1915.2s)]
*  the danger to the 2020 election so it turned on safety systems to reduce misinformation [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1921.1200000000001s)]
*  but many of those changes she says were temporary. And as soon as the election was over they turned [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1928.5600000000002s)]
*  them back off or they changed the settings back to what they were before to prioritize growth [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1933.92s)]
*  over safety and that really feels like a betrayal of democracy to me. Facebook says some of the [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1938.48s)]
*  safety systems remained but after the election Facebook was used by some to organize the January [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1944.56s)]
*  6th insurrection. Prosecutors cite Facebook posts as evidence, photos of armed partisans, and text [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=1952.72s)]

*  when you consume more content people enjoy engaging with things that elicit an emotional reaction [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=2032.88s)]
*  and the more anger that they get exposed to the more they interact and more they consume. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=2039.8400000000001s)]
*  That dynamic led to a complaint to Facebook by major political parties across Europe. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=2044.5600000000002s)]

*  As a publicly traded company, Facebook is required to not lie to its investors or even [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=2211.2799999999997s)]

*  or if they're more like telephone companies that merely transmit everyone's speech. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=2409.44s)]
*  If the laws are upheld, the platforms could be forced to carry hate speech and false medical [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56aO2Dr2to&t=2416.24s)]
