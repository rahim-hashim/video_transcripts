# Child prodigies and geniuses | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [October 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o)
*  We cannot explain what you are about to hear. Science doesn't know enough about the brain [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=0.0s)]
*  to make sense of Alma. Alma Deutcher is an accomplished British composer in the classical [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=18.92s)]
*  style. She is a virtuoso on the piano and the violin, and she is 12 years old. She's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=25.6s)]
*  different from other prodigies we have known because at the age of 10 she wrote an opera [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=34.0s)]
*  which demands comprehensive mastery. Not just how to play the piano, but what is the range [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=39.36s)]
*  of the oboe? What can a cellist play? We don't know how she understands it all. It seems [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=45.16s)]
*  that Alma was born that way. What is your earliest musical memory? I remember that when [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=51.36s)]
*  I was three and I listened to this really beautiful lullaby by Richard Strauss, and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=63.44s)]
*  that was when I really first realized how much I loved music, and I asked my parents, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=69.88s)]
*  but how can music be so beautiful? You remember the melody? Yes. You want me to sing it? Please. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=75.44s)]
*  Those notes of Richard Strauss ignited a universe. At three, Alma was playing piano and violin. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=81.28s)]
*  When did the composing begin? When I was four, I just had these melodies and ideas in my head, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=97.4s)]
*  and I would play them down on the piano. Sometimes my parents would think that I was just remembering [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=107.44000000000001s)]
*  music that I'd already had before, but I said, no, no, these are my melodies that I composed. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  This past summer in Austria, we watched Alma prepare her violin concerto and the premiere [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=127.12s)]
*  of her piano concerto. Giochi Hattori conducts the Vienna Chamber Orchestra. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=133.96s)]
*  Just the clarinet. Just the clarinet. What I really want to hear is the violin and the clarinet. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=139.68s)]
*  That night, the soloist was the composer herself, and as you listen, remember, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=144.28s)]
*  she wrote all the notes for all the instruments. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=154.32s)]
*  We could see Alma was living a story. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=163.88s)]
*  A story of loss. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=186.8s)]
*  A story of redemption. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=188.28s)]
*  Scales of emotion beyond a child. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=194.2s)]
*  And yet her vision was almost like wisdom. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  Do you have any idea where this comes from? I don't really know, but it's really very normal [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  to me to go around, walk around and having melodies popping into my head. It's the most [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=242.32s)]
*  normal thing in the world. For me, it's strange to walk around and not to have melodies popping [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=247.6s)]
*  into my head. So if I was interviewing you, I would say, well, tell me, Scott, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=252.12s)]
*  how does it feel like not having melodies popping into your head? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=256.2s)]
*  It's very quiet in my head, I must say. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  But it appears never quiet in hers. Look what happened when we took a break from [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=263.96s)]
*  filming at the Deutscher home. Never mind the background noise, that's just the rustle of lunch. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=277.56s)]
*  This is idol Alma. When she has nothing to do, the music flows from its mysterious source as [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=285.84s)]
*  fluently as breath. Do you feel that there's anything about Alma's gift that you don't [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=295.76s)]
*  understand? Her parents, Guy and Janey, are professors. She teaches old English literature, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=309.71999999999997s)]
*  and Guy is a noted linguist. Both of them are amateur musicians. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  We don't understand creativity. Does anyone? I mean, I think that's the crux of the mystery. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=321.8s)]
*  Where does it come from, these melodies popping into your head? It really is a [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=327.84s)]
*  volcano of imagination. It's almost unstoppable. It was Guy who taught her how to read music. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=332.08s)]
*  I thought I was an amazing teacher because I hardly had to say something. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  She was a piano teacher once. It's difficult to teach her because one always has the sense [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=349.68s)]
*  she's been there before. She wouldn't be able to imagine life without dreams and stories and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=355.68s)]
*  music. That's as unimaginable to her as it is strange for other people to think about a little [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=362.52000000000004s)]
*  girl with melodies in her head. I love getting the melodies. It's not at all difficult to me. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=368.32s)]
*  I get them all the time, but then actually sitting down and developing the melodies, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=373.92s)]
*  and that's really the difficult part, having to tell a real story with the music. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=379.12s)]
*  The story Alma tells in her opera is Cinderella, but it's not the Cinderella you know. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=393.68s)]
*  It seemed demeaning to Alma that Cinderella was attractive just because her feet were small, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=404.92s)]
*  so she cast Cinderella as a composer and the prince as a poet. Cinderella finds a poem that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  was composed by the prince and she loves it and she's inspired to put music to it, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=419.40000000000003s)]
*  and in the ball she sings it to the prince. I think that it makes much more sense if he falls [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=423.92s)]
*  in love with her because she composed this amazing melody to his poem because he thinks [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=434.88s)]
*  that she's his soulmate because he understands her. Well people can fall in love with composers. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  Exactly. I think this may be one of those times. They fell in love with Cinderella in its first [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=443.20000000000005s)]
*  production in Vienna. There is another composer who had an opera premiere in Vienna at the age of [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=451.6s)]
*  11. Mozart. People compare you to Mozart. What do you think of that? I know that they mean it to be [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=460.08000000000004s)]
*  very nice to compare me to Mozart. It could be worse. Of course I love Mozart and I would have [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=467.92s)]
*  loved him to be my teacher, but I think I would prefer to be the first Alma than to be a second Mozart. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=473.76000000000005s)]
*  In Israel, Mozart joined Alma on stage. She played his piano concerto with a cadenza. In a cadenza, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=481.68s)]
*  the orchestra stops and the soloist breaks away in music of her own making. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=491.40000000000003s)]
*  It's something that I composed because it's a very early concerto of Mozart and the cadenza was very [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=502.16s)]
*  simple. It didn't go to any different keys and I composed quite a long one going to lots and lots [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=508.68s)]
*  of different keys doing lots of things on Mozart's motifs. So you improved the cadenza of Mozart. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=513.24s)]
*  Well, yes. It's kind of a comment that goes by and everybody looks up and just goes, wow. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=525.64s)]
*  Robert Yertigan is a professor of music at Northwestern in Chicago. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=536.12s)]
*  He has been a consultant to Alma's education. I sent her some assignments when she was six, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=540.6s)]
*  seven, where I expected her to crash and burn because they were very difficult. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=548.28s)]
*  It came back, it was like listening to a mid-18th century composer. She was a native speaker. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=554.6800000000001s)]
*  A native speaker? It's her first language. She speaks the Mozart style. She speaks the style of [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=562.04s)]
*  Mendelssohn. And the names that you just mentioned are the ones that live for centuries. Yes. She's [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=569.16s)]
*  batting in the big leagues and if you win the pennant, there's immortality. The route to [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=576.36s)]
*  immortality leads through California. In December, the San Jose Orchestra will stage Cinderella [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=584.04s)]
*  in Alma's American debut. She'll be the belle of the ball on the piano, organ, and violin. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=590.9200000000001s)]
*  The piano music teachers say, oh, you must choose the piano. And the violin music teachers say, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=598.52s)]
*  oh, you must choose the violin. But anyway, that's better than the piano teachers saying, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=603.96s)]
*  you must choose the violin. That would be a bad sign. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=608.2s)]
*  That would be a bad sign, yes. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=612.44s)]
*  Fortunately, she doesn't have to choose. This is her composition, Violin Concerto Number One. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=619.24s)]
*  It's extremely jolly and very happy and jocular, that movement. I want to make the people who listen [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=626.52s)]
*  to it laugh and be happy. The first movement to the Violin Concerto is quite the opposite. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=634.28s)]
*  It's very dark and dramatic. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=640.28s)]
*  What does a girl your age know about dark and dramatic? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=656.04s)]
*  Well, yes, that's an interesting question because you know, I'm a very happy person. So [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=665.0799999999999s)]
*  I have lots of imaginary composers and one of them is called Antonin Jelosink. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=669.88s)]
*  Antonin Jelosink, Alma's imaginary composing friend, is an insight into the music of her mind. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=676.12s)]
*  Alma told us that she made up a country where imaginary composers write each in his own style [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=684.28s)]
*  of emotion. So how many composers do you have in your head? I have lots of composers and sometimes [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=691.96s)]
*  when I'm stuck with something when I'm composing, I go to them and ask them for advice and quite [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=698.12s)]
*  often they come up with very interesting things. Even the real world seems magical. The Deutsches [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=703.8000000000001s)]
*  move to the English countryside to be near a famous school of music. Alma is privately [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=710.44s)]
*  tutored and homeschooled alongside her sister Helen who also knows her way around the piano [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=716.2s)]
*  and the treehouse. I usually don't ask people your age this question but what have you learned about [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=722.36s)]
*  life? Well, I know that life is not always beautiful, that there's also ugliness in the [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=730.84s)]
*  world. That's why I've learned that I want to write beautiful music because I want to make the [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=739.56s)]
*  world a better place. We cannot know how Alma Deutscher channels her music like a portal in time [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=745.0799999999999s)]
*  but in a world too often ugly and too often overburdened with explanation, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=755.0799999999999s)]
*  it is nice to take a moment and wonder. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=761.56s)]
*  you [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=769.8s)]
*  Child prodigies have long been a source of great fascination. We wonder, how can so much [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=777.8s)]
*  talent reside in such a young body, so much genius? In a moment, you'll meet Jake, a 13-year-old math [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=803.8s)]
*  and science prodigy who's confident he may one day challenge some of the established theories [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=811.16s)]
*  of physics. The source of that talent and that confidence comes from our most remarkable organ, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=817.3199999999999s)]
*  the one we understand least, the brain. What is it about Jake Barnett that had him taking college [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=824.0799999999999s)]
*  courses at age 8 and getting A's and by 12 doing paid scientific research? And today at age 13, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=831.2s)]
*  an honors college sophomore lecturing the crowd at his university science symposium. The untied [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=841.6800000000001s)]
*  shoelaces reveal either your average teenager or the first telltale signs of the absent-minded [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=850.6400000000001s)]
*  professor or both. Surrounded by researchers twice his age, Jake is presenting his summer [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=857.72s)]
*  physics research project on PT symmetric lattice systems. This has implications in fiber optics, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=865.32s)]
*  electromagnetic signals, anything that requires like a light going through a cable. Every number [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=872.64s)]
*  or math problem I ever hear, I have permanently remembered. You just never forget. They never [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=879.2s)]
*  slip out the back door of your brain. No. Is it fun for you to do it? I mean do you get a kick out [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=885.88s)]
*  of it? Yeah. For Jake, fun is reciting from memory the infinite series of numbers known as Pi. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=891.4s)]
*  3.1415926535897932384626433832795028. Jake memorized more than 200 of Pi's numbers in an afternoon. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=899.0s)]
*  974944592307. And he did it just to test himself. You want me to go backwards from there? Well sure. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=910.84s)]
*  32397985356295141.3. Bravo. He's not just parroting a textbook, he understands and analyzes the logic [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=918.2s)]
*  of higher mathematics. He can visualize and solve complex problems by using what he calls the fourth [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=933.1600000000001s)]

*  because it's tangent to all the other ones. I'd be able to describe if I had like a whiteboard and [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=947.96s)]
*  like 30 minutes to describe it. It takes a while. It's the fourth dimension. What do you expect? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=953.88s)]
*  The numbers appear to him as shapes that he says just build on one another. So this for example is [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=958.84s)]
*  three cubed or 27. And then if I want to do 54 I just stack another one onto it. He says his mind [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=965.56s)]

*  he moves on to windows. Remembering things so precisely, does that ever become a burden to you? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=979.2399999999999s)]
*  No, not at all. No sense of overload. I remember math and numbers. I don't remember other things. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=986.8399999999999s)]
*  For example if someone asks me where something is in the house I tell them I don't know. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=994.12s)]
*  The oldest of four kids, Jake lives with his family in the suburbs of Indianapolis. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=998.76s)]

*  play does not make Jake a dull boy. What do you do for fun? When it isn't anything academic. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1042.28s)]
*  No I mean beyond the academics. Does looking up space articles online count? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1049.88s)]
*  He has a full scholarship at the joint Indiana University Purdue campus [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1058.68s)]

*  Where it's proportional to that. Jake's been auditing classes here since the ripe old age of [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1079.48s)]
*  eight when it became obvious to his parents that third grade was not going to be enough for him. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1084.52s)]
*  What did your fellow students make of you? Everyone was thinking that mom was taking the class and she [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1091.8s)]
*  couldn't find a babysitter. The students thought I was the student. His parents Christine and Michael [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1096.44s)]
*  Barnett expected their son would quietly listen and learn but even they were shocked when Jake [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1101.8s)]
*  jumped right into scientific discussions. The professor would ask questions and Jacob was [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1108.28s)]
*  answering them and then he took the final at the end and got an A on it and suddenly the people [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1113.16s)]
*  at the university took notice of that and eventually invited him to attend the university. It's pretty [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1119.8799999999999s)]
*  shocking with an eight-year-old ace's of university astronomy course. Weren't you impressed? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1126.2s)]

*  developmental therapy, occupational therapy. Therapists came to the home. He was going further [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1158.44s)]
*  and further from our world into a world of his own and I really was just baffled at how we were [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1163.4s)]
*  going to get him back out of that world. And how did you get him back out of that world? We realized [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1170.92s)]
*  that Jacob was not happy unless he was doing something he loved. Which even as a three-year-old [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1176.3600000000001s)]
*  was math and science. His parents say the more he focused on the subjects he loved the more he [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1182.8400000000001s)]
*  began to communicate. You could just see him just relax. You could just see him feel like thank [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1188.36s)]
*  goodness we're not working on something that I can't do today. And how long did it take for him to [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1195.7199999999998s)]
*  as you say come back? By the time he was kindergarten age five six he was still behind as far as [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1202.1999999999998s)]

*  else. He was coming home asking us when am I going to learn something at school today? I want to [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1212.76s)]
*  learn algebra. It was trying to keep Jake challenged that led to a kind of double life. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1217.08s)]
*  Elementary school by day and sitting in on college courses in the evening. By fifth grade he dropped [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1223.0s)]
*  out of public school and just to demonstrate that he was ready for college he taught himself all of [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1230.12s)]
*  high school math in just two weeks. He was 10 years old. That was the most determined thing I've ever [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1236.76s)]

*  and Jacob was like I'm going to participate in that class discussion so if I need to learn [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1250.76s)]
*  algebra one, algebra two, geometry, trig that's what I'm going to do and he took a stack of books [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1256.1200000000001s)]
*  and he sat down and he just went and taught himself all of it in two weeks. Not only that he [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1262.2s)]
*  finished the entire state of Indiana curriculum for grade six to 12 in little over a year. The [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1269.08s)]

*  symptoms of autism have disappeared. There's certain traits that are still there and if you [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1282.1999999999998s)]

*  believe is the reason why I am in college and I am so successful. It is the rise as to my love for [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1305.8000000000002s)]

*  for the last 13 years. She believes there's a link between autism and prodigies. We know that [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1327.0s)]
*  child prodigies are having autistic relatives at a very high clip and some of them have autism [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1334.36s)]

*  one of them. In Jake's case he's 13 years old. What's remarkable is not just this memory but his [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1376.68s)]
*  vocabulary is so adult. Of course they speak like adults they've picked up so much information [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1385.5600000000002s)]

*  something else. The great memory does help him of course because he once he reads something he [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1475.16s)]
*  remembers it but what is more important is that he has the drive to learn more. He definitely stands [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1481.32s)]

*  Yes yes it did. It's a no joke award. I wasn't expecting any awards at then when I won I was just [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1684.52s)]
*  flabbergasted I was like freaking out I was just like what? Yes you were. Me? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1692.84s)]
*  Jack Andraka's journey from suburban Baltimore high school freshman to cancer researcher began [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1698.76s)]
*  at age 14 when a family friend died of pancreatic cancer. Shocked that there's no reliable early [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1704.92s)]
*  test for the disease Jack decided he would develop one. He began probing the internet for [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1711.8799999999999s)]
*  everything he could find about pancreatic cancer biomarkers. He read research articles during class [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1718.2s)]
*  and in the middle of biology while stealthily reading a medical journal he says inspiration [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1725.48s)]
*  hit. The teacher was not amused. I swear she has like eyes on the back of her head or something. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1731.88s)]
*  She sees me and she storms up to my desk and is like Mr. Andraka what is this and like snatches [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1737.8s)]
*  out my hand. As if you had playboy magazine. I'm just like it was just a science article [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1743.88s)]
*  shouldn't this be a good thing? When he told his parents Steve and Jane Andraka about his project [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1750.44s)]
*  they weren't exactly encouraging. My reaction wasn't a good one I said Jack isn't that a little [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1757.0800000000002s)]
*  far-fetched. And I know that when you're 14 you can't just run out and get a lab a lot of people [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1763.5600000000002s)]
*  you know are like we don't train middle schoolers. But Jack decided to find one that did. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1769.16s)]
*  Over the course of four months he prepared a test protocol for his theory and sent it out to 200 [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1774.8400000000001s)]
*  cancer researchers. I essentially had to send them my budget my procedure my timeline and materials [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1781.8000000000002s)]
*  list and I actually had 199 rejections out of those. Some professors ripped apart my procedure [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1787.3200000000002s)]
*  completely but one professor Dr. Anirban Maiitra finally said yes. An encouraging yes. It was like [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1793.08s)]
*  this idea might work and he starts interrogating me kind of firing these questions trying to sink [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1799.72s)]
*  my procedure in a way but I answered all of them. Dr. Anirban Maiitra was a professor of oncology [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1804.6799999999998s)]
*  at Johns Hopkins University now heads pancreatic cancer research at MD Anderson Cancer Center in [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1811.96s)]
*  Houston. He says his curiosity was piqued by Jack's proposal. Well it's not every day that you get [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1819.32s)]
*  an email from a 15 year old that comes with a detailed protocol with methods and supplies and [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1827.72s)]
*  what pitfalls you might run into. I said maybe I'll get you a corner in my lab and we'll have one of [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1836.04s)]
*  the postdocs little fellows supervising you. Let's see where this all goes. For the next seven months [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1841.72s)]
*  after school and on weekends Jack's mother would drop him off at the lab where he learned basic [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1849.16s)]
*  lab techniques and worked on developing his cancer test. Finally one day in March I realized this was [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1855.72s)]
*  actually working like it was working amazingly because it was passing all of these preliminary [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1863.8000000000002s)]
*  tests and I run out and I'm pretty much like screaming around the lab. I finally go out and [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1869.4s)]
*  rush into my mom's car and like me and her are screaming in the car and then of course at school [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1874.36s)]
*  the next day. Jack's test detects an unusually high level of mesothelin a protein that the body [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1879.9599999999998s)]
*  produces in pancreatic cancers early and most treatable stage. What exactly are you doing now? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1887.8799999999999s)]
*  So essentially what this is is it's one of my strips and what you do is you first get an original [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1894.84s)]
*  measurement of how the electricity flows across it. The paper strip is coated with a carbon [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1900.52s)]
*  substance that attracts mesothelin. It is placed in an apparatus that Jack built in his parents' [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1906.52s)]
*  garage. And I'm just taking out one single drop of blood here. A high level of mesothelin in a [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1913.32s)]
*  patient's blood sample may indicate the first stages of pancreatic cancer. See how it's increased? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1920.28s)]
*  It's increased by about two times here and so what that means is that there's a really high [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1927.8799999999999s)]
*  level of this one protein there and that signals the presence of pancreatic cancer from it. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1932.12s)]
*  While years of clinical trials must be done there is no FDA approved test that can reliably measure [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1936.9199999999998s)]
*  mesothelin. Dr. Maitra says a test of this kind that could detect pancreatic cancer in its earliest [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1943.48s)]
*  stage could save thousands of lives. He did hone in to the most important missing aspect in terms [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1950.92s)]
*  of pancreatic cancer which is we don't really have good early detection. There is nothing like a PSA [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1958.28s)]
*  test or a colonoscopy or a mammogram that you can get for the pancreas at this point in time. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1963.8000000000002s)]
*  So by the time the majority of patients present they already have tumor that has spread outside [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1970.68s)]
*  the pancreas and those patients typically don't do very well. He says the test which costs Jack [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1976.44s)]
*  three cents a strip to make is remarkably elegant in its simplicity. It's remarkable what you've [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1983.3200000000002s)]
*  achieved and what you've come up with there's no question. Have the brain men come to talk to you [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1990.3600000000001s)]
*  and want to figure you out? No actually no one has approached me to do like an autopsy of my brain [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=1995.3200000000002s)]
*  yet. A scan. A scan but like maybe later on an autopsy but really I don't think it's that I'm [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2001.88s)]
*  really smart. I mean I know people that are way smarter than me. You can be a genius but if you [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2012.2800000000002s)]
*  don't have the creativity to put that knowledge to use then you just have a bunch of knowledge [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2018.2800000000002s)]
*  and nothing else. I mean like then you're just as good as my smartphone. His parents say he's [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2023.24s)]
*  been obsessed with science since he was a toddler conducting experiments even as a three-year-old. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2027.8s)]
*  School for him was so easy his parents tried to keep him engaged by encouraging science projects [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2034.52s)]
*  at home. My family isn't the typical family like we're instead of like talking about football we [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2041.3999999999999s)]
*  have like all these science magazines all scattered through our house and we talk to them at dinner. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2047.24s)]
*  After Jack decided to cultivate E. coli just for the fun of it on the kitchen stove his parents [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2052.52s)]
*  insisted that he and his older brother Luke use the basement as their lab. Their parents believe [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2059.24s)]
*  the less they know about what goes on down there the better. I gather the rule of the house is [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2066.12s)]
*  don't burn down the house and don't kill yourself. Pretty much it's don't blow up the house I want to [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2072.2s)]
*  come home to a place to live. What do they do down there? I don't really know because I don't go [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2076.84s)]
*  down there much. And they may have reason for concern. Clearly neatness does not count. Last [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2081.8s)]
*  year Luke cooked up some nitroglycerin just to see if he could. I was just interested to see [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2088.6000000000004s)]
*  could I make it down here. It worked. It also drew the attention of the FBI who they say sent a letter [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2094.84s)]
*  letting them know that their internet purchasing history had been noted by the feds. They were a [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2102.68s)]
*  little concerned. I don't know why I'm laughing. But these days Jack doesn't have much time for [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2109.24s)]
*  messing in the basement. Jack and Jackie. His test idea has made him a star speaker at medical [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2116.3599999999997s)]
*  conferences all over the world. So with me I just use Google and Wikipedia to find a new way to [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2123.64s)]
*  detect pancreatic cancer. At the beginning of this I didn't even know I had a pancreas. So if I could [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2129.96s)]
*  do that. And he's become a regular at the White House. Four visits this year alone. Where's Jack? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2135.0s)]
*  There he is. Jack stand up. You've also become a heavy-duty celebrity. It's pretty insane. I mean [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2142.12s)]
*  you see Barack Obama. President Barack Obama. Yeah President Barack Obama. I'm just like hello Mr. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2148.92s)]
*  President and then hello First Lady. It's just like it's crazy. In the past year he's spoken in [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2155.72s)]
*  Canada, Italy, Australia, Greece, the United Nations and so far four trips to England. Earlier this year [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2162.7599999999998s)]
*  including this address he gave to the renowned Royal Society of Medicine about his test and the [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2171.3999999999996s)]
*  problems with current cancer diagnostics. I typed this into the internet. This 15 year old has all [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2178.2s)]
*  the confidence of a physician. And what comes up with is I could be going through cocaine withdrawal, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2185.08s)]
*  I could have cancer or I could be pregnant. So a stand-up physician. So what I see in the future [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2190.52s)]
*  of medical diagnostics is a shift from the symptom-based to more of a diagnostic [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2198.6s)]
*  anti-bi-based approach such as a sensor. Working the crowds of academics and checking out Cambridge [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2203.56s)]
*  University, no big deal. Could you study here? Yes. Jack easily maintains a 4.0 GPA in school [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2209.72s)]
*  despite a spotty attendance record. You're still in high school. Yeah. Why bother? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2219.48s)]
*  Well the reason I still bother with high school is because of my mom. She's really like you have [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2227.56s)]
*  to do high school and you have to go to college but they're being kind of lenient with me right now. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2233.32s)]
*  Jack's family is pretty laid back about his success, low pressure and a high sense of humor. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2239.0800000000004s)]
*  They say that all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. It seems that you've been doing all work. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2246.1200000000003s)]
*  Well I would say all play no work because for me going to the lab is pretty much play. I mean it's [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2251.6400000000003s)]
*  the funnest thing ever. Jack holds the pattern on his cancer test and with the help of his [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2256.92s)]
*  patent lawyer is looking to license the technology to a pharmaceutical company in the next few months. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2262.2s)]
*  Now the actual testing on people or animals, I gather you're not interested in doing that. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2269.48s)]
*  So I did some preliminary studies however one thing I don't want to do is end up as a lab rat. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2275.8799999999997s)]
*  I kind of want to be able to come up with a new idea and then really just move on to the next idea [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2281.56s)]
*  and have other people do their repetitive trials. Well where does that stand right now? I have enough [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2287.56s)]
*  data to prove that this works and so now I'm going to give it to the pharmaceutical companies [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2292.92s)]
*  to run through like clinical trials and stuff. He believes that one day his invention will be [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2297.32s)]
*  in every doctor's office and even on pharmacy shelves but Dr. Maitra who's seen so many promising [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2302.44s)]
*  ideas flame out when it comes to pancreatic cancer urges caution. Pancreatic cancer is a very humbling [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2309.88s)]
*  disease. Every time we think we have a home run we barely get to first base. As a test it is still [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2316.92s)]
*  a very long way off and the reason for that is because such a test cannot be marketed unless it [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2324.52s)]
*  has been validated in large clinical trials and that cannot be done in a small lab that cannot be [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2331.0s)]
*  done by a 15 year old but that does not detract in any way from the remarkable achievement of [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2336.92s)]
*  this young man. I think he's brilliant. I was sitting in class and suddenly it hit me. Between [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2342.76s)]
*  speaking engagements and the occasional appearance at school Jack is back in the lab working on new [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2349.2400000000002s)]
*  diagnostic and environmental tests. And while he now moves in very adult circles Jack says when it [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2355.5600000000004s)]
*  comes to his future he's just like any other lost teenager. I actually have no clue what I want to [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2363.5600000000004s)]
*  do when I grow up. I mean hopefully something in science I'll be in and hopefully I'll be doing [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2369.8s)]
*  work that will help change the world. Jack has come up with a new diagnostic invention [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2374.36s)]
*  and is using it to compete for the 10 million dollar tri-corner x-prize in medical diagnostics. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2381.1600000000003s)]

*  played by 500 million people. It's chess. Many don't think of it as a sport because nobody moves [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2413.8s)]
*  but chess masters will tell you it can be more brutal than boxing. That's because at the [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2421.4s)]

*  hours. The best players need extraordinary endurance so most of them are young. Magnus [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2434.04s)]
*  is the youngest number one ever and no one can explain to you how he does what he does. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2440.68s)]
*  It seems to come from another world which is why he's become known as the motard of chess. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2447.08s)]
*  Just look at what he's doing. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2457.4s)]
*  Competing against 10 players simultaneously. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2462.12s)]
*  That in itself is not extraordinary but Magnus cannot see the boards he's facing the other way. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2467.16s)]
*  So he has to keep track of the positions of 320 pieces blind. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2476.04s)]
*  And the number of possible moves infinite. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2481.56s)]
*  Magnus comes out on top. It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2487.96s)]
*  Do you have any idea how extraordinary this looks to? No it's one of the amazing things [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2495.48s)]
*  in chess that you can you can you don't really need the board you can just keep it. But it's [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2502.68s)]
*  transcends chess I mean I just I just can't fathom what you've just done it's just it seems like it's [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2508.44s)]
*  supernatural. Last December we caught up with him at the London chess classic. He arrives with his [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2514.2000000000003s)]
*  constant companion his father. Magnus will play against eight other top ranked players but he [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2521.32s)]
*  is the star as celebrated in this world as Eli Manning is in his. The world number one player [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2527.8s)]
*  from Norway Magnus Carlsen. Today Magnus is playing America's number one Hikaru Nakamura. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2535.64s)]
*  The match will last four hours and there will be no breaks. Magnus will go on a stroll now and then [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2543.7999999999997s)]
*  but his mind won't be going anywhere. He says he's concentrating not only on this game but on other [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2550.68s)]
*  games played by other masters. He's playing against the best of the best. He's playing against [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2557.16s)]
*  other games played by other masters at other times which he might want to draw on now. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2563.48s)]
*  Ten thousand of them. We gave him a test. It was played right here in London and [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2569.16s)]
*  Simpsons on the Strand in 1859. I don't know the month or day. You got it wrong. Not 59. 51. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2576.28s)]
*  Wow. You see your memory isn't superb and everything. It's not what it used to be. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2587.16s)]
*  Chess players are pretty poker faced but occasionally Magnus will flash the smile of [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2594.8399999999997s)]
*  someone who knows it's all over but the handshake while Nakamura dives deeper into doom. Magnus [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2600.36s)]
*  was playing brilliantly and he knew it. Is there anything in life more satisfying than that feeling [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2608.04s)]
*  when you're playing brilliantly? I don't know but it's it's really you know up there. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2614.44s)]
*  It's pretty good. Yes. The spectator seem as mesmerized as the competitors. They're all [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2621.0s)]
*  chess players of course. If they weren't it would be like watching paint dry. Worldwide [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2627.2400000000002s)]
*  a hundred thousand are watching on their computers. The suspense keeps building until end game by which [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2634.12s)]
*  time it's cut throat. But you enjoy it when you see your opponent squirm? Yes I do. I enjoy it when [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2640.92s)]
*  I see my opponent you know really suffering when he knows that I've that I've outsmarted him. If I [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2652.28s)]
*  lose just one game then usually you know I just want to really get revenge. This is war isn't it? [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2659.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. For 50 years chess was war. It was a battleground in the cold war with the Russians [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2668.36s)]
*  who were dominant. But then an American came along. His name was Bobby Fischer. In 1972 he took on the [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2675.56s)]
*  Russian champion Boris Spassky and he won. It was an international spectacle and the enthusiasm has [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2683.56s)]
*  not waned. Back in London just down the corridor from where Magnus is playing [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2691.8s)]
*  500 novices are learning how to master kings and queens. Do you ever play any any grown-ups? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2699.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes. Yep I do play grown-ups. In fact I'm getting to the hang of playing grown-ups. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2709.5600000000004s)]
*  Who's your favorite chess player? Bobby Fischer. Bobby Fischer? And I like Magnus. You like Magnus? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2716.68s)]
*  Chess is now routinely taught in schools all over the world including the United States. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2726.52s)]
*  In some countries it's compulsory. Chess can be taught but not genius. Magnus seemed like a normal [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2732.52s)]
*  enough kid growing up outside Oslo. But wait a minute. When he was five he could name almost [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2740.2s)]
*  all the countries in the world and their capitals and their populations. Magnus's father Henrik [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2746.9199999999996s)]
*  didn't think that was terribly unusual. He did have a good memory and the ability to concentrate [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2754.7599999999998s)]
*  for hours at the time on a specific topic and he seemed to be interested in a lot of things, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2760.2s)]
*  new things all the time. But I thought that was normal. What got him into chess? Sibling [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2766.7599999999998s)]
*  rivalry. His older sister started to play so he wanted to beat her which he did quickly. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2773.32s)]
*  Then he started winning tournaments. Before long he became a celebrity. One of the first [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2780.52s)]
*  Norwegians to excel in a sport that did not involve snow. People lined up in shopping malls to play him. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2786.44s)]
*  When he won, Magnus said it was just a game. No big deal. He couldn't understand why people [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2794.12s)]
*  were making such a fuss. Why this? Why this? All people want to talk with little me. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2800.6s)]
*  Magnus's parents took him and his sisters out of school for a year, rented out their house, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2811.4s)]
*  sold their car. It was part holiday mostly chess. They went to Reykjavik Iceland which is where [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2817.0s)]
*  Magnus took a leap into legend when he was matched against Garry Kasparov, a Russian considered by [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2823.88s)]
*  many to be the greatest ever. And how did Magnus prepare? By reading up. Kasparov kept the 13-year-old [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2830.84s)]
*  kid waiting for half an hour and when he did arrive he didn't even say hello. It was speed [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2840.76s)]
*  chess, the formula one of the sport, a race against the clock. Kasparov started slow. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2848.04s)]
*  Magnus started getting bored. I sat there for a few seconds and then I thought to myself, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2854.68s)]
*  you know what, I don't know why he's thinking but I know what my response is going to be anyway so [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2861.32s)]
*  I'll just walk off and watch the other games. Kasparov had never played anyone so young but he [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2867.48s)]
*  did not exude confidence or happiness and he did not win. Magnus played him to a draw. It was a [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2873.96s)]
*  sensation. Kasparov left quickly. No nice game kid, nothing. How did Magnus react? Guess. He thought [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2882.28s)]
*  he had blown it. When I actually got the winning position I had little time. I was nervous and I [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2892.76s)]
*  couldn't finish him off. Why were you nervous? I was playing Kasparov. I was intimidated. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2899.64s)]
*  You were intimidated by playing the world champion when you were already 13 years old? Yeah. Go figure. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2906.44s)]
*  It warranted a celebration of course and Magnus got to choose. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2915.64s)]
*  Yes, I went to my family and had some ice cream at McDonald's. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2919.96s)]
*  By the time he was 19, the boy with the ice cream had become number one in the world. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2924.84s)]
*  He has a very deep understanding of chess. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2930.52s)]
*  Frederick Friedl's company, Chessbase, publishes the world's most popular chess program. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2934.6800000000003s)]
*  Is this an indication of genius? Of genius and raw talent. Now Magnus has still hasn't reached his [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2941.08s)]
*  peak. He hasn't really worked yet. I've heard him described as lazy which I find quite extraordinary. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2951.72s)]
*  I think that's an impolite term but it's probably appropriate. Except when he's not. Magnus plays [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2960.4399999999996s)]
*  soccer whenever he can break away from the board. He's got a mean backhand and he's moonlighting [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2967.64s)]
*  as a model. There's never been much money in chess but Magnus is changing that. Sponsors are [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2973.8799999999997s)]
*  lining up to endorse him. He's making about a million and a half dollars a year. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2981.56s)]
*  But it's a solitary life. Magnus is on the road 200 days a year now. Between matches [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2988.92s)]
*  he is alone in his hotel room getting ready for tomorrow's game. He works out almost every day. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=2995.7999999999997s)]
*  Knows he can't concentrate for it's often seven hours unless he's in shape. Magnus says he [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3002.7599999999998s)]
*  wouldn't be able to tolerate this life if it weren't for his father who's always there for him. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3009.16s)]
*  When you travel with Magnus what's your role? I'm a servant [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3015.3199999999997s)]
*  and a chess fan. You enjoy the games? Yes. And so he says does Magnus? Boy when you look at him, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3021.56s)]
*  when I look at him, enjoyment is not the word that comes to mind. It should. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3029.64s)]
*  Maybe you have to compare it to a writer or a painter. I mean [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3035.88s)]
*  probably if you see them at work they're not smiling or having an easy time. They're [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3044.28s)]
*  exploiting their mind to the utmost and the same with the chess players. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3051.32s)]
*  But that level of concentration is not danger free. A fair number of grandmasters have gone mad, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3057.32s)]
*  which is what happened to Bobby Fischer in his later years. This was not an arrest, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3064.28s)]
*  this was a kidnapping, it was all cooked up. Do you ever think about that? Yes I do. You know [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3069.8s)]
*  when I was watching the recent film about Bobby Fischer I was thinking you know is this going to [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3077.0800000000004s)]
*  be me in a few years? I don't think that's going to happen but you know it made me think a little [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3083.8s)]
*  bit that you know I have to be aware of this at least. People have described you as the Mozart [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3093.4s)]
*  of chess. How do you react to that? Yeah maybe but was Mozart ever asked how he does this? [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3104.04s)]
*  I would be very impressed if he had a good answer to that because I think [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3113.48s)]
*  what he would say is that it just comes natural to me. It's what I do. Which is what you say. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3123.64s)]
*  It's what he does for fun too at the Oslo chess club where he started. He's playing [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3132.84s)]
*  the Norwegian grandmaster here. It's called bullet chess and Magnus has a handicap. His [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3138.28s)]
*  opponent is given three minutes to make his moves. Magnus has won. It's just a friendly match but [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3145.2400000000002s)]
*  Magnus always hates to lose so he doesn't. Oh where's the... You got him. Yeah I got him. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5esTad3S9o&t=3152.2000000000003s)]
