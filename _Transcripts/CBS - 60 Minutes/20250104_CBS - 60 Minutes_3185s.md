# Dua Lipa, Kate Winslet, Cillian Murphy, Nicolas Cage | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [January 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw)
*  Tick tock [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=0.0s)]
*  Plenty of teenagers want to become pop stars, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=11.6s)]
*  but few convinced their parents to let them pack their bags [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=14.0s)]
*  and move to another country to try and make it big. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=17.0s)]
*  That's what Dua Lipa did when she was just 15 years old. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=20.0s)]
*  She'd taken some singing lessons, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=24.0s)]
*  but didn't know anything about the business of making music. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=26.0s)]
*  Turns out she's a quick study. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=29.0s)]
*  At 29, she's now one of the top female recording artists in the world. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=31.44s)]
*  Take a look at what happened in June when she headlined Britain's biggest music festival, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=36.4s)]
*  Glastonbury. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=41.0s)]
*  She was singing one of the first songs she released nine years ago. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=42.18s)]
*  Back then, hardly anyone knew who Dua Lipa was. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=45.6s)]
*  But at Glastonbury, 100,000 people came to see her. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=49.04s)]
*  They sang along to her every word. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=53.14s)]
*  Glastonbury, as loud as you can, come on! [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=56.44s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=62.04s)]
*  One more time, louder! [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  I love you guys, you're making my dreams come true. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=67.44s)]
*  Louder! [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=69.64s)]
*  Be the one, be the one, be the one, be the one, be the one, be the one. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=72.24s)]
*  It's unbelievable seeing that many people sing back at you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=77.24s)]
*  I couldn't believe that it was happening in that moment, you know? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=86.44s)]
*  I'd dreamt about being on that stage my whole life. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=90.44s)]
*  I'd thought about it, I'd wished it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=93.44s)]
*  You'd envisioned it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  I'd envisioned it so many times. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  I had written down, I want to headline, Glastonbury on the pyramid stage on the Friday night. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  Being very specific about the Friday night so I could party afterwards. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=112.24s)]
*  Wait a minute, so even in your dream it was due Friday night so you could stay at Glastonbury? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=116.24s)]
*  So I could stay Saturday, Sunday. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=120.24s)]
*  And go out dancing and be in the crowds. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=121.64s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=123.64s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=124.64s)]
*  You know, you've got to be specific about your dreams, you know? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=126.24s)]
*  Dua Lipa isn't afraid to admit she enjoys a good time. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=131.44s)]
*  And that's what her music is all about. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=135.24s)]
*  The songs are fun and flirtatious. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=144.24s)]
*  She sings of boy breakups and girl power. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=153.24s)]
*  Late nights and dark clubs. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=158.24s)]
*  It is pure pop. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=161.24s)]
*  Dua Lipa's got no problem with that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=166.24s)]
*  You're always met with some kind of pushback as a female artist. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=169.24s)]
*  If you're not like with a guitar or with a piano, just like, oh she can't sing, oh it's all processed, or it's this or it's whatever. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=174.24s)]
*  I just think there's just like a stigma around pop music. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=182.24s)]
*  But that was the music which you wanted to do from the beginning. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=185.24s)]
*  Because I loved it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=188.24s)]
*  That's the music that makes me get up and dance. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=189.24s)]
*  Don't let the laid back demeanor fool you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=196.24s)]
*  Dua Lipa has worked hard and come a long way to make all this look easy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=201.24s)]
*  Dua, whose name means love in Albanian, was born in London. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=211.24s)]
*  Her parents had moved there from Kosovo after the war in Bosnia broke out in 1992. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=215.24s)]
*  She started singing lessons at nine, but her family returned to Kosovo when she was 11. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=220.24s)]
*  Four years later, she decided to go back to Britain and try and become a pop star. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=226.24s)]
*  That was the plan? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=231.24s)]
*  That was the plan, always. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=232.24s)]
*  The pitch to your parents was, in order to go to a British university, I need to go to high school. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=234.24s)]
*  Yes, that was the initial pitch. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=239.24s)]
*  Her father, Dukagene Lipa, is now her manager. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=242.24s)]
*  Did you buy that pitch? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=245.24s)]
*  Of course we did. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=246.24s)]
*  But she's underplaying the fact that she was always very mature. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=247.24s)]
*  Even at 15? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=252.24s)]
*  Even at 15. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=253.24s)]
*  And yeah, it is a little bit crazy saying, like, oh, 15 years old, she persuaded you to let her go. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=254.24s)]
*  But her maturity and our relationship was... [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=260.24s)]
*  You knew she could handle it? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=264.24s)]
*  Of course. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=265.24s)]
*  It sounds like you were a very confident 15-year-old. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=266.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=269.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think more confident than I am now, for sure. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=270.24s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=273.24s)]
*  I'm Dua, I'm 15 years old, and I'm going to be singing Super Duper Love by Just Don't. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=274.24s)]
*  In London, she immediately started recording herself singing covers of her favorite artists [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=281.24s)]
*  and putting the videos on YouTube. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=286.24s)]
*  This is one of the first ones she made in 2011. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=292.24s)]
*  She was living with a family friend, but was pretty much on her own. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=295.24s)]
*  She skipped school so often, she flunked out. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=299.24s)]
*  Basically, I got expelled, and I remember calling my parents, and they're like, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=302.24s)]
*  okay, well, you did this, find yourself a school, or you're going to come back to Kosovo. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=308.24s)]
*  She did find another high school and graduated, but decided college could be her only option. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=315.24s)]
*  She had gotten some notice online. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=322.24s)]
*  Just three years after leaving Kosovo, 18-year-old Dua Lipa got a record deal with Warner Brothers. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=324.24s)]
*  Baby, I'd rather be blind, boy [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=332.24s)]
*  Let us say you walk away, walk away from me [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=336.24s)]
*  I walked in with a dream of I want to sing, I want to perform, I want to run, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=343.24s)]
*  I walked in with a dream of I want to sing, I want to perform, I want to write, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=347.24s)]
*  but I had no idea of what comes with it or what other things I have to do, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=352.24s)]
*  or even what goes into the promotion of a record. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=359.24s)]
*  I've been through mountains and seas [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=362.24s)]
*  While working on her first album, she began releasing singles and performing wherever she could. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=367.24s)]
*  Now I find it harder and harder to breathe [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=373.24s)]
*  We were doing really small shows where the stage was like a step above the floor. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=380.24s)]
*  So how many people liked your first performances? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=386.24s)]
*  About ten. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=389.24s)]
*  Ten? Wow. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=390.24s)]
*  And how many were like friends and family? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=392.24s)]
*  Well, none, but they all got offered a drink to come and watch. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=395.24s)]
*  So that was how we got them to come and watch us perform. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=398.24s)]
*  It's like puppet show and Spinal Tap. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=401.24s)]
*  It's both of those together. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=403.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=405.24s)]
*  Talking in my sleep at night, making myself crazy [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=406.24s)]
*  That all changed in 2017 when her first album came out [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=410.24s)]
*  and she made this music video in a hotel in Miami for a song called New Rules. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=414.24s)]
*  One, don't pick up the phone, you know he's only calling because he's my friend [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=420.24s)]
*  It became her first major hit in America. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=423.24s)]
*  You have to kick him out again [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=426.24s)]
*  Three, don't be his friend [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=428.24s)]
*  The album would earn Dua Lipa two Grammys, one of them for Best New Artist. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=430.24s)]
*  When she sang New Rules at the Brit Awards on live TV in 2018, the reviews were positive. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=439.24s)]
*  But some viewers' comments online weren't. One in particular went viral. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=445.24s)]
*  The comment was from somebody that said, I love her lack of energy, go girl give us nothing. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=450.24s)]
*  You remember the words? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=456.24s)]
*  Yeah, it just spread like wildfire that I had no stage presence or I couldn't perform. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=458.24s)]
*  So I was like, alright, well, I'm just going to prove to you that I can perform and I can dance and I can do all these things. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=463.24s)]
*  Dua Lipa may have wanted to prove her doubters wrong, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=473.24s)]
*  but when her second album, called Future Nostalgia, was ready to be released two years later, the timing could not have been worse. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=476.24s)]
*  My second album came out in March 2020 at the very beginning of the pandemic. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=483.24s)]
*  Was there any talk of delaying? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=490.24s)]
*  Yeah, there was. But because I'd spent so long working on it, I was like, this album has to come out. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=492.24s)]
*  With much of the world locked down, it wasn't clear if anyone would want to listen to dance songs or how she could even promote the album. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=499.24s)]
*  My whole idea was that this is a record that's supposed to be played in the clubs. I envisioned myself in the club. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=506.24s)]
*  In the producing of it, the whole thing is like you're in the club. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=512.24s)]
*  Dua, how are you? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=516.24s)]
*  Good, how are you? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=517.24s)]
*  Three days after the album's release, she gamely appeared on The Late Late Show with James Corden. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=518.24s)]
*  Her home had flooded and she was renting a small studio apartment. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=524.24s)]
*  Oh my God, and I was having really a bad... [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=531.24s)]
*  ...hair day. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=537.24s)]
*  Everyone coming together in their living rooms and their kitchens to make this happen, it's crazy. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=543.24s)]
*  I love that you were in some random apartment. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=553.24s)]
*  Yeah, so you can see from there how close I am to the cupboards above, the oven and the stove top. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=556.24s)]
*  This is you kicking off the release globally of your album. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=565.24s)]
*  Globally of my album. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=568.24s)]
*  The new album was an extraordinary success, commercially and critically. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=571.24s)]
*  Billboard, Rolling Stone and others called it one of the best of the year, and Dua Lipa was dubbed the quarantine queen. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=577.24s)]
*  It worked out in a weird way. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=584.24s)]
*  Yeah, it did. It didn't end up being the nightclub experience, but it ended up being the kitchen dance parties [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=587.24s)]
*  and the soundtrack to people's workouts at home to kind of keep them sane during that time. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=596.24s)]
*  It also gave people the fantasy of being out in a club. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=602.24s)]
*  Being out, I hope so. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=605.24s)]
*  In May, she released her third album called Radical Optimism and is now rehearsing for a year-long tour in 28 countries. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=610.24s)]
*  I'm still getting my timing while I'm rehearsing. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=618.24s)]
*  Those first beginning notes, the, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, they're really fast. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=621.24s)]
*  So I just have to practice to make sure that I don't slow the song down and miss my timing. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=628.24s)]
*  In just nine years of releasing music, Dua Lipa has reached a level of success even she never imagined. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=638.24s)]
*  Her songs have been streamed by fans more than 45 billion times. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=649.24s)]
*  I saw some writers who said that in your songs they don't have a sense of who you are. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=655.24s)]
*  You're not pouring out your innermost fears and desires and wants. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=661.24s)]
*  It's something that I just naturally hold back. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=667.24s)]
*  Some people are just so ruthless with their own private life that they decide to put it all out in a song [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=671.24s)]
*  because they know that it's gonna attract people's attention. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=679.24s)]
*  And for me, it was always important to make music that people really loved. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=684.24s)]
*  Not because I was putting someone out on blast or not because I'm doing it for the clickbait. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=692.24s)]
*  Maybe someone else's expense. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=698.24s)]
*  Dua Lipa's music may not be controversial, but some statements she's made over the past few years about Israel have been. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=701.24s)]
*  She's called the current war in Gaza genocide. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=708.24s)]
*  And in 2021, a well-known rabbi took out this full page ad in the New York Times criticizing her. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=711.24s)]
*  There was a lot of words kind of thrown at me, things that I don't believe represent who I am or what I believe in at all. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=718.24s)]
*  Like I've always only ever wanted peace, really. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=727.24s)]
*  It's devastating what's happening over there. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=731.24s)]
*  There's bombs happening between both Israel and Palestine and children are dying and families are being separated. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=734.24s)]
*  And it's just devastating to sit back and see it happen. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=742.24s)]
*  Some people are saying what you said was anti-Semitic. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=747.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=750.24s)]
*  And it's just not, I think it was very unfairly treated by the times. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=751.24s)]
*  Did that experience make you reticent to be outspoken again? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=756.24s)]
*  No, because it hasn't stopped me from talking about things that I believe in. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=761.24s)]
*  Whatever Dua Lipa's political or personal opinions may be, for now you won't find them in her music. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=768.24s)]
*  She wants that to be something that will help lift you up, get you out, and maybe, just maybe, take a spin on the dance floor. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=775.24s)]
*  Kate Winslet was just 20 years old when she was plucked from relative obscurity to star in Titanic. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=797.24s)]
*  She's had her pick of lead roles ever since. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=803.24s)]
*  Film critics we spoke to compare her to greats like Katharine Hepburn and Meryl Streep. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=806.24s)]
*  Winslet has a propensity for playing tough, angst-ridden women. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=811.24s)]
*  And that's exactly who she becomes in her latest film, Lee, which she also produced about American photographer Lee Miller, one of the few female journalists on the front lines of World War II. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=815.24s)]
*  We met Winslet last month at the theater where she performed as a teenager and found her to be remarkably un-Hollywood. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=828.24s)]
*  She drove herself to the interview, showed up alone, and dropped a few F-bombs. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=836.24s)]
*  Well, the idea of going back on this stage still terrifies me. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=843.24s)]
*  So how do you get over the nerves? What do you tell yourself? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=846.24s)]
*  Oh, honestly, it's a whole bunch of mind-f*****. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=849.24s)]
*  I mean, it is even to this day. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=853.24s)]
*  It's like anything, going for a job interview. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=855.24s)]
*  It's absolutely terrifying if it's a job you really want. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=858.24s)]
*  Doubly terrifying. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=860.24s)]
*  You've said on the first day you walk in and think everyone is in here thinking, why did they cast her? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=862.24s)]
*  Yeah, that, oh my God. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=868.24s)]
*  You are an Oscar-winning actress. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=870.24s)]
*  So what? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=873.24s)]
*  When I was doing Lee, I would sit there and I would say, this is ridiculous. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=874.24s)]
*  This is ridiculous. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=878.24s)]
*  I can truly think of at least five other brilliant actresses who would have played this part much better than me. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=879.24s)]
*  Like a lot better. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=884.24s)]
*  And often I will turn to another crew member and I'll say, they just read the wrong name off the list. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=885.24s)]
*  I'm telling you, they didn't mean for me to be here. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=890.24s)]
*  And I will have days where I'll be coming out of the back door now to take your role. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=893.24s)]
*  Please. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=897.24s)]
*  Welcome. Come on in. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=898.24s)]
*  Delighted to have you. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=899.24s)]
*  You must be Lee Miller. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=901.24s)]
*  Well, it's a war zone, Colonel. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=903.24s)]
*  Just Lee is fine. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=905.24s)]
*  That role that caused Kate Winslet so much angst was for the movie Lee. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=906.24s)]
*  She didn't just star in it. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=912.24s)]
*  She made it her first as a producer. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=914.24s)]
*  How much time did you spend at this house? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=922.24s)]
*  Oh my God. I mean, a lot of time across seven years. Yeah. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=924.24s)]
*  Those years were spent at Lee Miller's estate in the English countryside where she lived with her husband, a British painter. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=930.24s)]
*  It's where, with the help of Miller's son, Winslet scoured the archives and decided to focus Miller's life story not on her history as a model who had many lovers. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=937.24s)]
*  We don't hire older models. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=948.24s)]
*  Don't blow a gasket. I'm not a model anymore. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=950.24s)]
*  But as a troubled woman who in her late thirties left her glamorous life to become a war photographer, capturing some of the most haunting images from World War II, including some of the first uses of napalm and Nazi concentration camps, Winslet says she knew it wouldn't be an easy sell. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=953.24s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about what some of those phone calls were like. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=972.24s)]
*  There was one potential investor who said to me, why should I like this woman? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=975.24s)]
*  I mean, she's drunk. She's, you know, she's like loud. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=979.24s)]
*  She's like, I mean, he just probably stopped short of saying she has wrinkles on her face. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=982.24s)]
*  You had a director say something like, I'll get your little Lee funded. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=988.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=993.24s)]
*  You want to share names now? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=994.24s)]
*  No, never, never, no. That's not my vibe. No. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=995.24s)]
*  No, but so this director did say, yeah, tell you what, if you be in my film, I'll help you get your little Lee Miller film made. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=998.24s)]
*  And he actually went like that. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1005.24s)]
*  And I was like, might just have lost signal. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1008.24s)]
*  She didn't make the movie with those men. Instead, she insisted on bringing in a female director, co-producer and writers. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1012.24s)]
*  Winslet was intimately involved in every step of production, as we saw during a scoring session last spring. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1024.24s)]
*  Kate? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1031.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1032.24s)]
*  It doesn't feel too loud to you, does it? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1033.24s)]
*  Well, it's funny. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1035.24s)]
*  Okay, it's too loud. Let's do it again. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1036.24s)]
*  She also enlisted a historian to make an exact replica of Miller's camera and really took pictures while she was acting. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1040.24s)]
*  Why did you feel like you had to learn this craft? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1048.24s)]
*  It couldn't just be a prop. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1052.24s)]
*  It needed to feel like an actual piece of art. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1054.24s)]
*  It needed to feel like an extension of my arms. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1057.24s)]
*  I had to be confident and comfortable with it. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1062.24s)]
*  And in order to do that, I had to know what I was doing. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1064.24s)]
*  She spends months, even years, preparing for roles, inventing an elaborate backstory for every character, down to what sport they played in school and how they feel about their mothers. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1067.24s)]
*  You know me, I'm impulsive. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1078.24s)]
*  She's learned to dig for fossils, make dresses, and free dive, holding her breath for more than seven minutes for Avatar 2. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1080.24s)]
*  And she's not afraid of being exposed. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1090.24s)]
*  All right. Make me invisible. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1093.24s)]
*  Because to see a Kate Winslet movie often means you'll see a lot of Kate Winslet. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1096.24s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1102.24s)]
*  And then there's the accents. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1104.24s)]
*  Yeah, Nershan, down at Easttown. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1107.24s)]
*  She won an Emmy for Mayor of Easttown, playing a vaping, beer-swinging detective, nailing the specific sound of Delaware County, a Philadelphia suburb. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1110.24s)]
*  She's probably lying at the bottom of the Delaware River right now. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1120.24s)]
*  And why is the Philly so hard? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1124.24s)]
*  It's actually the I sound in the Philadelphia, in the Delco dialect, that is really difficult. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1126.24s)]
*  They don't say, that's nice. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1132.24s)]
*  I say, that's nice. I like your bike. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1135.24s)]
*  And though she may seem like someone with a shelf full of Oscars, she won her first and only in 2009 for her portrayal of a Nazi prison guard in The Reader. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1138.24s)]
*  I want to take out a book. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1149.24s)]
*  For years she kept a statue in her bathroom so guests could hold it up in the mirror and pretend to win. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1152.24s)]
*  I used to get the bus into town a lot. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1158.24s)]
*  We went with Winslet to Reading. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1161.24s)]
*  The working class town just outside London where she was born and raised. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1163.24s)]
*  This is the house? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1167.24s)]
*  Oh my God, this is the house. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1168.24s)]
*  The front door boarded up. Her family no longer lives here. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1170.24s)]
*  I lived here until when I was sort of 16 and I kind of left home really when I was 16. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1174.24s)]
*  Winslet is the second of four children. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1180.24s)]
*  Her father was a struggling actor who often gave his daughter the advice she still lives by. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1183.24s)]
*  You're only as good as your last gig. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1188.24s)]
*  He would sort of hop from job to job and then he would do part-time work to make ends meet in the meantime. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1191.24s)]
*  But the thing that was interesting I think is that even though there was so little, as you can see, to go around, we were really happy. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1197.24s)]
*  With financial help from a charity for actors, she enrolled in a local theatre school when she was 11, catching the train into London for auditions. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1206.24s)]
*  She says the scrutiny of her appearance started young. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1215.24s)]
*  You once had a drama teacher tell you settle for the fat girl parts? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1219.24s)]
*  Oh yeah. No, listen, Kate, I'm telling you, darling, if you're going to look like this you'll have to settle for the fat girl parts. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1224.24s)]
*  And I wasn't even fat. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1233.24s)]
*  What did that do to your spirit? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1236.24s)]
*  Your confidence. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1238.24s)]
*  It made me think, I'll just show you. Just quietly. It was like a sort of a quiet determination really. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1239.24s)]
*  Yeah, I'll just go in. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1247.24s)]
*  This grocery store was once the deli where 16-year-old Winslet was working when she got the news that she'd landed her first movie. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1248.24s)]
*  And I was making a sandwich and the phone rang and I swear to God there was something about the way the phone rang. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1256.24s)]
*  I was like, oh my God, that's for me. I wonder if it's about the job. And then the owner was like, hey, phone for you. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1262.24s)]
*  I thought, oh my God. So I ran and was told that I'd gotten this part. And then I was just so unraveled I had to leave. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1268.24s)]
*  I was like, I have to go home and tell my mom and dad. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1277.24s)]
*  After filming that first movie, Heavenly Creatures, Winslet went right back to making sandwiches. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1280.24s)]
*  That must have been kind of what is going on in my world here. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1286.24s)]
*  Because that was what I knew. You know, my dad would do jobs and he'd go back to, you know, tar macking the roads or working as a postman. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1289.24s)]
*  So I just thought, oh, well, that's what you do as an actor. You know, if you're lucky, you get a job and then you go back to a day job. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1296.24s)]
*  At 20, she got the offer for the part that would make Hollywood history. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1302.24s)]
*  Playing Rose opposite Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack in Titanic, the first film to break a billion dollars at the box office. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1308.24s)]
*  Winslet was game to discuss just about anything. But let's talk about Titanic. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1316.24s)]
*  Really? I was wondering what your reaction would be if I said that to you. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1323.24s)]
*  No, I'm happy to talk about Titanic. I guess it wouldn't be an interview with you if we didn't talk about Titanic in some way. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1328.24s)]
*  It could be an interview without it. We tried to ask about the famous scene that has sparked decades of debates. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1335.24s)]
*  I'll never let go. I promise. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1343.24s)]
*  May I ask, true, Leo really could have fit on the raft? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1347.24s)]
*  You know what? I have no idea. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1353.24s)]
*  Does it annoy you at all that 27 years later this movie still comes up in this way and probably will for the rest of your life? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1357.24s)]
*  No. I tell you what I do sometimes find just curious, I suppose, is whatever I say about Titanic will often be the take-home. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1364.24s)]
*  I just think, well, there were those things that I said about the film I was talking about and yet that's the one thing. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1376.24s)]
*  So that's the only thing that sometimes I just think. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1382.24s)]
*  What to miss? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1385.24s)]
*  To the stars. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1388.24s)]
*  While Titanic made Winslet a star, she says it came at a cost. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1391.24s)]
*  Paparazzi aggressively pursued her and just listened to how she was ridiculed for her weight. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1396.24s)]
*  There's cake a little melted and poured into that dress and you know she just needed two sizes large and it would probably have been okay. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1403.24s)]
*  I gasped at how cruel some of that coverage was of you at that time. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1409.24s)]
*  I know. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1414.24s)]
*  It's absolutely appalling. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1416.24s)]
*  What kind of a person must they be to do something like that to a young actress who's just trying to figure it out? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1419.24s)]
*  Did you ever get face to face with any of those people? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1427.24s)]
*  I did get face to face. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1430.24s)]
*  What did you say? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1432.24s)]
*  I let them have it. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1433.24s)]
*  I said I hope this haunts you. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1434.24s)]
*  It was a great moment. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1447.24s)]
*  It was a great moment because it wasn't just for me. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1455.24s)]
*  It was for all those people who were subjected to that level of harassment. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1460.24s)]
*  It was horrific. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1465.24s)]
*  It was really bad. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1467.24s)]
*  Now 49, Winslet says she developed an armor that she brings to characters like Lee Miller. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1469.24s)]
*  People say oh you were so brave for this role. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1475.24s)]
*  You didn't wear any make up. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1477.24s)]
*  You know you had wrinkles. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1479.24s)]
*  Do we say to the men oh you were so brave for this role. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1481.24s)]
*  You grew a beard. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1484.24s)]
*  No we don't. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1485.24s)]
*  That still happened to you? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1486.24s)]
*  Yes it happens to me all the time. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1488.24s)]
*  It's not brave. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1490.24s)]
*  It's playing the part. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1492.24s)]
*  Is it true that a crew member came up to you and said you might want to kind of sit up a little bit. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1494.24s)]
*  You're showing a lump. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1500.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1502.24s)]
*  You might want to kind of just sit in, suck in, sit up. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1503.24s)]
*  And I was like. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1507.24s)]
*  You didn't. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1509.24s)]
*  I don't think Lee would have done. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1511.24s)]
*  It's about knowing that Lee's ease with her physical self was hard won. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1513.24s)]
*  In Hollywood you could have a lot of great lights so that you don't see the lump that we all have, the bumps that we all have. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1519.24s)]
*  You don't care about showing that. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1525.24s)]
*  No I don't. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1527.24s)]
*  Why not? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1528.24s)]
*  It's exhausting. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1530.24s)]
*  When she's not filming Winslet lives far from the spotlight in a quiet English seaside village. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1532.24s)]
*  She and her husband Ned Abel Smith have a 10 year old son. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1538.24s)]
*  She also has a 20 year old son and 24 year old daughter from previous marriages. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1542.24s)]
*  Winslet is not on social media and told us she doesn't read reviews of her work. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1547.24s)]
*  But this much she knows. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1553.24s)]
*  It's hard to make films about historical female figures. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1555.24s)]
*  Typically those aren't films that would necessarily do well in the box office. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1559.24s)]
*  Says she sitting here proudly telling you that her film has taken over 25 million so far. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1563.24s)]
*  Cha-ching. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1567.24s)]
*  And we made a film about one woman. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1569.24s)]
*  So there's not a sense of I told you so. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1571.24s)]
*  No I don't feel like that but I just hope they've seen the film. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1573.24s)]
*  2023 was the year the world learned to pronounce Killian. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1578.24s)]
*  The ancient Irish name seemed to be on everyone's lips as the film Oppenheimer became a blockbuster. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1581.24s)]
*  Winning seven Oscars including Best Actor for Killian Murphy. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1588.24s)]
*  Murphy has worked now for the film since the early 2000s. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1593.24s)]
*  He's been a director for a few years. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1598.24s)]
*  He's been a director for a few years. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1600.24s)]
*  He's been a director for a few years. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1602.24s)]
*  And we've been a director for Killian Murphy. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1604.24s)]
*  Murphy has worked nonstop for nearly 30 years. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1606.24s)]
*  But it was the epic drama of the atomic bomb that ignited a star. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1609.24s)]
*  As we told you last winter, Murphy seems to be more famous than well known. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1615.24s)]
*  So we set out to learn more. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1620.24s)]
*  We were warned the 48 year old Irishman is reserved and wouldn't talk about himself. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1623.24s)]
*  But we discovered finding Killian Murphy depends on where you look. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1628.24s)]
*  Ireland's Dingle Peninsula was named for a goddess before such things were written. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1646.24s)]
*  And for 6,000 years, stories have passed by ear. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1652.24s)]
*  So if verse inhabits every Irish soul, then in a country pub, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1658.24s)]
*  Killian Murphy is among peers as he would have it. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1671.24s)]
*  Just a man with a pint to lift and no fame to bear. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1675.24s)]
*  What is the meaning of Ireland to you? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1681.24s)]
*  I don't think I can answer that question satisfactorily. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1685.24s)]
*  It's defined who I am as a person and my values. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1689.24s)]
*  It's just home. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1695.24s)]
*  Home includes his wife of 20 years, two teenage sons, and Scout, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1697.24s)]
*  a lab named for the character in To Kill a Mockingbird that figures [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1703.24s)]
*  Murphy has always let stories lead his path. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1708.24s)]
*  You find so much empathy in novels because there you are putting yourself [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1713.24s)]
*  into somebody else's point of view. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1718.24s)]
*  I've always been a big reader. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1721.24s)]
*  When a movie can connect with someone and they feel seen or feel heard, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1723.24s)]
*  or a novel can change somebody's life, or a piece of music, an album, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1727.24s)]
*  can change someone's life, and I've had all that happen to me, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1732.24s)]
*  and that's the power of good art, I think. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1735.24s)]
*  There's a straight line from the music in the pub to Oppenheimer. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1737.24s)]
*  I think they're from the same source. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1742.24s)]
*  I mean, I really do. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1744.24s)]
*  I don't see... I see it's all in a continuum. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1745.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's just a form of expression. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1748.24s)]
*  Expression in the eyes of J. Robert Oppenheimer, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1751.24s)]
*  the physicist who created the atom bomb but never controlled it. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1755.24s)]
*  If they detonated too high in the air, the blast wouldn't be as powerful. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1760.24s)]
*  With respect, Dr. Oppenheimer, we'll take it from here. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1763.24s)]
*  I remember reading at the beginning about him that he was more riddled than answer, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1769.24s)]
*  and I thought, oh, okay, wow, that's interesting. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1775.24s)]
*  I'm curious about your notes. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1780.24s)]
*  The riddle was in this script by writer-director Christopher Nolan, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1782.24s)]
*  printed in red so it couldn't be photocopied. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1787.24s)]
*  I did genuinely think it was one of the greatest screenplays I'd ever read. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1791.24s)]
*  And you told him, I'll do it. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1794.24s)]
*  I mean, I said I'd do it before I read it. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1796.24s)]
*  That's quite a risk. Why would you do that? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1798.24s)]
*  It's always paid off for me, you know, in every film that I've worked with him on. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1801.24s)]
*  I'm not going back. I'm not going back. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1805.24s)]
*  There have been six Chris Nolan films for Murphy, Dunkirk, Inception, and three Batman titles. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1809.24s)]
*  Would you like to see my mask? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1820.24s)]
*  You told me that getting a film made and getting it seen is a miracle. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1822.24s)]
*  It is. And then if it's any way good, that's a miracle. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1827.24s)]
*  And then if it connects with audiences, that's a miracle. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1832.24s)]
*  So it's a miracle upon miracle upon miracle to have a film like Oppenheimer. It really is. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1834.24s)]
*  His Oppenheimer was not so much a miracle as hard work. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1841.24s)]
*  He lost 28 pounds to get the silhouette. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1845.24s)]
*  Then he rose to the character step by step over six months, reading, listening to Oppenheimer's lectures, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1848.24s)]
*  and covering miles on the beach, performing for Scout. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1857.24s)]
*  I remember at one point I said to Chris, Chris, there appears to be, he appears to speak Dutch here, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1862.24s)]
*  and I think he's giving a lecture in Dutch here. What are we going to do about that? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1869.24s)]
*  And Chris said, you mean, what are you going to do about that? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1872.24s)]
*  What's he saying? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1883.24s)]
*  Murphy says he put all he learned in the back of his mind and acted on instinct. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1884.24s)]
*  I think instinct is your most powerful tool that you have as an actor. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1891.24s)]
*  Nothing must be predetermined, so therefore you mustn't have a plan about how you're going to play stuff. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1895.24s)]
*  And I love that. It's like being buffeted by the wind and being buffeted by emotion. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1901.24s)]
*  You don't get to commit the sin, and then others all feel sorry for you. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1906.24s)]
*  Emily Blunt plays Oppenheimer's tormented wife. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1911.24s)]
*  You pull yourself together. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1915.24s)]
*  He's very visceral to be in a scene with. It's like you, he transports you. He'll kidnap you in a scene. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1919.24s)]
*  My favorite acting moment of his in Oppenheimer is the scene after the bomb has been dropped, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1925.24s)]
*  and he's addressing all of the people at Los Alamos. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1932.24s)]
*  The world will remember this day. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1936.24s)]
*  He somehow welds together the concept of being proud of what they did and regretting it very deeply. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1943.24s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1953.24s)]
*  All at the same time. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1954.24s)]
*  I know. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1955.24s)]
*  It's too soon to determine what the results of the bombing are. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1956.24s)]
*  But I'll bet the Japanese didn't like it. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1965.24s)]
*  No one moment is about one thing, and if you're as agile as someone like Killian and as vulnerable and as clever, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1970.24s)]
*  you can play it all. But I don't know if many people can do what he does. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1978.24s)]
*  Killian Murphy discovered agility in his hometown Cork. His mother was a teacher, his father a school inspector. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1985.24s)]
*  In high school, Murphy and his brother had a band. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1994.24s)]
*  Performing led to acting class and his first play. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=1999.24s)]
*  This is more like the size of a storage room than a theater. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2004.24s)]
*  Yeah, but that's all we were used to. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2007.24s)]
*  His first theater, 1996, age 20, the play was Disco Pigs, which grew to bigger theaters and became a movie. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2010.24s)]
*  Why did you think you could be an actor? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2020.24s)]
*  I didn't. I was very comfortable on stage in front of an audience from when I was little. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2022.24s)]
*  I never had any nerves doing that. I felt that natural, you know, and thrilling. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2028.24s)]
*  In this theater, what did you learn about acting? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2034.24s)]
*  There's a fire escape door right there and that's kind of an alleyway there. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2040.24s)]
*  So you get a lot of drunk guys out of their mind bashing up against the fire escape door. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2046.24s)]
*  And it used to kind of energize us. So I remember learning about taking whatever you have, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2052.24s)]
*  sort of responding to whatever the energy is in the room and using it. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2058.24s)]
*  That's really good training. Maintaining your character with the drunk guy yelling through the fire escape door. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2061.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. And I think theater is such an absurd undertaking when you think of it, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2069.24s)]
*  because at any point it could collapse and go wrong. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2077.24s)]
*  It's dangerous. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2080.24s)]
*  Yeah, and I love that aspect of it. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2082.24s)]
*  That love led him to drop law school. And since then there have been a dozen plays and 40 movies. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2084.24s)]
*  I love it when it becomes an immersive experience. I love getting lost in it. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2093.24s)]
*  In the early days, that was with theater, it felt kind of extraordinary. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2101.24s)]
*  With just the power of will and a couple of lights and a good script, we were creating this world. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2105.24s)]
*  So that's kind of addictive when it works well. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2110.24s)]
*  It worked well in 2013 in a breakout role as a leading man. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2113.24s)]
*  In the series Peaky Blinders, Murphy plays Thomas Shelby, who survives World War I to lead a family of gangsters. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2119.24s)]
*  You're mostly in the war so you know the battle plans always change and get f***ed up. Well here it is. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2129.24s)]
*  They're all damaged, broken men, but something got knocked in him and he came back with this incredible drive and ambition. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2135.24s)]
*  And like, I'm not afraid of death, so now I can do whatever I want. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2146.24s)]
*  In Tommy Shelby you created a sympathetic, relatable monster. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2154.24s)]
*  Kill and kill. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2160.24s)]
*  That's the only way to make people listen. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2165.24s)]
*  I like to be challenged and when I read something I want to go, I don't really know how I can do that. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2168.24s)]
*  In ten years of Peaky Blinders, Murphy came into his own. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2177.24s)]
*  I heard very early on in my career a director, it was one of the Sidneys, it couldn't be in Sidney, it couldn't be in Sidney Pollock, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2182.24s)]
*  but one of them said it takes 30 years to make an actor. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2188.24s)]
*  It's not just technique and experience, it's maturing as a human being and trying to grapple with life and figure it out and all of that stuff. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2193.24s)]
*  So by the time you've been doing it for 30 years, you've all of that banked, hopefully. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2207.24s)]
*  And eventually then I think you'll get to a point where you might be an okay actor. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2211.24s)]
*  Maturing is the theme of Murphy's new film based on the novel Small Things Like These. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2220.24s)]
*  He plays Bill Furlong, tormented by the injustice he sees. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2228.24s)]
*  His wife fears that his empathy will upend their lives. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2233.24s)]
*  Don't you ever question this? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2238.24s)]
*  If you want to get on in this life, there are things you have to ignore. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2251.24s)]
*  That's Eileen Walsh. No actor has known Murphy longer. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2258.24s)]
*  She was his first partner in Disco Pigs 28 years ago. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2264.24s)]
*  Is his work ethic rooted in fear or joy? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2269.24s)]
*  Oh, that's a good question. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2274.24s)]
*  I think it can only be joy, but it sometimes takes a lot of pain to get to that joy. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2278.24s)]
*  The deeper we go with acting, the cost is greater for us. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2284.24s)]
*  And physically I know Oppenheimer has cast him for the weight loss he insisted. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2289.24s)]
*  It was his choice to do, but it was the right choice to create that amazing silhouette. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2299.24s)]
*  But from the very beginning, our warm-ups for Disco Pigs involved us punching each other. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2305.24s)]
*  Quite hard. And like going for it and then bursting out into it. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2312.24s)]
*  This huge ball of velocity coming into it was the beginning of an Oppenheimer, was the whole kind of atom of us. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2320.24s)]
*  Now, after three decades of work, Cillian Murphy is cast in the most familiar Irish legend of all, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2328.24s)]
*  with a 24-carat gold-plated statue at the end of his long spectrum of talent. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2338.24s)]
*  You have screwed this up though, you know. In what way? [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2346.24s)]
*  You used to be an actor, and now you're a movie star. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2350.24s)]
*  Okay. Am I? I think you could be both. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2354.24s)]
*  You know, I've never understood that term, really, movie star. I've always just felt like I'm an actor. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2360.24s)]
*  That's, I think, a term for other people rather than for me. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2367.24s)]
*  It's no secret big Hollywood studios like Ashore bet, and there's no shortage of predictable movies to prove it. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2370.24s)]
*  Which is probably why Nicolas Cage left Los Angeles for Las Vegas a long time ago. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2378.24s)]
*  At 15, he was a big fan of the Hollywood movie industry, and he was a big fan of the Hollywood movie industry. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2384.24s)]
*  Which is probably why Nicolas Cage left Los Angeles for Las Vegas a long time ago. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2393.24s)]
*  At 59, the Academy Award winner owns one of the most eclectic lists of film credits in the business. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2399.24s)]
*  He's been at it for more than 40 years, pivoting from leading man to action hero to a slew of lesser features and back again. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2406.24s)]
*  As we first told you in April, behind that kaleidoscope of characters is a unique imagination, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2414.24s)]
*  and an encyclopedic knowledge of film that seems to motivate everything Nicolas Cage does. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2420.24s)]
*  His work, his life, and even this. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2427.24s)]
*  I always loved that character. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2431.24s)]
*  Cage's brand new Gold Lamborghini, a tribute to a beloved 1968 film directed by Federico Fellini featuring this gilded Ferrari. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2434.24s)]
*  It was a crazy, beautiful Fellini movie, and it inspired me. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2443.24s)]
*  So when I saw this, I said, that's the car. It's not a Ferrari, which would be great, but they don't really have any gold Ferraris. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2448.24s)]
*  Have you driven this out here, beyond the gates? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2455.24s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2458.24s)]
*  It's fun. Snap, crackle, pop. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2467.24s)]
*  By any measure, Nicolas Cage is not slowing down. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2471.24s)]
*  He's revamped the role of Dracula in a movie called Renfield. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2476.24s)]
*  Please, come in. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2481.24s)]
*  And has another five movies coming up. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2483.24s)]
*  We met Nicolas Cage at the home he shares with his wife and young daughter in Las Vegas. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2485.24s)]
*  It is exactly what you might imagine Nicolas Cage's home in Las Vegas would be. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2491.24s)]
*  Part goth cathedral, part avant-garde gallery. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2496.24s)]
*  Okay, Hogan. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2500.24s)]
*  There's an African crow in the living room, a cat that could scare off a burglar, and this. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2502.24s)]
*  This is my black dragon that's a monitor lizard. He'll get to be about six feet long. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2507.24s)]
*  He's like having a real dinosaur in your house. It's kind of amazing. And he's alive. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2513.24s)]
*  That kind of imagination is in his DNA. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2518.24s)]
*  Nicolas Kim Coppola was born on the fringe of cinema royalty. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2521.24s)]
*  His uncle is director Francis Ford Coppola. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2526.24s)]
*  He told us his mother Joy, a choreographer, suffered from severe mental illness and was institutionalized for much of his childhood. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2529.24s)]
*  He and his two brothers were raised by his father August, a literature professor, who introduced him to the masterworks of Italian and German filmmakers, igniting his love of cinema. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2537.24s)]
*  As a teenager, he worked at a movie theater and says he was mesmerized by the big screen. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2548.24s)]
*  Was it about being a movie star or was it about escaping into something else? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2554.24s)]
*  It was about wanting to be James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause and wearing that red jacket, wanting to be John in Saturday Night Fever. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2559.24s)]
*  I came out of the cinema electrified. I was like, yeah, wanting to go there. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2568.24s)]
*  And after seeing James Dean in East of Eden, he did. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2572.24s)]
*  It was more meaningful to me than anything else I'd experienced. Music, you know, Beethoven, Beatles, painting. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2578.24s)]
*  What I saw in that moment made me realize the power, the excitement of what you can convey through film performance, film performance. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2586.24s)]
*  He's been in pursuit of that feeling for most of his life. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2598.24s)]
*  Inhabiting characters of every stripe, a baby snatching ex con, a Brooklyn baker, an alcoholic screenwriter, a treasure hunter, and even himself. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2602.24s)]
*  Nick Cage. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2620.24s)]
*  Cage's first feature role came in 1982's Fast Times at Ridgemont High. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2622.24s)]
*  The 17-year-old blends into the background, but his Coppola name did not. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2626.24s)]
*  His uncle directed The Godfather and Apocalypse Now. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2632.24s)]
*  Sick of being hazed about it on set, he changed his name, inspired by a Marvel superhero with unbreakable skin. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2635.24s)]
*  When people think of Nicolas Cage, I wanted it to have like a punk rock energy at that time. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2643.24s)]
*  I wanted it to be unpredictable. You don't know what you're going to get. I wanted it to be exciting and a little scary. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2651.24s)]
*  It has been. After more than 100 movies, Nicolas Cage is almost his own genre. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2658.24s)]
*  He told us when he read the script for Peggy Sue God Married, he worried it was going to be too much like the play Our Town. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2665.24s)]
*  How did you know about that? [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2671.24s)]
*  Which he hated. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2673.24s)]
*  I grew up watching Gumby and listening to Pokey and I thought, well that would be a good voice for a character, especially in this movie. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2675.24s)]
*  Thank you for saving me. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2682.24s)]
*  And so I thought if I do that, that won't be boring. That'll be like, what the hell is he doing? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2684.24s)]
*  Things just work out better in the end. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2689.24s)]
*  And Kathleen Turner said, like, what the hell is he doing? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2691.24s)]
*  You know, I think I frustrated her with the performance, but I adored her. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2694.24s)]
*  Did she ever say, like, knock it off? [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2698.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2699.24s)]
*  But Cage would draw from odd places again in The Coen Brothers Raising Arizona. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2701.24s)]
*  How did you envision that role? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2707.24s)]
*  H.I. McDonough was like that thrush muffler symbol, the Woody Woodpecker with the cigar. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2710.24s)]
*  I saw him with like the red hair sticking up, like a Looney Tunes character come to life again. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2717.24s)]
*  I'm going to ask you about one scene in that movie. You're having your mug shot taken and you turn and as you're walking away you slap your ass. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2724.24s)]
*  Let me know how this can end. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2732.24s)]
*  I had it all thought out. Giddy up, you know, like getting himself up out of the mug shot. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2734.24s)]
*  Cage's catalogue of inspiration extends from cartoons to the haunting German films he watched as a child. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2741.24s)]
*  You've been influenced by German expressionists. What does that look like? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2749.24s)]
*  Well, what it is is specifically movies like Cabinet of Dr. Caligari or Nosferatu or Metropolis. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2751.24s)]
*  The mad scientist shows the robot hand and it goes like that. You know, it's just like a large expressionistic acting. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2760.24s)]
*  So I put that into Moonstruck. I lost my hand. That's exactly a direct steal. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2768.24s)]
*  I lost my hand. I lost my bride. Johnny has his hand. Johnny has his bride. You want me to take my heartbreak, put it away and forget? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2774.24s)]
*  Come on. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2786.24s)]
*  Thirty-five years on, Ronnie Camerary, the operatic one-handed baker in the romantic comedy Moonstruck, remains one of his most memorable roles. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2788.24s)]
*  You can do this one thing for me. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2798.24s)]
*  But Cage says it was a small movie called Leaving Las Vegas that was the answer to his prayers. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2800.24s)]
*  What did you think when you first read that script? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2807.24s)]
*  That was the feeling that I had with East of Eden and James Deems. Like this is the kind of movie I really want to make. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2810.24s)]
*  A heartbreaking drama about two wounded people who somehow have this true love. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2819.24s)]
*  True love. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2828.24s)]
*  How did you figure out how to play that role? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2830.24s)]
*  Well, I looked at a lot of great movies. I looked at Chris Kristofferson in A Star is Born. From him I got that feeling of he was always smiling. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2832.24s)]
*  In my view, the only thing sadder than a person who's in a sad situation and knows it is a person who's in a sad situation and doesn't know it. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2840.24s)]
*  You're like some kind of antidote that mixes with the liquor and keeps me in balance. But that won't last forever. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2848.24s)]
*  I was saying to myself literally I'm never going to win the Academy Award so let's just do this anyway because nobody wanted to make it. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2856.24s)]
*  At the Oscars you announced on stage you loved the idea of blurring the line between art and commerce by making this small film. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2864.24s)]
*  And then you start doing these big action films. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2871.24s)]
*  Yeah, that was about staying unpredictable and trying something new again. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2874.24s)]
*  But at the time when I did it, I think it pissed a lot of people off. It was like, well, you're an actor's actor. You're not supposed to be doing adventure films. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2881.24s)]
*  You will not. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2890.24s)]
*  But he did. The Rock with Sean Connery. A Prison Break movie con air. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2892.24s)]
*  Put the bunny back in the box. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2897.24s)]
*  The National Treasure franchise. And Face Up, where Cage's character literally swaps faces with John Travolta. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2901.24s)]
*  You've got something in common. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2908.24s)]
*  It was an idea that delivered big box office returns and helped catapult Cage into the category of Hollywood's highest paid actors. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2910.24s)]
*  Where's your head at when that starts happening? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2919.24s)]
*  Oh great, now I can make another Leaving Las Vegas. Let's keep doing it. Let's keep mixing it up. Let's keep challenging ourselves. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2922.24s)]
*  But Cage ended up facing a different kind of challenge. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2929.24s)]
*  We wanted to ask him about reports that he blew through his fortune buying exotic cars, mansions around the globe, even a dinosaur skull. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2932.24s)]
*  But his African crow, Hugen, objected to the line of questioning. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2941.24s)]
*  Hi, Hugen. Right on cue. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2946.24s)]
*  It's nice to hear you're talking again. I know everybody in the house kind of freaked you out. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2948.24s)]
*  The houses, right? Castles in Germany, in England, in Ireland, the mansion in New Orleans. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2952.24s)]
*  Right. What's that about? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2958.24s)]
*  I was overinvested in real estate. It wasn't because I spent $80 on an octopus. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2959.24s)]
*  The real estate market crashed and I couldn't get out in time. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2964.24s)]
*  How much money did you end up owing to the IRS and to your creditors? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2968.24s)]
*  I paid them all back, but it was about $6 million. I never filed for bankruptcy. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2972.24s)]
*  He moved to tax-free Las Vegas, dug in and worked nonstop, making three to four movies a year. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2977.24s)]
*  That had to be a dark period for you. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2984.24s)]
*  It was dark, sure. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2987.24s)]
*  Did the work help you get through? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2989.24s)]
*  Work was always my guardian angel. It may not have been blue chip, but it was still work. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=2992.24s)]
*  When somebody suggests during that period of time, when they say, these critics say, like, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3001.24s)]
*  he's just here for a paycheck and he's phoning it in. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3006.24s)]
*  Even if the movie ultimately is crummy, they know I'm not phoning it in, that I care every time. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3010.24s)]
*  But there are those folks that are probably thinking that the only good acting that I can do [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3015.24s)]
*  is the acting that I chose to do by design, which was more operatic and larger than life [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3022.24s)]
*  and so-called cage rage and all that. But you're not going to get that every time. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3029.24s)]
*  But part of the appeal is the cage rage, a moniker his fans have for his outsides, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3035.24s)]
*  some say over-the-top moments on film. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3042.24s)]
*  I'm going to help you and you won't listen! [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3045.24s)]
*  You go for it. I've heard you've described it as like going for the triple axel every time. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3047.24s)]
*  And sometimes you land it and sometimes you don't. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3051.24s)]
*  Well, not every time. But there are things that I do want to go for, sometimes that I have a vision for, and I do. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3054.24s)]
*  Like his 2021 performance as a heartbroken chef in the movie Pig. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3062.24s)]
*  None of it is real. The critics aren't real. The customers aren't real. Because this isn't real. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3068.24s)]
*  When I played Rob in Pig, I felt I entered the room. I felt that I was closer to me than maybe I have ever been before in film performance. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3080.24s)]
*  She died. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3097.24s)]
*  What do you mean closer to you? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3099.24s)]
*  That I wasn't acting. I felt that I was doing exactly what I care about. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3102.24s)]
*  I think it's probably my best movie and I think I'll put that up against Leaving Las Vegas or anything else. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3109.24s)]
*  That would include his turn as Dracula in his latest movie Renfield. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3115.24s)]
*  Cage Meta sat a favorite hangout on the strip to talk about the Count. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3120.24s)]
*  We have much to discuss. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3124.24s)]
*  Dracula is daunting. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3127.24s)]
*  I am Count Dracula. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3129.24s)]
*  Because it's a legacy. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3131.24s)]
*  He's my servant. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3133.24s)]
*  Dracula is a character that has been done well many times. He's also a character that has been done poorly many times. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3135.24s)]
*  But for me, I think Christopher Lee, he was my Dracula. He made Dracula scary. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3144.24s)]
*  We had a happy marriage in terms of I could bring where I wanted to go into the camera with the teeths almost like the shark in Jaws. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3149.24s)]
*  You seem like a guy who's all in all the time. You don't do anything halfway. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3159.24s)]
*  Very insightful Sharon. Very, very insightful. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3167.24s)]
*  Let's eat. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3171.24s)]
*  Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVReUtyxLw&t=3179.24s)]
