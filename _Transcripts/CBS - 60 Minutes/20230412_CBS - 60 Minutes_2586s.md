# The Origin of Everything; Sportswashing; The Resurrection Of Notre Dame | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [April 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0)
*  What does the origin of everything look like? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=0.0s)]
*  That's what NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is trying to discover. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=11.0s)]
*  We call it space because we thought there was nothing out there. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=15.5s)]
*  There is no empty sky with James Webb. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=19.0s)]
*  The telescope is sensitive to the faint light that reaches us from the dawn of time. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=22.0s)]
*  Then this team turns data into images that look like this, and this, and this. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=28.0s)]
*  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has ignited a revolution in global sports, and it's not easy to apply a price tag. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=41.0s)]
*  Soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo has just signed a $200 million contract for one year. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=48.0s)]
*  Golfers who left the PGA make more than $100 million to play in a new Saudi-backed circuit. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=55.0s)]
*  Is the kingdom simply resetting the market in sports, or using sports to launder its image? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=61.0s)]
*  Almost exactly four years ago, the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris caught fire and the world watched in horror. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=70.0s)]
*  On this Easter Sunday, 60 Minutes gets rare access to the painstaking restoration of Notre Dame, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=80.0s)]
*  as workers and artisans revive every part of this medieval masterpiece. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=87.0s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=95.0s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=96.0s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=97.0s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonzi. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=99.0s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=100.0s)]
*  I'm Nora O'Donnell. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=101.0s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=103.0s)]
*  Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=104.0s)]
*  NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has hardly opened its eyes, and the universe is new, more mysterious, more beautiful than humanity's dreams. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=110.0s)]
*  The largest telescope ever flown launched into deep space on Christmas Day 2021. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=128.0s)]
*  Its primary mission is to reveal the let there be light moment when the stars and galaxies first ignited after the Big Bang. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=135.0s)]
*  Recently, we got a look at some captivating images as Webb peers back toward the origin of everything. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=144.0s)]
*  This is one of Webb's early deep dives into the cosmos, 250 hours of exposures that expand the imagination. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=154.0s)]
*  And all these little dots are stars? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=166.0s)]
*  All these little dots are galaxies, some of which are bigger than our own. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=168.0s)]
*  Astrophysicist Brent Robertson flew us through 130,000 galaxies, half never seen before. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=173.0s)]
*  Enormous swirls of billions of stars each, some like our own Milky Way, and others, well, out of this world. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=182.0s)]
*  We call this galaxy at the center of the screen the Cosmic Rose. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=192.0s)]
*  Just by chance, it looks like a rose does. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=196.0s)]
*  You can see that dusty red, irregular galaxy. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=200.0s)]
*  You know, space is more crowded than you might think, and actually galaxies wind up interacting with each other. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=203.0s)]
*  They actually will merge together. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=209.0s)]
*  So I'm zooming in now on a pair of galaxies that are merging together, interacting. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=211.0s)]
*  You can see that they're disturbed because the gravity of one galaxy yanks the stars out of the other galaxy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=216.0s)]
*  They're running into each other. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=223.0s)]
*  They're running into each other. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=224.0s)]
*  Robertson, of the University of California Santa Cruz, helps lead Webb's most ambitious mission, the Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=226.0s)]
*  Well, we've discovered the most distant galaxy in the universe, the one that is the furthest away from us that we currently know about. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=237.0s)]
*  I'd like to share that with you. Can I show you some pictures? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=245.0s)]
*  Please. I'd love to see it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=247.0s)]
*  So as we zoom in, we keep going, we keep going. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=249.0s)]
*  And now this red splotch that you see there, that galaxy, that's a galaxy, that galaxy is more than 33 billion light years away. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=253.0s)]
*  How long after the Big Bang, the beginning of the universe, did this galaxy form? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=264.0s)]
*  It's amazing. It's only 320 million years after the Big Bang. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=269.0s)]
*  The most distant galaxy so far, there on the right, doesn't look like much, but astronomers can fill textbooks by analyzing the spectrum of its light. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=274.0s)]
*  So we can actually measure things like how fast it's forming stars. We can measure the amount of stars in the galaxy. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=286.0s)]
*  We know the size because we know how far away it is. And we know the typical age of the stars in the galaxy. So we know a lot. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=293.0s)]
*  The earliest galaxy so far formed when the universe was 2% of its current age, and the baby galaxy ignited stars at a furious pace. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=300.0s)]
*  It's like a hummingbird. You know, the heartbeat of this galaxy is so rapid. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=312.0s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=316.0s)]
*  Well, this galaxy is forming stars at about the rate of the Milky Way, even though it's a hundred times less massive. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=318.0s)]
*  So it really is like a hummingbird. The heartbeat of this galaxy is racing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=325.0s)]
*  T minus 30 seconds and counting. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=329.0s)]
*  More than a few human hearts were racing in 2021 as the $10 billion observatory readied for launch. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=331.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=340.0s)]
*  Earlier that year, we were among the last to see Webb in California before it was folded into a 15-foot wide nose cone. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=344.0s)]
*  Well, somehow that's a lot bigger than I imagined. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=354.0s)]
*  Twenty-five years in the making, Webb is named for an early NASA administrator. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=358.0s)]
*  Northrop Grumman engineer Amy Lowe showed us down below the silver-colored sunshield, big as a tennis court, and 21 feet of gold-plated mirrors for gathering light. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=364.0s)]
*  There are 18 of these hexagonal mirrors, but when you fold them out, they all work in concert as one mirror. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=379.0s)]
*  That's right. All 18 images will form one very nice solid image. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=388.0s)]
*  And liftoff. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=396.0s)]
*  Decolage. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=398.0s)]
*  Decolage. Liftoff. From a tropical rainforest to the edge of time itself, James Webb begins a voyage back to the birth of the universe. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=399.0s)]
*  Webb lofted on a European rocket into an orbit around the sun a million miles away. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=407.0s)]
*  To set up for observations, engineers used a star to align those mirrors. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=414.0s)]
*  But the image was speckled with what looked like artifacts of digital noise, which forced a closer look. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=421.0s)]
*  These were not artifacts from the detector. These were not strange stars. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=430.0s)]
*  The whole of the sky was filled with galaxies. There was no empty sky. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=434.0s)]
*  And that's when I went, this telescope's going to be phenomenal. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=440.0s)]
*  Matt Mountain leads Webb's operations as president of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=444.0s)]
*  No empty sky. What do you mean by that? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=453.0s)]
*  And almost every image we're taking now, we see galaxies everywhere. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=456.0s)]
*  I mean, we took a simple picture of a planet and our own system, Neptune. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=460.0s)]
*  You know, it was this beautiful orb just sitting there, and we saw some rings. And the background? A galaxy again. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=465.0s)]
*  It tells us that our universe is filled with galaxies. We knew this theoretically. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=472.0s)]
*  But when you go out to the night sky, we're used to saying, well, look up at night sky, we see those stars. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=478.0s)]
*  We can no longer say that. We now have to say, look up at the night sky, and there are galaxies everywhere. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=483.0s)]
*  We call it space because we thought there was nothing out there. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=489.0s)]
*  There is no empty sky with James Webb. That is what we have discovered. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=493.0s)]
*  Matt Mountain says that Webb is a reminder of how much we do not know. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=497.0s)]
*  For example, galaxies are rushing away from each other at greater and greater speed, defying gravity. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=502.0s)]
*  It makes no sense. So scientists infer that there must be unseen elements at work. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=510.0s)]
*  They call them dark energy and dark matter. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=517.0s)]
*  And whenever you hear the term dark energy or dark matter, this means we don't know what it is. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=521.0s)]
*  We're not that imaginative. But it is a force. It is 95% of our universe, and we have no idea what it is. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=527.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. 95% of our universe is made up of dark energy and dark matter, and we don't know what it is. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=536.0s)]
*  Correct. We're lucky if we even understand 4% of our universe today. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=543.0s)]
*  Astronomy is a very humbling discipline. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=549.0s)]
*  Humbling, but with Webb... [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=553.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=555.0s)]
*  Also thrilling. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=556.0s)]
*  Look at this. Right! [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=558.0s)]
*  This is Purdue University astronomer Dan Mili-Soblovich starstruck and chatting with a colleague. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=561.0s)]
*  Yes! Yes! Look at the detail! [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=569.0s)]
*  Even Wilbur, who's not an astronomer, strained to see what the excitement was about. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=573.0s)]
*  Mili-Soblovich studies exploded stars, which were the furnaces that forged the first heavy elements from a cosmos of simple helium and hydrogen. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=581.0s)]
*  Every time there's a supernova explosion, it's producing the raw materials for life. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=592.0s)]
*  The iron in our blood, the calcium in our bones, the oxygen that we breathe. Love that oxygen. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=599.0s)]
*  All that is being manufactured in supernova explosions. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=607.0s)]
*  The late astronomer Carl Sagan used to say, we're all made of star stuff. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=611.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=615.0s)]
*  Webb reveals unprecedented detail at the center of these explosions. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=617.0s)]
*  And that's what Webb is most sensitive to for our purposes. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=624.0s)]
*  Understanding what's happening inside the explosion that we couldn't see before because it only comes out in infrared light. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=628.0s)]
*  Infrared light is what Webb is designed to see. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=636.0s)]
*  Like a night vision camera, the telescope is sensitive to heat radiation, which is all that remains of the light reaching us from the dawn of time. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=640.0s)]
*  Trouble is, infrared is invisible to the human eye. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=651.0s)]
*  When you first pull up the Webb data, what does that look like? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=656.0s)]
*  Essentially, it looks like a blank screen. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=661.0s)]
*  Alisa Pagan and Joe DiPasquale are astronomers and science imagers for the Space Telescope Science Institute. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=664.0s)]
*  This is what a Webb infrared picture looks like until they match the data-filled darkness to colors of wonder. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=674.0s)]
*  So we take those longest wavelengths of infrared light and give those the red colors. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=684.0s)]
*  The next shortest wavelengths would be green and then the shortest wavelengths that we get from Webb are colored blue. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=689.0s)]
*  And so just like how our eyes work, we take those three color channels, combine them together to create the full color images that we see from Webb. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=694.0s)]
*  Among their favorite images is this cluster of stars with the not-so-wonderous name NGC 346. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=701.0s)]
*  Cosmic dust sculpted into ripples by interactions between stars. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=711.0s)]
*  And the Tarantula Nebula, a star-birthing nursery on a backdrop of galaxies. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=717.0s)]
*  It occurs to me you're the first two people to see these images in human history. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=725.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's quite an honor. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=730.0s)]
*  It is a great honor and it does blow your mind every time. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=732.0s)]
*  There will be many mind-blowing revelations. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=735.0s)]
*  Webb is already the first to find carbon dioxide in the sky of a planet 700 light-years away. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=738.0s)]
*  It will continue to look for planets with atmospheres that might support life. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=746.0s)]
*  On the other end of the time scale, astrophysicist Erica Nelson of the University of Colorado Boulder [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=752.0s)]
*  thinks her team may have made a discovery that she says would break the theory of how the early universe formed. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=759.0s)]
*  Either this is wrong or this is a huge discovery. And we think that it's a huge discovery. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=769.0s)]
*  More observations are needed, but Nelson is investigating what may be five giant galaxies [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=778.0s)]
*  that appear to have formed much too quickly after the Big Bang. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=785.0s)]
*  If they're confirmed, astronomy may have to revise the timeline of galaxy formation. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=790.0s)]
*  And that's the most exciting piece of this, of this telescope, of this remarkable instrument we put in space, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=797.0s)]
*  is finding things that we didn't expect, that we can't explain, because that means that we have to revise our understanding of the universe. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=804.0s)]
*  Brant Robertson, who showed us the earliest galaxy found so far by the James Webb Telescope, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=813.0s)]
*  told us the record for the earliest will not hold long. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=820.0s)]
*  How far back can you go to the origins of the universe? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=824.0s)]
*  Well, JWST is so phenomenal that if you spend enough time, you could probably find any galaxy that ever formed in the universe. It's really that powerful. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=828.0s)]
*  Will the history of astronomy be divided between before Webb and after Webb? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=837.0s)]
*  Yes, I believe it will be. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=842.0s)]
*  Matt Mountain, who manages Webb Operations, told us the observatory may last up to 25 years, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=845.0s)]
*  perhaps long enough to comprehend space and time and the origins of life. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=852.0s)]
*  We're seeing a universe we've never seen before. We thought it was there, we hoped it was there, but now we see it for the first time. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=860.0s)]
*  In the days of the Roman Colosseum, they called it bread and circuses, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=870.0s)]
*  leaders using the superficial appeal of entertainment to distract citizens from genuine problems. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=882.0s)]
*  The term today, sportswashing, the use of games and teams and stadiums to cleanse an image and launder a reputation. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=888.0s)]
*  A country that has never won an Olympic gold medal, Saudi Arabia has suddenly emerged as a major player in global sport, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=896.0s)]
*  hosting events, buying teams and luring athletes with staggering contracts. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=903.0s)]
*  Is this investment an attempt to diversify the economy and cater to younger citizens, as its leaders claim, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=908.0s)]
*  or is it done to paper over human rights abuses, authoritarian rule and even murder? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=914.0s)]
*  We visited the kingdom to check out the sports world's new nerve center, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=920.0s)]
*  and check out what the Saudis and their neighbors are getting for their money. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=924.0s)]
*  Argentina, champions of the world's greatest game. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=928.0s)]
*  Argentina may have claimed the World Cup last December, but it wasn't the only country to emerge as a big winner. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=935.0s)]
*  A controversial choice to host, the oil-rich Gulf state of Qatar threw more than $200 billion into staging the event [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=942.0s)]
*  and dribbled past criticism over its appalling human rights record. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=950.0s)]
*  And another winner was next door. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=955.0s)]
*  Saudi Arabia fielded the one team that beat Argentina, a triumph celebrated around the Arab world, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=959.0s)]
*  not least by Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud, the country's minister of sport. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=968.0s)]
*  It was unbelievable. It was just a milestone that we ticked that shows that if you put the effort and the right resources behind it, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=974.0s)]
*  you can achieve impossible things. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=982.0s)]
*  The improbable continued after the World Cup. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=985.0s)]
*  Saudi Arabia's enormous resources, that is sloshing oil money, enticed Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=988.0s)]
*  a generational star, to play for a team in Riyadh. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=995.0s)]
*  His salary? More than $200 million a season. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=999.0s)]
*  That's right, 200 million. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1003.0s)]
*  Roughly the annual playing wages of LeBron James, Steph Curry, Aaron Judge and Patrick Mahomes combined. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1006.0s)]
*  Such a con composed for a... [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1014.0s)]
*  The opening bell for Saudi Arabia's investment in global sports sounded three years ago [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1016.0s)]
*  with the clash on the dunes, a heavyweight title fight. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1021.0s)]
*  A few months later, the kingdom staged the world's richest horse race. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1025.0s)]
*  A huge shock, but they love it here in Saudi Arabia. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1029.0s)]
*  There's Formula One racing and a 10-year deal with the WWE. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1033.0s)]
*  But to many, these mega events in Saudi Arabia are financial loss leaders [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1042.0s)]
*  being used to launder the image of a country while cloaking repression and authoritarian rule. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1047.0s)]
*  You've heard the term sports washing, this idea that countries can cover up bad acts through sports. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1054.0s)]
*  Do you believe in the concept that a country can use sports this way? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1060.0s)]
*  Not at all. I don't agree with that term because I think that if you go to different parts of the world, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1063.0s)]
*  then you bring people together. Everyone should come, see Saudi Arabia, see it for what it is, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1069.0s)]
*  and then make your decision. See it for yourself. If you don't like it, fine. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1074.0s)]
*  Which is precisely why we came to Saudi Arabia late last year, to see this unlikely sports hub for ourselves. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1079.0s)]
*  December is the off season for pro tennis, yet Riyadh was the site of an exhibition, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1086.0s)]
*  studded with top 10 stars and embroidered with local touches. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1092.0s)]
*  Falcons enlisted to help with the draw ceremony. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1096.0s)]
*  But the real draw? Australia's Nikirios was blunt. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1100.0s)]
*  What brought you here at the end? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1104.0s)]
*  Well, money's pretty good. I'm not going to lie. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1106.0s)]
*  Despite deserts of empty seats, and little in the way of television rights, usually the lifeblood for sports, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1111.0s)]
*  the players were paid millions just to show up. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1117.0s)]
*  Magnificent! [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1120.0s)]
*  And Taylor Fritz, a Californian, earned a million dollars in prize money for winning the weekend event. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1122.0s)]
*  The Saudis aren't just hosting events. Through the Kingdom's Sovereign Wealth Fund, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1130.0s)]
*  they bought an English Premier League soccer team, Newcastle United. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1140.0s)]
*  We saw them for a visiting game against the local team, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1144.0s)]
*  pointedly abandoning their usual striped kits for the green of the Saudi flag. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1147.0s)]
*  Then there is, to date, Saudi's biggest swing in sports, the $2.5 billion live tour. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1153.0s)]
*  Which has divided golf. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1159.0s)]
*  Dismissing this rival to the PGA Tour as, quote, an endless pit of money, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1161.0s)]
*  Tiger Woods turned down $800 million from the Saudis to join live. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1166.0s)]
*  Many other top players, including Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson, did switch their tour allegiances. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1171.0s)]
*  Both paid as they were north of $100 million. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1177.0s)]
*  This flood of Saudi money into sports is just absolutely, it's a disruptor. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1181.0s)]
*  It's completely changing the face of sports. Is that the intention? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1188.0s)]
*  Not at all. It adds a lot to the sport. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1191.0s)]
*  You have to realize the impact this has. When winners of live golf events are making multiple times [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1194.0s)]
*  what Tiger Woods won the last time he won the Masters, that's a big economic change. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1199.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter, I think, if the impact of increasing the participation of sports [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1204.0s)]
*  and the interest in that sport is growing, then why not? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1208.0s)]
*  The sports minister insists that the massive investment is an essential pillar of what is called Vision 2030, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1213.0s)]
*  a $7 trillion plan by the kingdom's effective ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1220.0s)]
*  to diversify the economy beyond oil while softening some of its most restrictive social conventions and laws. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1227.0s)]
*  It's now permitted for women to drive, uncover their head, hold a passport and travel without a male guardian. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1234.0s)]
*  On the country's fields and in gyms and rec centers, young Saudis, male and female, are embracing sport. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1241.0s)]
*  So are their moms. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1248.0s)]
*  Rasha El-Khames is the country's first female certified boxing coach. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1250.0s)]
*  Back in 2019, she attended the Clash on the Dunes fight. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1255.0s)]
*  This is your country, these are two international superstars and you're not watching them on TV, you're watching them live here. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1259.0s)]
*  What was that like? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1265.0s)]
*  I would never imagine that me going to the fight, driving my car and attending the fight in my own country. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1266.0s)]
*  So that's a massive transformation and you can feel that the change is tangible. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1273.0s)]
*  Yet these changes come at a cost. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1280.0s)]
*  Lujain El-Hafloul led the Saudi Women to Drive movement and was punished for her activism, arrested, charged with terrorism [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1283.0s)]
*  and sentenced to prison where she says she was tortured. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1292.0s)]
*  Even after her release, she is prevented from leaving the country. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1296.0s)]
*  Her sister Lina lives in exile and spoke with us remotely. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1300.0s)]
*  When we talk about sports, of course we do want to have entertainment in Saudi Arabia. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1304.0s)]
*  We do want to have this, but not at the expense of our freedoms. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1309.0s)]
*  We don't want to be living in fear and not knowing if tomorrow they will break into our house and take our sister, our daughter. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1313.0s)]
*  I do not want to live in this country. I want to live in a country where I feel free, truly. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1321.0s)]
*  Even if they have fancy sporting events? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1326.0s)]
*  I want both. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1328.0s)]
*  Her sister's harsh treatment, she says, underscores a stark paradox. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1330.0s)]
*  At a time when social freedoms have expanded, political repression in Saudi Arabia has become more severe. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1335.0s)]
*  You're saying this is window dressing, this is cosmetic, and behind the games there's mass executions and repression like never before. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1342.0s)]
*  Absolutely, exactly. This is what's happening. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1350.0s)]
*  The cultural shift goes beyond sports. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1353.0s)]
*  Who would have pegged Saudi Arabia to start hosting an annual desert rave? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1356.0s)]
*  Bruno Mars and DJ Khaled were among the headliners. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1361.0s)]
*  It's all of a piece. Sports, entertainment, tourism. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1365.0s)]
*  To marry it all, the crown prince turned to American impresario Jerry Enzerillo. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1369.0s)]
*  What's a guy from Brooklyn doing in a place like this? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1374.0s)]
*  Creating magic, making a place welcoming for everybody to come see the kingdom, the birthplace of the kingdom. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1377.0s)]
*  Very exciting times. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1384.0s)]
*  Salam alaikum. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1386.0s)]
*  In his career in hospitality and entertainment, Enzerillo launched Atlantis in the Bahamas. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1388.0s)]
*  Name a global celebrity and be assured, Jerry has made their acquaintance. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1393.0s)]
*  I've done five decades in tourism. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1398.0s)]
*  My job is to welcome people and to create joy and festivity. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1401.0s)]
*  With Vision 2030 now, we want people to come to Saudi. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1405.0s)]
*  Today he oversees a massive $63 billion development on the site where the Saudi state was born, converting it into a modern Xanadu with homes for 100,000 people, luxury hotels and restaurants. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1409.0s)]
*  We asked Enzerillo about his comfort level representing this autocracy. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1423.0s)]
*  He told us he focuses on the positive. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1427.0s)]
*  You know, I went to school in Las Vegas and there's a gambling term that when you're way ahead, you're playing Witt House Money. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1430.0s)]
*  You're winning? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1437.0s)]
*  Not only am I winning, I've won. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1438.0s)]
*  You know, there's an old country western song, Dance with the One in Brungia. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1441.0s)]
*  Who Brungia? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1445.0s)]
*  Who Brung me here? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1446.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1447.0s)]
*  Vision 2030, a very benevolent, very love king and a very visionary, dynamic Crown Prince. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1448.0s)]
*  But it's the less noble doings of the Crown Prince that have stained the country's reputation, both accelerating and complicating its foray into sports. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1455.0s)]
*  A CIA report said MBS approved the 2018 assassination and dismembering of Washington Post journalist Jamel Khashoggi. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1464.0s)]
*  Under MBS's rule, executions have drastically increased, including a mass beheading of 81 people in one day last March. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1473.0s)]
*  The mildest criticism of the state, even on Twitter, has been met with detention, torture and long and arbitrary prison sentences. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1481.0s)]
*  We've heard a lot about transition. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1490.0s)]
*  We've seen it with our own eyes. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1492.0s)]
*  But the concern is that this country right now is still not fit to hold international sporting events. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1494.0s)]
*  We're not saying that we're perfect. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1498.0s)]
*  But what I'm trying to say is that these things help us to achieve a better future for our population. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1499.0s)]
*  I think no country would say they're perfect. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1505.0s)]
*  But are you saying that every country has a leader that, according to the CIA, has ordered the murder of a journalist? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1508.0s)]
*  Are you saying that every country has 81 beheadings in a single day? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1515.0s)]
*  And if the answer is no, doesn't it make this relative argument, this what about-ism, doesn't it make that irrelevant? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1519.0s)]
*  Well, what I'm trying to say is that let's look at the good side about this. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1525.0s)]
*  And you know, you're just been pointing certain topics that if we had the mass shooting a couple of weeks ago in the US, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1529.0s)]
*  does that mean that we don't host the World Cup in the US? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1536.0s)]
*  No, we should go to the US. We should get people together. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1539.0s)]
*  Mass shooting is not a government actor. Let's be clear about that. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1541.0s)]
*  Still, whatever, people died. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1544.0s)]
*  But what I'm trying to say is that if we look at only the bad side, then we shouldn't do anything. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1546.0s)]
*  Are there not universal rights? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1551.0s)]
*  Are there not basic thresholds you think need to be met? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1553.0s)]
*  As I said, there's a lot of issues with a lot of countries. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1558.0s)]
*  But then you mentioned that the order came from the Crown Prince. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1561.0s)]
*  That's not true. There's no proof of that as we speak. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1564.0s)]
*  You're denying that the CIA's report that says this was ordered and approved. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1567.0s)]
*  I don't think the CIA report actually says that if you look at it. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1571.0s)]
*  The CIA report concluded Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1575.0s)]
*  approved an operation to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1580.0s)]
*  Finally, they collide. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1586.0s)]
*  Still, the games go on. So do the choices. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1588.0s)]
*  Just last month, FIFA, soccer's governing body not known for occupying ethical high ground, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1591.0s)]
*  responded to protests from players and turned down Saudi tourism sponsorship offer [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1597.0s)]
*  for this summer's Women's World Cup. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1603.0s)]
*  These moral dilemmas will only intensify. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1605.0s)]
*  When we were in Saudi Arabia, we saw a top-level tennis event, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1609.0s)]
*  a top-level golf event had just been held, Bruno Mars had given a concert. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1612.0s)]
*  What would your message be to the athletes and entertainers who are coming in to perform and compete? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1617.0s)]
*  My message is that why would you go to Saudi Arabia and stay silent on what is going on on the ground? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1623.0s)]
*  Why won't you speak on behalf of the prisoners who have been muzzled [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1630.0s)]
*  and all the families that cannot speak? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1634.0s)]
*  Because when you go to Saudi Arabia, you are part of discovering up machine. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1636.0s)]
*  What do you think the purpose is of throwing around billions and billions of dollars into sports like this? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1642.0s)]
*  I think the Saudi government, the Saudi regime and MBS, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1647.0s)]
*  he wants people to think of Ronaldo when they think about Saudi and not about Khashoggi. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1651.0s)]
*  That's become the association now. We've gone from the murder journalist to the star soccer player. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1656.0s)]
*  Absolutely, unfortunately. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1661.0s)]
*  Almost exactly four years ago, the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris caught fire. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1674.0s)]
*  It was one of those 21st century moments that people around the world experienced together, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1680.0s)]
*  staring in horror at live video on their smartphones and televisions. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1686.0s)]
*  For the people of France, it was especially traumatic, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1691.0s)]
*  because Notre Dame has been a powerful symbol, both sacred and secular, since medieval times. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1694.0s)]
*  French president Emmanuel Macron pledged that Notre Dame would be reopened by the end of 2024. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1701.0s)]
*  He couldn't have known then how hard it would be to keep that promise. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1708.0s)]
*  But on this Easter Sunday, four years later, the resurrection of the great cathedral seems within reach. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1712.0s)]
*  Flames tore through the roof of Notre Dame on the evening of April 15th, 2019 [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1723.0s)]
*  and spread with incredible speed and ferocity, engulfing her 200-foot spire. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1731.0s)]
*  Jean-Louis Jorgelin is the man now in charge of restoring Notre Dame. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1739.0s)]
*  Only a heroic effort by the Paris Fire Brigade saved Notre Dame from collapse, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1760.0s)]
*  as a few staffers raced through falling embers to rescue precious relics. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1765.0s)]
*  Philippe Villeneuve, the cathedral's chief architect, was out of town that night and raced back to Paris. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1772.0s)]
*  He was devastated by what he saw. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1778.0s)]
*  I've said that the little boy who was in love with the cathedral and the architect who was in charge of it died that day. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1782.0s)]
*  And another man took over and said, I have to save the cathedral. It's my mission. It's my duty. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1790.0s)]
*  Villeneuve now shares that duty. If he's the artist who knows every inch of stone in Notre Dame, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1798.0s)]
*  retired army general Jorgelin is the commander, called back to meet that five-year deadline. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1805.0s)]
*  I will relax only when this will be done. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1811.0s)]
*  What does this cathedral mean to the people of France? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1815.0s)]
*  The cathedral, Notre Dame de Paris, is in some way the heart of France. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1820.0s)]
*  For the Catholic, of course, for the Christian, but for everybody. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1825.0s)]
*  All the great events of France in some way or another took place here in the cathedral. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1829.0s)]
*  Napoleon crowned himself emperor in Notre Dame in 1804. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1835.0s)]
*  In 1944, as Paris was liberated from Nazi occupation, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1840.0s)]
*  General Charles de Gaulle braved sniper fire to enter the cathedral. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1845.0s)]
*  In many ways you could say that she's the people's palace. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1852.0s)]
*  Agnès Prarier is a journalist and author who lives and works just across the river Seine from Notre Dame. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1856.0s)]
*  She and her neighbors watched the most horrifying moment the night of the fire, the collapse of that imposing spire. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1863.0s)]
*  I remember the scream of the crowd saying no, as if they couldn't, they couldn't conceive such a thing. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1871.0s)]
*  That spire meant so much to Philippe Villeneuve that he had it tattooed on his arm. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1881.0s)]
*  They say that I have Notre Dame in my skin, he told us. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1887.0s)]
*  It's very practical because when I have to explain how the spire fell, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1893.0s)]
*  it's always better to show that from here to there it tipped over. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1899.0s)]
*  The huge spire made of oak and covered in lead tiles crashed through two of the stone vaults which formed the ceiling of Notre Dame, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1905.0s)]
*  leaving gaping holes at the top and heaps of broken stone and charred wood on the floor below. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1914.0s)]
*  The top priority was to shore up the grand cathedral's walls. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1921.0s)]
*  The grand cathedral's weakened structure. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1927.0s)]
*  Huge temporary wooden supports were placed under the surviving stone vaults of her ceiling [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1930.0s)]
*  and under the flying buttresses to save this prime example of medieval engineering. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1936.0s)]
*  We have to check every stone in the cathedral, every pillar. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1942.0s)]
*  At the same time, a huge decontamination project was mounted to remove lead tiles that had melted from the burning roof and spire [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1947.0s)]
*  and all the toxic lead dust spread by the fire. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1955.0s)]
*  Four years on, workers still take extraordinary precautions against lead poisoning. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1959.0s)]
*  We had to wear disposable hazmat suits to enter the cathedral. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1965.0s)]
*  Tons of rubble had to be removed. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1969.0s)]
*  Paintings and stained glass windows were taken away for restoration. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1972.0s)]
*  And twisted steel scaffolding erected for ongoing restoration work had to be dismantled. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1976.0s)]
*  So you were in the process of restoring the spire when the fire broke out in 2019. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1983.0s)]
*  Did your restoration project have anything to do with the fire breaking out? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1989.0s)]
*  An investigation is still underway, Philippe Villeneuve told us, and no cause of the fire has been identified. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=1998.0s)]
*  But personally, it's unbearable. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2005.0s)]
*  This fire never should have happened, and it did. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2008.0s)]
*  Inevitably, I feel responsible. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2011.0s)]
*  At that point in our interview, Villeneuve switched to English with a rueful smile. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2014.0s)]
*  In reality, I'm totally destroyed. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2021.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2026.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2029.0s)]
*  I so want to rebuild Notre Dame, it's because I want to rebuild myself. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2030.0s)]
*  The fire's deeply emotional impact on Philippe Villeneuve was mirrored around the world. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2037.0s)]
*  Nearly a billion dollars in private donations have been pledged to rebuild Notre Dame, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2045.0s)]
*  most of it from France, 50 million dollars from Americans. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2051.0s)]
*  I know many people in the United States contributed. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2056.0s)]
*  They can contribute again. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2059.0s)]
*  They can continue to contribute. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2061.0s)]
*  Cash is always running. If I want, give me money, I need. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2063.0s)]
*  In the weeks immediately following the fire, all sorts of ideas were floated [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2066.0s)]
*  for how centuries-old Notre Dame might be given a touch of avant-garde. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2071.0s)]
*  And all those architects throughout the world said, yes, let's have a roof garden, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2077.0s)]
*  let's have a golden torch, let's have a titanium spire. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2081.0s)]
*  Even I, for 20 seconds, I thought, hmm, to add some 21st century genius to Notre Dame, why not? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2086.0s)]
*  Chief architect Philippe Villeneuve had a very simple answer, why not? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2094.0s)]
*  An historic monument, a cathedral, is not something to be played with, he told us. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2102.0s)]
*  Notre Dame had been standing for 850 years with a wooden frame and a lead roof. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2107.0s)]
*  So wood is the way to go. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2113.0s)]
*  In the end, President Macron and a special committee agreed to rebuild Notre Dame [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2116.0s)]
*  exactly as she had been, and with the same materials, stone, wood and lead. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2122.0s)]
*  How is it that the traditionalists won out? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2129.0s)]
*  Well, I think wisdom won. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2133.0s)]
*  Notre Dame's signature spire was a fairly recent addition. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2137.0s)]
*  Images of the cathedral from the mid-1800s show her without a spire and in an advanced state of decay. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2141.0s)]
*  The cathedral was in great disrepair, was it not? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2148.0s)]
*  It was about to collapse, but of neglect, not of fire. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2152.0s)]
*  There were even proposals to demolish Notre Dame before the cathedral crumbled on its own. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2157.0s)]
*  Instead, the French government hired a young architect named Violette Le Duc. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2162.0s)]
*  He created that famous spire. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2168.0s)]
*  So you are rebuilding the spire exactly as Violette Le Duc? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2171.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2175.0s)]
*  Are you using his original drawings? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2176.0s)]
*  We were lucky, he said, because it was extremely well documented. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2179.0s)]
*  We have the drawings of Violette Le Duc, the sketches, the surveys. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2184.0s)]
*  We have everything needed to be able to remake it. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2189.0s)]
*  A thousand French oak trees were felled for the new spire, then fine-cut by carpenters in eastern France. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2194.0s)]
*  In other workshops around the country, the cathedral's organ, the largest in France, and many of its stained glass windows were restored. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2203.0s)]
*  How many workers and craftsmen do you have on this project? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2212.0s)]
*  If we take into account all the people in France, it's about 1,000 people. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2215.0s)]
*  On the plaza in front of Notre Dame, a huge tent has been erected where stonecutters and sculptors are recreating Gothic gargoyles and adornments damaged in the fire. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2222.0s)]
*  Philippe Villeneuve supervises every detail. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2236.0s)]
*  I'll make them put their fingers on the layers of the original sculpture, he said, and then on the layer they are sculpting. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2243.0s)]
*  So he wants you to feel it, not just look at it. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2251.0s)]
*  And that works? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2256.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2258.0s)]
*  Dane LeBlanc is just 23 years old, sculpting and chiseling to recreate a floral detail carved hundreds of years ago. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2260.0s)]
*  We try to remake things identically, she said, but we are also trying to understand the intention of the original sculptors, so we look at the traces left by their tools. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2270.0s)]
*  We were given rare access to the painstaking restoration of Notre Dame as workers and artisans revived the cathedral's exterior and her interior. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2284.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2297.0s)]
*  The cathedral's great rose windows have been meticulously cleaned. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2299.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2303.0s)]
*  And every inch of stone coated with latex, which, when peeled away, leaves the surface gleaming. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2306.0s)]
*  We found restorers, Mathilde Maire and Aude Massimi, working on painted stone sculptures depicting scenes from the life of Christ. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2315.0s)]
*  How old is this? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2325.0s)]
*  This part of the cathedral, she said, was built at the beginning of the 14th century. These sculptures are medieval. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2331.0s)]
*  The restorers are carefully wiping every surface with small cotton swabs dipped in a water-based cleaning solution. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2339.0s)]
*  So I think you have to have a lot of patience. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2347.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2351.0s)]
*  Yes, she says, you have to be calm and know that it will take time, but it's a pleasure. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2353.0s)]
*  You can see she's wiping away the centuries. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2360.0s)]
*  A 600-ton maze of scaffolding has been built inside Notre Dame to support all the work, especially the rebuilding of the spire. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2364.0s)]
*  General Georges Land took us up through it, two-thirds of the way on a construction elevator. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2373.0s)]
*  We reached the top climbing steps and ladders. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2378.0s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2382.0s)]
*  We were standing 100 feet above the cathedral floor in exactly the spot where the flaming spire collapsed. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2384.0s)]
*  Four years ago, there was nothing here but a vast hole. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2392.0s)]
*  The drama took place here, and we have to rebuild the vault of the transept. The spire will be there. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2396.0s)]
*  66 meters high. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2402.0s)]
*  At the top of the old 200-foot spire sat a copper sculpture of a rooster, the symbol of the French people. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2405.0s)]
*  The day after the fire, Philippe Villeneuve found it on a lower roof, a bit mangled but miraculously untouched by the flames. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2413.0s)]
*  It has been left as it was found and will be put on display in the restored cathedral. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2422.0s)]
*  Can I tell you, Villeneuve says, that I plan to put a new rooster on top of a new spire one year to the day before the reopening of the cathedral. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2427.0s)]
*  There will still be scaffolding, but the frame of the spire will again be in the sky of Paris. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2437.0s)]
*  And the spire will rest on these four pillars, you see here. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2444.0s)]
*  It will be magnificent. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2448.0s)]
*  Magnificent, yes, for the glory of God and France. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2449.0s)]
*  Now, the last minute of 60 minutes. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2478.0s)]
*  Preparing tonight's story, we were reminded of the role Notre Dame, a soaring prayer in stone, has played in the life of Paris and all of France. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2482.0s)]
*  Our own houses of prayer are as often prayers in brick or wood as of granite or limestone, but they are every bit as vital to their communities. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2492.0s)]
*  Houses of prayer are often houses of refuge for the hungry, houses of hospitality for the addicted, the alcoholic and the abused. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2501.0s)]
*  In small towns and big cities, in immigrant communities and among people in spiritual need, our churches and synagogues, our mosques and temples, grand or simple, are our own Notre Dames. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2510.0s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2521.0s)]
*  We'll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2522.0s)]
*  Happy Easter, a joyous Passover and a peaceful Orthodox Holy Week. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNbS56I8a0&t=2526.0s)]
