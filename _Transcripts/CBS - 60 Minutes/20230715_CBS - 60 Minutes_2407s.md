# The King of CrossFit; Wingsuit Flying; Saddle Bronc Riding | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [July 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk)
*  There are more gyms in America than ever before, but we're more overweight than we've ever [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=0.0s)]
*  been. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=18.04s)]
*  Lots of people have theories as to why, but we're about to introduce you to a man who [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=19.04s)]
*  says he's figured it out. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=23.44s)]
*  Greg Glassman is the unlikely creator of the biggest fitness phenomenon in the world right [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=25.88s)]
*  now called CrossFit. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  It's a workout program that's unpredictable, uncompromising and raw, a lot like the man [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=32.96s)]
*  who created it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=38.76s)]
*  Glassman likes to say he runs CrossFit more like a biker gang than a business, but business [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=40.36s)]
*  is booming. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=45.86s)]
*  In just 15 years, the king of CrossFit has created the largest gym chain in history and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=47.36s)]
*  turned fitness into a spectator sport. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=53.04s)]
*  Last summer, the finals of the CrossFit Games were broadcast on ESPN. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  45,000 people showed up to watch contestants who look like superheroes heave, jump and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=64.12s)]
*  lift until a champion was crowned. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  If this is the body that defines a new kind of fitness, the brain that dreamt it all up [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=75.16000000000001s)]
*  belongs to Greg Glassman. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=85.76s)]
*  Well before CrossFit was a competition, he designed it as a new way to work out. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=89.12s)]
*  He says it can transform anyone, and he's not just talking about bulging biceps and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=95.44s)]
*  six-pack abs. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=100.7s)]
*  I'll deliver you to your genetic potential. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=102.28s)]
*  Your genetic potential. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=104.72s)]
*  Yeah, how do you like that? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=105.72s)]
*  It sounds like you're creating a robot or something. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=106.72s)]
*  Look at her. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=108.08s)]
*  She was meant to look like that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=109.2s)]
*  That's what nature would have carved from her a million years ago, or she'd have been [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=111.72s)]
*  eaten. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  Greg Glassman hardly looks like an exercise guru. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=119.64s)]
*  There's no hint of ripped muscle underneath his untouched shirt, but he is widely considered [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=123.28s)]
*  the most powerful man in fitness today. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=128.56s)]
*  Glassman is the architect of CrossFit, a workout program that mixes elements of weightlifting, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=133.0s)]
*  calisthenics and gymnastics. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=139.08s)]
*  The classes take place in what CrossFitters call a box, a stripped down, willfully ugly [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=142.8s)]
*  space. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  The exercises range from simple to sadistic, and made Greg Glassman, a college dropout, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=152.48s)]
*  a multimillionaire. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  You know, you didn't invent weightlifting. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  You didn't invent calisthenics. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=164.44s)]
*  You didn't invent gymnastics. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  So what did you do? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=167.48s)]
*  I invented that doing lateral raises and curls while eating pretzels is dumb. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=168.48s)]
*  That's what I invented. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  He says for decades gym owners have ignored the importance of diet and been all too happy [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=173.28s)]
*  to watch their members fall into a trance on the treadmill. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=178.82s)]
*  Do you think people think they're getting a workout and aren't getting a workout? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=182.36s)]
*  Well, I mean, look, you get sweaty and you come home tired. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  I couldn't appreciate that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=189.72000000000003s)]
*  But many people are much closer to doing nothing than they perhaps realize. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=191.68s)]
*  Is everything up till now been wrong in the fitness industry? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=202.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=203.0s)]
*  As far as I can see. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=204.0s)]
*  CrossFit classes usually don't take more than an hour. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=209.32s)]
*  Athletes compete against each other and the clock. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=214.48s)]
*  To keep their energy up, they're encouraged to follow something called a paleo diet, heavy [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=218.76s)]
*  on meat and vegetables. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  Food fit for a caveman. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=225.4s)]
*  I have heard you say that CrossFit prepares athletes for quote the unknown and the unforeseen. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=227.56s)]
*  It sounds like you're getting ready to go to war. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=233.72s)]
*  Yeah, why not? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=236.12s)]
*  Yeah, for getting ready for war, getting ready for earthquake, getting ready for mugging, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=237.28s)]
*  getting ready for the horrible news that you have leukemia. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=241.68s)]
*  What awaits us all is challenge, that's for sure. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=245.76s)]
*  CrossFit, he says, is creating a new super breed. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=250.08s)]
*  And although some of their athletes appear to be carved out of marble, he says the focus [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=256.24s)]
*  isn't big muscles. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=260.88s)]
*  It's simple, functional movements like squatting and lifting, whether you're 25 or 75. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=262.8s)]
*  Would I use deadlifts in both cases? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=269.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=271.2s)]
*  Squatting in both cases? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=272.2s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=273.2s)]
*  Do you have a 75 year old doing deadlifts? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=274.2s)]
*  Uh huh. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=275.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=276.68s)]
*  To say no is to say that if you drop your pen on the ground, you're not going to pick [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=277.68s)]
*  it up. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=279.64s)]
*  It's a deadlift. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=280.64s)]
*  It's picking something off the ground. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=281.64s)]
*  It does not require a physician's okay. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=282.76s)]
*  If your physician doesn't think you should deadlift, you need to get a new doctor is [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  what you need. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  Glassman started to teach people to lift, jump and sprint long before CrossFit became [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=290.32s)]
*  a household name. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=295.92s)]
*  He had polio as a child and used gymnastics to regain his strength. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=297.4s)]
*  In high school, a bad dismount left him with a permanent limp. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=302.28s)]
*  He became a personal trainer and started experimenting with some of the exercises that would become [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=306.26s)]
*  the backbone of his creation. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=311.96s)]
*  These workouts were loud, disruptive and gym owners were not impressed. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=314.48s)]
*  How many gyms did you get tossed out of? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=321.24s)]
*  About five or six. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=323.12s)]
*  Five or six. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=324.12s)]
*  Seven. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=325.12s)]
*  You don't like being told what to do? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=326.12s)]
*  Oh, I don't mind being told what to do. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=327.12s)]
*  I just won't do it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=330.12s)]
*  Just say anything you want. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=331.12s)]
*  He opened his own gym in Santa Cruz in 2001. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=333.92s)]
*  Today there are 12,000 CrossFit boxes around the world. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=337.76s)]
*  Each one defiantly barren. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=342.38s)]
*  The company is private but estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=345.1s)]
*  Greg Glassman owns 100% of it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=350.5s)]
*  He has no board of directors and says he never had a business plan. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=353.14s)]
*  This is awesome. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=357.54s)]
*  Can I have a picture of this? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=358.54s)]
*  I would love that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=359.54s)]
*  But recently found himself at Harvard Business School. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=360.54s)]
*  If you like metrics, you like money, we're the fastest growing large chain on earth. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=363.34s)]
*  We have broken all records. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=367.46s)]
*  Here he was invited to share the secrets behind CrossFit's meteoric growth. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=368.94s)]
*  I'm not trying to grow a business. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=373.14s)]
*  I'm doing the right things for the right people for the right reasons. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=374.66s)]
*  One reason CrossFit's grown so fast is because just about anyone who wants to open a box [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=379.02s)]
*  can after paying a $3,000 yearly fee and passing a two-day seminar. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=384.26s)]
*  It's how the company makes most of its money. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=390.46s)]
*  Two days to take a course then I can open a gym? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=393.42s)]
*  Amazing, huh? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=396.86s)]
*  To me, is that enough? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=398.46s)]
*  Well here was the alternative. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=400.21999999999997s)]
*  Here's what it used to be. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=401.21999999999997s)]
*  All you had to have was the money and you don't even have to take a test. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=402.21999999999997s)]
*  That's where every other chain came from. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=408.09999999999997s)]
*  Someone just launched them. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=409.7s)]
*  And unlike most gym chains, Glassman, a diehard libertarian, relinquishes nearly all control [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=411.14s)]
*  over his affiliates. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=417.58s)]
*  They can open a box next door to another box if they want. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=419.17999999999995s)]
*  It's probably not surprising. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=423.17999999999995s)]
*  Glassman believes the strongest one will survive. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=424.46s)]
*  You don't have an iron fist on them on how they do this. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=428.1s)]
*  Nope, it's not a franchise. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=430.18s)]
*  They can do it any way they want to do it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=431.18s)]
*  This isn't Kentucky Fried Chicken or yeah, it's CrossFit. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=432.18s)]
*  You let them do what they want to do. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=436.38s)]
*  I do. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=437.94s)]
*  Although he occasionally fires up the company plane, grabs the family dog and drops in on [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=440.18s)]
*  an affiliate unannounced. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=445.62s)]
*  So you're not going in there looking for trouble? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=447.42s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=452.06s)]
*  But I saw someone pulling with their arms or a rounded back. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=453.06s)]
*  I think it's inevitable that I would say something. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=456.3s)]
*  At the company's media office in the Silicon Valley, they publish a different workout of [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=459.42s)]
*  the day every day and more information about CrossFit than you could read in a lifetime. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=464.22s)]
*  And what is it cost for people to access the stuff that you're putting on? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=469.82s)]
*  There is no cost. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=473.98s)]
*  How does that make sense? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=475.42s)]
*  Yeah, it didn't until we did it, you know, and the more video we give away, the more [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=477.42s)]
*  money we make. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=482.64s)]
*  CrossFitters created a huge virtual community, posting videos of workouts and wipeouts and [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=484.94s)]
*  spreading Glassman's gospel around the world in Africa, Siberia and on the front lines [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=494.3s)]
*  of Afghanistan and Iraq. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=500.21999999999997s)]
*  Whether soldiers or soccer moms, the evangelical enthusiasm of Glassman's disciples has led [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=503.18s)]
*  to criticism. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=510.53999999999996s)]
*  When you hear people describe CrossFit as a cult, what do you say? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=511.86s)]
*  I don't mind that. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=515.3000000000001s)]
*  What if someone led a cult and they didn't know they were? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=516.3000000000001s)]
*  I mean, that would be messed up, right? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=518.5s)]
*  So I started trying to think what makes us a cult or what would define a cult. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=521.0600000000001s)]
*  One is recruiting, and I ain't recruiting anybody. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=525.1800000000001s)]
*  I don't, you know, you got, people call me up, hey, I was thinking about joining CrossFit. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=527.7s)]
*  Well, then call back when you've decided to, you know. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=531.74s)]
*  So the doors are open, you're not recruiting? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=534.26s)]
*  We're not recruiting, we're not barring the doors. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=536.02s)]
*  I mean, it really is an open house. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=537.86s)]
*  Glassman says he spends most of his time defending the CrossFit brand with an iron fist. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=540.14s)]
*  If you don't defend it, you won't have a brand for long. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=545.66s)]
*  We are in shark-infested waters and I've got shark repellent attorneys. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=548.1999999999999s)]
*  How many attorneys do you have working for you now? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=553.98s)]
*  Dozens. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=556.18s)]
*  They're everywhere. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=557.18s)]
*  They're everywhere, like freaking leprechauns. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=558.18s)]
*  The most exercised muscle at CrossFit may be this man, their general counsel. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=561.42s)]
*  He oversees a legal staff of 12, but Glassman has hired another 80, eight-zero outside law [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=566.7s)]
*  firms to defend its reputation and its trademark. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=573.34s)]
*  They've gone after a company selling bogus CrossFit branded jump ropes, taken on gyms [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=577.5400000000001s)]
*  in Puerto Rico and Germany, who use their name without permission, and are suing the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=582.24s)]
*  publishers of a study that allegedly contained made-up information about CrossFit's safety record. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=587.1s)]
*  I love my lawyers. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=593.5400000000001s)]
*  I love my lawyers. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=594.74s)]
*  Very few people say that. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=596.06s)]
*  I know. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=597.06s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=598.06s)]
*  So how many lawsuits have you been involved in? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=599.06s)]
*  30 or 40? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=601.5s)]
*  More? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=602.6999999999999s)]
*  50? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=603.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=604.6999999999999s)]
*  Have you lost any? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=605.6999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=606.6999999999999s)]
*  I won every single one of them. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=607.6999999999999s)]
*  You like the fight? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=608.6999999999999s)]
*  I do. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=609.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=610.6999999999999s)]
*  His most tenacious fight revolves around headlines that CrossFit could be dangerous, or worse, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=611.6999999999999s)]
*  deadly. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=617.0999999999999s)]
*  Some journalists have questioned how the regimen might be bad for one's back, shoulders, or [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=618.0999999999999s)]
*  even kidneys. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=622.4599999999999s)]
*  Because it's such a new phenomenon, there aren't many studies about the overall safety [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=625.06s)]
*  of CrossFit. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=629.06s)]
*  The few that exist found it to be about as safe as gymnastics or weightlifting and less [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  likely to cause an injury than running. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=635.3599999999999s)]
*  Greg Glassman is so sure it's safe, the father of six allowed his future seventh child to [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=637.9399999999999s)]
*  be part of this class. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=643.9s)]
*  So that person who's sitting in their living room saying this all sounds interesting, but [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=645.26s)]
*  I've heard things and I don't want to get hurt. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=649.54s)]
*  Stay in your chair where you're sure to get hurt and you'll become one of the 300,000 [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=652.74s)]
*  people that will die next year from sitting in their chair doing nothing. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=657.1s)]
*  Another reason Glassman's been so good at getting people out of their chairs is the [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=663.42s)]
*  success of the CrossFit Games. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=667.34s)]
*  This year, 273,000 people around the world competed for a chance to be featured in the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=671.02s)]
*  finals. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=677.42s)]
*  It is a spectacle. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=681.58s)]
*  Part Olympic Games, part Hunger Games, and the winner is crowned the fittest man or woman [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=683.5s)]
*  on earth. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=689.2s)]
*  A title you'll be shocked to learn, Greg Glassman had his lawyer's trademark. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=690.2s)]
*  He told us no one in the world is in better shape than the Games' top athletes. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=698.62s)]
*  You bent the mortgage not the rent. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=703.62s)]
*  I bet everything on it. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=705.22s)]
*  You're going to come and best the Games athletes out of nowhere the same way you're going to [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=707.34s)]
*  walk out here on the street and put up together a Stanley Cup challenge out of morons walking [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=712.58s)]
*  by. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=717.22s)]
*  It ain't going to happen. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=718.22s)]
*  The Games are sponsored by Reebok. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=719.22s)]
*  CrossFit is credited with re-energizing the Reebok brand and boosting sales. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=727.86s)]
*  Fitness apparel should be technical apparel. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=733.14s)]
*  But five years into a 10-year deal that may be CrossFit's most important commercial partnership, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=735.22s)]
*  Glassman has developed some strong opinions about Reebok's owners, the German company [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=742.1800000000001s)]
*  Adidas. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=746.6600000000001s)]
*  And he wasn't shy about sharing them on 60 Minutes. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=748.1s)]
*  I'd like to see Reebok sold. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=751.4200000000001s)]
*  To who? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=753.78s)]
*  Young, fresh, excited and willing to enter into the modern era of things. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=757.58s)]
*  That's a pretty bold thing, isn't it? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=768.0200000000001s)]
*  For you to say. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=770.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=771.26s)]
*  Does everyone ever say to you, Greg, like you shouldn't say that? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=772.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=774.9000000000001s)]
*  I've had people tell me, boy, he's stark raving mad, but he sure is sincere. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=775.9000000000001s)]
*  You know? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=779.5s)]
*  Okay, good. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=780.5s)]
*  You know I believe it. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=781.5s)]
*  You know I believe it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=783.1s)]
*  For hundreds of years, fully grown adults and very young children have dreamed about [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=786.58s)]
*  flying. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=799.94s)]
*  People have made wings out of feathers and wood, jumped off buildings and cliffs in [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=801.34s)]
*  order to soar like a bird. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=805.34s)]
*  And a lot of them have died trying. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=807.22s)]
*  Now, a small group of extreme sportsmen wearing specially made wingsuits have come about as [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=808.86s)]
*  close to flying as you can get outside the confines of an airplane, at least for a minute [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=815.18s)]
*  or two. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=819.8599999999999s)]
*  Some people call them bird men, and we first learned about them on the internet. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=821.18s)]
*  The pictures we saw were so spectacular, we decided to assemble some of the sport's top [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=825.4599999999999s)]
*  athletes and mount a small expedition with the latest high definition cameras to one [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=830.4599999999999s)]

*  Three, two, one, mold the base. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=839.74s)]
*  There he goes. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=844.0999999999999s)]
*  He's going to come around the corner. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=852.0999999999999s)]
*  There he is. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=855.6999999999999s)]
*  Oh, he's high. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=856.6999999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=860.6999999999999s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=865.3s)]
*  How are you? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=867.3s)]
*  JT Holmes is an American, a professional skier from Lake Tahoe. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=872.3s)]
*  They've got like little goosebumps from that speed, eh? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=876.3s)]
*  Julian Boulle is a South African living in France, a skydiver and aerial photographer [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=880.6999999999999s)]
*  par excellence. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=886.18s)]
*  And that's Tom Erik Heimann, one of our Norwegian hosts, darting across the valley. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=888.3s)]
*  I just love just feeling that speed and watching stuff go by. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=894.3s)]
*  And how fast are you going? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=898.3s)]
*  That was probably about 140, 150 mile an hour fly by. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=900.3s)]
*  That sound is amazing to me. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=904.3s)]
*  Did you feel it? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=905.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=906.3s)]
*  It's so cool to watch. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=907.3s)]
*  I can just... [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=908.3s)]
*  If you want to do this, there is no better time or place than the Romsdal Valley of Norway [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=910.3s)]
*  during the summer solstice, a paradise of fjords and farms several hundred miles northwest [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=915.3s)]
*  of Oslo. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=921.3s)]
*  Myth has it that Norway's trolls live here, amidst the waterfalls and some of the tallest, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=922.3s)]
*  sheerest cliffs in Europe. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=927.3s)]
*  Norwegians have been parachuting off them for decades. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=929.3s)]
*  Birdmen take the extreme sport to new extremes, dropping off a cliff and free falling until [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=932.3s)]
*  the air inflates the wings of their nylon suits and propels them forward. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=939.3s)]
*  The dive creates the speed and you use that speed to glide out and fly flatter. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=945.3s)]
*  Gravity makes it impossible for them to go up or even maintain altitude. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=951.3s)]
*  For every two feet JT glides forward, he drops a foot. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=955.3s)]
*  But the suit allows him to stay aloft three times longer than a skydiver. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=960.3s)]
*  Within a few seconds, of course, that suit, that wind is going to fill up that suit, it's [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=965.3s)]
*  going to pressurize and you're going to have total control. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=969.3s)]
*  How long have you been doing this? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=972.3s)]
*  Five years. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=973.3s)]
*  What's special about the wing suits? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=974.3s)]
*  You know, it's just like so many children dream, it's flying. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=976.3s)]
*  You feel like you're flying? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=985.3s)]
*  Well, I am flying. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=987.3s)]
*  So yes, I do very much feel like I'm flying. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=988.3s)]
*  Like a bird? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=991.3s)]
*  Yeah, just like a bird. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=992.3s)]
*  A bird that can't flap his wings and go up. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=994.3s)]
*  The birds probably laugh at us. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=999.3s)]
*  They're probably just like, look at these guys. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1000.3s)]
*  They have long grown bored of simply flying over the valleys. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1003.3s)]
*  In order to maximize the sensation of speed, they need a visual reference point, so they [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1007.3s)]
*  fly just a few feet from the rock face. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1012.3s)]
*  Sometimes you're flying so close to these cliffs, it looks like you could reach out [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1015.3s)]
*  and touch them. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1019.3s)]
*  And you're going 100 miles an hour, 140 miles an hour? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1020.3s)]
*  There's not much margin for error. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1023.3s)]
*  It feels entirely in control and the speed actually increases your stability and it [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1025.3s)]
*  increases your safety margin because with the speed that we're flying with, you can [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1030.3s)]
*  create, lift, you know you can pop up and fly away at any time. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1035.3s)]
*  There's margin there. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1039.3s)]
*  Ready, set, go! [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1041.3s)]
*  How quickly can you turn? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1050.3s)]
*  I don't even know how to turn. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1052.3s)]
*  You just do it. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1054.3s)]
*  You just look where you want to go and you just go there and you just feel it and go. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1055.3s)]
*  You're like, yeah, let's go fast. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1062.3s)]
*  This feels good. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1064.3s)]
*  The faster I go, the more control I have and you just charge with it. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1065.3s)]
*  To the extent that JT and the others ever get nervous, it usually comes at a time that [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1069.3s)]
*  many people might consider one of the most mundane legs of the trip when the end is in [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1074.3s)]
*  sight. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1079.3s)]
*  What is the most dangerous part of this? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1080.3s)]
*  The most important thing is to open that parachute. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1082.3s)]
*  You know, just that moment when you reach back and throw the pilot chute out there which [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1084.3s)]
*  extracts your parachute, that's the most critical thing. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1089.3s)]
*  I mean, if you don't do that, you're not going to live through it. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1093.3s)]
*  But getting down the mountain, which only takes a minute or so, is just part of the [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1099.3s)]
*  extreme sport. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1103.3s)]
*  The much longer and more arduous part involves scaling the mountains you're going to jump [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1104.3s)]
*  off in the first place. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1109.3s)]
*  How long does it take you to get up to the ledge where you go from? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1110.3s)]
*  This one's about an hour and a half, but some of them are up to four, five, six hours for [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1114.3s)]
*  the big, big mountains around here. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1119.3s)]
*  There are no chair lifts, which explains why JT, Julian and Tom Erick are members of such [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1121.3s)]
*  a small and exclusive club. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1126.3s)]
*  You have to be a skilled climber, an accomplished skydiver and an experienced outdoorsman to [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1128.3s)]
*  even attempt to do this. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1134.3s)]
*  You know, it's that first view looking over the edge that really hits you. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1136.3s)]
*  You're like, whoa, cool. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1140.3s)]
*  This is an amazing spot to fly. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1142.3s)]
*  Money can't buy you this experience. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1144.3s)]
*  You've got to have the passion to do your time. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1146.3s)]
*  If you haven't done the time, you just can't get there. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1149.3s)]
*  You can't arrive at like $10,000 and buy a wingsuit experience. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1152.3s)]
*  What do you have to know? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1157.3s)]
*  What kind of skills do you have to have to be able to do what you do? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1158.3s)]
*  You need to just have some mountain sense. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1161.3s)]
*  You know, how long am I going to be? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1163.3s)]
*  If something goes wrong, how long is it going to be until I can get back? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1164.3s)]
*  If the weather comes in? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1167.3s)]
*  You need to know yourself. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1168.3s)]
*  How much water do I need? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1170.3s)]
*  Can I realistically walk up this mountain for two hours or is that not within my physical [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1171.3s)]
*  capabilities? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1176.3s)]
*  Yesterday I jumped from... [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1178.3s)]
*  It all looks spontaneous, but the birdmen put together a detailed plan every time they [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1179.3s)]
*  jump. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1184.3s)]
*  There's still some fog coming in. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1186.3s)]
*  There's still some fog coming in. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1190.3s)]
*  And they almost always have help from the locals who serve as spotters, keeping them [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1192.3s)]
*  posted of weather conditions and potential problems on the ground. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1196.3s)]
*  A birdman died here just last spring. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1200.3s)]
*  Do you ever get spooked up there? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1203.3s)]
*  I have, yeah. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1205.3s)]
*  On a couple of occasions I've had no real good reason for not jumping, but I just walked [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1207.3s)]
*  back down. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1212.3s)]
*  We're trying to get people to understand that we're not crazy. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1213.3s)]
*  We just want to have fun like everybody else. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1217.3s)]
*  We want to share nature like everyone else. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1219.3s)]
*  We just have our own special way of doing it. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1221.3s)]
*  If you die there jumping, it is your own fault. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1223.3s)]
*  It is your own mistakes that makes that happen. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1226.3s)]
*  Do you think about it? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1229.3s)]
*  I mean, when you're up there on the top of the mountain, you're getting ready to go and [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1230.3s)]
*  you all shake hands and say... [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1233.3s)]
*  Do you think about the possibility? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1235.3s)]
*  Yeah, but we don't think like, oh, I might not see you again. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1237.3s)]
*  I better say goodbye. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1241.3s)]
*  Give me a kiss. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1242.3s)]
*  That never enters your mind. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1244.3s)]
*  Come on. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1246.3s)]
*  If you do crash when you're flying your wingsuit, you're going to die. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1248.3s)]
*  Nobody lives through that. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1252.3s)]
*  You're just going too fast. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1254.3s)]
*  JT was just 15 when his dad took him helicopter skiing. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1256.3s)]
*  Today, he's one of the best in the world at it, making a living endorsing products and [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1260.3s)]
*  making movies for top-of-the-line production companies like MSP Films. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1265.3s)]
*  You're a professional skier. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1270.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1272.3s)]
*  Yeah, great job. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1273.3s)]
*  I mean, in your day job, there are any number of ways you could kill yourself in your day job. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1274.3s)]
*  And for fun, you take on something that's maybe even more dangerous? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1279.3s)]
*  Yeah, I do dangerous things. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1285.3s)]
*  He and his friend Shane McConkie were the first to ski off mountains wearing their wingsuits. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1289.3s)]
*  Then they jettisoned their skis so they could fly down the mountain. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1295.3s)]
*  You lost a good friend recently. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1299.3s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1301.3s)]
*  Shane, he was supposed to be with us here. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1303.3s)]
*  Yeah, he was. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1306.3s)]
*  We planned this trip to meet up with you guys. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1307.3s)]
*  Then I took off to Europe. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1312.3s)]
*  That was when he died. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1313.3s)]
*  You were with him? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1315.3s)]
*  Yep. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1316.3s)]
*  Shane crashed in Italy because he was unable to release his ski bindings quickly enough so he could begin flying. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1317.3s)]
*  How did it affect you? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1324.3s)]
*  It saddened me deeply. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1326.3s)]
*  I miss my friend. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1328.3s)]
*  Did it make you think about quitting? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1329.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1331.3s)]
*  But you did? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1332.3s)]
*  No. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1334.3s)]
*  No, I didn't quit. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1335.3s)]
*  At least I haven't quit yet. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1338.3s)]
*  Near the end of our stay, we chartered a helicopter for the biggest adventure of our visit. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1340.3s)]
*  We were going to the top of one of the most famous mountains in Norway, Romsdalshorn. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1346.3s)]
*  When JT and the others climb up here, they don't even use ropes. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1351.3s)]
*  The choppers saved us time and energy. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1355.3s)]
*  It was a dizzying flight, not for the faint-hearted. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1359.3s)]
*  From the air, our landing pad looked tiny but solid, a flat piece of rock. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1362.3s)]
*  But when we touched down, it turned out to be an unstable patchwork of stone. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1367.3s)]
*  You guys said that this was like the size of two football fields. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1373.3s)]
*  This is like the size of an NBA basketball court. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1376.3s)]
*  For a summit, it's huge. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1379.3s)]
*  You could throw a party up here for New Year's Eve. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1382.3s)]
*  I'm busy New Year's Eve. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1386.3s)]
*  It was early summer, but we were a mile above the valley floor and the temperature was just above freezing. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1389.3s)]
*  I kind of have to battle just getting in these things, though. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1395.3s)]
*  I kind of feel like you're climbing into a tight cockpit. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1399.3s)]
*  They had a pre-flight checklist, making sure their zippers were closed, parachutes well packed, and there were no rips in their wingsuits. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1404.3s)]
*  It was time to go to what they call the exit point. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1413.3s)]
*  So you're having fun? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1416.3s)]
*  Yeah, I'm enjoying myself. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1417.3s)]
*  I wish I could say the same thing. I'm not crazy about heights. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1419.3s)]
*  By his count, JT has jumped off mountains like this 125 times. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1422.3s)]
*  But there is a bit of the first time every time he does it. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1427.3s)]
*  I feel kind of butterflies in my stomach, and you just feel like a flow of adrenaline. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1430.3s)]
*  Tom Erick and his Norwegian friend Espen were the first to take the plunge. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1436.3s)]
*  See ya! [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1440.3s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1443.3s)]
*  So are you psyched right now? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1450.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1452.3s)]
*  That's the way to describe it. Pump. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1453.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1454.3s)]
*  You're pumped. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1455.3s)]
*  Yeah, I'm fired up. I want to go. Can I go? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1456.3s)]
*  Go. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1457.3s)]
*  We decided not to follow JT down the last few steps to the ledge where he was going to jump. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1458.3s)]
*  And we were glad we didn't. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1464.3s)]
*  He then collected himself and took a couple of deep breaths. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1467.3s)]
*  You ever have trouble pulling the trigger? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1472.3s)]
*  No. No, I don't. But you do sometimes have trouble finding that calm moment. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1474.3s)]
*  And you're just like, okay, well, this is about as calm as I'm going to get this time. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1480.3s)]
*  Okay. Ready, set, go. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1486.3s)]
*  You step off and it's like you're an astronaut. You're just weightless. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1490.3s)]
*  And then you start to fall and you get the wind. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1493.3s)]
*  That's when you're gaining speed. I really enjoy that part. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1495.3s)]
*  Air is air and gravity is gravity. You're carving through just beautiful stuff there. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1501.3s)]
*  For some of these pictures, Julian was our cameraman. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1510.3s)]
*  And at one point, he and JT were flying so close together in such perfect formation [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1513.3s)]
*  that there was time for a birdman high five half a mile up at 140 miles an hour. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1518.3s)]
*  It was an exhilarating moment, but it wasn't the last. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1524.3s)]
*  Over the next few days, they kept on jumping, saving the best for last. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1527.3s)]
*  Ready, set, go. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1531.3s)]
*  And you're just flying along the wall on your right. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1535.3s)]
*  And at that point, I don't really know what's going on. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1538.3s)]
*  Is Julian there or not? I assume he is because he's so good. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1541.3s)]
*  But on this jump, I can see our shadows and I'm like, oh, he's right there. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1544.3s)]
*  He's right there. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1549.3s)]
*  He's right there. Sick. He's right there. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1551.3s)]
*  Every jump is like a little mini adventure. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1555.3s)]
*  These are experiences that I only want to share with people that I love and respect. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1559.3s)]
*  Thanks. Yeah, buddy. Good trip. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1566.3s)]
*  Good trip. Oh, yeah, Kasia. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1568.3s)]
*  We've done it again. Yeah. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1570.3s)]
*  Do you think anybody else had much fun as us today in the entire world? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1572.3s)]
*  I don't think so. I really don't think so. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1577.3s)]
*  I don't think it's possible. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1579.3s)]
*  Rodeo might just be America's original pastime. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1593.3s)]
*  It started with an event called Saddlebronk in the Old West. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1596.3s)]
*  Today, there's one name that dominates Saddlebronk, the Wrights. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1600.3s)]
*  There are nine members of the Wright family riding the circuit, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1606.3s)]
*  and they rank among the best in the world. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1609.3s)]
*  In a sport with plenty of wannabe cowboys, as you'll see and hear, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1612.3s)]
*  the Wrights are the real deal, vestiges of the American frontier. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1617.3s)]
*  Their lifestyle has prepared them for what's been called [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1622.3s)]
*  one of the last blue-collar sports in America. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1625.3s)]
*  In Saddlebronk, there are no Tom Brady salaries, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1628.3s)]
*  and there are regular injuries that would make running backs flinch. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1632.3s)]
*  And yet none of that discourages the Wrights. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1636.3s)]
*  Each generation seems to be better than the last. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1639.3s)]
*  Tonight, we'll introduce you to America's first family of rodeo, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1643.3s)]
*  competing for glory on horseback the Wright way. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1648.3s)]
*  Anybody heard of the Wrights in the Bronk riding? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1654.3s)]
*  You may not have heard of the Wrights before. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1657.3s)]
*  A Utah sensation. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1660.3s)]
*  But at rodeos big and small across the country, like this one in Utah, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1662.3s)]
*  that last name is as famous as Manning or Montana, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1667.3s)]
*  and there are just about enough Wrights to field their own football team. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1671.3s)]
*  It is the Wright Knight at the rodeo. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1675.3s)]
*  Nine professional cowboys with five world titles among them. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1678.3s)]
*  There's Ryder Wright. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1685.3s)]
*  Ryder! Come on, Ryder! [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1687.3s)]
*  The youngest world champion of all time and a 21 currently sitting in first place. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1689.3s)]
*  Hey, we've been watching all of the Wrights. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1695.3s)]
*  His uncle is this guy. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1698.3s)]
*  Hi. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1700.3s)]
*  Spencer Wright, another world champion. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1702.3s)]
*  That was incredible. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1705.3s)]
*  Yeah, he did awesome. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1707.3s)]
*  And in a league of his own, Cody Wright, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1708.3s)]
*  the one who started the family dynasty 20 years ago. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1711.3s)]
*  And street style! [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1715.3s)]
*  At 42, Cody's a two-time world champion and one of the best Bronk riders ever. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1717.3s)]
*  What's that feel like? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1724.3s)]
*  Adrenaline, a little bit of fear, and you've got to learn how to control it. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1726.3s)]
*  Otherwise, it would go to heck pretty quick. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1731.3s)]
*  Here's Stetson Wright. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1735.3s)]
*  In Saddle Bronk, the goal is to hang on with style for eight seconds [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1737.3s)]
*  Yeah! Wow! [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1744.3s)]
*  to a horse specially bred to buck you off. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1746.3s)]
*  Can you explain to us what's going on in that eight seconds? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1751.3s)]
*  Let's go to Cody Wright. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1756.3s)]
*  Yeah, go on! [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1757.3s)]
*  You've got a rein you hang on to. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1759.3s)]
*  You need to lift on it because that's what holds you down in the saddle. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1761.3s)]
*  When they jump and kick, you know, they're stretched out, their feet are off the ground. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1767.3s)]
*  You want to be stretched out, you know, your free arms straight back [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1772.3s)]
*  and your feet set as high in the neck as you can get them. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1776.3s)]
*  It's like one hell of a rocking horse. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1780.3s)]
*  It can be the roughest ride in the world if you're out of time [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1783.3s)]
*  or it can be the smoothest ride in the world. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1786.3s)]
*  So are you kind of dancing with a horse? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1789.3s)]
*  I like to think you are. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1792.3s)]
*  I dance a lot better with a horse than I do with my wife. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1795.3s)]
*  I ain't got no rhythm. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1799.3s)]
*  The Wrights and the Broncos they're randomly paired with are partners in the rodeo. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1802.3s)]
*  Both have to perform well to get a good score from the judges. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1807.3s)]
*  When it's go time, the Wrights, the sons and brothers crowd around the shoot [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1813.3s)]
*  like a NASCAR pit crew, helping each other saddle up. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1818.3s)]
*  This is a team sport for you guys. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1822.3s)]
*  I think so. I love it. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1824.3s)]
*  There's nobody I'd rather see do better, but don't think that I ain't trying to beat them. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1826.3s)]
*  We all show up to the rodeo wanting to win first, but we're going to help each other do it too. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1831.3s)]
*  That's Jake Wright, Cody's younger brother and one of his toughest competitors. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1837.3s)]
*  And yes, there are more brothers. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1843.3s)]
*  Jake's twin, Jesse, a brother-in-law, Coburn Bradshaw, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1846.3s)]
*  plus Alex, Calvin, Stewart and Spencer Wright. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1851.3s)]
*  We're like a big support group. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1856.3s)]
*  There's 10 of the best bronc riders in the world right here. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1858.3s)]
*  We all get together and practice. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1862.3s)]
*  Everybody focused? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1864.3s)]
*  And I know that's why we all have been so successful at what we do. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1865.3s)]
*  All that practice has propelled them to the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1871.3s)]
*  It's the Cowboy Super Bowl. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1877.3s)]
*  Spencer Wright, he's got a great ride going. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1879.3s)]
*  And team Wright has made it every year for the last decade and a half. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1881.3s)]
*  Cody has won the champion's gold buckle twice. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1886.3s)]
*  He showed us that we could do it with a little hard work and a lot of try. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1890.3s)]
*  If he would have never even pursued rodeo, I wonder what the rest of us would even be doing. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1895.3s)]
*  What they're doing comes at a steep cost. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1901.3s)]
*  While these horses are rarely injured, that can't be said for the rights. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1904.3s)]
*  They all have the same orthopedic surgeon on speed dial. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1909.3s)]
*  Can I see a show of hands of how many of you have been injured? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1914.3s)]
*  So all of you have been injured. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1918.3s)]
*  And two of you came into this interview on crutches. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1920.3s)]
*  Three of us. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1923.3s)]
*  Tell me some of the injuries. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1927.3s)]
*  I think the worst was my back when I broke my back in Omaha. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1928.3s)]
*  Fractured my skull. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1932.3s)]
*  I broke my nose about ten times. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1934.3s)]
*  I broke all the sinuses on this right side of my face one time. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1936.3s)]
*  I had a brain bleed. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1940.3s)]
*  As far as injuries go, I think I'm one of the lucky ones sitting here. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1941.3s)]
*  Do you hear yourself? Brain bleed. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1945.3s)]
*  And you call that lucky? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1947.3s)]
*  Hurts a lot less than heartache, Phil. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1950.3s)]
*  But heartache won't land you in the hospital. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1955.3s)]
*  The Wright boys are well aware every ride could be their last. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1958.3s)]
*  Stewart came close. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1963.3s)]
*  I said let's go and horse rared up and hit my head. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1965.3s)]
*  It kind of knocked me a little senseless. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1968.3s)]
*  I fell off into the arena. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1970.3s)]
*  He just jumped straight up and fell completely on me. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1972.3s)]
*  I thought I broke my back because I just felt my ribs pop as he landed on me. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1975.3s)]
*  I was like, oh my gosh. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1980.3s)]
*  As awful as that may sound, the Wrights say the hardest part of the job is being away from home. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1983.3s)]
*  What did they tell Alex last time he went to the doctor? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1990.3s)]
*  They're on the road around 250 days a year, clocking 100,000 miles in these, what they call rodeo motels. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=1993.3s)]
*  This weekend you're going to Herodon and Fort Peer or vice versa. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2002.3s)]
*  Where they eat, sleep and drive from Canada to the Mexican border, chasing eight second dreams. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2007.3s)]
*  Do you sometimes feel like you're on the road more times than you're on a horse? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2016.3s)]
*  You drive 22, 24 hours from home to there and we're there an hour and turn around and drive them back. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2020.3s)]
*  We drive for a living, ride bucking horses for fun. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2027.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2030.3s)]
*  When they aren't on the road, home is southern Utah. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2033.3s)]
*  They mostly grew up in Milford, a no-stoplight town where the Wrights are the main attraction. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2037.3s)]
*  They're a family of 13 kids, kept in line by their parents, Bill and Evelyn. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2046.3s)]
*  That's a huge family. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2052.3s)]
*  It's a good size family. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2054.3s)]
*  Kids are kind of moreish, you know. The more you get, the more you want. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2056.3s)]
*  She trained the older ones to help the younger ones. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2059.3s)]
*  I had to organize them. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2063.3s)]
*  I'm like, I cannot do this on my own or else it's going to be bad. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2065.3s)]
*  Because mom's going to grow bear hair and you're not going to like it. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2070.3s)]
*  Alright, quit. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2074.3s)]
*  The Wright kids were cowboys playing cowboys and were natural ranch hands. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2076.3s)]
*  It kept them out of Evelyn's hair and out of trouble. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2083.3s)]
*  The seven boys and six girls knew how to ride a horse before they could pedal a bike. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2086.3s)]
*  Some of the girls rodeo'd too, but never went pro. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2091.3s)]
*  They learned how to break horses early, how to ride and tame horses and train them. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2095.3s)]
*  I think you have to be a cowboy before you can be a rodeo cowboy. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2101.3s)]
*  The ranch was their training ground. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2107.3s)]
*  The family has been working this land at the edge of Zion National Park for more than a century and a half. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2111.3s)]
*  I'm five generations. Cody's six and Rusty's seven and his boy is eight generations. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2118.3s)]
*  Bill, do you think the Wright family will be ranching this land in another 150 years? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2127.3s)]
*  Well, I hope so. I really do. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2133.3s)]
*  When you work as hard on something as I have at this, you don't want to see it just go away. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2136.3s)]
*  What keeps their way of life going are rituals like this. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2147.3s)]
*  Branding Day. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2153.3s)]
*  Bill and his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren gather every year to round up, vaccinate, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2157.3s)]
*  and brand their cattle. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2165.3s)]
*  The hard work brings them together. It defines them on the ranch and in the arena. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2168.3s)]
*  Dad's the first one to preach that you get out of what you put into it and if he's seen you putting something into it, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2175.3s)]
*  they were both behind you and it didn't matter if they had to sell the farm, they was going to get you there. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2181.3s)]
*  They sacrifice a lot for you to reach your dream. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2188.3s)]
*  I think so. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2193.3s)]
*  This cowboy gets emotional because he knows exactly how much his parents gave up when he was starting out in a family where money was tight. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2196.3s)]
*  We went to Gillette, Wyoming to the national finals and I had like ten kids. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2206.3s)]
*  He comes back from the expo and he said, I bought Cody a saddle. I'm like, what? It was only $1,100. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2211.3s)]
*  I'm like, what? You did what? I started crying. He's like, we've got to help him. We've got to support him. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2220.3s)]
*  He's going to lose his dream if we don't. What do you say to that? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2229.3s)]
*  Thanks for coming. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2234.3s)]
*  These days, Cody may be living his dream, but it hasn't exactly made him rich, considering cowboys have to foot the bill for just about everything. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2235.3s)]
*  I really like rodeos. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2245.3s)]
*  If you're rodeoing full time and going to a hundred rodeos, you've got to make over 60 or 70,000 just to break even. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2247.3s)]
*  So you could go through all this and go to a rodeo and walk away with nothing. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2256.3s)]
*  Yeah, you could walk away in the red. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2262.3s)]
*  Less than nothing. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2265.3s)]
*  Less than nothing. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2266.3s)]
*  So surely there are easier ways to make a living. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2268.3s)]
*  You'd think so. But better? I don't know. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2271.3s)]
*  Still, the sport has taken a toll on Cody's body and his family. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2278.3s)]
*  He's spending less time in the arena now and more time on the ranch and in the practice pen, leading the next generation to carry on the right legacy. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2283.3s)]
*  Son's rider, Rusty Stetson, who are already rising stars and the youngest, Statler. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2295.3s)]
*  We were there the day Cody coached his 16 year old on his very first bronc ride. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2302.3s)]
*  Statler, right there, lift hard and take a hold of him. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2308.3s)]
*  Well, I was like super nervous until I got in there and then I just pretty much forgot about everything else but what my dad's taught me. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2311.3s)]
*  Go on, spur, go on. Keep going, buddy. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2319.3s)]
*  That ride, how'd that feel? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2323.3s)]
*  I hurt my butt, actually a lot. But as soon as I hit the ground, I wanted to do it again. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2327.3s)]
*  One hall of famer told us that you guys have the potential to be the best there ever was. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2333.3s)]
*  I think we can do it, but really that's kind of humbling. Humbling and who likes fire. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2340.3s)]
*  A fire, they say, to win those gold buckles just like their dad, Cody. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2347.3s)]
*  You know, I wanted a gold buckle, but to ride every horse the best I could was always what did it for me. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2354.3s)]
*  Sure, I want money. Who don't? You needed to go along, but I always just wanted to ride broncs. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2361.3s)]
*  It was striving to make that perfect ride and the feeling that you feel when you're in time with a horse that's trying to get you off their back as hard as they can. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2370.3s)]
*  Have you ever had a perfect ride? [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2381.3s)]
*  No, I've never had a perfect ride. When I make that perfect ride, I'm going to be done. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0US6507Kwk&t=2383.3s)]
