*  of the war in Ukraine, the degree to which this war is a crime against humanity. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=36.96s)]

*  During Argentina's ruthless dictatorship in the mid-70s, the Skyvan PA-51 was used to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=50.08s)]
*  throw victims alive into the Atlantic Ocean. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=55.96s)]
*  To quote-unquote disappear, thousands of innocent citizens seem a threat to the state. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=59.24s)]
*  Dumping prisoners out of an airplane seems so extreme. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=64.8s)]
*  Why would a military resort to this? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  No trail, no clues whatsoever that could incriminate them. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=73.24000000000001s)]

*  cordial greeting. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=109.68s)]
*  President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy squared off in the Oval Office and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=111.28s)]
*  left an alliance shaken. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=117.72s)]
*  For three years, the West has stood against Russia's unprovoked invasion of an innocent [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=120.08s)]
*  country. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=125.76s)]
*  Ukraine is a vanity war for Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, who covets an empire. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=127.32s)]
*  And for that alone, more than one million have been killed or wounded on both sides. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=133.88s)]
*  President Trump has boasted only he can end it quickly, but in the last two weeks, his [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=140.92s)]
*  chaotic attempt alarmed allies and encouraged enemies. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=146.48s)]
*  By Friday, he was scolding the man who stands between Russia and the rest of Europe. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=151.27999999999997s)]
*  You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  We're going to feel very good. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=163.64s)]
*  You will feel influenced. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=164.64s)]
*  We're going to feel very good and very strong. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=165.64s)]
*  You will feel influenced. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  You're right now not in a very good position. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=169.0s)]
*  You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position and it happens to be right about [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=175.68s)]
*  From the very beginning of the war, Mr. Graham, I was... [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=176.68s)]
*  You're not in a good position. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  You don't have the cards right now. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  With us, you start having cards. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=181.36s)]
*  Right now, you're playing cards. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=183.36s)]
*  I'm very serious, Mr. President. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=184.36s)]
*  You're playing cards. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=185.36s)]
*  I'm very serious. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=186.36s)]
*  You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=187.36s)]
*  You're gambling with World War III. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=189.84s)]
*  You're gambling with World War III. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=192.4s)]
*  The meeting itself was a gamble and the public had never seen anything like it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=195.36s)]
*  The president dressing down Zelensky, whose people had done all of the dying to stop Putin [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=200.44000000000003s)]
*  short of the border of NATO. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=207.24s)]
*  Vladimir Putin watches the video from the Oval Office and what does he see? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=210.52s)]
*  Vladimir Putin couldn't be happier, Scott, because what he sees is all of the pressure [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=215.4s)]
*  on Zelensky, all of the pressure on Ukraine and no pressure on him. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=220.5s)]
*  H.R. McMaster knows he was national security adviser in Trump's first term. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=226.06s)]
*  He's a retired army general, senior fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=232.14000000000001s)]
*  a CBS News contributor. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=237.82s)]
*  The allies look at the video from the Oval Office and see what? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=240.5s)]
*  What they see is something that's just confounding, a discussion that doesn't reflect the reality [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=246.14s)]
*  of the war in Ukraine, the degree to which this war is a crime against humanity. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=251.33999999999997s)]
*  And they think, how can President Trump be berating the leader of Ukraine while he says [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=257.53999999999996s)]
*  kind things about Vladimir Putin? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=263.78s)]
*  We have seen those crimes against humanity in mass graves of Ukrainian civilians and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=266.5s)]
*  in their obliterated cities. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=273.1s)]
*  Behind a murderous front line, Russia occupies 20 percent of Ukraine and bombs all the rest. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=275.98s)]
*  American-led sanctions isolated Putin, but last month, President Trump flipped U.S. policy [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=284.18s)]
*  on its head. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=291.18s)]
*  He opened peace talks with Russia and did not invite Ukraine. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=292.68s)]
*  At the same time, he spread a deceitful history of the war. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=298.54s)]
*  But today I heard, oh, well, we weren't invited. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=303.3s)]
*  Well, you've been there for three years. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=304.98s)]
*  You should have ended it three years. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=306.46000000000004s)]
*  You should have never started it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=308.22s)]
*  You could have made a deal. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=309.42s)]
*  Ukraine did not start the war. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=311.58000000000004s)]
*  Next, the president said this. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=314.34000000000003s)]
*  We gave them, I believe, 350 billion dollars, but let's say it's something less than that, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=317.44s)]
*  but it's a lot. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=322.02000000000004s)]
*  It's 122 billion, not 350. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=324.1s)]
*  The next day, Trump went after Zelensky. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=328.1s)]
*  A dictator without elections, Zelensky better move faster. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=331.42s)]
*  He's not going to have a country left. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=335.38s)]
*  Got to move, got to move fast because that war is going in the wrong direction. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=336.98s)]
*  Zelensky is not a dictator. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=341.54s)]
*  He was elected in 2019. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=343.74s)]
*  There hasn't been a vote since because of the war. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=346.34000000000003s)]
*  On February 24th, Trump's tilt toward Russia reached the UN, where America voted against [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=350.82s)]
*  its allies and sided with Russia and North Korea, opposing Ukraine. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=358.34s)]
*  Alarmed, the leaders of France and Britain hurried to the White House. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=365.38s)]
*  In these last two weeks, we've heard him call Zelensky a dictator. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=371.38s)]
*  We've heard him say it was Ukraine that started the war. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=375.53999999999996s)]
*  What is going on? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=378.86s)]
*  Well, President Trump, as we all know, has a tendency to say outlandish things. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=380.1s)]
*  Sometimes that's to shake the situation up and create some sense of change. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=385.74s)]
*  But oftentimes what he doesn't consider is how his words could impede his own agenda [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=390.26s)]
*  or how his words actually can cut against US interests or be received abroad in a way [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=397.22s)]
*  that's much different from the way his political supporters will receive those words in the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=403.62s)]
*  United States. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=408.86s)]
*  And so those words were damaging, damaging to the psyche of the Ukrainians. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=410.14s)]
*  War really is a contest of wills. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=415.54s)]
*  And I think what you're seeing is Donald Trump delivering a series of body blows to the Ukrainians [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=418.02000000000004s)]
*  in a way that could affect their will to continue to fight. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=424.78000000000003s)]
*  Zelensky's will to fight led him to push for the meeting Friday. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=429.46000000000004s)]
*  Trump had demanded Ukraine sign over the rights to billions of dollars in mineral wealth [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=434.22s)]
*  to pay America back. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=440.18s)]
*  Zelensky came to sign the deal. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=442.06s)]
*  Well, thank you very much. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=444.54s)]
*  It's an honor to have President Zelensky of Ukraine. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=445.94000000000005s)]
*  President Trump began generously. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=450.22s)]
*  I give tremendous credit to your generals and your soldiers and yourself in the sense [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=452.62s)]
*  that it's been very hard fighting, very tough fighting. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=457.74s)]
*  They're great fighters. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=462.86s)]
*  And you have to be very proud of them from that standpoint. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=464.78000000000003s)]
*  But now we want to get it over with. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=467.82000000000005s)]
*  These public Oval Office meetings are planned for weeks with issues settled in advance, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=470.42s)]
*  but this was hasty. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=476.06s)]
*  Neither side was prepared. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=478.54s)]
*  Trump spoke of loss in the war, both the victim and the aggressor. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=480.86s)]
*  They're not American soldiers, but they're Russian soldiers and they're Ukrainian soldiers. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=486.58000000000004s)]
*  We want to be able to stop it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=491.58s)]
*  Zelensky seemed irritated when his people were equated to the invading Russians. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=493.3s)]
*  Whether they're in Russia or Ukraine, think of the parents of all these people being killed, needlessly. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=499.41999999999996s)]

*  Should have never started. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=506.86s)]
*  Trump helped arm Zelensky in Trump's first term, but now he has all but cut off aid. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=508.78s)]
*  Trump is pushing a quick ceasefire without an international guarantee of Ukraine's security, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=516.5s)]
*  which is Russia's position too. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=523.26s)]
*  I'm not aligned with Putin. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=525.9000000000001s)]
*  I'm not aligned with anybody. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=527.34s)]
*  I'm aligned with the United States of America and for the good of the world. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=528.6600000000001s)]
*  I'm aligned with the world and I want to get this thing over with. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=533.38s)]
*  You see the hatred he's got for Putin. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=536.46s)]
*  It's very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hatred. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=538.3000000000001s)]
*  He's got tremendous hatred. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=540.86s)]
*  The protocol prevailed for 40 minutes until Vice President J.D. Vance said diplomacy could have ended the war long ago. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=542.54s)]
*  The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=552.5799999999999s)]
*  Can I ask you? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=558.74s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=560.54s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=561.0999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=561.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=562.18s)]
*  Vance had struck a nerve with a man who has buried tens of thousands of his countrymen. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=563.14s)]
*  It got worse when Vance told Zelensky he'd seen Ukraine on TV. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=569.22s)]
*  Zelensky explained that Putin, a mass murderer indicted for war crimes, could not be trusted. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=575.6600000000001s)]
*  A ceasefire without a security guarantee would be naive. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=582.74s)]
*  What kind of diplomacy, J.D., you are speaking about? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=587.5s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=590.78s)]
*  I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=592.86s)]
*  Yes, but if you are not strong... [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=596.46s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=597.26s)]
*  It was the White House that called in the media. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=604.14s)]
*  Ukraine's ambassador couldn't bear to watch. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=607.14s)]
*  The problem is I've empowered you to be a tough guy. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=610.94s)]
*  And I don't think you'd be a tough guy without the United States. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=615.26s)]
*  And your people are very brave. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=618.6600000000001s)]
*  But you're either going to make a deal or we're out. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=620.78s)]
*  And if we're out, you'll fight it out. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=623.38s)]
*  I don't think it's going to be pretty. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=626.42s)]
*  But you'll fight it out. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=628.22s)]
*  But you don't have the cards. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=630.14s)]
*  But once we sign that deal, you're in a much better position. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=631.7s)]
*  But you're not acting at all thankful. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=635.46s)]
*  And that's not a nice thing. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=637.66s)]
*  I'll be honest, that's not a nice thing. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=638.86s)]
*  Immediately after the meltdown, many Republicans rallied around the president, saying Zelensky was at fault. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=641.22s)]
*  But Republican Congressman Don Bacon has worried about Trump's approach to Ukraine since last month. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=648.02s)]
*  I hope it's not as bad as it sounds. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=655.54s)]
*  Congressman Bacon represents Omaha. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=658.18s)]
*  He's a retired Air Force general who knows what America means to NATO. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=660.66s)]
*  America's the leader of the free world. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=666.26s)]
*  We're the indispensable power. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=667.54s)]
*  Nobody can stand up to Russia and China if we're not a part of that. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=669.38s)]
*  And Ukraine's the victim. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=673.26s)]
*  And I think Putin's made clear that he wants to reestablish his old borders. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=674.9399999999999s)]
*  And that's not in our national security interests. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=678.98s)]
*  To me, this is a national security issue, but also a moral issue. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=681.5s)]
*  Would you say that Donald Trump is appeasing Vladimir Putin? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=685.74s)]
*  It appears that way, though I can't get into his motives. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=689.38s)]
*  I don't know his motives. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=691.86s)]
*  Some people think he's doing this for negotiating and maybe help get a better deal. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=693.1800000000001s)]
*  I don't know. All I know is what he says. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=699.1800000000001s)]
*  And when he says that Russia is not the invader, that's Ukraine's fault, that's just wrong. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=701.6600000000001s)]
*  Is there danger in this? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=707.9000000000001s)]
*  Yep, there is. I fear what this means. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=710.66s)]
*  We came out of World War II, the dominant power, the indispensable country for freedom. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=713.9s)]
*  We've had NATO. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=719.62s)]
*  And I worry that this framework is going to collapse. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=721.62s)]
*  When the United States sided with Russia and North Korea at the United Nations, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=725.54s)]
*  what message did that send? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=731.18s)]
*  Well, the first message it sent to me was shame. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=734.1s)]
*  Senator Angus King is an independent from Maine, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=737.02s)]
*  serving on the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=740.5s)]
*  I always try to think of, you know, what's the argument on both sides? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=744.98s)]
*  I cannot think of a rational argument for pulling our support from Ukraine. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=747.62s)]
*  Senator King likes to point out that Europe has given more than the U.S., [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=753.86s)]
*  and Ukraine has given the most. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=758.78s)]
*  They've done the dying. All they've asked for us is to send them the means to defend themselves. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=761.86s)]
*  In this moment, what should Congress be doing about Ukraine? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=767.3000000000001s)]
*  I think they have to start speaking up, because if we persist in walking away from Ukraine, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=771.1800000000001s)]
*  it will be the greatest geopolitical mistake that this country's made since World War II. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=778.5s)]
*  Back in the Oval Office, President Trump revealed something of a common cause with the Russian president. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=784.5s)]
*  Trump complained he and Putin had been slandered for years by allegations that Russia helped Trump's campaigns, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=792.38s)]
*  allegations Trump ties to his Democratic opponents. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=800.46s)]
*  Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=804.7s)]
*  He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=806.9399999999999s)]
*  You ever hear of that deal? That was a phony, that was a phony Hunter Biden, Joe Biden scam. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=812.66s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, Shifty Adam Schiff, it was a Democrat scam. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=818.5s)]
*  And he had to go through that. And he did go through it. We didn't end up in a war. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=823.9s)]
*  And he went through it. He was accused of all that stuff. He had nothing to do with it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=828.74s)]
*  It came out of Hunter Biden's bathroom. It came out of Hunter Biden's bedroom. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=832.26s)]
*  It was disgusting. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=838.62s)]
*  That rant was familiar to Trump's first term national security adviser, H.R. McMaster. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=840.82s)]
*  McMaster left the White House after 13 months in a falling out with the president. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=847.78s)]
*  But even back then, he was warning Trump about Vladimir Putin. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=852.78s)]
*  He appeals to President Trump's sense of aggrievement, right? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=857.74s)]
*  Donald, like me, you've been treated so unfairly. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=862.78s)]
*  And he's been very successful at it because he's a master manipulator and one of the best liars in the world. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=866.62s)]
*  You seem to be saying that President Trump is being played. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=873.26s)]
*  He is being played. And he's being played like other presidents have been played, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=877.14s)]
*  like other leaders have been played through that same playbook of Putin's. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=881.5s)]
*  Today, the allies stood with Zelensky. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=886.3000000000001s)]
*  In London, a flash summit was arranged with leaders, including those of Canada, France, Germany, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=890.1800000000001s)]
*  Italy, the head of NATO and the British prime minister, who announced new negotiations by Britain and France, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=896.66s)]
*  potentially taking the lead for peace out of the hands of President Trump. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=905.66s)]
*  All right. I think we've seen enough. What do you think? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=910.86s)]
*  Every once in a while, we come across a story so extraordinary that it resists belief. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=922.1s)]
*  Tonight, the saga of an airplane that doubled as an instrument of murder. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=927.42s)]
*  During Argentina's ruthless dictatorship in the mid 70s, the Skyvan PA-51 was used to throw victims alive into the Atlantic Ocean, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=931.8199999999999s)]
*  to quote unquote disappear thousands of innocent citizens seen as a threat to the state. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=941.42s)]
*  Those disappeared were meant never to reappear. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=946.86s)]
*  Forty years after the end of the dictatorship, many of its crimes remain unsolved and unresolved. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=950.1s)]
*  When an unlikely pair of investigators went looking for the death plane, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=956.5s)]
*  their search for truth uncovered state secrets, damning evidence, and a reminder of a dark period that echoes into the present. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=959.86s)]
*  The journey here, though, it was quite literally a vehicle for evil. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=969.22s)]
*  This British made Skyvan, now 50 years old, is grounded for good here at the former Navy School of Mechanics, or ESMA, in a Buenos Aires neighborhood. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=973.74s)]
*  The facility is now a museum, and a memorial to the 30,000 citizens tortured and murdered during the dictatorship. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=984.22s)]
*  This was a death camp, looming large in the middle of a thrumming city. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=991.46s)]
*  Images of the victims adorned the walls. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=995.58s)]
*  Most were students, dissidents, and union members, never charged with a crime. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=998.18s)]
*  This plane, where many of them met their death, would have been lost in the contrails of history [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1003.34s)]
*  had it not been for an Italian documentary photographer, Giancarlo Ciraudo. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1009.02s)]
*  Why was it important not just to return this plane to Argentina, but here, to ESMA? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1014.5s)]
*  It's very important for the memory for the next generation. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1020.46s)]
*  This is real. This is an evidence. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1025.74s)]
*  This was an instrument of death, but now is a witness. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1029.1s)]
*  The cockpit, just as it was when the military pilots flew their clandestine death missions, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1033.86s)]
*  flying far enough over the Atlantic so the bodies wouldn't likely be recovered, and then dumping the victims out alive. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1039.86s)]
*  To climb inside the plane is to experience an unmistakable chill of the past. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1049.4199999999998s)]
*  Giancarlo grew up loving planes, but this flying coffin ended that romance. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1054.5s)]
*  You're emotional seeing this. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1060.1399999999999s)]
*  Yes, very emotional. Very emotional. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1062.42s)]
*  How did a young Italian photographer, armed only with a camera, an eye for detail, and burning curiosity, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1065.7s)]
*  come to unravel one of the great national shames of Argentina? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1072.46s)]
*  It all began in 2003, when Ciraudo was in Buenos Aires working on a project about the disappeared. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1076.74s)]
*  He heard about the death flights in the 1970s, but the stories were never fully told. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1083.7s)]
*  So many unanswered questions and so little accountability. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1089.06s)]
*  If there were flights, he reasoned, then surely there were planes and there were pilots. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1093.34s)]
*  So where were they? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1098.1399999999999s)]
*  You knew those death flights existed. How did you start your search for the planes? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1100.1399999999999s)]
*  I had an idea, but to start the investigation, started with Miriam. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1105.34s)]
*  Miriam is Miriam Lewin. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1114.26s)]
*  She was a young student activist in 1977 when she was kidnapped, tortured and sexually abused. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1116.3799999999999s)]
*  She was then taken to ESMA and was among the few who survived, though she never knew quite why. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1123.02s)]
*  Later, she became a leading investigative journalist in Argentina, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1129.6999999999998s)]
*  best known for unearthing the crimes of the dictatorship. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1133.1399999999999s)]
*  When Ciraudo first contacted Miriam, she told him she had other things on her mind. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1136.8999999999999s)]
*  And I said, look, we were looking for the desaparecidos, the missing people, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1141.98s)]
*  and then we started looking for the bodies. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1147.46s)]
*  So we had plenty to think about. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1150.6200000000001s)]
*  People, not things. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1153.38s)]
*  Yeah. And he said, I come from a different culture. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1154.66s)]
*  In Rome, when they are digging a tunnel to extend the subway lines, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1158.98s)]
*  they find a plate or a sculpture and they stop everything for like three years. Right? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1165.1s)]
*  He comes from a culture where objects are witnesses to history and that hadn't occurred to anyone here. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1173.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1179.86s)]
*  Giancarlo's passion paired with Miriam's reporting chops and her own experience at ESMA. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1180.9399999999998s)]
*  She'd seen other prisoners taken to the basement and given what they were told was a vaccine. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1187.4199999999998s)]
*  Only years later did she learn that it was a sedative and that those drug prisoners were put on board planes, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1193.42s)]
*  flown over the ocean, stripped of their clothes before being flung to their deaths. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1199.94s)]
*  Dumping prisoners out of an airplane 10,000 feet above an ocean seems so extreme. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1205.42s)]
*  Why would a military resort to this? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1211.94s)]
*  Death flights allow them to disappear the bodies of the disappeared. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1215.1000000000001s)]
*  No trail, no clues whatsoever that could incriminate them. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1221.62s)]
*  Miriam and Giancarlo began their search, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1229.4599999999998s)]
*  poring over military records, hunting down sources and combing the internet. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1232.06s)]
*  They discovered that in the 1970s, the Argentine military purchased five Skyvans, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1237.02s)]
*  workhorses used for transporting cargo, troops and leading parachutists of many nations have dropped from Skyvan. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1242.9399999999998s)]
*  And they are unanimous that there's not another jump platform like it. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1251.1s)]
*  Two of the fleet were shot down by the British during the Falklands War. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1254.78s)]
*  Argentina's surrender in that conflict ended the dictatorship in 1983. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1258.5s)]
*  The rest were sold off. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1263.26s)]
*  They tracked one plane to the United States, where it was being used for skydiving excursions. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1265.22s)]
*  Maybe the owners didn't know about the terrible, obscure parts of these planes. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1271.1s)]
*  In 2008, Miriam and Giancarlo found the plane in Fort Lauderdale and later paid it a visit. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1281.06s)]
*  To their surprise, the owner provided them with all the technical logs, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1287.18s)]
*  detailing every journey the plane had ever flown. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1291.42s)]
*  I was very, very excited. I couldn't believe that. I couldn't believe it. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1294.82s)]
*  They brought the logs back to Argentina and asked for help deciphering the technicalities. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1300.5s)]
*  But even decades after the dictatorship ended, there was still lingering paranoia. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1305.74s)]
*  Aviation experts didn't want to talk. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1311.02s)]
*  What they said, no, no, no way. They could kill me. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1313.3s)]
*  But they were nothing if not persistent. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1320.18s)]
*  They tracked down a source who explained the highly suspicious journeys occurring Wednesday nights, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1322.6200000000001s)]
*  tracing a route over the middle of the ocean. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1328.06s)]
*  The departure and arrival points the same. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1330.8600000000001s)]
*  When he looks at them and goes, oh gosh, this is gold. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1333.78s)]
*  Why did he say that? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1339.34s)]
*  This is the first time that death lives could be documented and proven. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1340.42s)]
*  Finding the logs was one thing, but Miriam and Giancarlo were determined to solve one of the most [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1347.9s)]
*  notorious and heinous abductions of the dictatorship. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1352.54s)]
*  Every week, the mothers of the disappeared marched in the Plaza de Mayo, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1356.02s)]
*  in front of the presidential palace, demanding to know the fate of their missing sons and daughters. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1359.8999999999999s)]
*  The mothers became the most potent symbol of resistance against the dictatorship, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1367.54s)]
*  and soon they became targets themselves. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1371.86s)]
*  In December 1977, a group of 12 mothers and their supporters, including two French nuns, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1379.6599999999999s)]
*  were meeting here at the Holy Cross Church in Buenos Aires when they were hauled away and taken to ESMA. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1385.74s)]
*  They were seen by fellow prisoners being tortured, and then never seen again. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1392.82s)]
*  Azucena Vizafor was one of the mothers. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1398.02s)]
*  She had been searching in vain for her son, who had disappeared. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1400.9s)]
*  Cecilia De Vicente is her daughter. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1404.9s)]
*  As the days turned into months, turned into years, what did you think had happened? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1407.74s)]
*  In reality, we didn't know what happened. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1413.9399999999998s)]
*  Every single day we thought she was coming back. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1416.1799999999998s)]
*  New Year's, Mother's Day, every day we lived like this. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1418.9399999999998s)]
*  What Cecilia and the other victims' families didn't know, in the days after those kidnapped [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1425.22s)]
*  were last seen, a rare storm washed up six bodies some 220 miles from Buenos Aires. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1430.1399999999999s)]
*  Authorities in the nearby towns secretly buried the remains in unmarked graves, and a local [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1436.74s)]
*  doctor issued death certificates noting the bodies had suffered multiple blunt force traumas. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1441.46s)]
*  What did that mean? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1447.8600000000001s)]
*  This means that they were compatible with those bodies having fallen from height. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1449.42s)]
*  In the years after democracy was restored, forensic anthropologists began unearthing [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1461.7s)]
*  evidence of the dictatorship's crimes. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1466.38s)]
*  In 2005, bodies in the cemetery were exhumed and identified. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1469.1799999999998s)]
*  Five were victims of the Holy Cross kidnapping. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1473.82s)]
*  Azucena Vizafor was one of them. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1477.06s)]
*  The ultimate purpose of these death flights was to disappear the victims and sink to the [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1479.9399999999998s)]
*  bottom of the ocean. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1485.3s)]
*  Your mother did not disappear, did she? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1487.3s)]
*  The mothers and the nuns fought death just as they fought when they were looking for [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1489.98s)]
*  their children. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1494.34s)]
*  The ocean brought them back as proof that the military was trying to disappear them. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1495.62s)]
*  Miriam and Giancarlo began building a timeline for the days after the Twelve were kidnapped [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1503.26s)]
*  from the Holy Cross Church. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1508.4199999999998s)]
*  And there it was in the logs. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1510.02s)]
*  A three-hour flight over the Atlantic the night of December 14, 1977. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1512.4599999999998s)]
*  What's more, the log contained the names of the pilots. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1518.6599999999999s)]
*  I think this plane is a gift, yes, from the sky. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1522.54s)]
*  For Miriam, the hard-boiled investigative journalist, this was the jackpot. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1527.42s)]
*  I thought that no one would deny what happened back then, seeing that proof, seeing that [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1531.8999999999999s)]
*  horrible proof of a group of women being thrown alive into the ocean, being mothers [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1545.02s)]
*  and nuns, right? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1553.9s)]
*  Innocent people, completely innocent people. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1556.22s)]
*  The pilots of those death flights, they were hiding in plain sight. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1559.38s)]
*  It was a glimpse into the banality of evil. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1563.3000000000002s)]
*  Two of them were flying international commercial routes for Argentina's state airline. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1566.18s)]
*  Miriam and Giancarlo's investigation figured prominently in the largest and perhaps most [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1574.18s)]
*  sensational trial in the country's history. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1580.02s)]
*  In 2017, decades after the fact, an Argentine court convicted 48 people linked to ESMA for [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1582.9s)]
*  crimes against humanity. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1589.7s)]
*  The pilots who flew the Skyvan PA-51 death flights were sentenced to life in prison. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1591.78s)]
*  For Miriam and Giancarlo, there was one last assignment, bringing the Skyvan back from [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1599.78s)]
*  the United States to Argentina, where it would be a source of truth, irrefutable evidence [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1605.78s)]
*  of the horrors of the past. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1611.78s)]
*  Questioning, denying, or even vindicating what happened in those years will lead us [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1613.78s)]
*  into darkness again. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1624.78s)]
*  We always said, never again. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1626.78s)]
*  So it was on a misty morning in June 2023, the Skyvan PA-51 arrived at its final destination. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1630.78s)]
*  Giancarlo was there taking the last pictures of this personal odyssey, this 20-year investigation. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1638.78s)]
*  The families and friends of the victims were there as well. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1645.78s)]
*  You have to consider that I could have been a passenger of one of those flights. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1649.78s)]
*  So I always ask myself why I survived. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1654.78s)]
*  I wonder if this investigation helped provide an answer. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1658.78s)]
*  Yes. Now I know definitely that there was a goal, there was a purpose of my survival, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1663.78s)]
*  to get justice. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1672.78s)]
*  One mystery of Argentina's dictatorship finally solved. But most of the families of the 30,000 [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1676.78s)]
*  disappeared, never learned what happened to their loved ones. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1682.78s)]
*  When we come back, we'll tell you about one family's decades-long search for a missing baby. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1685.78s)]
*  Argentina returned to democracy in 1983, but the trauma from those seven years of dictatorship persists. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1702.78s)]
*  While more than a thousand military officials have been tried and convicted for kidnapping, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1709.78s)]
*  torturing, and murdering Argentine citizens, most of the families of the 30,000 disappeared [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1714.78s)]
*  never learned what happened to their loved ones. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1720.78s)]
*  Tonight, we'll tell you of one family's search for a baby stolen by the military in 1978. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1723.78s)]
*  It's a story about truth and memory, both of which have been attacked under the country's president, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1729.78s)]
*  Javier Millet, a populist leader who's vowed to make Argentina great again. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1734.78s)]
*  After years of economic stagnation and runaway inflation, in 2023, Argentina elected an economist as its president, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1740.78s)]
*  Javier Millet, a chainsaw-toting, self-proclaimed sex guru and true libertarian. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1750.78s)]
*  While he's met favor for revitalizing the national economy and slashing bureaucracy, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1757.78s)]
*  he's met criticism for his open sympathy for military rule, his denial of its brutality, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1762.78s)]
*  and his defunding of human rights programs. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1768.78s)]
*  After 40 years of democracy, we never thought we would have to fight against these denialists, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1772.78s)]
*  but we know the truth. We lost an election, but we won't give up. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1780.78s)]
*  We will resist, which is what we've done all our lives. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1784.78s)]
*  At age 94, Taty Almeida is the president of the Mothers of the Plaza de Maggio. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1792.78s)]
*  For half a century, she's been searching for her son Alejandro, who left for classes one day, never to return. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1797.78s)]
*  When they took the most precious thing a mother has, a child, we went out like lionesses looking for our cubs. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1804.78s)]
*  They called you los locos, the crazy ones. You didn't take that as an insult. Were you crazy? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1814.78s)]
*  We were crazy with pain, with rage, with helplessness, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1821.78s)]
*  because we mothers know what it's like to carry a child for nine months in the womb [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1829.78s)]
*  and then have it ripped away from you like that. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1836.78s)]
*  Twenty-five years ago, 60 Minutes correspondent Bob Simon came to the Plaza de Maggio [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1840.78s)]
*  to report on the story of Patricia Roizenblatt. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1846.78s)]
*  In 1978, she was eight months pregnant when she and her husband Jose were hauled away by armed government thugs. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1849.78s)]
*  Patricia was taken here to the Esma death camp. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1857.78s)]
*  Human rights groups estimate that 500 babies were born in camps to mothers kept alive only long enough to give birth before being killed. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1860.78s)]
*  In a systematic campaign, their stolen babies were then given to childless military couples. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1868.78s)]
*  Back then, Bob Simon spoke to Patricia's friend and fellow prisoner Miriam Lewin, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1874.78s)]
*  yes, the same investigative journalist who discovered the death plane. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1879.78s)]
*  Why did they keep the babies alive? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1883.78s)]
*  Maybe they thought of it as an act of humanity. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1885.78s)]
*  An act of humanity to take children away from the people they labeled enemies of the state and raise them as patriots? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1890.78s)]
*  Save the baby from the subversive germ of the baby's parents and grandparents. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1898.78s)]
*  That's right. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1905.78s)]
*  She remembered Patricia in the brief moments after her baby was born before he was taken away. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1906.78s)]
*  He was a beautiful and healthy baby boy, almost blonde, and she told me his name is going to be Rodolfo. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1912.78s)]
*  And she was smiling. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1924.78s)]
*  Patricia Rosenblit was never seen again, nor was her husband. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1929.78s)]
*  Her mother Rosa spent years searching police stations, hospitals, and orphanages for baby Rodolfo. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1933.78s)]
*  You and the other grandmothers have found 64 children. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1940.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1944.78s)]
*  You must be pretty good detectives. How do you do it? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1945.78s)]
*  Yes, we are detectives. We call each other detectives. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1948.78s)]
*  We call each other Sherlock Holmes. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1953.78s)]
*  But the search for her own grandchild Rodolfo was anything but elementary. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1955.78s)]
*  Rosa became a founding member of the Abuelas, or Grandmothers of the Plaza de Maggio. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1960.78s)]
*  She spent years searching for him. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1966.78s)]
*  She was joined by her granddaughter, Rodolfo's older sister Mariana. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1968.78s)]
*  She was in her early 20s when 60 Minutes interviewed her. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1973.78s)]
*  I have a lot of hope that he comes to realize that he's been living a lie and that he would come looking for me. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1977.78s)]
*  25 years later, we return to Buenos Aires. Today Mariana is 47 years old. Rosa is 105. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1984.78s)]
*  In 2000, just days after our initial report aired, Mariana received an anonymous tip about a man who might be her brother. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=1993.78s)]
*  His name? Guillermo Gomez. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2003.78s)]
*  He was working in a fast food restaurant in a Buenos Aires suburb. So she went to visit him. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2006.78s)]
*  You've been envisioning this moment for basically your whole life. What was the emotion? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2012.78s)]
*  At that moment I felt, I felt disassociated. I had a feeling of peace and relief and that everything would be okay. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2017.78s)]
*  You're 21 years old, you're working in a fast food restaurant, and all of a sudden one day a young woman comes in to see you. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2026.78s)]
*  What happened that day? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2034.78s)]
*  First of all, she asks me my full name. Most people don't go around asking people on the street their full name, with their whole identity, right? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2036.78s)]
*  That seems strange to me. I denied that I was her brother. I had a document with a different name and birth date. I didn't believe it. I didn't understand it. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2045.78s)]
*  It was a brief encounter, but before departing Mariana left him a book with photographs of the disappeared, including her parents. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2054.7799999999997s)]
*  When Guillermo saw the photograph of her father Jose, he was stunned. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2063.78s)]
*  It's like in a science fiction movie, when you see a picture of yourself in the past. It was a picture of me in the past. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2068.78s)]
*  I felt that Mariana's father didn't just look similar, but identical. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2076.78s)]
*  You felt that in your heart? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2080.78s)]
*  Yes, you could say that. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2082.78s)]
*  A photograph of a man that looked like him was one thing, but a DNA test could confirm his real parentage. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2084.78s)]
*  Did you hope it turned out one way or the other? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2091.78s)]
*  I was very afraid. At that moment, I didn't know who I was. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2093.78s)]
*  The results? Guillermo and Mariana were siblings. They tried to cut through time. It wasn't even a reunion, just a union. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2097.78s)]
*  But soon Guillermo learned the awful truth. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2106.78s)]
*  The couple who had raised him, Francisco Gomez and his wife Dora, had not only seized him after his mother Patricia's murder, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2109.78s)]
*  but Gomez, who worked in Argentina's Air Force Intelligence, had taken part in Patricia's capture. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2118.78s)]
*  How did it feel when you learned that not only were the people you thought were your parents for the first 20 years of your life weren't your parents, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2124.78s)]
*  but also they had abducted, they had appropriated you? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2130.78s)]
*  It's a very, very confusing time, because it's like all the ties that you have at that moment are cut, and you're absolutely alone. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2134.78s)]
*  From that moment of revelation, Guillermo's life cleaved into two parts, the lie and the painful search for truth as he rebuilt his identity [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2144.78s)]
*  and learned about his real parents whom he would never meet. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2153.78s)]
*  What is it like for you to see these pictures here? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2157.78s)]
*  It's necessary so that those who come here know they aren't just a number. They aren't just a grave that doesn't exist, you know? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2160.78s)]
*  They were people. They were people that had a life that was interrupted. They had dreams. They were ordinary people like the rest. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2168.78s)]
*  The Esma death camp achingly marks where he was born, and it's the site of his mother's death sentence just days later. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2176.78s)]
*  The worst thing is what happened to me here, in this place. That was the worst. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2185.78s)]
*  Where we are right now. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2190.78s)]
*  Of course. The worst is that I was born in captivity like a zoo animal. My mother was also kidnapped. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2191.78s)]
*  I was separated after three days. I was disappeared for 21 years. I'm a contradiction because I'm a disappeared person alive. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2198.78s)]
*  I'm a person who was missing without knowing I was missing. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2206.78s)]
*  Guillermo says his childhood was unhappy and that Gomez was violent. He sometimes hoped Gomez wasn't his real father. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2211.78s)]
*  Guillermo felt differently about Dora, who'd always tried her best, he says, to take care of him. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2219.78s)]
*  It seems to me something complicating this even more is that you have differentiated between how you feel about the man who raised you and the woman who raised you. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2225.78s)]
*  Well, they were two completely different people. I grew up being afraid of him, running away from him. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2235.78s)]
*  And she, for a long time, was practically my whole world. She was the person I called Mom. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2243.78s)]
*  Dora, the woman who raised you. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2249.78s)]
*  I see her and I love her and I need her in my life. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2251.78s)]
*  The only thing I wished for the person I had called Mom was for nothing to happen to her, for her not to go to jail. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2255.78s)]
*  But for Mariana and Rosa, Guillermo's relationship with Dora was a constant source of conflict. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2262.78s)]
*  It felt like a betrayal. They wanted consequences. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2268.78s)]
*  Every day, every morning when she woke him up, she knew she had stolen someone else's son. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2272.78s)]
*  And I don't forgive that. They stole a brother from me and they stole him for all my life. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2278.78s)]
*  Don't forgive and forget. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2284.78s)]
*  No. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2287.78s)]
*  Gomez appeared in court in 2016 and on the witness stand, Guillermo faced him and made one final plea. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2289.78s)]
*  I told him I needed to stop being in constant mourning for the death of my parents and that I needed to know when it happened, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2298.78s)]
*  who had been responsible for their deaths and where their remains are. And he chose to say nothing. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2305.78s)]
*  That's what he chose as his last act of cruelty, to say nothing. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2311.78s)]
*  Gomez was sentenced to 12 years in prison for Guillermo's abduction. Dora was sentenced to three. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2316.78s)]
*  After the trial, the siblings presented a unified front with their grandmother Rosa, but their relationship was all but doomed from the beginning. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2323.78s)]
*  So little in common apart from DNA. They were, after all, separated for two decades. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2331.78s)]
*  And there were struggles familiar to many siblings, jealousies, resentments, issues with money. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2338.78s)]
*  Life isn't a movie. I wish it was a Hollywood production and this had a happy ending. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2345.78s)]
*  The bottom line is, having been raised separated, not living together, we could never get over that distance between us. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2351.78s)]
*  You don't have a relationship. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2359.78s)]
*  We won't be the first or last siblings that don't have a relationship. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2361.78s)]
*  But she plays a very important role in my life, in my history, and I recognize how long she spent looking for me. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2366.78s)]
*  Today, a year into President Millet's rule amid his gutting austerity measures, these are convulsive times in Argentina. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2372.78s)]
*  When we were in Buenos Aires, Mariana, a celebrated artist and writer, was performing her latest experimental play to a packed audience. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2381.78s)]
*  It was about dictatorship, conjured memories, and her conflicted identity in the shadow of disappeared parents. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2390.78s)]
*  Do you ever wonder whether it would be easier not to have found him and just keep living with this fantasy, this mystery brother? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2397.78s)]
*  No, no, I don't regret it. Because I see the suffering of those who are still looking for a brother or sister. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2408.78s)]
*  I don't think that in any sense my life would be better if I was still looking for him because I would not have stopped for a moment. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2415.78s)]
*  I wouldn't be at peace. We all know the seriousness of what the military have done. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2421.78s)]
*  What's stealing the babies, raising them as their own children, lying to them. What happened broke everything. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2425.78s)]
*  So what's broken is broken. It's very difficult for us as a society to accept that it's broken forever. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2432.78s)]
*  But it's always better to know the most painful truth than not knowing the truth at all. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2439.78s)]
*  As for Guillermo, 25 years after meeting Mariana at the fast food restaurant, he's settled into his new identity. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ5ah0APN4&t=2445.78s)]
