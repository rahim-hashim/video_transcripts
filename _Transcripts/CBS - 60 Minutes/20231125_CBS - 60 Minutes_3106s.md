# Great Inventions | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw)
*  There are 7 billion people on the planet and nearly 5 billion cell phones, meaning most [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=0.0s)]
*  of the Earth's population is connected for sound, for picture, for heaven only knows [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  what else. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=24.28s)]
*  The cell phone has brought us a world without end of talking, twittering, texting, even [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=25.64s)]
*  of sexting. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=30.46s)]
*  If you don't know what that is, ask any high school kid. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=31.46s)]
*  It's all the result of Marty Cooper's big idea. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=34.68s)]
*  And he looks at it all with pride, amusement, and some dismay, and with good reason. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=39.04s)]
*  He's the father of the cell phone. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  He built the first one 37 years ago. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=47.0s)]
*  It ushered in a technological and social revolution which he believes is far from over. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=49.76s)]
*  He made the first public cell phone call on the sidewalks of New York in 1973. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=55.64s)]
*  This is a time when there were no cordless phones, and certainly no cell phones, and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=62.56s)]
*  here's this guy talking as he was walking along, and I stepped into the street and nearly [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=67.28s)]
*  got creamed by a New York taxi cab. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=72.16s)]
*  So talk about being prescient and seeing a picture of the future. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=75.4s)]
*  It's a future of non-stop connection of apps galore, iPhones and droids, blackberries, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=81.4s)]
*  and blue teeth, or is it blue tooth? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=88.0s)]
*  So you really like this thing, huh? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  Marty Cooper checks out the latest at the wireless industry's annual convention in Las [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=92.08s)]
*  Vegas. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  A huge convergence where geeks meet gizmos. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  How do I remove? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=103.12s)]
*  I know how to add a... [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  And unlike some of us of a certain age, he understands all of it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=105.88000000000001s)]
*  Do you tweet or Twitter? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=110.48s)]
*  I signed up for Twitter about six months ago, did nothing, and I had 17 followers. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=112.4s)]
*  So now I'm actually Twittering. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=118.48s)]
*  My latest Twitter is the secret of successful aging is to have good genes and to show a [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=123.2s)]
*  lot of respect for the genes. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=129.24s)]
*  You think you're the oldest Twitterer in America? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=131.36s)]
*  I don't want to be the oldest anything in America. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=134.72000000000003s)]
*  Sorry about that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=137.4s)]
*  But you'll have to look hard to find anyone older on the slopes at Vail, his favorite [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=139.36s)]
*  getaway. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  Marty Cooper was born in Chicago on the eve of the Great Depression. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=145.84s)]
*  He's 81, an age for many when the most strenuous exercise of the day is getting in and out [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  of bed. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  His tennis and his skiing are better than they've ever been. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=158.04s)]
*  I have a hard time keeping up with them. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=161.72s)]
*  And I'm almost 20 years younger. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=164.12s)]
*  With his wife Arlene, another veteran of the mobile phone business, Marty Cooper is still [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=167.28s)]
*  in the game, awaiting the next big thing in wireless communication. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  He's convinced that the cell phone at 37 is still in its infancy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=178.2s)]
*  It has to be invisible, transparent, just simple. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=184.88s)]
*  A modern cell phone in general has an instruction book that's bigger and heavier than the cell [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=189.16s)]
*  phone. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=195.68s)]
*  That's not right. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=196.68s)]
*  Call it the complexity or confusion factor. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=197.68s)]
*  You can use this device to connect up to five different computers or Wi-Fi capable devices [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=201.12s)]
*  at one time. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=206.6s)]
*  Really cool. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=207.6s)]
*  It's the future. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=208.6s)]
*  Welcome to the 21st century. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=209.6s)]
*  Cooper argues that cell phones designed to do everything, take pictures, play music and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=212.16s)]
*  videos, surf the web, don't do any of them really well. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=217.44s)]
*  He thinks the buyers should be dictating exactly what they want. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=222.04s)]
*  The consumer is king. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=226.28s)]
*  The consumer ought to make the decisions and not, certainly not the engineer. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  Because engineers try to dazzle other engineers rather than... [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=233.44s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=236.64s)]
*  Engineers tend to get enchanted by the technology itself. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=237.64s)]
*  You know what a jitterbug phone is. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=241.4s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=242.8s)]
*  So it seems only natural that the latest gadget developed by Cooper and his wife is a retro [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=243.8s)]
*  cell phone called the jitterbug. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=249.4s)]
*  A basic phone. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=251.44s)]
*  No camera, no music. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  Any idiot can operate it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=255.44s)]
*  Try it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=257.8s)]
*  What do you hear? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=258.8s)]
*  Dial tone. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=259.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=260.8s)]
*  If there's dial tone, you can call. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=261.8s)]
*  If there's no dial tone, you can't. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=264.4s)]
*  Why'd you drag me up here on the roof? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=266.0s)]
*  His next target, dropouts, lost calls. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=268.12s)]
*  Atop his office building, ugly conventional cell phone antennas are disguised as flag [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=272.0s)]
*  poles. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=277.4s)]
*  They cover all of this area. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=278.4s)]
*  He's developing so-called smart antennas that can cut through all the competing noise in [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=279.64s)]
*  the radio environment to get your call through. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=284.88s)]
*  And what they do is when we transmit, we send the information only to your phone. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=289.08s)]
*  I mean, we will reach the day when each cell phone will be perfect. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=295.52s)]
*  Or as perfect as a landlock. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=302.84s)]
*  What has Marty Cooper wrought? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=305.12s)]
*  Let us go for a moment back to the future. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=307.76s)]
*  New York calling all cars for a preview of tomorrow. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=311.15999999999997s)]
*  The cell's precursor, the car telephone, came in right after World War II. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=314.8s)]
*  World of wonders. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  If someone was sick, you could track down the doctor on the road. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  Remember these were the quaint old days when doctors, at least in newsreels, made house [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=339.12s)]
*  calls. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=344.56s)]
*  Even then it was clear that being connected would put everyone on a very short leash. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=348.76s)]
*  George, I forgot to tell you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=354.48s)]
*  Now get me two dozen oranges, two loaves of bread, twenty pounds of potatoes, five pounds [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=355.48s)]
*  of sugar, two pounds of... [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=359.48s)]
*  And when in the 60s AT&T developed more sophisticated cellular antennas, the phone giant still considered [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=360.48s)]
*  car phones the name of the game. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=368.76s)]
*  But Marty Cooper and his engineers at Motorola thought otherwise and decided to elbow their [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  way into the business. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=377.48s)]
*  We really had a basic understanding that people are mobile and it's personal telephones they [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  want. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=385.88s)]
*  It's handheld portables. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=386.88s)]
*  So there was a real conflict between this elephant that was AT&T and this fly that was [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=387.88s)]
*  Motorola. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=395.08000000000004s)]
*  But we ended up winning. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=398.0s)]
*  On a chilly spring day, we took Cooper back to the spot where he made that first call. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=400.46000000000004s)]
*  6th Avenue outside the New York Hilton. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=406.08s)]
*  For the record, the call went to Joel Engel, Cooper's rival at AT&T. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=409.35999999999996s)]
*  I said, Joel, this is Marty Cooper. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=414.68s)]
*  He says, hi. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=417.28s)]
*  I'm calling you from a cellular phone. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=419.2s)]
*  But a real cellular phone, a handheld portable cellular phone. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=423.4s)]
*  There was silence on the end of the line. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=427.64s)]
*  You could not resist rubbing it in. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=429.88s)]
*  Oh, no question about it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=432.03999999999996s)]
*  Wait for a dial tone, which I hope you'll be able to hear too. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=433.92s)]
*  There it is. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  At a news conference inside the Hilton, Cooper introduced his gadget and encouraged reporters [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=437.96000000000004s)]
*  to try it out. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=444.0s)]
*  The first reporter I talked to actually called her mother in Australia. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=445.42s)]
*  And she was astounded when her mother answered. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=450.12s)]
*  She couldn't understand how this little phone could talk halfway across the earth, which [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=452.24s)]
*  of course it didn't. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=456.66s)]
*  Little phone? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=457.66s)]
*  What are you talking about, little phone? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=458.66s)]
*  Well, relatively small. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=460.36s)]
*  After all, it only weighed two and a half pounds. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=463.6s)]
*  And now I hang it up. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=466.32000000000005s)]
*  And the only thing I can say is, what will I think of next? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=468.64000000000004s)]
*  It's still a good question. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=472.52000000000004s)]
*  Where is cell phone technology going? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=474.40000000000003s)]
*  I think we are just barely scratching the surface. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=477.08000000000004s)]
*  Take the issue of health and fitness. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=481.32000000000005s)]
*  A workout fanatic, if there ever was one, Cooper says the day is fast approaching when [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=483.44s)]
*  your phone or something like it will be checking your vital signs day and night. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=490.47999999999996s)]
*  The healthcare industry is going to be revolutionized because you will have sensors at various points [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=496.64s)]
*  of your body measuring different things. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=503.4s)]
*  And a computer somewhere, or maybe a doctor, will be examining you all the time. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=506.52s)]
*  And the whole concept demonstration is built for the diabetic audience. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=513.12s)]
*  It's not that far-fetched. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=516.4399999999999s)]
*  Health monitoring was a major theme at that recent wireless convention in Las Vegas. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=518.52s)]
*  The concept of the annual physical examination, it's almost worthless because looking at your [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=524.52s)]
*  body at a point in time doesn't really tell doctors very much at all. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=530.96s)]
*  But if you could measure these things all the time, you can predict heart failures, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=535.9399999999999s)]
*  you can predict diabetes, and you can prevent all these things. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=541.02s)]
*  From his hideaway overlooking the Pacific and Southern California, Cooper contemplates [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=545.12s)]
*  a society where such familiar touchstones like money and credit cards, simple human [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=550.36s)]
*  contacts are things of the past, replaced by wireless devices that will rule our lives. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=556.88s)]
*  Isn't there almost a brave new world sense behind all of this being connected? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=563.92s)]
*  What does it do to our privacy? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=570.64s)]
*  Privacy is a thing of the past. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=574.2s)]
*  He's got a point. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=577.0s)]
*  Security cameras track our movements. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=578.6800000000001s)]
*  Cell phones hold clues to what we've read, where we've been, and where we are. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=580.76s)]
*  Police track down suspects on Facebook. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=586.0s)]
*  And police states can no longer suppress instant images of their repression. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=589.52s)]
*  I think the whole concept of privacy requires a new mindset among people. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=595.32s)]
*  There are people that object to somebody monitoring their buying habits. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=600.0s)]
*  I'm delighted if people know what I buy because they're going to tailor their marketing to [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=605.08s)]
*  me and the products that are available to me to my taste. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=610.68s)]
*  Well, it's a good thing. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=614.36s)]
*  Well, yes and no. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=616.16s)]
*  Hiding something is a kind of undeniable human right, you know, to have some sense of a private life. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=618.0s)]
*  The next gizmo can start reading our thoughts. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=626.52s)]
*  And who wants that? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=629.6s)]
*  They're not going to be able to read our minds for a few generations if ever. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=630.6s)]
*  But they're working on it though. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=634.76s)]
*  Yes, they are. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=636.64s)]
*  The reason it was so huge is we had to put so much in it. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=637.64s)]
*  Cooper is annoyed, as we all are, by his cell phone, which butted in as we were discussing [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=641.12s)]
*  the gadget's history. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=647.0799999999999s)]
*  We never would have... [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=648.0799999999999s)]
*  Sorry about that. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=650.0799999999999s)]
*  I just got a notification from my... [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=652.64s)]
*  I thought you had an error or a budgie in here. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=655.64s)]
*  My droid came with me and it says, droid, every time I get an email message in. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=659.64s)]
*  So I corrected it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=665.64s)]
*  Now it goes, beep. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=666.64s)]
*  And he's philosophical on the topic of bad phone manners, that worldwide curse of other [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=668.64s)]
*  people's chatter, sound and fury signifying nothing. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=675.64s)]
*  You know, it doesn't take a telephone to make people be either stupid or rude. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=681.0400000000001s)]
*  They're going to be both of those. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=687.9200000000001s)]
*  So get used to it and don't take it out on the phone. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=689.0400000000001s)]
*  When I throw this against the wall... [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=692.44s)]
*  They're making them shockproof and waterproof anyway. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=694.44s)]
*  Let's say if you spilled something on it... [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=697.44s)]
*  And besides, as the future bears down on us, Marty Cooper says eventually man and machine [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=699.76s)]
*  will become one. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=706.32s)]
*  The optimum telephone is one that I think someday is going to be embedded behind your [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=707.8s)]
*  ear. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=712.3599999999999s)]
*  It's going to have an extraordinarily powerful computer running the cell phone. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=713.3599999999999s)]
*  And I'm going to name my computer Sam and I'm going to say, Sam, get Morley on the phone [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=718.76s)]
*  for me. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=723.12s)]
*  And Sam's going to respond in my ear. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=724.68s)]
*  Which Morley? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=727.8399999999999s)]
*  Is this your cousin Morley in Toronto or the Morley Safer in New York? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=728.8399999999999s)]
*  And I'm going to say, Morley Safer. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=732.9599999999999s)]
*  And the next thing you know I'm going to be talking to you. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=734.56s)]
*  Back in the 1980s, a laboratory of misfits foresaw our future. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=737.8s)]
*  Touch screens, automated driving instructions, wearable technology and electronic ink were [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=753.52s)]
*  all developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in a place they call the Media [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=759.92s)]
*  Lab. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=765.68s)]
*  It's a research lab and graduate school program that long ago outgrew its name. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=767.0s)]
*  Today, it's creating technologies to grow food in the desert, control our dreams and [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=772.28s)]
*  connect the human brain to the internet. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=778.84s)]
*  Come have a look at what we found in a place that you could call the future factory. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=781.84s)]
*  To Arnav Kapoor, a graduate student in the Media Lab, the future is silent. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=788.06s)]
*  He's developed a system to surf the internet with his mind. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=794.4s)]
*  What happens is when you're reading or when you're talking to yourself, your brain transmits [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=798.64s)]
*  electrical signals to your vocal cords. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=802.16s)]
*  You can actually pick these signals up and you can get certain clues as to what the person [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=804.8s)]
*  intends to speak. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=810.54s)]
*  So the brain is sending an electrical signal for a word that you would normally speak, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=811.88s)]
*  but your device is intercepting that signal. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=819.32s)]
*  It is. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=822.64s)]
*  So instead of speaking the word, your device is sending it into a computer. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=823.64s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=827.92s)]
*  That's unbelievable. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=829.08s)]
*  Let's see how this works. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=830.08s)]
*  So we tried it. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=831.36s)]
*  What is 45,689 divided by 67? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=832.9s)]
*  Short. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=839.6s)]
*  He silently asks the computer and then hears the answer through vibrations transmitted [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=841.0s)]
*  through his skull and into his inner ear. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=846.76s)]
*  Six, eight, one, point nine, two, five. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=850.04s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=859.4s)]
*  One more. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=861.16s)]
*  What's the largest city in Bulgaria and what is the population? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=862.16s)]
*  The screen shows how long it takes the computer to read the words that he's saying to himself. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=867.48s)]
*  Sofia, 1.1 million. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=874.16s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=876.12s)]
*  You just Googled that. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=877.92s)]
*  I did. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=879.44s)]
*  You could be an expert in any subject. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=880.44s)]
*  You have the entire internet in your head. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=882.6800000000001s)]
*  That's the idea. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=886.24s)]
*  Ideas are the currency of MIT's Media Lab. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=888.96s)]
*  The lab is a six-story tower of babble where 230 graduate students speak dialects of art, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=893.16s)]
*  engineering, biology, physics, and coding, all translated into innovation. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=900.96s)]
*  The Media Lab is this glorious mixture, this renaissance, where we break down these formal [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=908.4399999999999s)]
*  disciplines and we mix it all up and we see what pops out. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=914.3199999999999s)]
*  That's the magic, that intellectual diversity. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=918.0799999999999s)]
*  Hugh Herr is a professor who leads an advanced prosthetics lab. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=921.36s)]
*  And what do you get from that? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=925.72s)]
*  You get this craziness when you put a toy designer next to a person that's thinking [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=927.92s)]
*  about what instruments will look like in the future next to someone like me that's interfacing [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=932.68s)]
*  machines to the nervous system. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=937.0799999999999s)]
*  You get really weird technologies. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=939.28s)]
*  You get things that no one could have conceived of. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=943.0s)]
*  The Media Lab was conceived in a 1984 proposal. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=947.3199999999999s)]
*  MIT's Nicholas Negroponte wrote, computers are media that will lead to interactive systems. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=951.4399999999999s)]
*  He predicted the rise of flat panel displays, HDTVs, and news whenever you want it. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=959.1999999999999s)]
*  Negroponte became co-founder of the lab and its director for 20 years. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=967.0799999999999s)]
*  When we were demonstrating these things in let's say, 85, 86, 87, it was really considered [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=971.68s)]
*  new. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=980.68s)]
*  It looked like magic. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=981.68s)]
*  It was indistinguishable from magic. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=982.68s)]
*  In 1979, MIT developed MovieMap, which predated Google Street View by decades. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=988.3599999999999s)]
*  We were going north on Aspen Street. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=995.04s)]
*  Now notice what's so common today that you didn't even notice it. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=997.52s)]
*  He's touching the screen. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1001.68s)]
*  If you had seen that on 60 Minutes in the 80s, you would have been amazed. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1003.8399999999999s)]
*  And you might have been dazzled by one of the earliest flat screens. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1008.8s)]
*  It was six inches by six inches, black and white. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1013.12s)]
*  It was a $500,000 piece of glass. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1016.9599999999999s)]
*  It cost a half a million dollars. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1019.0799999999999s)]
*  It cost half a million dollars, that piece of glass. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1020.68s)]
*  And I said, that piece of glass will be six feet in diagonal with millions of pixels in [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1023.6s)]
*  full color. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1030.68s)]
*  In 1997, the lab also gave birth to the grandfather of Siri and Alexa. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1032.48s)]
*  Nomatic, wake up. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1038.16s)]
*  Okay, I'm listening. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1039.6000000000001s)]
*  Go to my email. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1041.38s)]
*  Where do you want to go? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1042.38s)]
*  And in 1989, it created turn-by-turn navigation that it called Backseat Driver. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1044.88s)]
*  We're right at the stop sign. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1051.56s)]
*  And the MIT patent lawyers looked at it and said, this will never happen, never be done, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1053.56s)]
*  because the insurance companies won't allow it, so we're not going to patent it. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1058.8s)]
*  Look through the glass-walled labs today, and you will witness 400 projects in the making. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1063.32s)]
*  The lab is developing pacemaker batteries recharged by the beating of the heart, self-driving [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1069.6s)]
*  taxi tricycles that you summon with your phone. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1075.94s)]
*  Humans that do retinal eye exams. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1079.92s)]
*  Ariana, I will tell you two stories. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1081.96s)]
*  And teaching robots. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1086.0s)]
*  So we think that the devices of tomorrow have an opportunity to do so much more and to fit [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1088.1200000000001s)]
*  better in our lives. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1093.6000000000001s)]
*  Professor Patti Maas ran the graduate program student admissions for more than a decade. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1096.2s)]
*  We really select for people who have a passion. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1101.48s)]
*  We don't have to tell them to work hard. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1105.3600000000001s)]
*  We have to tell them to work less hard and to get sleep occasionally. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1108.1599999999999s)]
*  How often does a student come to you with an idea and you think, we're not going to [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1113.04s)]
*  do that? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1117.28s)]
*  Actually, for us, the crazier the better. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1118.28s)]
*  Adam Hor Horowitz's idea was so nutty, he was one of 50 new students admitted last year [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1123.04s)]
*  out of 1,300 applications. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1129.4399999999998s)]
*  I was really interested in a state of sleep where you start to dream before you're fully [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1132.32s)]
*  unconscious, where you keep coming up with ideas right as you're about to go to sleep. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1136.24s)]
*  Time to go to sleep. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1141.04s)]
*  Hor Horowitz's system plants ideas for dreams. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1142.64s)]
*  Remember to think of a mountain. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1146.6s)]
*  Then records conversations with the dreamer during that semi conscious moment before you [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1148.52s)]
*  fall asleep. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1154.56s)]
*  Tell me what are you thinking? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1155.88s)]
*  I'm doing an origami pyramid. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1157.92s)]
*  Her origami pyramid dream was influenced by the robot saying the word mountain. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1161.64s)]
*  It's long been believed that this is the moment when the mind is its most creative. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1167.84s)]
*  Hor Horowitz hopes to capture ideas that we often lose by the next morning. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1173.3600000000001s)]
*  So it's basically like a conversation. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1179.04s)]
*  You can ask, hey, Jibo, I'd like to dream about a rabbit tonight. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1180.8s)]
*  It would watch for that trigger of unconsciousness. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1184.32s)]
*  And then right as you're hitting the lip, it triggers you with the audio and it asks [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1186.76s)]
*  What is it that you're thinking about? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1190.72s)]
*  You record all that sleep talking and then later when you wake up fully, you can ask [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1192.56s)]
*  for those recordings. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1197.04s)]
*  And when he brought this idea to you, what did you think? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1198.56s)]
*  Really? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1201.92s)]
*  Crazy enough. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1202.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1203.92s)]
*  Welcome to the world of bodies and motions. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1204.92s)]
*  Nearby in Hugh Her's lab, Everett Lawson's brain is connected to his prosthetic foot, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1207.96s)]
*  a replacement for the club foot he was born with. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1214.68s)]
*  The very definition of a leg or a limb or an ankle is going to dramatically change with [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1217.68s)]
*  what they're doing. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1223.16s)]
*  It isn't just whole. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1224.16s)]
*  It's 150 percent. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1225.48s)]
*  You feel directly connected, huh? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1227.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1230.3600000000001s)]
*  When I fire a muscle really fast, it makes its full sweep. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1231.3600000000001s)]
*  Her's team has electronically connected the computers in the robotic foot with the muscles [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1235.1200000000001s)]
*  and nerves in Lawson's leg. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1240.76s)]
*  He's not only able to control via his thoughts. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1243.2800000000002s)]
*  He can actually feel the design synthetic limb. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1246.2s)]
*  He feels the joints moving as if the joints are made of skin and bone. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1250.04s)]
*  For Professor Her, necessity was the mother of invention. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1256.2s)]
*  He lost his legs to frostbite at age 17 after he was stranded by a winter storm while mountain [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1260.56s)]
*  climbing. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1267.3600000000001s)]
*  Through that recovery process, my limbs are amputated. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1268.3600000000001s)]
*  I design my own limbs. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1271.96s)]
*  I return to my sport of mountain climbing. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1273.28s)]
*  I was climbing better than I'd achieve with normal biological limbs. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1276.0s)]
*  That experience was so inspiring because I realized the power of technology to heal, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1280.44s)]
*  to rehabilitate and even extend human capability beyond natural physiological levels. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1286.48s)]
*  You developed the legs that you're wearing today. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1293.16s)]
*  Each leg has three computers actually and 12 sensors. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1295.96s)]
*  They run these computations based on the sensory information that's coming in. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1299.52s)]
*  And then what's controlled is a motor system, like muscle, that drives me as I walk, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1304.0s)]
*  enable me to walk at different speeds. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1309.6s)]
*  What will this mean for people with disabilities? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1312.64s)]
*  Technology is freeing. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1317.12s)]
*  It removes the shackles of disability from humans. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1318.12s)]
*  And the vision of the Media Lab is that one day through advances in technologies, we will [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1321.44s)]
*  eliminate all disability. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1327.24s)]
*  The current director of the Media Lab is Joey Ito, a four-time college dropout and [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1331.28s)]
*  one of those misfits that the lab prefers. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1336.76s)]
*  After success in high-tech venture capital, he came here to preside over the lab's 30 [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1340.52s)]
*  faculty and a $75 million annual budget. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1345.76s)]
*  How do you pay for all this? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1350.04s)]
*  So we have 90 companies that pay us a membership fee to join the consortium. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1351.84s)]
*  And then because it's all coming into one pot, I can distribute the funds to our faculty [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1358.44s)]
*  and students and they don't have to write grant proposals. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1363.96s)]
*  They don't have to ask for permission. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1366.2800000000002s)]
*  They just make things. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1367.96s)]
*  Do any of these companies lean on you from time to time and say, hey, we need some product [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1369.52s)]
*  here? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1374.6000000000001s)]
*  I fired companies for that. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1375.6000000000001s)]
*  You fired them? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1377.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've told companies you're too bottom-line-oriented, maybe we're not right for you. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1378.0s)]
*  The sponsors, which include LEGO, the Toymaker, Toshiba, Exxon Mobil and General Electric, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1383.48s)]
*  get first crack at inventions. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1389.88s)]
*  The lab holds 302 patents and counting. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1392.32s)]
*  Caleb Harper's idea is so big it doesn't fit in the building, so MIT donated the site [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1397.88s)]
*  of an abandoned particle accelerator for this trained architect who is now building farms. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1403.66s)]
*  He calls these food computers, farms where conditions are perfect. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1411.84s)]
*  They're all capable of controlling climate. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1417.08s)]
*  So they make a recipe. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1419.32s)]
*  This much CO2, this much O2, this temperature. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1421.1999999999998s)]
*  So we create a world in a box. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1424.06s)]
*  Most people understand if you say, oh, the tomatoes in Tuscany on the North Slope taste [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1426.1s)]
*  so good and you can't get them anywhere else. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1430.8799999999999s)]
*  That's those genetics under those conditions that cause that beautiful tomato. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1433.52s)]
*  So we study that inside of these boxes with sensors and the ability to control climate. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1438.44s)]
*  Tuscany in a box? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1442.64s)]
*  Tuscany in a box, Napa in a box, Bordeaux in a box. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1443.76s)]
*  Now these are plants you're growing in air. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1447.0800000000002s)]
*  These basil plants grow not in soil but in air. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1450.3600000000001s)]
*  The plant is super happy. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1453.68s)]
*  No dirt. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1455.1200000000001s)]
*  Air saturated with a custom mix of moisture and nutrients. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1456.4s)]
*  So each one of these are drops that drops down to the reservoir. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1460.56s)]
*  The food computers grow almost anything, anywhere. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1463.14s)]
*  What have you learned about cotton farming? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1467.4s)]
*  So cotton is actually a perennial plant, which means it would grow the whole year long. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1469.48s)]
*  But it's treated like an annual. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1475.1200000000001s)]
*  We have a season. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1476.2800000000002s)]
*  So in this environment, since it's perfect for cotton, we've had plants go 12 months. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1477.2800000000002s)]
*  So how many crops can you get in a controlled environment like this? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1482.02s)]
*  You can crop up to four or five seasons. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1485.2s)]
*  We're growing on average three to four times faster than they can grow in the field. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1487.6000000000001s)]
*  The uncommon growth of the media lab flows from its refusal to be bound to goals, contracts, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1492.98s)]
*  or next quarter's profits. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1499.78s)]
*  It is simply a ship of exploration going wherever a crazy idea may lead. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1502.26s)]
*  We get to think about the future. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1509.46s)]
*  What does the world look like 10 years, 20 years, 30 years? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1511.5s)]
*  What should it look like? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1514.2s)]
*  The best way to predict the future is to invent it. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1516.02s)]
*  If you've ever had the fantasy of soaring over bumper to bumper traffic in a flying [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1522.98s)]
*  vehicle, that may be possible sooner than you think. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1532.22s)]
*  Not with a flying car, but with a battery powered aircraft called an EVTOL, a clunky [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1535.66s)]
*  acronym for electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1540.7s)]
*  As we first reported in April, dozens of companies are spending billions of dollars to make EVTOLs [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1545.02s)]
*  that will operate like air taxis, taking off and landing from what are called vertiports [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1551.06s)]
*  on the tops of buildings, parking garages, or helipads in congested cities. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1556.3799999999999s)]
*  EVTOLs promise a faster, safer, and greener mode of transportation, potentially changing [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1561.78s)]
*  the way we work and live. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1567.46s)]
*  Sound too good to be true? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1569.4199999999998s)]
*  We went for a joyride to find out. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1571.3s)]
*  I will arm the aircraft if you are ready. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1574.22s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1577.06s)]
*  Confirm clear of both. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1578.06s)]
*  If this looks like an oversized drone I'm about to take off in, that's pretty much what [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1580.56s)]
*  it is. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1584.8799999999999s)]
*  Breaking ground right there. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1585.8799999999999s)]
*  It's a single-seat EVTOL called HEXA, powered by 18 propellers, each with its own battery, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1588.6399999999999s)]
*  no jet fuel required. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1595.08s)]
*  You are in control. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1597.3s)]
*  Onboard computers automatically adjust for altitude and wind. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1599.6s)]
*  I can really feel the wind up there. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1603.36s)]
*  So all I had to do was use a joystick to control HEXA's movement and speed. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1605.76s)]
*  It took about 30 minutes of pre-flight training to get the hang of it. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1610.24s)]
*  Use that yaw to rotate 90 degrees. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1614.84s)]
*  Wonderful. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1618.84s)]
*  HEXA is still in its testing phase, so I had to stay close to Chief Pilot, Chase McCown, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1620.8s)]
*  and his ground crew. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1626.4s)]
*  But they say it's flown up to 195 feet in the air to 24 miles per hour. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1627.4s)]
*  Whenever you're ready, you can come back to home. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1633.12s)]
*  The batteries last up to 15 minutes. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1635.26s)]
*  I was going to throw it over the camera. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1637.74s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1639.78s)]
*  To land, I maneuvered HEXA into position, pressed a button, and the computers did the [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1640.78s)]
*  rest. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1645.86s)]
*  Right there. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1646.86s)]
*  You are on the ground and the propellers spinning down. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1647.86s)]
*  That is cool. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1651.46s)]
*  I can't stop laughing. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1653.46s)]
*  Piece of cake, right? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1655.46s)]
*  That was awesome. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1656.46s)]
*  That is so much fun. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1657.46s)]
*  Wow. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1658.46s)]
*  I so just want to like take off with it. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1659.46s)]
*  I know. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1662.26s)]
*  Matt Chason is CEO of Austin-based Lyft Aircraft, which makes HEXA. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1663.26s)]
*  He envisions a future where it's used by commuters to skip rush hour traffic. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1667.7s)]
*  You can fly 10 miles in 10 minutes, instead of spending over an hour on the roads during [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1672.86s)]
*  rush hour congestion. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1679.66s)]
*  Would it be something that an individual then in the future owns and flies from their house [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1681.14s)]
*  to somewhere? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1685.3s)]
*  We don't see individual ownership as very practical. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1686.3s)]
*  These are very expensive aircraft. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1688.58s)]
*  We see putting fleets of aircraft at locations where we provide maintenance, we provide training, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1690.64s)]
*  and people can come in and basically pay per flight. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1697.72s)]
*  But that's still a long way off. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1700.68s)]
*  Federal, state, and local regulators, not to mention the nation's airspace, aren't ready [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1702.76s)]
*  for hundreds of thousands of commuters piloting their own EV tolls in the skies over congested [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1707.5600000000002s)]
*  cities. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1713.5200000000002s)]
*  So, to give people a taste of the future now, Chason designed HEXA as an ultralight vehicle, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1715.0s)]
*  which means it doesn't have to go through the Federal Aviation Administration's complex [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1720.4s)]
*  certification process, but also can't fly over populated areas. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1724.52s)]
*  Chason plans to start offering rides to paying customers for $250 by the end of this year. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1729.96s)]
*  The initial market you see is essentially joy rides for people. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1736.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a huge market for people to just experience the thrill and joy of flight. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1739.76s)]
*  Around the world, all kinds of EV tolls are being developed. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1748.12s)]
*  Cargo carriers, air ambulances, and a whole lot of air taxis, some with a pilot, some [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1751.76s)]
*  without. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1758.32s)]
*  The Air Force is investing, so is Airbus and American Airlines, and dozens of companies [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1759.8s)]
*  are already working with the FAA. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1765.48s)]
*  It's not the flying cars that science fiction movies anticipated. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1768.6s)]
*  No, but when you think about it, I look back over the arc of my own career, having been [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1772.48s)]
*  a pilot for 42 years, and I'm just amazed by the amount of innovation that has taken [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1777.36s)]
*  place. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1782.76s)]
*  Billy Nolan was head of safety for the FAA before being named acting administrator in [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1783.76s)]
*  March. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1788.48s)]
*  How difficult a certification process is there, because there's a lot of moving parts to this. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1789.52s)]
*  First, we have to certify the design of the aircraft itself, and then we look at how it [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1794.08s)]
*  will operate. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1799.52s)]
*  Is it piloted? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1800.52s)]
*  Is it autonomous? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1801.52s)]
*  We look at where it will operate, so that means how do we put it within our nation's [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1802.72s)]
*  airspace. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1806.6s)]
*  So, once it's met that safety threshold, and only until it's met that safety threshold, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1807.6s)]
*  will we be prepared to certify it. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1812.8799999999999s)]
*  Some EV toll companies are well on their way. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1816.1999999999998s)]
*  We flew in a gas-guzzling helicopter with one of the frontrunners in this air taxi arms [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1819.3999999999999s)]
*  race, Joe Ben Bevert, CEO of Joby Aviation. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1824.1599999999999s)]
*  He took us to this remote facility in California, where he was testing his EV toll Joby aircraft. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1828.1999999999998s)]
*  As we landed, it felt like the old guard meeting the new. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1834.6399999999999s)]
*  Obviously, it's a combination of a helicopter and a plane. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1839.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1842.76s)]
*  So, it can take off like a helicopter, but it flies with the efficiency of an airplane. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1843.76s)]
*  Bevert has been working on the Joby for more than a decade. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1847.08s)]
*  It has six propellers and four batteries in its wings and will operate as an air taxi, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1849.96s)]
*  carrying a pilot and four passengers. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1855.84s)]
*  He says it can fly 150 miles on a single charge and has a top speed of around 200 miles an hour. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1858.72s)]
*  Why this design? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1866.6s)]
*  So, vertical takeoff is important so it can take you to where you want to go, right? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1867.6s)]
*  We don't need a huge runway. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1872.52s)]
*  And then with the wing, it gives you the efficiency to fly far and to fly fast. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1874.56s)]
*  Because it's still being tested, the Joby was piloted remotely by a nearby ground crew. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1881.24s)]
*  When they fired up the motors, unlike a helicopter, the Joby didn't need time to warm up. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1887.32s)]
*  It took off in about 20 seconds. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1893.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1897.3999999999999s)]
*  That's really quiet. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1898.3999999999999s)]
*  We wanted this to sound more like the wind in the trees than the wop wop of a helicopter. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1900.24s)]
*  Noise levels are a critical issue since EV tolls are meant to take off and land near [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1905.04s)]
*  where people work and live. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1909.56s)]
*  This is below the background noise level of many cities. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1911.84s)]
*  I go around with my decibel meter on my phone and measure sound levels. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1914.84s)]
*  That's what you've been doing for 10 years? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1918.92s)]
*  Exactly, because we needed to make sure that the aircraft was going to be quiet enough. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1920.56s)]
*  Bevert studied mechanical engineering at Stanford, where he invented this popular flexible camera [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1925.04s)]
*  tripod, and later created a company that made flying wind turbines. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1930.76s)]
*  But the Joby had remained an elusive dream. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1934.0s)]
*  There were definitely skeptics, even good friends of mine, who didn't believe that you [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1937.92s)]
*  could make this with batteries and electric propulsion. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1943.88s)]
*  The battery technology just wasn't there. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1946.52s)]
*  It wouldn't work. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1948.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1949.48s)]
*  Bevert hired John Wagner away from Tesla, where he helped develop the car's revolutionary [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1950.48s)]
*  batteries. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1955.88s)]
*  At Joby, he figured out a way to make the batteries lighter, but still powerful enough [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1956.96s)]
*  to get the two-ton EV toll off the ground. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1961.2800000000002s)]
*  You had to play to the strengths of battery power and the strengths of electric motors. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1964.48s)]
*  So a typical aircraft might have one big motor, but we can have six motors distributed throughout [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1969.0800000000002s)]
*  the aircraft and in that way operate in a much more efficient manner. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1973.96s)]
*  The weight of everything must be the most important thing. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1978.0400000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1981.5200000000002s)]
*  So how do you make a plane as light as possible? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=1982.5200000000002s)]

*  They have to certify the aircraft as being safe and capable of flying to their standards. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2006.02s)]
*  They also have to certify the production of all the parts of it. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2011.8999999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2016.4s)]
*  And the operation, the pilot training, the maintenance steps, every facet is heavily [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2017.4s)]
*  regulated. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2022.24s)]
*  All this costs a lot of money. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2023.52s)]
*  Toyota has invested about $400 million in Joby and Bevert took the company public last [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2025.3600000000001s)]
*  year. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2030.84s)]
*  Billionaire Paul Sciara, co-founder of the website Pinterest, has also put in a small [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2033.3600000000001s)]

*  will eventually end up paying around $3 to $4 a mile to fly, a little more than an average [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2044.12s)]
*  Uber ride. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2049.8s)]
*  Can you just take me through as a passenger what it looks like? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2050.8s)]
*  I want to get to JFK Airport. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2053.68s)]
*  It's bumper to bumper traffic. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2055.92s)]
*  What do I do? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2057.4s)]
*  Take out your phone, pull out an app, and with one click, you're booking the whole trip. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2058.48s)]
*  So a car is coming to wherever you are in Manhattan. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2063.2799999999997s)]
*  It's taking you to the takeoff and landing location, the Virta port. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2065.92s)]
*  And you're hopping in your Joby and it's flying you to your final destination. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2070.08s)]
*  Now, maybe there's a car at the other end or you're just walking to the tail end. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2073.7200000000003s)]
*  If people are taking cars to and from Virta ports, doesn't that just add to congestion? [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2077.0s)]
*  If we're able to take out 80 percent of the miles that people might be traveling and move [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2082.6400000000003s)]
*  those miles from congested roads to the air, I think that's going to have an impact. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2089.52s)]
*  But just a few weeks after we saw this Joby aircraft fly, it crashed in February due to [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2094.6800000000003s)]
*  what federal investigators called a component failure. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2100.44s)]
*  No one was hurt, but the eVTOL was totaled. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2103.92s)]
*  Bevert says that's all part of the testing process and is as optimistic now as he was [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2107.56s)]
*  when we interviewed him. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2112.92s)]
*  How far are you from getting the first Joby in the sky with passengers? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2114.76s)]
*  So we are launching our service in 2024. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2119.6400000000003s)]
*  You think you can do it that quickly? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2121.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2123.32s)]
*  There have been, though, a lot of companies that have said, oh, we're going to do this [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2124.32s)]
*  in two years and then it doesn't happen. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2126.1600000000003s)]
*  We're very confident. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2129.44s)]
*  There's a lot of confidence over at Whisk Aero as well, though the eVTOL they're developing [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2132.0s)]
*  will be even more complicated to bring to market because it's fully autonomous. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2137.08s)]
*  There'll be passengers, but no pilot on board. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2141.56s)]
*  You're not just figuring out an electric vehicle. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2145.6s)]
*  You're figuring out a fully autonomous flying vehicle. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2148.82s)]
*  That's right. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2152.12s)]
*  We're going for it. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2153.12s)]
*  You and I talked about that. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2154.12s)]
*  CEO Gary Gyssen says they're on track to spend about $2 billion. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2157.52s)]
*  The company is bankrolled by Boeing and Google co-founder Larry Page. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2161.0s)]
*  They've been testing the technology for the last eight years. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2165.52s)]
*  So how many test flights have you actually done? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2171.92s)]
*  So close to 1,600 test flights without an incident. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2173.9s)]
*  We watched one of those test flights in Hollister, California. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2180.2400000000002s)]
*  A team of engineers about half a mile away started the eVTOL with the click of a mouse. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2183.04s)]
*  The entire route was pre-programmed. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2190.8s)]
*  Why autonomous? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2197.4s)]
*  Why go this route? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2198.4s)]
*  So we're going straight to self-flying. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2199.4s)]
*  Several reasons. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2201.04s)]
*  One, it's safer. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2202.04s)]
*  Safer, he says, because most plane accidents involve human error. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2203.04s)]
*  The approach of commercial aviation is already automated, and Gyssen sees the entire eVTOL [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2207.68s)]
*  industry going that way eventually. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2212.56s)]
*  He's determined to get there first. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2215.16s)]
*  We do it primarily from a safety perspective, but also scale. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2217.56s)]
*  So if you don't have a pilot in the aircraft, it's less expensive. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2221.18s)]
*  You don't have to do pilot training. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2224.3999999999996s)]
*  You're flying four passengers. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2226.44s)]
*  We can charge less. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2229.02s)]
*  We don't want this to be a premium helicopter-like service. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2230.2s)]
*  We want this to be a service that's affordable to the masses. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2233.2799999999997s)]
*  There is a hurdle psychologically for people to get into an aircraft that does not have [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2236.84s)]
*  a human at the controls. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2242.28s)]
*  Of course. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2243.58s)]
*  And so what we're trying to do with that is each passenger can be in verbal communication [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2244.58s)]
*  with the ground. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2250.32s)]
*  They can be talking to a pilot whenever they want to. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2251.32s)]
*  So it's all designed to provide comfort. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2253.54s)]
*  It will take time. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2256.52s)]
*  This isn't going to happen overnight. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2257.52s)]
*  Gyssen wants to launch Wist's four-seater air taxi service in the world's 20 busiest [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2259.2400000000002s)]
*  cities within the next decade. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2263.88s)]
*  You don't give a date of when you think you'll be operational? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2266.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2270.32s)]
*  You know why we don't do that? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2271.32s)]
*  Because we are not in control of that part. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2272.48s)]
*  The FAA is in Europe. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2275.16s)]
*  It's called the ASSA. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2277.16s)]
*  They're in charge. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2278.32s)]
*  So when they certify aircraft to fly, that's when you fly. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2279.68s)]
*  The FAA won't say when an autonomous EV toll might be certified, but acting administrator [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2283.48s)]
*  Billy Nolan told us hailing a piloted air taxi by 2024 is well within the realm of possibility. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2289.32s)]
*  The challenge for us is to make sure that innovation doesn't come at the expense of [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2296.8399999999997s)]
*  safety. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2301.12s)]
*  But clearly we are seeing the emergence of something that's fantastic, I think. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2302.12s)]
*  This is real. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2307.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, this is no longer just the stuff of fantasy. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2308.3999999999996s)]
*  We want to be very careful. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2312.3999999999996s)]
*  We want to be very measured. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2313.8799999999997s)]
*  But you're absolutely right. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2315.3399999999997s)]
*  This is real and this is happening. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2316.7999999999997s)]
*  We've come a long way from where we were just, you know, a mere decade ago. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2318.9199999999996s)]
*  We don't often think about how the sense of touch makes our lives possible. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2326.2s)]
*  We grip a paper coffee cup with perfect force to hold it, but not crush it. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2338.2s)]
*  Our feet always find the floor. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2343.8399999999997s)]
*  But for people with artificial limbs or those with spinal injuries, the loss of touch can [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2346.72s)]
*  put the world beyond their grasp. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2352.3599999999997s)]
*  Seventeen years ago, the Defense Department launched a $100 million project to revolutionize [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2355.16s)]
*  prosthetic limbs. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2361.68s)]
*  The robotics you're about to see is amazing, but as we first reported earlier this year, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2363.6s)]
*  even more remarkable is how the feeling of feeling is returning to people like Brandon [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2369.3599999999997s)]
*  Prestwood. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2375.68s)]
*  For me, it was a battle if I wanted to live or die. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2378.6s)]
*  You weren't sure you wanted to live? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2385.44s)]
*  No. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2388.0s)]
*  I didn't know if I wanted to or not. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2389.0s)]
*  Brandon Prestwood's battle began with the loss of his left hand. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2393.6s)]
*  In 2012, he was on a maintenance crew reassembling an industrial conveyor belt when someone turned [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2398.72s)]
*  it on. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2406.16s)]
*  My arm was dragged in pretty much up to the shoulder. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2407.2s)]
*  It crushed my bones in my arm and fed my arm through a gap about one inch. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2410.7599999999998s)]
*  How did they save your life? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2418.04s)]
*  The other maintenance guys jumped in. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2419.48s)]
*  They started basically taking the machine back apart. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2420.68s)]
*  Once we got it back apart, I could look in and see what was there. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2424.8399999999997s)]
*  The gentleman was a Vietnam veteran. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2430.24s)]
*  And the Vietnam veteran knew what to do? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2440.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2443.24s)]
*  The Vietnam veteran knew tourniquets, but Prestwood lost his hand and couldn't return [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2444.24s)]

*  I was not 100% on board to start with, but I knew he had his mind set that he had to [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2463.96s)]
*  do this and I couldn't hold him back. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2471.2s)]

*  Everything still feel good? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2485.2s)]
*  Probably when I get her turned around. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2488.64s)]

*  A computer translates those signals to the hand. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2497.84s)]
*  How about the middle finger now? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2500.8s)]
*  Sensors in the plastic fingers are connected to nerves in his arm to return a basic sense [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2503.24s)]
*  of touch. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2509.96s)]
*  Close your eyes and tell me when you're feeling me, too. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2511.0s)]

*  That's not bad. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2518.52s)]
*  Middle. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2521.52s)]

*  Touch is about connection. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2533.44s)]
*  It's connection to the world. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2534.44s)]
*  It's about connection to others. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2535.44s)]
*  It's connection to yourself, right? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2537.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, we never experience not having touch. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2539.92s)]
*  It's the largest sensory organ on our body. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2543.6400000000003s)]
*  All right, so go ahead. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2545.84s)]

*  He switched it on in a volunteer and wondered what would happen. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2551.88s)]
*  So I was concerned, would it feel his whole hand? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2557.12s)]
*  Would it be painful? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2559.08s)]
*  Would it not feel anything? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2560.4s)]
*  We had no idea. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2561.76s)]
*  So one of those big moments in my career was he came in, we first turned on the stimulus [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2563.44s)]
*  and he kind of stopped for a second and he goes, that's my thumb. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2568.68s)]
*  That's the tip of my thumb. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2572.7999999999997s)]
*  This happened right away. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2574.44s)]
*  It didn't require any training of the brain. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2576.3599999999997s)]
*  No, that was the beauty of it. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2579.7599999999998s)]
*  My thumb. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2581.48s)]
*  Brandon Presswood remembers the instant it happened to him. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2583.16s)]
*  That's my fingers. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2587.3199999999997s)]

*  It doesn't feel exactly like my right hand. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2598.7200000000003s)]
*  It's a tingling sensation. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2601.64s)]
*  It's not painful. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2603.44s)]
*  It's kind of like if your hand's been to sleep right at the end, right before it wakes up, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2604.56s)]
*  that very, for me, it's pleasant. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2610.04s)]
*  It's a pleasant tingling. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2613.76s)]
*  Let's see if you can do it on a cherry here. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2614.76s)]
*  A tingling that's light with a light touch, but grows stronger the harder he presses. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2616.28s)]
*  Eyes closed. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2623.08s)]
*  He can pinch a cherry firmly enough to pull it from its stem, but not crush it. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2624.2799999999997s)]
*  You can feel this is light. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2629.9599999999996s)]
*  I had to use my lightest touch. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2630.9599999999996s)]
*  So if I hold this right here. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2633.16s)]
*  With an empty eggshell. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2635.16s)]
*  I can feel it. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2637.0s)]

*  It's a feeling more than a decade in the making. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2642.4399999999996s)]
*  At the beginning of this research, how did you even imagine that this would be possible? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2645.9199999999996s)]
*  I didn't imagine. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2650.8399999999997s)]

*  There are a hundred billion neurons in the brain interconnected with a hundred trillion [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2673.32s)]
*  synapses. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2679.0s)]
*  The human brain is like the most complex system in the known universe. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2680.64s)]
*  Too complex, he believed, to target electrical stimulation to exactly the right neurons. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2685.12s)]
*  And when we electrically stimulate, we activate hundreds, thousands of them at the same time [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2692.44s)]
*  in ways that would never happen naturally. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2698.44s)]
*  It just seemed like that very impoverished interface with this nervous system would never [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2701.56s)]

*  Electrodes pick up the brain's electrical signals that were intended for the muscles. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2738.92s)]
*  A computer translates those signals to the robot arm. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2744.2s)]

*  How can you possibly know what part of the brain is the tip of the index finger? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2770.48s)]
*  We took Scott and we put him in a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2778.76s)]

*  digits as we monitored his brain activity. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2790.76s)]

*  Eventually, the brain builds scar tissue at the implants, limiting the motor electrodes. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2811.7200000000003s)]
*  But one patient's implants have lasted eight years and counting. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2818.58s)]
*  Scott Embreeze have been working more than two years. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2823.3s)]
*  You have been a subject of this work for years now. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2827.38s)]
*  And I wonder why. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2833.18s)]
*  I wanted to have someone else have the opportunity to become independent again. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2835.22s)]
*  The most meaningful work of your life. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2840.5s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2842.54s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2844.1s)]
*  The greatest independence might be no prosthetic at all. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2845.5s)]
*  And we saw this astounding possibility with a pioneer, Austin Beggen. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2850.66s)]
*  His brain impulses are rooted not to a robot, but to implants in his own arm that fire his [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2857.02s)]
*  muscles. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2864.46s)]
*  What function did you have in this hand before the implants? [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2865.74s)]
*  Oh, absolutely none. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2869.94s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2871.78s)]
*  You couldn't move it at all. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2872.78s)]
*  So the only thing I can do really is shrug my shoulders and kind of shift them. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2873.86s)]
*  Unfortunately, that was all that came back after my accident. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2880.5400000000004s)]
*  His accident was on a vacation celebrating his college graduation. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2884.9s)]
*  Diving into a submerged sandbar left him quadriplegic. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2890.5s)]

*  spinal cord injury can regain some level of functional independence. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2925.58s)]
*  The cradle under his arm only supports the weight. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2930.9s)]
*  All of the motion is his own. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2935.58s)]
*  It takes effort. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2938.38s)]
*  He has to concentrate. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy9FqRtnLfw&t=2939.82s)]
