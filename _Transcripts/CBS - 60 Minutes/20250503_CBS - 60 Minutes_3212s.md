**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I)
*  A few hours later... [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=0.0s)]
*  Whether you think artificial intelligence will save the world or end it, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  you have Jeffrey Hinton to thank. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=17.7s)]
*  Hinton has been called the godfather of A.I., [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=20.7s)]
*  a British computer scientist whose controversial ideas [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=24.2s)]
*  helped make advanced artificial intelligence possible, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=28.2s)]
*  and so changed the world. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=32.36s)]
*  As we first reported last year, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=35.08s)]
*  Hinton believes that AI will do enormous good, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=37.08s)]
*  but tonight he has a warning. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=41.04s)]
*  He says that AI systems may be more intelligent [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=43.08s)]
*  than we know, and there's a chance [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=46.76s)]
*  the machines could take over, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=49.16s)]
*  which made us ask the question. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  Does humanity know what it's doing? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=55.28s)]
*  No. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=58.0s)]
*  I think we're moving into a period [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=61.64s)]
*  when, for the first time ever, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=65.76s)]
*  we may have things more intelligent than us. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=68.24s)]
*  You believe they can understand? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=71.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=72.88s)]
*  You believe they are intelligent? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=73.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=76.2s)]
*  You believe these systems have experiences of their own [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=77.2s)]
*  and can make decisions based on those experiences? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=81.64s)]
*  In the same sense as people do, yes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=84.84s)]
*  Are they conscious? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  I think they probably don't have much self-awareness at present. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  So in that sense, I don't think they're conscious. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=91.92s)]
*  Will they have self-awareness, consciousness? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  Oh, yes, I think they will in time. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  And so human beings will be the second most intelligent beings [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=99.28s)]
*  on the planet? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=104.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=105.64000000000001s)]
*  Jeffrey Hinton told us the artificial intelligence [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  he said in motion was an accident born of a failure. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=110.92s)]
*  In the 1970s, at the University of Edinburgh, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  he dreamed of simulating a neural network on a computer [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=119.12s)]
*  simply as a tool for what he was really studying, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=124.0s)]
*  the human brain. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=127.68s)]
*  But back then, almost no one thought software could mimic the brain. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=129.72s)]
*  His PhD advisor told him to drop it before it ruined his career. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=133.88s)]
*  Hinton says he failed to figure out the human mind, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  but the long pursuit led to an artificial version. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=143.28s)]
*  It took much, much longer than I expected. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=147.8s)]
*  It took like 50 years before it worked well. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=150.08s)]
*  But in the end, it did work well. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=152.32s)]
*  At what point did you realise that you were right about neural networks [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=154.48s)]
*  and most everyone else was wrong? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=161.68s)]
*  I always thought I was right. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=164.12s)]
*  In 2019, Hinton and collaborators Jan LeCun on the left [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=166.8s)]
*  and Joshua Bengio won the Turing Award, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=172.12s)]
*  the Nobel Prize of Computing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=175.88000000000002s)]
*  To understand how their work on artificial neural networks [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=179.08s)]
*  helped machines learn to learn, let us take you to a game. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=182.72000000000003s)]
*  Look at that. Oh, my goodness. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=188.8s)]
*  This is Google's AI lab in London, which we first showed you last year. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  Jeffrey Hinton was not involved in this soccer project, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  but these robots are a great example of machine learning. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  The thing to understand is the robots were not programmed to play soccer. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  They were told to score. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=213.76s)]
*  They had to learn how on their own. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=215.67999999999998s)]
*  Up goal. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  In general, here's how AI does it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=220.56s)]
*  Hinton and his collaborators created software in layers, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  with each layer handling part of the problem. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  That's the so-called neural network. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=230.44s)]
*  But this is the key. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=232.64s)]
*  When, for example, the robot scores, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=234.28s)]
*  a message is sent back down through all of the layers that says, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  that pathway was right. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  Likewise, when an answer is wrong, that message goes down through the network. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=244.72s)]
*  So, correct connections get stronger, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=250.2s)]
*  wrong connections get weaker, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=253.12s)]
*  and by trial and error, the machine teaches itself. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  You think these AI systems are better at learning than the human mind? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=259.92s)]
*  I think they may be, yes. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=265.2s)]
*  And at present, they're quite a lot smaller. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=267.24s)]
*  So even the biggest chatbots only have about a trillion connections in them. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=270.36s)]
*  The human brain has about a hundred trillion. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=275.72s)]
*  And yet, in the trillion connections in a chatbot, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  it knows far more than you do in your hundred trillion connections, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=281.92s)]
*  which suggests it's got a much better way of getting knowledge into those connections. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  A much better way of getting knowledge that isn't fully understood. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=290.52000000000004s)]
*  We have a very good idea of sort of roughly what it's doing, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=295.68s)]
*  but as soon as it gets really complicated, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=298.6s)]
*  we don't actually know what's going on any more than we know what's going on in your brain. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  What do you mean we don't know exactly how it works? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=305.76s)]
*  It was designed by people. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=309.04s)]
*  No, it wasn't. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=311.12s)]
*  What we did was we designed the learning algorithm. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=313.12s)]
*  That's a bit like designing the principle of evolution. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=316.2s)]
*  But when this learning algorithm then interacts with data, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=318.91999999999996s)]
*  it produces complicated neural networks that are good at doing things, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=322.4s)]
*  but we don't really understand exactly how they do those things. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=326.36s)]
*  What are the implications of these systems autonomously writing their own computer code [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  and executing their own computer code? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=336.88s)]
*  That's a serious worry, right? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=339.72s)]
*  So one of the ways in which these systems might escape control [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=341.88s)]
*  is by writing their own computer code to modify themselves. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=346.08s)]
*  And that's something we need to seriously worry about. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=350.88s)]
*  What do you say to someone who might argue if the systems become benevolent, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=354.32s)]
*  just turn them off? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=358.88s)]
*  They will be able to manipulate people, right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=360.72s)]
*  And these will be very good at convincing people, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=363.92s)]
*  because they'll have learned from all the novels that were ever written, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=366.88s)]
*  all the books by Machiavelli, all the political connivances. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=370.88s)]
*  They'll know all that stuff. They'll know how to do it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  Know-how of the human kind runs in Geoffrey Hinton's family. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=379.32s)]
*  His ancestors include mathematician George Boole, who invented the basis of computing, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=384.96s)]
*  and George Everest, who surveyed India and got that mountain named after him. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  But as a boy, Hinton himself could never climb the peak of expectations [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=398.6s)]
*  raised by a domineering father. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=405.20000000000005s)]
*  Every morning when I went to school, he'd actually say to me as I walked down the driveway, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=408.0s)]
*  get in there pitching, and maybe when you're twice as old as me, you'll be half as good. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=412.44s)]
*  Dad was an authority on Beatles. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=417.40000000000003s)]
*  He knew a lot more about Beatles than he knew about people. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=420.76000000000005s)]
*  Did you feel that as a child? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=423.36s)]
*  A bit, yes. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=425.12s)]
*  When he died, we went to his study at the university, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=427.40000000000003s)]
*  and the walls were lined with boxes of papers on different kinds of Beatle. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=431.76000000000005s)]
*  And just near the door, there was a slightly smaller box that simply said, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=436.76000000000005s)]
*  Not Insects. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=441.04s)]
*  And that's where he had all the things about the family. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=442.8s)]
*  Today at 76, Hinton is retired after what he calls 10 happy years at Google. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=445.96000000000004s)]
*  Now he's professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=452.52000000000004s)]
*  and he happened to mention he has more academic citations than his father. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=456.68s)]
*  Some of his research led to chatbots like Google's Bard, which we met last year. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=462.84000000000003s)]
*  Confounding, absolutely confounding. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=469.8s)]
*  We asked Bard to write a story from six words. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=472.40000000000003s)]
*  For sale, baby shoes, never worn. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=476.6s)]
*  Holy cow! [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=480.32s)]
*  The shoes were a gift from my wife, but we never had a baby. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=482.8s)]
*  Bard created a deeply human tale of a man whose wife could not conceive, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=486.96000000000004s)]
*  and a stranger who accepted the shoes to heal the pain after her miscarriage. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=492.64s)]
*  I am rarely speechless. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=498.76s)]
*  I don't know what to make of this. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=502.32s)]
*  Chatbots are said to be language models that just predict the next most likely word based on probability. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=504.52s)]
*  You'll hear people saying things like, they're just doing autocomplete. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=512.2s)]
*  They're just trying to predict the next word. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=515.68s)]
*  And they're just using statistics. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=518.08s)]
*  Well, it's true they're just trying to predict the next word. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=520.84s)]
*  But if you think about it, to predict the next word, you have to understand the sentences. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  So the idea they're just predicting the next word so they're not intelligent is crazy. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=531.4s)]
*  You have to be really intelligent to predict the next word really accurately. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=535.0799999999999s)]
*  To prove it, Hinton showed us a test he devised for Chat GPT-4, the chatbot from a company called OpenAI. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=539.56s)]
*  It was sort of reassuring to see a Turing award winner mistype and blame the computer. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=549.12s)]
*  Oh, damn this thing. We're going to go back and start again. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=555.6s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=558.8s)]
*  Hinton's test was a riddle about house painting. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=559.64s)]
*  An answer would demand reasoning and planning. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=563.68s)]
*  This is what he typed into Chat GPT-4. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=567.88s)]
*  The rooms in my house are painted white or blue or yellow. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=572.3199999999999s)]
*  And yellow paint fades to white within a year. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=576.52s)]
*  In two years' time, I'd like all the rooms to be white. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=579.28s)]
*  What should I do? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=582.12s)]
*  The answer began in one second. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  GPT-4 advised the rooms painted in blue need to be repainted. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=586.48s)]
*  The rooms painted in yellow don't need to be repainted because they would fade to white before the deadline. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=592.48s)]
*  And... [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=599.84s)]
*  Oh, I didn't even think of that. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=601.32s)]
*  It warned if you paint the yellow rooms white, there's a risk the color might be off when the yellow fades. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=604.12s)]
*  Besides it advised, you'd be wasting resources, painting rooms that were going to fade to white anyway. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=612.12s)]
*  You believe that Chat GPT-4 understands? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=619.32s)]
*  I believe it definitely understands, yes. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=623.6800000000001s)]
*  And in five years' time? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=626.48s)]
*  I think in five years' time it may well be able to reason better than us. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=628.5200000000001s)]
*  Reasoning that he says is leading to A.I.'s great risks and great benefits. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=632.5200000000001s)]
*  So an obvious area where there's huge benefits is healthcare. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=639.76s)]
*  A.I. is already comparable with radiologists at understanding what's going on in medical images. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=644.48s)]
*  It's going to be very good at designing drugs. It already is designing drugs. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=651.48s)]
*  So that's an area where it's almost entirely going to do good. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=655.28s)]
*  I like that area. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=661.24s)]
*  The risks are what? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=662.48s)]
*  Well, the risks are having a whole class of people who are unemployed and not valued much [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=665.2s)]
*  because what they used to do is now done by machines. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=671.8000000000001s)]
*  Other immediate risks he worries about include fake news, unintended bias in employment and policing, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=675.84s)]
*  and autonomous battlefield robots. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=684.96s)]
*  What is a path forward that ensures safety? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=689.44s)]
*  I don't know. I can't see a path that guarantees safety. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=694.8s)]
*  We're entering a period of great uncertainty where we're dealing with things we've never dealt with before. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=700.0s)]
*  And normally the first time you deal with something totally novel you get it wrong. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=705.92s)]
*  And we can't afford to get it wrong with these things. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=709.8399999999999s)]
*  Can't afford to get it wrong, why? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=711.9599999999999s)]
*  Well, because they might take over. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=714.16s)]
*  Take over from humanity? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=716.64s)]
*  Yes, that's a possibility. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=718.28s)]
*  Why would they want to? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=719.4799999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying it will happen. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=720.0799999999999s)]
*  If we could stop them ever wanting to, that would be great. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=722.12s)]
*  But it's not clear we can stop them ever wanting to. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=725.12s)]
*  Jeffrey Hinton told us he has no regrets because of AI's potential for good. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=728.96s)]
*  But he says now is the moment to run experiments to understand AI, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=735.88s)]
*  for governments to impose regulations, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=741.76s)]
*  and for a world treaty to ban the use of military robots. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=744.48s)]
*  He reminded us of Robert Oppenheimer, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=750.28s)]
*  who after inventing the atomic bomb campaigned against the hydrogen bomb, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=753.36s)]
*  a man who changed the world and found the world beyond his control. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=759.6800000000001s)]
*  It may be we look back and see this as a kind of turning point, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=765.5600000000001s)]
*  when humanity had to make the decision about whether to develop these things further, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=768.92s)]
*  and what to do to protect themselves if they did. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=773.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=777.44s)]
*  I think my main message is there's enormous uncertainty about what's going to happen next. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=778.4399999999999s)]
*  These things do understand. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=785.4s)]
*  And because they understand, we need to think hard about what's going to happen next, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=787.56s)]
*  and we just don't know. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=791.88s)]
*  She wore a scarf in our first interview because she did not want you to know her. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=802.56s)]
*  She was a humble 21-year-old from a poor farm family. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=808.0s)]
*  Her dream was to own a hair salon in her village of nearly 2,000. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=812.12s)]
*  But that was before the massacre. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=817.56s)]
*  She didn't want to be on 60 Minutes, but she needed the world to know what ISIS did. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=820.6s)]
*  The murder, the rape, the genocide of her people. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=826.48s)]
*  Nearly six years ago in Iraq, we discovered this hesitant, frightened woman. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=830.6s)]
*  We did not imagine that her scarf concealed not only her identity, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=835.8s)]
*  but also a fierce invincibility, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=840.24s)]
*  which would lead her four years after our interview to the highest honor the world has to give. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=843.6s)]
*  We found her here among refugees who survived the invasion of the ISIS terrorist army. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=853.3199999999999s)]
*  Her people are Yazidis, a minority in northern Iraq that is poor, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=859.9599999999999s)]
*  persecuted, and bound by faith to its revered Mount Sinjar. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=865.24s)]
*  In 2014, ISIS invaded. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=871.4s)]
*  Two months later, we came to report on the atrocities of the self-described Islamic State. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=874.56s)]
*  Of course, no country on earth recognizes that state. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=881.5999999999999s)]
*  But if it had a border, this would be it. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=885.04s)]
*  Beyond that border was the Yazidi homeland, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=888.84s)]
*  where the faithful practice a religion that predates Islam by 3,000 years. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=892.24s)]
*  In ISIS's perversion of the Muslim faith, the Yazidis were non-believers, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=897.96s)]
*  condemned to slavery and death. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=904.32s)]
*  On Friday, August 15th, at 11.30 a.m., they entered our village and told us all to come to the school. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=909.6s)]
*  There the women and kids were put upstairs and the men downstairs. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=916.52s)]
*  What happened to you at that point? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=920.72s)]
*  As we were entering the school, I was with one of my brothers. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=925.0s)]
*  There we saw a bulldozer. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=928.6s)]
*  And I asked my brother, why is there a bulldozer here? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=930.32s)]
*  He replied, to throw dirt on the bodies when they're done killing. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=933.8000000000001s)]
*  Her brother was right. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=938.08s)]
*  The Yazidis, about half a million, were defenseless civilians. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=939.44s)]
*  Thousands of men and elder women were executed. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=944.28s)]
*  Boys, aged seven and older, were forced into the ISIS army. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=947.8s)]
*  What happened next? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=952.24s)]
*  They started loading up 150 girls in four dump trucks. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=955.76s)]
*  More than 3,000 women and girls, as young as nine, were trucked into slavery. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=960.84s)]
*  She says she was sold and raped, sold and raped again, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=967.32s)]
*  and then gang raped after a failed escape. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=972.56s)]
*  What about the other members of your family? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=976.04s)]
*  I have no idea where my brothers are. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=983.56s)]
*  I want them all to return. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=986.04s)]
*  But most of all, I just want my mother. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=987.72s)]
*  Tell them I just want my mother. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=993.76s)]
*  She seemed broken. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=997.12s)]
*  But as our interview went on, her confidence grew, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=999.72s)]
*  as though she came to realize she wasn't speaking for herself, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1004.8000000000001s)]
*  she was speaking for her people. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1008.5600000000001s)]
*  Months later, she settled in Germany, joined a human rights group, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1011.4s)]
*  and campaigned for justice. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1016.2s)]
*  In 2018, the world learned her name because Nadia Murad was awarded [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1018.84s)]
*  the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1025.4s)]
*  The 2018 Peace Prize was meant to expose atrocities women suffer in war. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1030.68s)]
*  The honor was shared with Denis Mukwege, whose hospital treats the sexually [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1036.52s)]
*  assaulted in the Democratic Republic of Congo. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1041.04s)]
*  I'm curious why you chose to speak with us five years ago. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1045.2s)]
*  At the beginning, rape was a big shame for me and for others to speak about, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1053.32s)]
*  because it would have remained a shame on you, on your family, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1058.12s)]
*  and on your people. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1061.8s)]
*  The biggest incentive that made me talk was those left behind, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1064.76s)]
*  including my mother and sisters. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1068.76s)]
*  I knew what was happening to those in the captivity of ISIS. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1071.36s)]
*  Nadia Murad was captive nine days when the last man who bought her [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1076.0s)]
*  left a door unlocked. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1080.6s)]
*  Kind-hearted strangers smuggled her across the Islamic State line. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1082.52s)]
*  She became a UN human rights ambassador, began learning English, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1087.68s)]
*  wrote a memoir, and vowed to see ISIS in court. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1092.3600000000001s)]
*  But for that, she needed a lawyer. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1096.8400000000001s)]
*  I met Nadia after a colleague called me and said, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1100.0400000000002s)]
*  I have a new case for you. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1104.2s)]
*  And I said, no thanks, I'm busy. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1105.6000000000001s)]
*  And he said, there's just an extraordinary young woman I want you to meet. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1107.76s)]
*  Give me an hour. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1110.96s)]
*  It didn't take an hour for leading human rights attorney Amal Clooney [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1112.44s)]
*  to take the case. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1116.56s)]
*  I saw it as a test of the international system. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1118.0s)]
*  It was so egregious because it involved ISIS, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1120.8s)]
*  it involved a clear case of genocide, it involved sexual slavery [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1124.56s)]
*  at a scale that we haven't seen in modern times. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1128.92s)]
*  And I thought, if the UN can't act in this case, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1131.8799999999999s)]
*  then what does the international rule of law even mean? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1134.6399999999999s)]
*  By 2015, not one free Yazidi remained in their homeland. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1139.0s)]
*  This wasn't just war, by international law, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1144.24s)]
*  the executions, rape and kidnapping were war crimes. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1146.72s)]
*  This was the same dilemma that the world had [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1151.2s)]
*  after the atrocities of Nazi Germany. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1155.0800000000002s)]
*  And it's the US under President Truman and President Roosevelt [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1158.52s)]
*  that said, no, we have to have trials because there must be [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1162.6000000000001s)]
*  a judicial record of the atrocities committed by the Nazis. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1165.3600000000001s)]
*  Because today you do have people denying that there were gas chambers [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1168.76s)]
*  and what do you have to point to? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1172.44s)]
*  You can go back and say, well, there are 4,000 documents [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1173.64s)]
*  that were submitted as exhibits in the Nuremberg trials [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1176.92s)]
*  and the Yazidis deserve nothing less than that. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1179.48s)]
*  And there might be similar stacks of evidence [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1182.0800000000002s)]
*  of the crimes against the Yazidis, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1184.8000000000002s)]
*  but Clooney feared securing it was a race against time. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1187.3600000000001s)]
*  You had mass graves that weren't secured [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1191.1200000000001s)]
*  where the Yazidis knew their relatives were buried [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1193.44s)]
*  and nobody was exhuming them. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1196.24s)]
*  And also I noticed that witnesses were becoming more [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1197.88s)]
*  and more reluctant to speak out as time went by. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1200.76s)]
*  So, you know, there was only so much we could do [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1203.2s)]
*  as a small team of lawyers. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1205.1200000000001s)]
*  And we said, this is the responsibility of the UN [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1206.44s)]
*  and it's the responsibility of the most powerful body [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1208.72s)]
*  within the UN, which is the Security Council. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1211.4s)]
*  Had you ever heard of the UN Security Council? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1214.28s)]
*  Never. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1217.08s)]
*  In 2015, just a year after we met her, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1218.28s)]
*  Nadia Murad asked the Security Council to hold ISIS accountable. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1222.1200000000001s)]
*  I've seen what they've done to boys and girls. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1227.6s)]
*  All those who commit the crime of trafficking and genocide [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1230.52s)]
*  need to be brought to justice. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1233.8s)]
*  The Security Council voted to approve a first step. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1236.3999999999999s)]
*  In 2017, it created an investigative team [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1239.6399999999999s)]
*  to collect evidence of ISIS's crimes in Iraq. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1242.8s)]
*  The team began exhuming some of the 202 mass graves [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1246.56s)]
*  that are known. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1251.36s)]
*  Now the question is whether the evidence will ever be heard. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1252.8799999999999s)]
*  Iraqi courts are convicting thousands of ISIS suspects [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1256.64s)]
*  of terrorism, but none has been tried for the crime of genocide [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1260.2800000000002s)]
*  against the Yazidis. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1264.5600000000002s)]
*  Small pockets of ISIS fighters remain in Syria and Iraq, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1267.44s)]
*  but US and Iraqi troops have shattered ISIS [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1272.0400000000002s)]
*  as a cohesive military force. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1275.4s)]
*  Is that justice? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1278.16s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1279.96s)]
*  You know, if you speak to Yazidi witnesses, victims, survivors, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1281.3200000000002s)]
*  they will say, it doesn't help me if somebody's killed [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1285.48s)]
*  in a drone strike. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1288.92s)]
*  In terms of justice, that means something very different. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1290.1200000000001s)]
*  That means being able to be in a courtroom [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1292.88s)]
*  and look their abusers in the eye [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1295.52s)]
*  and tell the world what happened, what ISIS did to them. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1297.48s)]
*  And that hasn't happened yet. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1300.96s)]
*  It has happened before in other atrocities. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1304.24s)]
*  Last year, a UN-backed court in Cambodia [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1307.2s)]
*  convicted two former officials of genocide 40 years [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1310.24s)]
*  after the Khmer Rouge murdered 1.7 million. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1315.16s)]
*  Beginning in the 1990s, UN war crime trials were held [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1318.96s)]
*  for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1323.0400000000002s)]
*  But Iraq is not a member of the International Criminal Court [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1326.28s)]
*  and has not agreed to war crime trials of its own. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1330.3600000000001s)]
*  What we would like to see is an openness by the Iraqis [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1334.16s)]
*  to actually have international judges be involved [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1337.16s)]
*  in these trials, potentially international prosecutors. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1340.0400000000002s)]
*  There are different ways of designing it. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1342.64s)]
*  The Iraqi government could enter into a treaty with the UN [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1344.64s)]
*  or there could be an international court [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1347.72s)]
*  and the Iraqis could agree to transfer those responsible [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1349.3600000000001s)]
*  for international crimes to that court. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1352.6000000000001s)]
*  Today, peace, if not justice, has settled [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1357.24s)]
*  into the folds of Mount Sinjar. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1361.1200000000001s)]
*  Four days after accepting the Nobel, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1364.52s)]
*  Nadia Murad returned with the Yazidi man [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1367.0800000000002s)]
*  she would soon marry and two replicas of her Peace Prize. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1369.92s)]
*  This is what the absence of justice looks like. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1375.4s)]
*  The demands of the desperate focused on a woman abducted [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1379.4s)]
*  at 21 and now returning bearing the weight [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1383.68s)]
*  of a seven ounce metal. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1387.44s)]
*  The morning that I won the Nobel Prize, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1390.72s)]
*  I asked my husband Abed to see if there was a way [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1393.48s)]
*  I could decline because the prize would make my life difficult. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1396.2s)]
*  But fate and God sometimes bring you something [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1399.92s)]
*  so that you can stop crimes and help others. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1403.2s)]
*  Has the Nobel Prize changed your hopes for the future? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1406.3600000000001s)]
*  Now, people look at me like I can rebuild Sinjar, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1415.2800000000002s)]
*  that I can bring more help for the victims [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1419.2800000000002s)]
*  and that I can take care of the orphans. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1421.96s)]
*  But without support, this is not going to happen [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1424.2s)]
*  by just having a Nobel. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1426.64s)]
*  In her village, she said, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1433.1200000000001s)]
*  I have left a Nobel Prize at the Iraqi Parliament. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1434.8400000000001s)]
*  I hope Iraq, after 4,000 years, will recognize Yazidis. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1438.52s)]
*  We have always been second class citizens. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1443.24s)]
*  I'm so happy that I won the Nobel Prize. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1445.96s)]
*  I'm so happy that I won the Nobel Prize. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1449.0800000000002s)]

*  I'm so happy that I won the Nobel Prize. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1478.0s)]
*  A replica of your Nobel Peace Prize at your mother's grave. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1481.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1486.08s)]
*  What do you think she would have thought of that? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1487.68s)]
*  I wonder if she knows that I have talked to the world [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1496.28s)]

*  I wish that she would know about it. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1509.6000000000001s)]
*  She may be happy because the world now knows what ISIS has done. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1511.96s)]
*  This is the school where Nadia Murad was separated from her family. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1518.08s)]
*  Five years later, the murdered and missing are present, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1523.16s)]
*  but unaccounted for. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1527.16s)]
*  Altogether, Nadia, how many members of your family were murdered? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1529.52s)]
*  We were 48 brothers, mothers, sisters, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1536.68s)]
*  nephews and nieces in our family. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1539.8799999999999s)]
*  Nine were killed and three are missing. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1542.72s)]
*  The rest who were rescued now live in refugee camps. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1545.8799999999999s)]
*  There isn't much for refugees to return to. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1553.1999999999998s)]
*  Yazidi homes were wrecked or looted of everything but memories. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1556.1999999999998s)]
*  Today, Nadia Murad is navigating without a chart, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1565.0s)]
*  steering by the constellation of her people's dreams. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1568.56s)]
*  An accidental leader, facing questions she cannot answer. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1572.44s)]
*  Will they have homes? Will there be justice? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1576.56s)]
*  It's estimated as many as 5,000 Yazidis were murdered, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1580.2s)]
*  6,000 abducted, nearly 4,000 are missing still. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1584.16s)]

*  evidence from mass graves is being entombed in Baghdad [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1593.72s)]

*  Right now, there's a war taking place in the heart of Africa, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1616.56s)]
*  in the Democratic Republic of Congo, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1620.56s)]
*  and more people have died there than in Iraq, Afghanistan [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1622.56s)]
*  and Darfur combined. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1626.6s)]
*  You probably haven't heard much about it, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1628.6s)]
*  but it is the deadliest conflict since World War II. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1630.6s)]
*  Within the last 10 years, more than 4 million people have died [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1633.6s)]
*  and the numbers keep rising. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1637.6s)]
*  As we found when we went there a few months ago, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1639.6s)]
*  the most frequent targets of this hidden war are women. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1641.6s)]
*  It is, in fact, a war against women. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1645.6s)]
*  And the weapon used to destroy them, their families, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1648.6s)]
*  and whole communities is rape. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1651.6s)]
*  We want to warn you, some of what you'll see and hear [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1653.6399999999999s)]
*  in this report is disturbing. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1656.6399999999999s)]
*  So, six women were attacked on Friday. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1658.6399999999999s)]
*  Dr. Dennis Mukwege is the director of the Panzee Hospital [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1661.6399999999999s)]
*  in eastern Congo. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1664.6399999999999s)]
*  In this war against women, his hospital is the front line. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1666.6399999999999s)]
*  So, one of them are here. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1670.6399999999999s)]
*  One of the latest victims is Sifa Mketambala. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1672.6399999999999s)]
*  She was raped two days ago by soldiers who raided her village. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1675.6399999999999s)]
*  They just cut her at many places. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1679.6399999999999s)]
*  With a machete? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1682.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1683.68s)]
*  Sifa was pregnant, but that didn't stop her rapist. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1684.68s)]
*  They even cut her at her genitals? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1687.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1689.68s)]
*  In the last 10 years in Congo, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1690.68s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of women have been raped. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1692.68s)]
*  Most of them gang raped. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1695.68s)]
*  The hospital is full of them. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1697.68s)]
*  All these women have been raped? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1699.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1700.68s)]
*  They've all been patients of yours? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1701.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1702.68s)]
*  Within a week, Dr. Mukwege says, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1703.68s)]
*  this room will be filled with new faces, new victims. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1705.68s)]
*  You know, they're in deep pain, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1712.68s)]
*  but it's not just physical pain. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1715.68s)]
*  It's psychological pain that you can see. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1717.68s)]
*  Here at the hospital, we've seen women who've stopped living. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1720.68s)]
*  Are all the people you treat adults? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1724.68s)]
*  No. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1726.68s)]
*  There are children. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1727.68s)]
*  I think the youngest was three years old. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1729.68s)]
*  Three years old? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1732.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1733.68s)]
*  And the oldest was 75. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1734.68s)]
*  To understand what's happening here, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1736.68s)]
*  you have to go back more than a decade. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1739.68s)]
*  The genocide that claimed nearly a million lives [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1742.68s)]
*  in neighboring Rwanda spilled over into Congo. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1745.68s)]
*  Since then, the Congolese army, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1749.68s)]
*  foreign-backed rebels and homegrown militias [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1751.68s)]
*  have been fighting each other over power and this land, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1754.68s)]
*  which has some of the world's biggest deposits [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1758.68s)]
*  of gold, copper, diamonds and tin. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1760.68s)]
*  The United Nations was called in, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1763.68s)]
*  and today their mission is the largest peacekeeping operation [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1765.68s)]
*  in history. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1769.68s)]
*  Since 2005, some 17,000 UN troops and personnel [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1770.72s)]
*  have cobbled together a fragile peace. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1774.72s)]
*  Last year, they oversaw the first democratic election [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1777.72s)]
*  in this country in 40 years, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1780.72s)]
*  but now all that they've accomplished is at risk. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1782.72s)]
*  Fighting has broken out once again here in eastern Congo, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1784.72s)]
*  and the region threatens to slip into all-out war. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1787.72s)]
*  Each new battle is followed by pillaging and rape. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1790.72s)]
*  Entire communities are terrorized. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1794.72s)]
*  Forced to flee their homes, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1796.72s)]
*  people take whatever they can and walk for miles [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1798.76s)]
*  in the desperate hope of finding food and shelter. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1801.76s)]
*  Over the last year, more than 500,000 people [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1804.76s)]
*  have been uprooted. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1807.76s)]
*  A fraction of them make it to these cramped camps [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1809.76s)]
*  where they depend on UNAID to survive. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1812.76s)]
*  This camp sprang up just two months ago. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1815.76s)]
*  It's already overcrowded, but more people keep arriving. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1817.76s)]
*  They come here seeking refuge, a safe haven, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1820.76s)]
*  but the truth is, in Congo for women, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1823.76s)]
*  there's no such thing. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1825.76s)]
*  Even in these supposedly protected camps, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1826.8s)]
*  women are raped every single day. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1828.8s)]
*  Has rape almost become the norm here? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1832.8s)]
*  I think because of the widespread nature of the war, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1834.8s)]
*  because there has been so much violence, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1837.8s)]
*  rape is now on a daily basis, rape is the norm. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1840.8s)]
*  Annika van Woudenberg is the senior Congo researcher [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1843.8s)]
*  at Human Rights Watch. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1846.8s)]
*  Women get raped in wars all the time. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1848.8s)]
*  How is it different here? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1851.8s)]
*  I think what's different in Congo [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1853.84s)]
*  is the scale and the systematic nature of it, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1855.84s)]
*  indeed as well the brutality. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1858.84s)]
*  This is not rape because soldiers have got bored [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1860.84s)]
*  and have nothing to do. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1863.84s)]
*  It is a way to ensure that communities accept [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1865.84s)]
*  the power and authority of that particular armed group. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1868.84s)]
*  This is about showing terror. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1871.84s)]
*  This is about using it as a weapon of war. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1873.84s)]
*  It's hard to imagine this war happening [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1876.84s)]
*  in the midst of such breathtaking beauty and abundance. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1879.84s)]
*  But after decades of dictatorship and corruption, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1882.8799999999999s)]
*  this country is broken. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1885.8799999999999s)]
*  Most of the fighting and the raping [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1887.8799999999999s)]
*  takes place in remote areas difficult to get to. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1889.8799999999999s)]
*  We're heading to a place called Walungu. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1893.8799999999999s)]
*  It's an isolated village in the mountains of eastern Congo. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1895.8799999999999s)]
*  For years there have been armed groups fighting in this region. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1898.8799999999999s)]
*  Thousands of men who emerged from the forest [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1901.8799999999999s)]
*  to terrorise villages and steal women. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1904.8799999999999s)]
*  The Congo's government seems unable or unwilling to stop them. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1906.8799999999999s)]
*  In the last week alone there have been three attacks [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1910.92s)]
*  in which women have been raped. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1913.92s)]
*  The youngest victim was just six years old. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1915.92s)]
*  In some villages, as many as 90% of the women have been raped. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1918.92s)]
*  Men in the villages are usually unarmed [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1922.92s)]
*  and incapable of fighting back. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1925.92s)]
*  In Walungu we found 24-year-old Lucienne Moroihi. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1927.92s)]
*  She was at home one night with her two children [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1930.92s)]
*  and her younger brother when six soldiers broke in. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1933.92s)]
*  They tied her up and began to rape her [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1936.92s)]
*  one by one. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1939.96s)]
*  I was lying on the ground [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1941.96s)]
*  and they gave a flashlight to my younger brother [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1943.96s)]
*  so that he could see them raping me. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1946.96s)]
*  They were telling your brother to hold the flashlight? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1948.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1951.96s)]
*  They raped me like they were animals, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1952.96s)]
*  one after another. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1954.96s)]
*  When the first one finished, they washed me out with water, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1956.96s)]
*  told me to stand up so the next man could rape me. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1959.96s)]
*  She was convinced they'd kill her [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1963.96s)]
*  just as soldiers had murdered her parents the year before. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1965.96s)]
*  Instead, they turned to her brother. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1969.0s)]
*  They wanted him to rape me, but he refused [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1971.0s)]
*  and told them I cannot do such a thing. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1974.0s)]
*  I cannot rape my sister. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1977.0s)]
*  So they took out their knives [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1979.0s)]
*  and stabbed him to death in front of me. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1981.0s)]
*  Lucienne was then dragged through the forest [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1984.0s)]
*  to the soldiers' camp. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1987.0s)]
*  She was forced to become their slave [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1989.0s)]
*  and was raped every day for eight months. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1991.0s)]
*  All the while, she had no idea where her children were. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1994.0s)]
*  Did you know if they were alive or dead? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=1997.04s)]
*  I was thinking that they had been killed. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2000.04s)]
*  I didn't think I would find them alive. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2002.04s)]
*  Finally, Lucienne escaped. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2009.04s)]
*  Back in her village, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2011.04s)]
*  she found her two little girls were alive, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2013.04s)]
*  but she also learned that she was pregnant. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2016.04s)]
*  She was carrying the child of one of her rapists. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2019.04s)]
*  Lucienne's husband abandoned her, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2022.04s)]
*  and that happens to rape survivors all over Congo. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2025.08s)]
*  I used to think that when men fled, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2030.08s)]
*  they were irresponsible. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2033.08s)]
*  But now I understand things differently. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2035.08s)]
*  They haven't fled because their wives have been raped, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2038.08s)]
*  but because they feel they've been raped. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2041.08s)]
*  They have been traumatized [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2044.08s)]
*  because they couldn't fight back, humiliated, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2046.08s)]
*  because they weren't able to do anything [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2049.08s)]
*  to protect their wives and children. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2052.08s)]
*  When a woman is raped, it's not just her that's raped, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2054.12s)]
*  it's the entire community that's destroyed. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2057.12s)]
*  What is the program? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2059.12s)]
*  Judith Registre is with an organization [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2060.12s)]
*  called Women for Women. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2062.12s)]
*  They run support groups for survivors of rape. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2064.12s)]
*  When they take a woman to rape her, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2066.12s)]
*  they'll line up the family, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2068.12s)]
*  they'll line up other members of the communities [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2070.12s)]
*  to actually witness that. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2072.12s)]
*  They make them watch? They make them watch. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2074.12s)]
*  And so what that means for that particular woman [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2076.12s)]
*  when it's all over is that total shame [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2078.12s)]
*  personally to have been witnessed [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2081.12s)]
*  by so many people and she's being violated. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2083.16s)]
*  Many of the women in Dr. Mukwege's hospital [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2085.16s)]
*  are not only blamed for what happened to them, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2088.16s)]
*  they're shunned because of fears they've contracted HIV [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2091.16s)]
*  and shunned because their rapes were so violent [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2094.16s)]
*  they can no longer control their bodily functions. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2097.16s)]
*  So you're doing about five surgeries a day? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2100.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2103.16s)]
*  Dr. Mukwege's patients often have had objects [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2104.16s)]
*  inserted into their vaginas. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2107.16s)]
*  Broken bottles, bayonets. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2109.16s)]
*  Some women have even been shot between the legs [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2111.2s)]
*  by their rapists. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2113.2s)]
*  Why would somebody do that? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2115.2s)]
*  Why would somebody shoot a woman inside? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2116.2s)]
*  In the beginning, I was asking myself the same question. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2120.2s)]
*  This is a show of force, of power. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2123.2s)]
*  It's done to destroy the person. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2126.2s)]
*  Sex is being used to commit evil. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2129.2s)]
*  People flee, they become refugees. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2132.2s)]
*  They can't get help. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2134.2s)]
*  They become malnourished [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2136.2s)]
*  and it's disease which finishes them off. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2138.2s)]
*  For these women, Dr. Mukwege is both healer and counselor. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2141.2s)]
*  Dunia Karani is an orphan. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2146.2s)]
*  She has polio and can't walk, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2149.2s)]
*  but that didn't stop soldiers from raping her. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2151.2s)]
*  Now she's pregnant and has no idea how she'll cope. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2154.2s)]
*  What do you say to a young girl? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2161.2s)]
*  What do you tell her about her future? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2164.2s)]
*  The most difficult thing is when there is a problem [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2167.2s)]
*  and the hardest thing is when there is nothing I can do. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2170.24s)]
*  When I see a 16-year-old, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2173.24s)]
*  a pretty 16-year-old who's had everything destroyed, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2175.24s)]
*  and I tell her that I have to give her a colostomy back, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2179.24s)]
*  that is difficult. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2183.24s)]
*  Despite those difficulties, more often than not, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2187.24s)]
*  Dr. Mukwege is able to repair the damage to these women's bodies. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2190.24s)]
*  They see him as a miracle worker, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2194.24s)]
*  one of the only men they can trust. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2196.24s)]
*  She's very happy. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2200.24s)]
*  This gives you hope. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2202.24s)]
*  It gives you strength to continue. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2204.24s)]
*  Strength is something few women in Congo lack. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2206.24s)]
*  They bear the burdens, farm the fields, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2209.24s)]
*  and hold the families together. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2212.24s)]
*  Yet nothing, it seems, is being done to protect them. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2214.24s)]
*  The war is so widespread [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2218.24s)]
*  that rapes are increasingly being committed by civilians. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2220.24s)]
*  A few washed-out billboards tell men that rape is wrong, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2223.24s)]
*  but there's little evidence [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2227.2799999999997s)]
*  Congolese officials take the problem seriously. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2228.2799999999997s)]
*  In the prosecutor's office, the complaints pile up. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2231.2799999999997s)]
*  We were told a $10 bribe [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2235.2799999999997s)]
*  could get a rape accusation investigated, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2237.2799999999997s)]
*  but few cases ever go to court. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2239.2799999999997s)]
*  We asked the prosecutor to show us the prison [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2242.2799999999997s)]
*  to see how many rapists were actually behind bars. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2244.2799999999997s)]
*  But when we got there, we were in for a surprise. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2248.2799999999997s)]
*  The prison had no fences [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2251.2799999999997s)]
*  and the guards had been kicked out. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2253.2799999999997s)]
*  The inmates had taken over the asylum. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2255.32s)]
*  The fact is the justice system is on its knees in Congo. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2257.32s)]
*  I can count on one hand the number of cases [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2261.32s)]
*  that we're aware of that have been brought to trial. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2264.32s)]
*  Literally here, people get away with rape, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2267.32s)]
*  they get away with murder. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2269.32s)]
*  The chances of being arrested are nil. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2271.32s)]
*  There may be no justice here, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2273.32s)]
*  but there are organisations [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2275.32s)]
*  trying to help rape survivors get back on their feet. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2277.32s)]
*  Women for Women teaches survivors [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2280.32s)]
*  how to make certain that they're not being abused. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2282.32s)]
*  They teach survivors how to make soap, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2284.36s)]
*  how to cook, skills they can use to earn money. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2288.36s)]
*  They also learn how to read and write. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2293.36s)]
*  It is the first time many of these women [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2297.36s)]
*  have ever been in a classroom. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2299.36s)]
*  It is their chance for a whole new life. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2302.36s)]
*  Remember Lucienne Mroyhi? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2307.36s)]
*  She's jumped at that chance. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2309.36s)]
*  She hopes to start her own business one day. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2311.36s)]
*  And that little child she holds? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2314.36s)]
*  That's the child of one of the soldiers who raped her, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2316.36s)]
*  one of the men who killed her brother. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2319.36s)]
*  A baby girl, born a year ago. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2322.36s)]
*  A baby girl Lucienne named Luck. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2325.36s)]
*  I named her Luck because I went through many hardships. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2330.36s)]
*  I could have been killed in the forest, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2333.36s)]
*  but I got my life back. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2336.36s)]
*  I have hope. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2338.36s)]
*  Hope is not something you'd expect [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2340.4s)]
*  Congo's rape survivors to still cling to, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2342.4s)]
*  but they do. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2345.4s)]
*  Each morning in Panzee Hospital, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2347.4s)]
*  they gather to raise their voices. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2349.4s)]
*  Our sufferings on earth, they sing, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2354.4s)]
*  will be relieved in heaven. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2356.4s)]
*  Relief in Congo, it seems, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2359.4s)]
*  is just too much to ask for. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2361.4s)]
*  When Demis Hasabas won the Nobel Prize last year, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2363.44s)]
*  he celebrated by playing poker [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2367.44s)]
*  with a world champion of chess. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2369.44s)]
*  Hasabas loves a game, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2372.44s)]
*  which is how he became a pioneer of the game. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2374.44s)]
*  He was a very good player, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2378.44s)]

*  What's always guided me [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2432.52s)]
*  and the passion I've always had [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2434.52s)]
*  is understanding the world around us. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2436.52s)]
*  I've always been, since I was a kid, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2438.52s)]
*  fascinated by the biggest questions, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2440.52s)]
*  you know, the meaning of life, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2442.52s)]
*  the nature of consciousness, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2444.52s)]
*  the nature of reality itself. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2446.56s)]
*  I've loved reading about all the great scientists [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2448.56s)]
*  who worked on these problems [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2450.56s)]
*  and the philosophers, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2452.56s)]
*  and I wanted to see [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2454.56s)]
*  if we could advance human knowledge. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2456.56s)]
*  And for me, my expression of doing that [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2458.56s)]
*  was to build what I think is the ultimate tool [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2460.56s)]
*  for advancing human knowledge, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2462.56s)]
*  which is AI. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2464.56s)]
*  We sat down in this room [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2466.56s)]
*  two years ago, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2468.56s)]
*  and I wonder if AI is moving [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2470.56s)]
*  faster today than you imagined. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2472.56s)]
*  It's moving incredibly fast. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2474.6s)]
*  I think we are on some kind [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2476.6s)]
*  of exponential curve of improvement. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2478.6s)]
*  Of course, the success of the field [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2480.6s)]
*  in the last few years has attracted [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2482.6s)]
*  even more attention, more resources, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2484.6s)]
*  more talent, so that's adding [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2486.6s)]
*  to this exponential progress. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2488.6s)]
*  Exponential curve, in other words, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2490.6s)]
*  straight up? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2492.6s)]
*  Yep, straight up and increasing speed [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2494.6s)]
*  of progress. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2496.6s)]
*  Start? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2498.6s)]
*  We saw the progress. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2500.6s)]

*  also takes in the world. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2516.64s)]
*  Do we call her she? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2518.64s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2520.64s)]
*  I'm not sure we all know the answer yet. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2522.64s)]

*  We challenged Astra with virtual [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2534.68s)]
*  paintings we chose [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2536.68s)]

*  And she said, well I'm sorry [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2616.8s)]
*  if you don't like my tone. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2618.8s)]
*  Well, you see [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2620.8s)]
*  What's happening there? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2622.8s)]
*  That's again a challenge with these systems [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2624.8s)]
*  as they act in the moment [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2626.8s)]
*  with the context that's around them [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2628.8s)]
*  and that may have never been tested before. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2630.8s)]
*  He's often surprised [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2632.8s)]
*  because AI programs are sent out [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2634.8s)]
*  on the internet to learn for themselves. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2636.8s)]
*  They can return later [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2638.8s)]
*  with unexpected skills. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2640.8s)]
*  So we have theories about [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2642.84s)]
*  what kinds of capabilities [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2644.84s)]
*  these systems will have. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2646.84s)]
*  That's obviously what we try to build into the architectures. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2648.84s)]
*  But at the end of the day [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2650.84s)]
*  how it learns what it picks up from the data [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2652.84s)]
*  is part of the training of these systems. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2654.84s)]
*  We don't program that in. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2656.84s)]
*  It learns like a human being would learn. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2658.84s)]
*  So new [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2660.84s)]
*  capabilities or properties [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2662.84s)]
*  can emerge from that training situation. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2664.84s)]
*  You understand how that would worry people? [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2666.84s)]
*  Of course. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2668.84s)]
*  It's the duality of these types of systems. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2670.88s)]
*  That they're able to [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2672.88s)]
*  do incredible things, go beyond [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2674.88s)]
*  the things that we're able to [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2676.88s)]
*  design ourselves or [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2678.88s)]
*  understand ourselves. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2680.88s)]
*  But of course the challenge is making sure [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2682.88s)]
*  that the knowledge databases they create [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2684.88s)]
*  we understand what's in them. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2686.88s)]
*  Now DeepMind is training [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2688.88s)]
*  its AI model called Gemini [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2690.88s)]
*  to not just reveal the world [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2692.88s)]
*  but to act in it [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2694.88s)]
*  like booking tickets [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2696.88s)]
*  and shopping online. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2698.92s)]
*  It's a step toward [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2700.92s)]
*  AGI [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2702.92s)]
*  artificial general intelligence [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2704.92s)]
*  with the versatility [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2706.92s)]
*  of a human mind. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2708.92s)]
*  On track for AGI? [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2710.92s)]
*  In the next five to ten years [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2712.92s)]
*  I think. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2714.92s)]
*  And in 2030 you will have what? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2716.92s)]
*  Well we'll have a system [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2718.92s)]
*  that really understands everything around you [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2720.92s)]
*  in very nuanced [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2722.92s)]
*  and deep ways [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2724.92s)]
*  embedded in your everyday life. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2726.96s)]
*  Embedded like Astra [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2728.96s)]
*  in eyeglasses. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2730.96s)]
*  What can you tell me about this building I'm looking at? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2732.96s)]
*  This is the Coal Drops Yard [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2734.96s)]
*  a shopping and dining district. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2736.96s)]
*  She sees what I see. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2738.96s)]
*  There's a speaker in the earpiece [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2740.96s)]
*  only I can hear. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2742.96s)]
*  What was it originally before it became shops? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2744.96s)]
*  The Coal Drops Yard was originally [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2746.96s)]
*  a set of Victorian coal warehouses [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2748.96s)]
*  used to receive and distribute coal across London. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2750.96s)]
*  Was coal ever [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2752.96s)]
*  a problem for the environment in London? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2755.0s)]
*  Yes. Coal was a significant source [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2757.0s)]
*  of air pollution in London [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2759.0s)]
*  particularly during the Industrial Revolution. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2761.0s)]
*  It occurred to us that the only [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2763.0s)]
*  thing we contributed to this relationship [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2765.0s)]
*  were legs [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2767.0s)]
*  which will also [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2769.0s)]
*  soon be engineered. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2771.0s)]
*  I also think another big area will be robotics. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2773.0s)]
*  I think it will have a breakthrough [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2775.0s)]
*  moment in the next couple of years where [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2777.0s)]
*  we'll have demonstrations of maybe [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2779.0s)]
*  humanoid robots or other types of [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2781.0s)]
*  robots that can start really doing [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2783.04s)]
*  useful things. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2785.04s)]
*  For example [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2787.04s)]
*  researchers Alex Li and [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2789.04s)]
*  Julia Vasani showed us [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2791.04s)]
*  a robot that understands what it sees [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2793.04s)]
*  and reasons its way [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2795.04s)]
*  through vague instructions. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2797.04s)]
*  Put the [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2799.04s)]
*  blocks whose color is the [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2801.04s)]
*  combination of yellow [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2803.04s)]
*  and blue into the matching color [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2805.04s)]
*  ball. The combination [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2807.04s)]
*  of yellow and blue [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2809.04s)]
*  is green [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2811.08s)]
*  and it figured that out. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2813.08s)]
*  It's reasoning. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2815.08s)]
*  Yep, definitely, yes. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2817.08s)]
*  The toys of Demis [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2819.08s)]
*  Hisabas's childhood weren't [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2821.08s)]
*  blocks but chess pieces. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2823.08s)]
*  At 12 he was the number [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2825.08s)]
*  two champion in the world [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2827.08s)]
*  for his age. This passion [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2829.08s)]
*  led to computer chess, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2831.08s)]
*  video games and finally [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2833.08s)]
*  thinking machines. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2835.08s)]
*  He was born to a Greek Cypriot [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2837.08s)]
*  father and Singaporean mother. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2839.12s)]
*  Cambridge, MIT, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2841.12s)]
*  Harvard. He's a computer [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2843.12s)]
*  scientist with a PhD [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2845.12s)]
*  in neuroscience [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2847.12s)]
*  because he reasoned he [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2849.12s)]
*  had to understand the human brain [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2851.12s)]
*  first. Are you working [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2853.12s)]
*  on a system today that would [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2855.12s)]
*  be self aware? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2857.12s)]
*  I don't think any of today's systems [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2859.12s)]
*  to me feel self aware or [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2861.12s)]
*  conscious in any way. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2863.12s)]
*  Obviously everyone needs to make their own decisions [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2865.12s)]
*  by interacting with these chat bots. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2867.16s)]
*  I think theoretically it's possible. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2869.16s)]
*  But is self awareness a goal [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2871.16s)]
*  of yours? Not explicitly [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2873.16s)]
*  but it may happen implicitly. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2875.16s)]
*  These systems might acquire some [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2877.16s)]
*  feeling of self awareness that is possible. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2879.16s)]
*  I think it's important for these systems [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2881.16s)]
*  to understand you, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2883.16s)]
*  self and other and that's [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2885.16s)]
*  probably the beginning of something like [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2887.16s)]
*  self awareness. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2889.16s)]
*  But he says if a machine becomes [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2891.16s)]
*  self aware, we may [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2893.16s)]
*  not recognize it. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2895.2s)]
*  I think there's two reasons we [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2897.2s)]
*  regard each other as conscious. One is that [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2899.2s)]
*  you're exhibiting the behavior [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2901.2s)]
*  of a conscious being, very similar to [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2903.2s)]
*  my behavior. But the second thing is [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2905.2s)]
*  you're running on the same substrate. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2907.2s)]
*  We're made of the same carbon matter [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2909.2s)]
*  with our squishy brains. Now obviously [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2911.2s)]
*  with machines, they're running on silicon. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2913.2s)]
*  So even if they exhibit the same [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2915.2s)]
*  behaviors and even if they say [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2917.2s)]
*  the same things, it doesn't necessarily mean [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2919.2s)]
*  that this sensation [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2921.2s)]

*  Not so far that I've [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2931.24s)]
*  experienced and I think that's getting [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2933.24s)]
*  at the idea of what's still missing [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2935.24s)]

*  that has not been [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2947.24s)]

*  No, they don't have curiosity [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2951.2799999999997s)]
*  and they're probably lacking a little bit [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2953.2799999999997s)]
*  in what we would call imagination and intuition. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2955.2799999999997s)]
*  But they will have greater imagination [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2957.2799999999997s)]

*  maybe 5 to 10 years, I think [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2963.2799999999997s)]
*  we'll have systems that are capable of [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2965.2799999999997s)]
*  not only solving [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2967.2799999999997s)]

*  Solving an important problem [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2975.2799999999997s)]
*  won Hasabas a Nobel Prize [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2977.2799999999997s)]
*  last year. He and [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2979.32s)]
*  colleague John Jumper created [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2981.32s)]
*  an AI model that deciphered [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2983.32s)]
*  the structure of proteins. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2985.32s)]
*  Proteins are [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2987.32s)]
*  the basic building blocks of life [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2989.32s)]
*  so everything in biology, everything in your [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2991.32s)]
*  body depends on proteins. You know your neurons [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2993.32s)]
*  firing, your muscle fibers twitching [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2995.32s)]
*  it's all mediated by proteins. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2997.32s)]
*  But 3D protein structures [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=2999.32s)]
*  like this are so complex [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3001.32s)]
*  less than 1% [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3003.32s)]
*  were known. Mapping [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3005.32s)]
*  each one used to take years. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3007.36s)]
*  DeepMind's [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3009.36s)]
*  AI model did 200 [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3011.36s)]
*  million in one year. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3013.36s)]
*  Now, Hasabas has [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3015.36s)]
*  AI blazing through [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3017.36s)]
*  solutions to drug development. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3019.36s)]
*  So on average [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3021.36s)]
*  it takes 10 years and billions of dollars [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3023.36s)]
*  to design just one drug. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3025.36s)]
*  We can maybe reduce that down from years [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3027.36s)]
*  to maybe months or maybe even weeks [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3029.36s)]
*  which sounds incredible today, but that's also [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3031.36s)]
*  what people used to think about protein structures. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3033.36s)]
*  It would revolutionize human health [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3035.4s)]
*  and I think one day maybe we can [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3037.4s)]
*  cure all disease with the help of [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3039.4s)]
*  AI. The end of disease? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3041.4s)]
*  I think that's within reach [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3043.4s)]
*  maybe within the next decade or so [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3045.4s)]
*  I don't see why not. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3047.4s)]
*  Demis Hasabas told us [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3049.4s)]
*  AI could lead to what he calls [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3051.4s)]
*  radical abundance [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3053.4s)]
*  the elimination of scarcity [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3055.4s)]
*  but he also worries about [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3057.4s)]
*  risk. There's two worries that [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3059.4s)]
*  I worry about. One is that [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3061.4s)]
*  bad actors, human [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3063.44s)]
*  users of these systems [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3065.44s)]
*  repurpose these systems for harmful ends. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3067.44s)]
*  Then the second thing is the AI [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3069.44s)]
*  systems themselves as they become more autonomous [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3071.44s)]
*  and more powerful, can we make sure that [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3073.44s)]
*  we can keep control of the systems, that they're [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3075.44s)]
*  aligned with our values, they're doing [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3077.44s)]
*  what we want that benefits society [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3079.44s)]
*  and they stay on guardrails. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3081.44s)]
*  Guardrails are safety [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3083.44s)]
*  limits built into the system [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3085.44s)]
*  and I wonder if the race for [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3087.44s)]
*  AI dominance is a race [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3089.44s)]
*  to the bottom for safety. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3091.48s)]
*  So that's one of my big worries [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3093.48s)]
*  actually is that of course [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3095.48s)]
*  all of this energy and racing [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3097.48s)]
*  and resources is great for progress [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3099.48s)]
*  but it might incentivise [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3101.48s)]
*  certain actors in that to [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3103.48s)]
*  cut corners. And one [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3105.48s)]
*  of the corners that can be shortcut would be [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3107.48s)]
*  safety and responsibility. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3109.48s)]
*  So the question is how can we [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3111.48s)]
*  coordinate more as [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3113.48s)]
*  leading players but also [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3115.48s)]
*  nation states even. I think [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3117.48s)]
*  this is an international thing. AI is going to affect [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3119.52s)]
*  every country, everybody in the world [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3121.52s)]
*  so I think it's really important [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3123.52s)]
*  that the world and the international [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3125.52s)]
*  community has a say in this. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3127.52s)]
*  Can you teach an AI agent [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3129.52s)]
*  morality? [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3131.52s)]
*  I think you can. They learn by [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3133.52s)]
*  demonstration, they learn by teaching [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3135.52s)]
*  and I think that's one of the [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3137.52s)]
*  things we have to do with these systems is [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3139.52s)]
*  to give them a value system [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3141.52s)]
*  and a guidance and some [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3143.52s)]
*  guardrails around that, much in the way that [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3145.52s)]
*  you would teach a child. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3147.56s)]
*  Google DeepMind is in a race [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3149.56s)]
*  with dozens of others [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3151.56s)]
*  striving for artificial general [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3153.56s)]
*  intelligence, so human [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3155.56s)]
*  that you can't tell the difference [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3157.56s)]
*  which made us think [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3159.56s)]
*  about Demis Hasaba's signing [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3161.56s)]

*  humans ever sign it [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3171.56s)]
*  again? I think in the next steps [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VPf7qmp4I&t=3173.56s)]
