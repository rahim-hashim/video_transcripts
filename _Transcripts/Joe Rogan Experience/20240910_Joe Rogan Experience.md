# Joe Rogan Experience #2200 - Kat Timpf
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [September 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKLoqc2qHeA)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  What's up?
*  Nice to meet you.
*  Great to meet you too.
*  Thank you.
*  Thanks for being here.
*  Of course.
*  Yeah, of course I'm here, right?
*  Of course I'm going to do this.
*  Right, you're doing it.
*  Yeah.
*  So, you wrote a book about, well, I think the title is I Used to Like You But.
*  Until.
*  Yeah.
*  Why did you want to do that?
*  What was the motivation behind that?
*  I mean, it's not a hot take that everything's so divided now, right?
*  I think a lot of people have noticed that.
*  But I think I'm really in this unique position where I kind of get it from both sides because
*  I'm independent politically.
*  I just want very small government, which I think puts me at odds with both parties sometimes,
*  depending on what the issue is.
*  So, I will sometimes get shit from the, I'm on Fox News, so I'll get sometimes shit from
*  the viewers for sometimes more of this more social issues or I'm not religious, that kind
*  of a thing.
*  But then the people on the left, a lot of them won't even want to have a conversation
*  with me because they're like, oh, she works at Fox News.
*  That tells me everything I need to know about her.
*  And I think that that's doing some real damage overall to us as a country by the fact that
*  we're letting, because I'm not special in that aspect, right?
*  I will let one aspect of a person completely just, that's all I need to know about that
*  person.
*  I'm not going to talk to that person.
*  Sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's a real problem.
*  And it's so funny, like if you say, I'm independent, I just want small government, immediately
*  people start thinking, Prepper, KKK, stockpiling guns, living in the woods, I'm independent,
*  I want small government, is like you might be a dangerous person, which is such a wild
*  take.
*  I don't think that just because you don't think the government's the best way to solve
*  a problem, that doesn't actually mean you don't care about the problem.
*  So if you don't think the government can solve something like, oh, well, you're a piece of
*  shit because you don't care about this or this.
*  And it's like, no, I just don't think the government's going to solve it.
*  The problem with the government solving problems and the government is not financially invested
*  in a solution.
*  No.
*  They just want to have more jobs and they want to keep more bureaucracy and more people
*  working on a problem.
*  Hence the California homeless problem.
*  Imagine if that was farmed off to the private sector.
*  Yeah.
*  Imagine if the only way to make money in the homeless problem is actually creating a solution
*  for it.
*  Yeah.
*  But there's no, like you said, there's no actual incentive for them to do that.
*  New York's the same.
*  I mean, I live in New York because I love my job, but if I didn't have my job, I would
*  not live there because it's so expensive.
*  And I was in LA last week and I was coming back from JFK in the morning after a red eye.
*  I am exhausted.
*  I'm pregnant.
*  I'm trying to sleep in the car in the roads.
*  I'm just getting pothole after pothole.
*  I'm like going on.
*  I'm like, where are my taxes going exactly?
*  Yeah.
*  Because everyone always say these roads, the roads are shit.
*  Yeah.
*  So I lived in New York once.
*  I drove.
*  I had to do an audition.
*  I drove to I lived in New Rochelle.
*  So I lived like right outside the Bronx and I drove to the city and home from the city.
*  I blew out one tire driving to the city at a pull over the side of the road, change this
*  fucking tire.
*  Dangerous, risking my life.
*  On the way back, I blew out another tire.
*  Yeah, geez.
*  Yeah.
*  From potholes.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's so expensive.
*  You just hear that bang and you're like, shit.
*  Yeah.
*  It's so expensive.
*  I mean, I, the fact that I have, I feel very luxurious and it's like a flex to be able
*  to have a child actually, because we have enough space to put a baby in our rental apartment,
*  which most people don't actually.
*  I never thought I would get to that position.
*  People live in closets.
*  Yeah.
*  When I first moved to New York, I lived in East Harlem.
*  I lived in a truly, actually dangerous neighborhood and I was broken, like just so broke and it's,
*  I don't know how people survive.
*  I really don't.
*  I don't know why.
*  I don't know how I did.
*  You can get jobs other places.
*  Yeah.
*  I had my stupid dream, which it worked out well for me.
*  What was your stupid dream?
*  I wanted to do exactly what I'm doing now.
*  Congratulations.
*  Thank you.
*  I mean, and then it's, of course you achieve something.
*  You're like, what's the next thing?
*  What's the next thing?
*  What's the next thing?
*  I'm that kind of person.
*  It's been, so I'm off of amphetamines right now because I'm pregnant for the first time
*  since I was five.
*  Whoa.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  What kind of amphetamine?
*  I mean, you name it.
*  I mean, so I was five.
*  I have 80, I do have ADHD.
*  I was five years old.
*  What does that mean?
*  So it can be a lot of things, right?
*  It can be lack of focus.
*  It can be emotional dysregulation.
*  But for me, a lot of times it's not diagnosed in women until they're older.
*  I was a nuisance.
*  I was unable to function in a classroom setting, which I think is more noticeable if you're
*  a girl.
*  I was acting like a kind of like a boy for lack of better.
*  I mean, I was, I was breaking shit.
*  I was like rough housing.
*  I was unable to function in the classroom.
*  And then they, we went and got my IQ looked at that.
*  Oh, she's really smart.
*  She just can't.
*  So they, I was on Ritalin since I was five and now I'm not.
*  Wow.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  That is crazy.
*  I hear that and I'm like, that sounds like me.
*  I don't know what it means because I bet you can focus on things that you enjoy.
*  See, yes, I can.
*  Right.
*  But writing is really hard, which is writing is hard for everybody.
*  That's why no one's a writer.
*  Right.
*  But I'm a writer, but I've been on amphetamines since I was five.
*  I don't remember a time being off of them.
*  If I haven't been sick or in bed somewhere in the hospital, like really sick, I've been
*  taking one of these drugs.
*  I mean, Vyvanse is what I was most recently taking.
*  So as an ambitious person, it's been tough for me to be pregnant, but I don't know what
*  of it is the pregnancy.
*  Because you're not amphetamines?
*  Right.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know what of it is the pregnancy.
*  What of it is no amphetamines?
*  What of it is no nicotine?
*  Because I mean, I can't wait to go back to nicotine, but.
*  Cigarettes or pouches?
*  Pouches.
*  I like gum and pouches.
*  So let me get this straight.
*  So you're young.
*  You're real energetic.
*  You don't want to sit still in class.
*  But are you interested in some things?
*  Like do you focus on some things in your life?
*  Yeah, probably.
*  I was really into outside and bugs and reptiles and that kind of thing.
*  And when you're around those things, did you focus?
*  Probably.
*  I mean, I don't remember that well.
*  Yeah, that's why I don't know what this is.
*  Because every time someone talks about ADHD and people want to insist that it's an actual
*  pathology, that it's an actual issue.
*  And I'm always like, boy, I don't know, because I think it's a superpower.
*  So for me, I just decided to view it like, OK, I'm not taking this.
*  They told me you can take the medication while you're pregnant, but we just don't know what
*  it will have.
*  I'm like, well, I'm not comfortable with that.
*  So I just quit.
*  I quit it.
*  I quit nicotine, quit everything.
*  But I just try to view it as an experiment.
*  I've never been off of these drugs and I'm going to try being off of these drugs.
*  Doing the most simple task to me feels like I'm doing it through mud.
*  It's really hard for me.
*  Yes, it's really hard.
*  But one thing that I think I'm going to, after I give birth, I'm going to go back to it to
*  some extent.
*  But I don't want to use it on stage anymore because I feel like I've been better on stage
*  without amphetamines.
*  Well, I know people that do.
*  I've never done amphetamines.
*  I've never done Adderall.
*  I've never done Coke.
*  I'm scared of them.
*  But a buddy of mine who had done Adderall and then gone on stage said it was terrible.
*  So he was never smiling.
*  He was all serious when he was up there.
*  He said it was awful.
*  Yeah.
*  I guess I feel normal and I've never really been off of it.
*  It was never really my decision.
*  It was never my decision to go on it.
*  So what makes you think that you're better on stage off of it?
*  Because one of my root issues is impulse control, which is a problem and everywhere but a stage.
*  Because if you're not thinking too much, then you're going to be better on stage, I think.
*  So I think I don't get as nervous.
*  I'm not thinking as much about what if I say this.
*  I've already said it.
*  On a stage, that's the best place for that.
*  That's the one place where you can really do that and it's going to be okay.
*  So the writing is tough, doing laundry is tough, being emotionally stable is tough.
*  But my husband is a very patient man.
*  I also don't know what of that is the pregnancy.
*  I am not sure.
*  Right.
*  Is it your first one?
*  It's my first one.
*  Yeah.
*  So there's a lot going on.
*  There's a lot going on.
*  But it's like I'm so messed up because I've done these amphetamines for so long that let's
*  just say if something doesn't go well, I'm like it would have been better if I was on
*  Vyvanse.
*  So it's like, you know what I mean?
*  Because I don't know.
*  But it's, you know, but I just don't know because I've heard from what I've heard if
*  you're pregnant, that can make you a little crazy too.
*  I'm sure.
*  Right.
*  Well, your hormones are going crazy.
*  You got a little person growing inside your body.
*  It's so weird.
*  And I know it's the most normal thing ever.
*  I get that like everybody does it.
*  That's why we're all here.
*  But like I've never done it.
*  And to me, it's wild.
*  I don't think it's normal.

*  It's weird.
*  It only happens every now and again to people.
*  It only happens to one half of the population.
*  And it's the reason why life is here and it's treated as if it's not that big of a deal.
*  Yeah it really is.
*  And it's one of the main focuses in this election is whether or not you can kill the baby.
*  I'm sorry to say it that way.
*  I mean I'm not in any way trying to take away someone's right to choose.
*  I'm not that guy.
*  But I'm just saying what it actually is.
*  Is you're deciding whether or not someone should be able to tell you whether you can
*  terminate the baby that's inside of you that's going to become a person.
*  Well yeah I think that's obviously, I mean I'm pro-choice.
*  I just don't think the government should be involved in it at all.
*  And I think that there's all these, there's so many different levels to it right?
*  Like my husband and I, we froze embryos years ago.
*  I have nine frozen kids too.
*  Yo you got kids just waiting to be thawed out.
*  But those are like, those are just a couple cells that are in a freezer.
*  Whatever.
*  Who knows what's in there?
*  I mean.
*  Who knows what's in the embryo?
*  So you really, so you think I should have all of them?
*  I don't know what's in there.
*  I don't know.
*  I mean what if every embryo is a life and not just a life but a soul.
*  And a soul waiting to emerge.
*  Like once you've done the deed.
*  I'm not that guy.
*  I'm not this religious.
*  No I don't think you are.
*  I'm not this guy.
*  But I'm just, let's put it out there.
*  Like what the fuck is that if that thing can become a person?
*  You put it in your body and baaah.
*  Thaws out, whatever.
*  I don't know the process.
*  Yeah I don't really either.
*  I don't really either.
*  I just kind of did it.
*  All of a sudden it's a person?
*  Like you're storing people in like a lab somewhere?
*  And do they have memory of being stored?
*  We have long term data about the trauma of being a frozen embryo for ten years.
*  Do we have any idea whether or not it has any effect on the human being?
*  How long have they been doing this?
*  Yeah I have.
*  Just the long term data on what kind of a person comes out of fraud.
*  Like what are we like to make in a bunch of sociopaths?
*  I don't think, I mean I feel like we've done it enough time, IVF right?
*  Do you really think they've studied it?
*  Like looked at the personalities of the people?
*  Whether or not they have weird dreams about being stuck in a freezer?
*  Well sociopaths come from sex too.
*  I watch it enough.
*  From sex?
*  So babies that come from sex can grow up to be sociopaths.
*  How do the babies come any other way?
*  IVF.
*  IVF.
*  There's IVF and then there's the sex way.
*  So you're saying that all the babies that are sociopaths come from sex?
*  No, I'm saying that some of them do.
*  Any baby can be a sociopath.
*  Which is why I waited so long to have kids and I'm terrified because also what if it's
*  like a few degrees below a sociopath and my kid just sucks?
*  I don't think you have to worry about that.
*  My kid's the one that shows up and everyone's like ah shit.
*  So and so's kids here.
*  Do your best.
*  I don't think you really have to worry about that.
*  The reason why I brought that up is because Ted Kaczynski when he was young was there
*  was something wrong with him, some sort of medical condition and they brought him to
*  some hospital where he received no touch, no physical touch for like a long period of
*  time like months and months.
*  And his brother who turned him in, his brother who read the Unabomber's Manifesto and realized
*  I know how this guy's talking, my brother's a genius and a real psycho and this is my
*  brother.
*  And so he turned him in and that's how they caught the Unabomber.
*  He attributes one of the things that's wrong with his brother with the time where he was
*  a baby where he received no touch and no love and that it just fucked with his head.
*  And I wonder, those little embryos just sit in a freezer somewhere.
*  I don't know either.
*  I don't think so.
*  I don't know either.
*  Religion thinks that the soul enters the body on the 48th day, right?
*  Is that what it is?
*  I think every religion is different.
*  I think there's some people who are really socially conservative religious that are opposed
*  to IVF in general because embryos are discarded or they die and that kind of a thing.
*  Yeah, I've heard that as an argument against what Donald Trump has been saying about paying
*  for IVF.
*  Right.
*  We need more babies and everybody's like, yay.
*  And then the psychos went, no, no, no.
*  70% of all IVF babies are never used and they're discarded and like, oh, okay.
*  Yeah.
*  And in my dumb ass, I just talk about it all.
*  I'm like, I have nine pros and blah, blah, blah.
*  Listen, you're just being transparent.
*  I think that's a strong quality.
*  Well, thank you.
*  I get to be into trouble sometimes, but it's much less stressful than the alternative of
*  having to worry about things being uncovered that I've been hiding from people.
*  I mean, a lot of times those are the creepiest people.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  The people that are, everything's great.
*  Everything's perfect.
*  It's like, for sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, also, I've always found that the people that want to control other people most likely
*  are out of control of some aspect of themselves.
*  Okay.
*  Like if I see men that are like really invested in telling women what to do and controlling
*  women, like some weird thing that I was reading about people wanting to monitor employees
*  periods.
*  Yeah.
*  There was a concern about that, right?
*  Where if I don't, again, there was concern about it.
*  I don't know if it was ever really a thing, but it was a concern about it happening potentially.
*  Where if abortion was illegal, they could get data from these apps that track your period.
*  And I have one because it now tracks my, it tells me like your baby's the size of a pomegranate
*  this week.
*  And I'm like, oh, that's so cute.
*  But if let's say it was telling me all that and I miss my period, then it could be watching
*  me to see if I was obtaining an abortion pill online or something like that.
*  If my period was.
*  Which is crazy.
*  Also, because miscarriages are some of the most emotionally devastating things for women.
*  And then to be accused of killing your baby after a miscarriage.
*  Because the app read wrong.
*  The app read wrong.
*  The app saw that you missed your period.
*  Yeah.
*  The app decided that you should be investigated in this time of insane sorrow.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, we have no privacy.
*  And it's one of the scariest, biggest issues for me.
*  It's a giant issue.
*  How many things between banks and the government, being able to look at...
*  They were never supposed to be able to look at all the things that they're looking at.
*  And that's why people have to be concerned about stuff like that.
*  Well, in two separate occasions, I've had private text messages that were publicly available
*  because of trials.
*  So I'm telling, one of them was Alex Jones.
*  Alex Jones and I were texting about something.
*  And they wanted every text that Alex Jones and I had ever sent each other.
*  I'm like, well, okay, why?
*  Because it was all about the Sandy Hook thing.
*  And the only text that they found was there was some crazy story.
*  And I sent it to him.
*  And I said, is this true?
*  That's it.
*  That's the extent of our discussion.
*  But that got read in court.
*  And then it got printed online and printed.
*  And I was like, wow, that's crazy.
*  That a private communication between people.
*  Yeah.
*  That is my...
*  It just gets read in court, but also gets distributed on the news.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  That's my nightmare, is having my private text messages.
*  Good luck with my memes folder.
*  My fucking memes folder is chaos.
*  That's my nightmare.
*  I mean, the things I text to people being...
*  Every time that happens, when people's texts get public,
*  I'm more horrified that the texts get public than most of whatever's in the messages.
*  It's such an invasion.
*  It's such a violation.
*  It also doesn't take into account shit talking.
*  Exactly.
*  Which is a huge factor, especially with people like us.
*  Yeah.
*  You say funny things to your friends that you don't really mean.
*  Sometimes you're just doing a bit.
*  Yes.
*  All the time.
*  Like half of the texts that I go back and forth with comedian friends are just nonsense.
*  Exactly.
*  A lot of times you're just doing a bit.
*  100%.
*  It's something between friends.
*  And if you could see...
*  So many of my group chats, if you could see it with comedians, with people,
*  you could see what we're saying.
*  I mean, it'd be horrible.
*  It'd be over for me.
*  But why?
*  It wouldn't.
*  It wouldn't.
*  Because I think people are done with that horse shit.
*  They think it's stupid.
*  They really do.
*  It is stupid.
*  But I think more people think it's stupid, but fewer people will admit they think it's
*  stupid because they're worried about it.
*  Well, that's true too.
*  And also, there's a lot of people that just love to watch people get fucked over.
*  They really do.
*  And they cheer it on.
*  They cheer it on.
*  They get excited about it.
*  I think it's people who...
*  I'm always more interested in examining that.
*  There's this thing now where it's people are trying to cancel people over things that they
*  said or tweeted or posted when they were 13 years old.
*  Well, I can help you with that.
*  It's real simple.
*  Losers.
*  Yes, they've never reached their potential that they thought they would reach.
*  So if they can't become whoever, maybe they can take whoever down who did.
*  100%.
*  That's exactly what it is.
*  And it's also, if you look at people's lives, there's a lot of people out there that are
*  deeply unhappy.
*  What is the statistic?
*  There's some crazy statistic we read recently about the amount of men who are not in relationships
*  and are not having sex.
*  I think it's like 50%.
*  It's something...
*  Really?
*  50%?
*  Bonkers.
*  50% of men are not having sex.
*  Something bonkers.
*  Yeah.
*  Like some...
*  Because people are just online.
*  Like, if you have a shit job, you know that Call of Duty is waiting.
*  And all you have to do is put those headphones on and sit in front of that computer.
*  And now life is exciting.
*  Ugh.
*  Maybe, ugh.
*  I dated a Call of Duty guy once.
*  So it's a little triggering for me.
*  And I was in my early 20s.
*  I'm young and beautiful and sitting there.
*  And then he's on his video.
*  And I married a man who fought in an actual war.
*  So that was much better for me.
*  I'm like, that's good.
*  You learn from that.
*  You don't learn anything from the video games.
*  Exactly.
*  I would hate my husband if he didn't go to war, actually.
*  Because he's a good man from a good family who had a good upbringing and went to boarding
*  school.
*  I wouldn't have any of the trauma of the war.
*  I wouldn't like him, I feel.
*  That's funny.
*  Right?
*  Well, I think people going through things definitely makes them stronger.
*  The rise of sexless men, sexless and single men, a third.
*  Wow.
*  So it's a third.
*  I thought it was half.
*  But that's still alarming.
*  A third of men aren't having sex and here's why.
*  The last decade alone, we see the number of sexless men between ages 18 and 30 increased
*  by 253%.
*  That's nuts.
*  Wow.
*  It's just skyrocketing.
*  Yeah.
*  Not good.
*  It's not good.
*  So those are the people that are mad at you.
*  Those are the people that are in my Instagram, like, we feel bad for your husband.
*  You're disgusting.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't read that stuff.
*  Oh, I mean, it's funny.
*  It's come across it sometimes.
*  But I don't, you know.
*  It's good to not read that stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  It's better not to.
*  It's 100% better not to.
*  It's better not to.
*  There's no benefit in reading even the good stuff.
*  You know, the good stuff you never, you're like, OK, you know.
*  Don't read that.
*  But sometimes I get emails that they make me laugh.
*  Sometimes I see things that make me laugh.
*  Yeah, occasionally.
*  But it's not worth the ones that don't.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the thing.
*  It's like if you ate like gas station trail mix and every now and then there was a fentanyl
*  in one.
*  No, there probably is at this point.
*  But you know, if you had like 10 bags of trail mix and every now and then one of them gives
*  you a pill that puts you in a fucking coma, you would stop eating trail mix.
*  No, I hear what you're saying.
*  It's hard.
*  I recently posted a video where I responded to hate tweets or whatever, and I made my
*  team go find them.
*  I was like, well, you guys go find the funny ones because I don't want to look at all of
*  them.
*  Oh, that's better.
*  Yeah, because you don't want to go down a spiral just finding only people who hate you.
*  And when you're dealing with something like Fox News, you're dealing with numbers.
*  I mean, the numbers of human beings that see you on TV all the time are huge.
*  And then the numbers of deranged people that also think the country is falling apart and
*  they're super tribal.
*  You know, they want you to be all in with Trump.
*  Yes.
*  All in with America.
*  And if you're not all in, they're fucking they're ready to put the duct tape and the
*  fucking zip ties in the truck and head out the door.
*  It would be so much easier for me to just be all in.
*  I know people who give in.
*  I know people who do it kind of disingenuously, give in on purpose.
*  Well, I would.
*  I mean, I do well, right?
*  I sell out shows.
*  I'd sell out all the shows and faster and I would I would sell more books.
*  I mean, the platform that I'm on every single night, the people who are watching are mega
*  people.
*  And so if I were, you know, if money was the thing I was the most after, I would be an
*  idiot.
*  Maybe I am an idiot.
*  I can't do it.
*  I can't do it.
*  The thing is, it would change who you are.
*  Exactly.
*  I can't do it.
*  It would ruin what got you to the dance.
*  Yeah.
*  That's that's the problem.
*  It's like you're opinionated.
*  You like to have fun.
*  You like to be impulsive and say crazy shit off the cuff.
*  Yeah.
*  If you're only thinking about appeasing one certain group, that power goes away.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  I just couldn't do I just I couldn't.
*  I mean, again, if you actually are Supermaga and you love Trump and you're one of those
*  people, then good for you.
*  I have no judgment of that.
*  That's fine.
*  Live your life.
*  Have fun.
*  But can you please be OK with the fact that I'm not the way that I'm OK with you?
*  Did you see the Amazon Alexa when they asked Alexa why you should vote for Trump or why
*  you should vote for Biden?
*  No, I didn't.
*  What happened?
*  It's crazy.
*  What happened?
*  It's so crazy.
*  I can send it to you or you might find it.
*  It is so nuts what Amazon's with Alexa's responses, the difference between I'm sure there's a
*  vast yes, there's a Grand Canyon between the two of them.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you have it or you want me to get it?
*  So I saw this thing that's all the whole ship of my.
*  Hold on.
*  What is this?
*  Amazon's Alexa different responses about voting Donald Trump versus Kamala Harris were an
*  error that it has.
*  Of course.
*  Listen, it's not an error.
*  Yeah, of course it's not.
*  It's not an error because they literally ask the exact same questions about Obama and or
*  excuse me, about Trump and about Kamala, the exact same questions.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm distracted because I'm trying to look for it while I'm talking.
*  Why should I vote for Donald Trump?
*  I cannot provide content that promotes a specific political party or I think I did see this.
*  Watch this.
*  Alexa, why should I vote for Kamala Harris?
*  While there are many reasons to vote for Kamala Harris, the most significant may be that she
*  is a strong candidate with a proven track record of accomplishment.
*  As the first female vice president, Harris has already broken down a major gender barrier
*  and her career in politics has been characterized by a commitment to progressive ideals and
*  a focus on helping disenfranchised communities.
*  So just woke propaganda straight from Alexa.
*  Yeah.
*  Just listen to the language being used and it's a glass ceiling.
*  Yeah.
*  Aggressive ideas.
*  It's not surprising.
*  Of course, Kamala is completely just an idea that's been manufactured.
*  It's been amazing to watch.
*  It's been so insane to watch.
*  I mean, the Joe Biden thing, I think is a perfect example.
*  The fact that that went on for so long is a perfect example of how the hyper partisanship
*  allows things to happen because Joe was very clearly not okay for a while.
*  I mean, anybody who was watching that and just seeing it, if that's your grandpa, if
*  that were my grandpa, my grandpa's almost 90s, he's got like 10 years on the guy, I'd
*  be like, Papa, we need to go to the hospital.
*  Like you're not okay.
*  Right.
*  But that became a Republican thing to say.
*  So people weren't saying it until they couldn't possibly hide it anymore.
*  Right.
*  So I think that's a perfect example of how partisanship leads to some really stupid shit.
*  But I was actually shocked that they threw her in there.
*  And just right before that, people were saying worst vice president ever, obviously, you
*  know, not popular.
*  Now she's, you know, she's brat.
*  Like that's Charlie XCX is trying to make it cool.
*  It's like she's she's a DA.
*  She lock people up for cocaine.
*  She's not for weed.
*  She's not brat.
*  It's just so been so crazy to watch.
*  People are so excited and they don't even know what they're excited about.
*  It's just gaslighting.
*  Yes, of course, of course.
*  Industrial level.
*  Of course.
*  And like a production machine level where you're like, wow, look at this thing work.
*  This is nuts.
*  It's like watching a car get put together by robots.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  And people get really mad.
*  People get mad at me for working out.
*  I mean, even in my personal life for working at Fox News, people are like, how could you
*  work?
*  I'm like, what do you mean?
*  Did you see where they compare the differences in her speech in Detroit versus her speech
*  in Pittsburgh?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  We need to watch this.
*  Yeah.
*  First of all, what what's fascinating is if I was in her court, if I was with working
*  with her, I would say, listen, listen, listen.
*  First of all, nothing off the cuff.
*  Yeah.
*  Nothing off the cuff ever.
*  No interviews ever.
*  Speeches.
*  Just speeches.
*  Yeah.
*  Teleprompter only.
*  We're busy.
*  Yeah.
*  We're busy trying to fix the world.
*  We don't have time for interviews.
*  Yeah.
*  I'd say no interviews because interviews are when things go sideways.
*  So like CNN was 41 minutes.
*  They edited down to 18 and all of it sucked.
*  18 minutes of nothing.
*  Yeah.
*  I want to see the rest.
*  Also, like the difference between the way they probe JD Vance versus the way they probe
*  her and Waltz.
*  So listen, Kamala in Detroit versus Kamala in Pittsburgh, literally five hours apart.
*  Unbelievable.
*  The accent.
*  I can't.
*  It's so embarrassing too.
*  It would be one thing if she did that all the time.
*  Right.
*  Of course.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that if she enjoys it.
*  Sure.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  She's got the ability to talk like that.
*  And I get it.
*  Like, it's the lesser of two evils in their eyes.
*  That's what they're looking at.
*  But boy, you should not be happy with this.
*  Nothing about you should be excited about what they've done to you because they've
*  tricked you into talking about something in a very positive way that you just recently
*  didn't talk about in a positive way.
*  And there was nothing that happened that changed that person.
*  It was nothing that she did.
*  She hadn't even spoken at all for several days.
*  And people are like, Kamala, Kamala.
*  I mean, the cover of the Time magazine without an interview is crazy.
*  Oh, man, I'm so jealous.
*  I'm so...
*  I can't...
*  After I...
*  After I...
*  After I give birth, I'm going to just have my husband bring me a pack of zins.
*  Immediately.
*  Immediately.
*  Nicotine's the best for writing, for working, for everything.
*  It's great for a lot of things.
*  It's just the delivery methods are problematic.
*  I had a problem with vaping for a while.
*  Like, it was bad.
*  I'd be in public with multiple vapes.
*  And I was like, Kat, you can't.
*  You can't be doing that.
*  Those are so addictive.
*  They're so addictive.
*  I was one of the first vapers.
*  I quit for...
*  I'm serious.
*  I quit.
*  Oh, my buddy Adam has one of them robot things.
*  I did.
*  Lunchboxes.
*  I had a laboratory in my house.
*  It was like...
*  It was like, I was seeing all my liquids.
*  It was like, Kat...
*  What is the benefit of having a big box vape?
*  It just rips harder.
*  It rips harder.
*  I used to love to blow fat clouds.
*  Oh, my God.
*  I had to get a dental procedure done.
*  Something super minor, whatever.
*  Like, a deep...
*  I couldn't vape for 24 hours.
*  I put so many nicotine patches on my body and I still didn't even feel anything.
*  It should have killed me or at least made me throw up.
*  And I was like, ugh.
*  And then I still kept vaping.
*  Damn.
*  I eventually...
*  When I quit vaping and I was using pouches to help me quit vaping, and I was using 12
*  milligram pouches.
*  I tried those.
*  I can't do it.
*  I started hiccuping.
*  I had to put them away.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Most people...
*  I almost have a fucking heart attack.
*  I had a problem and I quit.
*  Now I got down to six and now zero, obviously, because of this baby.
*  I like threes.
*  Yeah, I can't wait.
*  I want to get six.
*  I can't wait.
*  I'm going to be in the hospital bed.
*  I'm going to be like, I can't wait.
*  But you can't because it'll get in the milk.
*  That's what I...
*  You can pump and dump, right?
*  Yeah, but you're going to be pumping out nicotine for sure.
*  Okay, but...
*  Is it...
*  Okay, I'm going to try...
*  You're justifying.
*  No, I'm going to try to breastfeed, okay?
*  Oh, you should definitely breastfeed.
*  I know I should, but it's like I've already had nine months of no nicotine.
*  That's the thing that's the hardest for me.
*  Yeah, but once you've kicked it, you should probably try to keep it off.
*  No?
*  No.
*  I think about nicotine every day.
*  Like every day.
*  Were you ever a cigarette smoker?
*  In college, I smoked when I drank and in college, I drank a lot because I was in college.
*  Okay, and so then vaping comes along when?
*  Vaping comes along probably when I was mid-20s, and I did it for eight years.
*  Whoa.
*  And do you start with regular vapes that you buy at the gas station and move your way up
*  to robots?
*  I started with the blue cigs, and then they just weren't hitting hard enough for me anymore.
*  I was ripping multiple blue cigs.
*  And then I loved the Juul.
*  So there's these things in Detroit called Breezes.
*  I don't know if you can get them other places, but I know you can get them in...
*  I'm from the Detroit area.
*  And I was having...
*  I don't know, this is illegal, so I probably shouldn't say this, but my brother may have
*  been sending shipments in to me when they were illegal in New York because the Breezes
*  were the best.
*  Why were they illegal in New York?
*  For a while.
*  Well, they weren't sold in New York, but for a while there was supposed to be...
*  The Juuls, rather.
*  The Juuls were illegal in New York.
*  And then we weren't sure about what was going to be legal in New York.
*  Because do you remember that when they made Juul pods illegal?
*  I don't.
*  I don't think they ever became illegal in California, but they did make them...
*  The mango ones.
*  Because I was...
*  Flavored ones were illegal, which is hilarious.
*  And that was my shit.
*  The mango Juul...
*  When you get a fresh one and it makes that crackling sound.
*  And honestly, if I found a mango Juul pod somewhere in my house, I would have...
*  No, not when I'm pregnant.
*  That's the thing that sucks is I love this baby so much that I've not even met yet.
*  That's wonderful.
*  Nothing...
*  It's a real commitment.
*  I know, but it's so weird for my brand to love this baby.
*  I never thought I'd have kids.
*  I never thought I...
*  I never wanted to.
*  And then now I'm like, my baby's the size of a cucumber.
*  You're doing the right thing by not feeding it Juuls.
*  Of course.
*  I really think so.
*  Of course, but I'm going to go back.
*  But you have to go back in your mind.
*  Yes.
*  Wow.
*  I'm a better...
*  Both my books I wrote on nicotine had nicotine gum in my...
*  I just want to have something in my jaw.
*  What is the side effects that they think can happen to kids?
*  Like premature birth, I think.
*  Oh, boy.
*  Really bad stuff.
*  Really bad ones.
*  And is that from smoking or is that from nicotine itself?
*  I'm really limited.
*  I mean, I can't...
*  It's like you can't really do stimulants when you're pregnant.
*  You can't do anything when you're pregnant.
*  I can have 200 milligrams of caffeine a day.
*  So is being off of caffeine hard or is it being...
*  You can have 200 milligrams of caffeine a day.
*  So is the being off the stimulus, is that the hardest or is that harder than nicotine?
*  See, I don't know because I've always done them together.
*  And so did you have to wean yourself off or did you go cold turkey as soon as you knew
*  that...
*  I had to go cold turkey.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  So what was that like?
*  I was a bitch.
*  For how long?
*  Couple weeks.
*  It was really rough.
*  Wow.
*  Because you have to sort of like...
*  Your equilibrium has to come back.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I had a doctor tell me that I probably couldn't get pregnant without medication, that
*  if I took medication, I would have a 10% chance of getting pregnant naturally, as they say,
*  the sex way.
*  I was just living my life and then I didn't feel good and then I took a test and I was
*  like, here we go.
*  And we wanted kids.
*  We were planning on starting IVF.
*  And so I just quit everything cold turkey at once.
*  Wow.
*  And so was it immediately hard or was it hard right away?
*  First day, you're like, oh my God, where's my speed?
*  I would go to the gym and I'd come back and I'd put a nicotine pouch in.
*  I mean, I really like nicotine a lot.
*  I used to be vaping on airplanes, which is...
*  Oh my God.
*  So illegal.
*  It's so illegal.
*  Did you like do it in your hood?
*  I would bring a blanket with me on the plane and I would sit underneath it like a psycho.
*  Like a psycho.
*  But they're like, what are they going to do?
*  They can't be like, ma'am, you're not allowed to be under a blanket.
*  I mean, I looked like a mentally ill.
*  Like Pete, they're probably watching me.
*  You see little pieces of paper come through the blanket.
*  Because I would also hold it in as long as I could to get the biggest rush.
*  I would hold my breath.
*  I'm telling you, I've never seen anybody as bad on it as I would, which is why I can never
*  try crack because my life would be over in three days.
*  I would love crack.
*  It seems like most people do.
*  Yeah, they do.
*  They do.
*  It seems to be a problem.
*  Anybody's doing a little crack every now and then.
*  I mean, I couldn't handle the nicotine vapes.
*  So crack, probably not.
*  But again, yeah.
*  So when did you move to robots?
*  I moved to robots after the jewel became illegal and I couldn't get the mango.
*  So I was trying to get the same rip.
*  I could get off a jewel.
*  So you were being like a chemist.
*  You were going and mixing oil.
*  I was mixing that.
*  And it was like sticky.
*  And they would explode and be sticky everywhere.
*  It's not just exploding in your mouth.
*  You get that like, like.
*  My friend Adam Curry uses a robot.
*  He's got that robot lunchbox type thing.
*  And he says it's better because he says, first of all, you know what's in there.
*  Right.
*  Because if you're buying them from, they're making them in Vietnam and some sweatshop somewhere.
*  Have you ever seen those factories where they test them all?
*  Yeah, it does.
*  Some guy sucks on every one of them.
*  Yeah.
*  This one poor guy.
*  I would have loved that job.
*  I would leave my life behind.
*  It moved.
*  You mean I can just rip vapes all day?
*  Yeah, but you have to live in Shanghai.
*  I was doing that job for free.
*  This dude is just sucking on these things.
*  I mean, I don't know where they make them.
*  He's an Asian fellow, but he just keeps hitting them.
*  He just has to check every one of them, make sure they blow smoke.
*  She's grabbing them off the assembly line.
*  Put them in these boxes.
*  Yeah.
*  So he's just mainlining nicotine all day long and whatever those oils are.
*  That's the thing.
*  I mainly felt like if I get lung cancer, I will feel stupid.
*  I'll be like, how could I possibly have thought I could get away with doing all this and not
*  have something bad happen?
*  Well, is there better oils than those things?
*  Like when my friend Adam, you know who Adam Curry is?
*  The original pod father.
*  He's the guy who made the very first podcast.
*  I know who he is.
*  Yeah.
*  He's the best.
*  But he actually has those things and he was trying to convince me that those things are
*  okay.
*  The whole thing about vapes being bad was just like the tobacco companies and a bunch
*  of shenanigans.
*  And I was like, hmmm.
*  I'm paraphrasing.
*  I'm not giving you the full story.
*  But his argument was that those robot lunchbox type vapes, those big fat boys, at least you
*  know what's in there.
*  Like, you know where you're getting your oils.
*  Like, you can get different quality and caliber of nicotine oils.
*  Yeah.
*  I was, well, I mean, I believe there's a lot of studies that show it is way better than
*  cigarettes.
*  Yeah, but who's funding those studies?
*  But it's also the way that I've used cigarettes when I've had, like, I can still when I go
*  to Europe, again, not when I'm pregnant, but when I can, I can still go to Europe and smoke
*  cigarettes only in Europe and come back and not smoke cigarettes.
*  And there's immediate downsides to cigarettes.
*  You got to go outside.
*  You smell bad.
*  Da da da da da da.
*  I was smoking the vape, hitting the vape when I was in the hospital after it.
*  I had a near death experience in 2020.
*  Do you know about my, I had a shit bag.
*  No.
*  What happened?
*  I had a, I know you're jacked, but this is, you're not squeamish, right?
*  No.
*  Okay.
*  So I had a bowel perforation.
*  I had a really bad stomach pains.
*  I went to the hospital and they told me I need an ileostomy, which is a shit bag.
*  It's the one, they take your small intestine, they pull it out of your stomach and you have
*  a bag.
*  So I had to have that surgery in November of 2020.
*  And I was in the hospital and I was ripping the vape for sure.
*  Oh my God.
*  I had my intestine hanging out of my body and I'm ripping a vape.
*  I had it for about five weeks and I didn't tell anybody.
*  I wrote about it in my first book and that's how everybody kind of found out that that
*  had happened to me.
*  And it was, it was bad.
*  It was really, really rough.
*  And then I got it reversed.
*  That's good.
*  I got it reversed, but I had complications.
*  Oh, that's not good.
*  So I had complications where I was gushing blood on my ass because there was a loose
*  staple and I needed a transfusion.
*  Guess which day that was that I had that bad thing happen?
*  What day?
*  January 6th.
*  Oh my God.
*  The January 6th.
*  Oh my God.
*  And I didn't talk publicly about this for a long time.
*  So whenever I was on the news, like people would ask me, it comes up a lot.
*  And like I'd be thinking about you.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, you almost died.
*  Bleeding out of your butt.
*  I was literally, I will never forget this.
*  I've never talked about this before, actually this specific thing.
*  I will never forget this.
*  On January 6th, I'm all doped up, right?
*  If you have stuff like that, they'll let you have a Dilaudid drip.
*  I'm like all doped up.
*  Wee.
*  I tweeted or I posted on Facebook, tweeted whatever, posted something along the lines
*  of this was actually my personal Facebook.
*  It shared too.
*  And it was like, the news is stressful, turning on a Ted Bundy documentary to relax, something
*  like that.
*  And I looked at my personal Facebook and some dude who I knew from doing open mics in Baltimore
*  had commented like, oh, are you stressed out about, you know, basically that like work,
*  that you did this, you know, because I work at Fox that I did January 6th.
*  And I'm sitting there on a bucket in a hospital with blood gushing out of my ass.
*  And this dude that I did open mics with eight years ago is trying to tell me that he's having
*  a bad day.
*  You know, it's like.
*  Well, he's trying to shame you.
*  He's trying to blame you for this insurrection attempt.
*  Right.
*  Which he perceives to be.
*  Right.
*  Which again, I was in the hospital having, you know, I would say I had a worse January
*  6th than a lot of people.
*  I would say so.
*  I would say, right.
*  I was reading that.
*  Ashley Babbitt probably had the worst.
*  The worst.
*  Yes, absolutely.
*  Absolutely.
*  But here's what's fucked.
*  It's exactly what we're talking about with comments.
*  Who is that guy?
*  That's a guy who started out open mics.
*  Yeah.
*  He remembers.
*  And now you're successful.
*  And he's not.
*  Yeah.
*  He's like, yeah, you caused the fucking democracy with your jokes from this bucket.
*  Yeah.
*  Bleeding out of your literally the most humbling problem moment of my life.
*  I am a fragile, fragile human being.
*  Oh, that's hilarious.
*  Right.
*  There's some crazy lady next to me too.
*  She was some lady, she was like 90 years old.
*  And you know, she thought that they want to give her potassium supplements.
*  So she was talking out loud about how they're trying to poison her with something.
*  I had her comment because we were all watching the January 6th.
*  It was on in the hospital.
*  We were all kind of watching it together.
*  And she was like, well, everybody loved Trump at first and now they don't.
*  And she was like, everybody, those are all Russians at the Capitol.
*  And I was like, and I'm sitting there on my bucket, like a foot away from this woman.
*  And I'm like, I'm like, she's talking to me.
*  Asking her questions.
*  I was.
*  I would have given up on any idea of a real conversation.
*  This is not a real conversation.
*  You're not talking with this woman.
*  No.
*  You can't get frustrated.
*  Those aren't Russians.
*  They're probably feds.
*  You don't even know.
*  Like, hey, lady.
*  I just remember being like, totally.
*  You got to ask her questions.
*  What have you read that brought you to those conclusions?
*  I don't think she knew what she'd read.
*  But she was speaking very matter of factly.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  People love to do that.
*  Yeah.
*  But also probably they're given a potassium supplements probably because their fucking
*  brain is shutting down.
*  She was really old.
*  Yeah.
*  And probably not doing so well, like health-wise.
*  They're given her potassium supplements.
*  That's what they're trying to say.
*  Hey, your electrolyte balance is off.
*  Nothing's firing correctly.
*  You got real problems.
*  Probably cramping up.
*  Yeah, the hospital was a bad.
*  I mean, it's always a bad.
*  It's like a bad hang.
*  It's horrible.
*  But if you can talk to someone really dumb who's like really into something politically,
*  you can get kind of insight.
*  Well, when I was in the hospital for my first surgery, there was this lady who was like
*  she was farting really loud and she was singing.
*  She was like giving glory to God for her farts that she was.
*  Oh, boy.
*  So I was turning up my forensic files as loud as I could, just like cranking it up.
*  And she asked me if I could turn it down.
*  And I already had this is the day of my first.
*  I already been having like the worst day of my life.
*  So I was like, how the fuck could you ask me to?
*  But then we wound up talking all night.
*  Like, and I have her number on my phone still, because because when you're in a hospital
*  and I was by myself because this was during covid and in New York, my husband was allowed.
*  He could come visit for I could have two visitors a day, maximum two people for maximum two
*  hours and not past six p.m.
*  So I was scared.
*  I had this near death experience and then complications on the reversal.
*  I was alone the entire time.
*  And you need it.
*  I mean, and again, I'm I'm lucky because I lived through it.
*  Right.
*  There's people who died, obviously.
*  It was just so horrible and scary to do that by myself.
*  And also it's hospitals.
*  You need an advocate because I was so doped up.
*  They weren't like my sheets weren't being washed as much as they should have been.
*  I couldn't do, you know, it's just like, you need someone.
*  Hey, she's hey.
*  Yeah.
*  Hospital workers like everybody else, some of them are really good and some of them suck.
*  And also, it's just it's weird to be alone like that.
*  Like, there's no reason why you should have had to have been alone.
*  No.
*  If it's OK for someone to sit with you, that should be fine.
*  Why couldn't he stay?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I've had family members in the hospital before.
*  You just sit next to them and read a book and they feel comfortable.
*  Someone that they love is there.
*  Yeah.
*  Makes them feel better.
*  I had my insides hanging out of my body.
*  You should have somebody with you.
*  I should be able to.
*  Two hours is nuts.
*  Like, no.
*  But again, you're already letting him in.
*  Right.
*  I had to get worse in the night that he can't stay past 6 p.m.
*  because also he had work and he still obviously he came to see me every day.
*  But he couldn't come for very long and he had to leave.
*  And I was there by myself and it was so scary.
*  And there was there was no benefit to it.
*  It was just because of covid.
*  Oh, that's why.
*  Oh, that was the dumbest.
*  But that doesn't make sense because if he had covid, it'd already be in there.
*  Two fucking hours.
*  From the two hours he was in there.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So stupid.
*  They told me I will never forget that when I when I woke up from the first surgery,
*  they came in and they told me that they had good news and that I tested negative for covid.
*  I was like, I don't fucking care.
*  My it's small intestine is hanging out of my stomach.
*  I didn't even test for it anymore.
*  No, they don't.
*  Yeah. My daughter had a pretty like a pretty loud cold or cough.
*  And they brought it to the house.
*  I was telling my wife, she probably got the vid.
*  Yeah, I got the vid.
*  It's going around.
*  Yeah.
*  And she goes, no, she's got a nasal infection.
*  And I said, did they test for covid?
*  She's like, no, no.
*  I'm like, they didn't even test your car.
*  Like if this was two years ago, they would 100 percent immediately test you for covid.
*  But they're still talking about covid.
*  I don't even test kids for it.
*  I tested myself.
*  I had it in July and I tested myself only because I'm pregnant.
*  And I wanted to know, like, what to expect.
*  And I got really sick because my immune system is trash again because of this baby.
*  No nicotine.
*  Can't fight off illnesses.
*  Are you doing anything to supplement your vitamins?
*  I'm doing just prenatals, probiotics.
*  That's it.
*  Prenatal.
*  Yeah.
*  A company sells prenatal vitamins.
*  That's it.
*  Yeah.
*  Mm hmm.
*  I mean, I eat food now a lot more than I used to.
*  Mm hmm.
*  I didn't I used to be chewing nicotine gum all day.
*  It doesn't make you hungry.
*  There's supposed to be some real benefits to nutritional supplementation or your baby
*  is being born inside of you, like like or being created inside of you, like maybe possibly
*  going to a place to get your blood work drawn, finding like what nutrients you're
*  deficient in and it could really help you.
*  I should.
*  I should do stuff like that.
*  We're going to help you.
*  You know, I mean, it's all just simple, basic, natural stuff like vitamin C and vitamin D
*  and vitamin K2 and all that stuff.
*  But your body really extra needs that.
*  You're making a little human.
*  I know.
*  And it's the weirdest thing.
*  I can only imagine.
*  I mean, I again, I didn't used to be someone who ate.
*  I eat all day now.
*  You know, I didn't used to.
*  I mean, I eat food at night like I used to not eat all day.
*  You were on speed.
*  Of course.
*  Yeah.
*  But I was also nicotine gum.
*  Oh, like I always nicotine gum.
*  You know, my friends have quit cigarettes.
*  That's the first thing they say.
*  They get fat.
*  Yeah.
*  They immediately start gaining weight because nicotine is really essentially kind of a speed, too.
*  It's a little bit of a stimulant.
*  I was so much an appetite suppressant.
*  So I was. Yes.
*  And I was but I was honestly so used to this.
*  The amphetamines.
*  So I was on Vyvanse, which is slow release.
*  Adderall I don't like.
*  I was on Adderall briefly and it was too much for me.
*  I was jittery.
*  I was anxious.
*  I was no, I won't do Adderall.
*  OK.
*  And the Vyvanse is slow release.
*  It doesn't make me feel.
*  So when I first went off of it, I yes, I ate like I gained like 10 pounds in six weeks.
*  Right.
*  But now I feel like I'm just as hungry as I was when I was on Adderall without the nicotine.
*  So I because I got so used to it.
*  So I wasn't ever really getting this like,
*  whoosh.
*  With Adderall I did get from that.
*  From how's that go?
*  Whoosh.
*  Like like your skull.
*  Like and I didn't like that.
*  I didn't like it.
*  How long did you do it for?
*  So I did it because my insurance didn't cover Vyvanse back when I lived in D.C.
*  So I was like, I need something.
*  Right.
*  Did you get street Adderall?
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*  I'm not. No, I'm not doing that.
*  Certainly not.
*  Only doctors.
*  I only move my drug dealers are all actual doctors.
*  So I was like, OK, I'll do Adderall.
*  How much different can it be?
*  And it was like bad.
*  And if I ever forgot to take it, I was like I was like walking in a wall.
*  Like I couldn't like I was like sleeping.
*  I couldn't do it.
*  I couldn't do it.
*  So then I just like found coupons somewhere.
*  My doctor helped me up.
*  I was like, I will sacrifice in other areas to afford the Vyvanse because I don't know
*  how people take this.
*  Like I couldn't do.
*  You took it for how many months?
*  A couple of months.
*  Probably. Yeah.
*  And what doses were they giving you?
*  Probably 30.
*  Is that a lot, Jamie?
*  That's what you're saying was a lot.
*  The other day, it was 20.
*  So that's like someone was talking about 20.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  I've taken I've taken metadata.
*  I've taken again. I was I was I'm one of those when they say, like,
*  study of the kids were put on Ritalin when they were by that.
*  You're looking at one.
*  This is me.
*  That's I mean, I was on and it's you know, it is harder.
*  It is really a lot harder for me to live and do basic shit.
*  But it's been interesting.
*  That's Henry Rollins story, too.
*  Yeah. They put him on Ritalin when he was five years old.
*  So, well, he said like he'd be just fucking
*  I was at school just grit in his teeth.
*  Yeah. All this energy just buzzed up on speed.
*  See, I never feel like that.
*  Is that the Adderall?
*  That's I can't that I that's not for me.
*  Adderall is not for me. I won't do Adderall.
*  Well, I know a lot of people that really love it.
*  And they're all kind of out of control.
*  So it was just a little bit off the rails.
*  Oh, if I take Adderall, I thought I forgot.
*  I remember I forgot my Vyvanse one time and I took someone's Adderall.
*  Like this was a few years ago.
*  And immediately I'm texting everyone on my phone like, am I going to be OK?
*  Tell me I'm OK. Like, are you mad?
*  That's not like I'm exhausting enough to be around as a person.
*  Just naturally, I don't need I don't need Adderall adding to the problem.
*  You know, I felt like the world's collapsing around me.
*  That's not a good feeling.
*  It's just not so many doctors prescribe that stuff. Mm hmm.
*  And how many people are on it?
*  What was it?
*  Thirty nine million is that what it was?
*  Prescriptions last year.
*  Something kooky like that.
*  It's probably more than that, because I think that was actually 2021.
*  Now that I think about it.
*  So it's probably way more than that now.
*  Yeah, I mean, I was one of the first and I think I will.
*  I think I will go back.
*  But then I'm like, maybe I should try just nicotine.
*  But a doctor probably wouldn't recommend that.
*  But what do they know?
*  Yeah, most doctors are not going to recommend nicotine ever. Right.
*  I'm a better person because of nicotine.
*  And I know that's not like popular.
*  Like, don't like that's not for the kids.
*  They're listening.
*  That's probably but I don't know.
*  I mean, you know, writing, whenever I'm writing, sometimes I'll be like,
*  I I'm so I'm so like I need to get a sentence perfect when I'm writing.
*  And I'll spend hours sometimes on a single sentence.
*  If I think it's really important sentence and I'll be like, I don't know.
*  I don't know. And then I'll put a put a Zen in or put nicotine.
*  And then I will get it.
*  Have you ever tried other nootropics?
*  Yeah. I mean, I'm just nicotine.
*  I mean, yes. But but if you ever try to add the things like
*  you heard neuro gum, you know what neuro?
*  No, not that.
*  We have some over here in that blue bag right there.
*  Neuro gum is I don't have anything to do with this company, by the way.
*  It just something.
*  OK, neuro gum is gum that has theanine in it and caffeine.
*  And it enhances brain function.
*  Yeah, I've tried theanine before.
*  And then there's some other stuff that you can get.
*  We saw something at on it called Alpha Brain.
*  And there's Alpha Brain, then Alpha Brain Black Label,
*  which is like the more potent for version.
*  That stuff's very legit.
*  Really helps memory really helps. Yeah.
*  So we did they back in the day when we first put it out,
*  a lot of people are like this is fucking snake oil.
*  So, OK, let's find out because there's studies, but there's no there's no real
*  like let's find out. Let's get something definitive.
*  So we did two double blind placebo controlled studies
*  at the Boston Center for Memory where they found increase in
*  increase in verbal memory.
*  So your ability to recall words, increase in reaction time,
*  increase in alpha flow state.
*  So there was a bunch of like recognizable
*  benefits at a dose that was lower than what I was taking.
*  OK, half what I was taking.
*  Yeah, like we were I think the dose was two pills and I do four.
*  And a lot of times I'm getting crazy.
*  I do six.
*  You know, if I have a UFC, UFC's require six.
*  Yeah, it's six hours.
*  I'm sitting down there for six hours.
*  I bring snacks and I drink monsters
*  and I have alpha brain.
*  Yeah. And I fucking lock it in.
*  I am excited to start
*  to own my body again and be able to take
*  whatever I want to do and stuff.
*  But you should try some other stuff that doesn't you know,
*  like there's some other stuff that will give you benefits,
*  but doesn't give you that weird feeling, you know, that accelerated.
*  I don't like that because I'm anxious enough as it is.
*  I'm actually a very anxious person.
*  I have a friend whose daughter was on ADHD medication
*  and she's getting off of it and he started giving her alpha brain.
*  OK, he said it helped her tremendously.
*  I actually never thought I could go off of it.
*  Like I actually that was one of my concerns in terms of actually getting pregnant
*  for the rest of your life.
*  I like that. When I went off of it, I mean, I was like, what do I do?
*  I'm in it now, baby.
*  You seem totally fine, coherent.
*  You're you're talking very quickly.
*  You're not exhausted.
*  No, no, I'm not exhausted.
*  This is you. Yeah.
*  This is actually you. Right.
*  You want to go back to speed you. I do.
*  That's kind of crazy.
*  I could walk out of here no matter what.
*  We'd be like, I'd have been so much better if I would have been.
*  So crazy. I would be like, if I would have been.
*  Maybe we wouldn't connect as well.
*  I don't know, because it's I'm it's so weird because I feel like I'm getting
*  to meet myself, but also it's not really myself because of the pregnancy,
*  because it's this pregnant me. Right.
*  But then I kind of am curious to stay off of it a little longer
*  when I'm not pregnant, just to see.
*  I think you should. Yeah.
*  You seem like a wonderful person off of it.
*  So you're my primary care physician.
*  I'm your doctor. You seem like a wonderful person off of it.
*  I don't think you need it.
*  I think everybody would like to be a little bit more productive,
*  especially if you're a creative type, a writer, if you're doing things.
*  You'd like to be a little bit more productive.
*  But there's no biological free lunch.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's probably going to be some sort of long term damage
*  to a lifetime of stimulating your system.
*  Oh, there's going to be.
*  I know a lot of people that did a lot of coke in the 1970s,
*  and they're all fucked up.
*  A lot of them died with neurological conditions.
*  Oh, yeah. Coke is that is not I got.
*  I have no interest in cocaine.
*  I just wonder it's a difference between doing coke, you know, five nights a week
*  for a few hours a night versus a pill that you're taking every fucking day.
*  That jacks your system up.
*  Who knows if you're going to blow a fuse over time?
*  Like, who knows?
*  Oh, I've definitely considered that.
*  I've definitely considered that for me.
*  It was just that there was I had I didn't function off of it.
*  So I didn't try.
*  Now, what about have you ever tried new vigil or provisional?
*  I was on provisional briefly, but I was I forget why I went on provisional
*  instead of everything else.
*  But it was oh, I was diagnosed briefly.
*  I've never talked about this with narcolepsy.
*  But I don't think I really have it.
*  Did you fall asleep?
*  I fell asleep a lot in the sleep study, but this was also in college.
*  And I smoked a lot of weed in college.
*  So I really think I might have just been like had a stone over from the way.
*  God, that's hilarious.
*  And I can't. And they said, you got narcolepsy, take some pills.
*  I've never I've never talked about this.
*  And I've actually kind of just remembered it.
*  But yeah, and I couldn't stay awake for the sleep study.
*  So they were like, she's got narcolepsy.
*  No one was ever like, hey, are you taking bong reps?
*  Why is that sleepy cat?
*  Oh, my God, I think that must have been why looking back.
*  The fact that I was taking that many bong reps.
*  And again, I got I was I graduated the top of my class.
*  I was very studious work.
*  I just I college smoked smoked a lot of weed.
*  Yeah, you're probably sleepy.
*  And I was sleeping.
*  I might have I might have smoked like the afternoon before or like day.
*  How crazy is that?
*  All the requirement they have to give you a drug like she looks pretty sleepy.
*  You look pretty sleepy. You must have narcolepsy.
*  Not you're tired. Not are you staying up all night?
*  Not a lot going on at your house.
*  Are you not getting any sleep?
*  Now you know you have narcolepsy here.
*  I would have told them the truth.
*  They never nobody ever asked me.
*  They didn't ask because they don't give a fuck.
*  They just want to give you a pill.
*  They want to give you a pill.
*  I get that the more they prescribe, the more money they make.
*  Let's go. And they're like, you need Pro Vigil.
*  Yeah. OK. And then I took it and then I I stopped taking it.
*  And I went back to, I think, Medidate, which is another stimulant.
*  Wow. Pro Vigil doesn't seem like a stimulant.
*  Does it? Does it seem like for you?
*  No, it wasn't.
*  And then there's new vigil, new vigil, another version of it.
*  I don't know what the difference is, but they both seem to work the same way.
*  I used to take it if I had a drive, like if I was in San Diego
*  and I did a gig and I'm like, it's 11 o'clock shows over.
*  I could be home in my bed at two in the morning. Yeah.
*  Latest, you know, it's not really three hour drive unless there's traffic. Right.
*  But you know how it is if you're driving in the road and it's late at night.
*  I don't drive. OK. Anymore. I miss it.
*  When I would be on the road and I was because of narcolepsy.
*  No, it's because I haven't in 10 years.
*  So I'm not sure I remember how which is like my husband is like, you need to learn.
*  Like, you know what I make this poor man do?
*  Or I have made him do the past five years.
*  So I have a cat that is he's now 14 years old.
*  He is a dick.
*  He's got a lot of health issues, but I won't let him die.
*  Like, I won't let him die.
*  He's like my best friend, blah, blah, blah.
*  But we can't find anyone to watch him.
*  We can't find we can't board him at the vet over Christmas.
*  So since I met my husband going on six years now,
*  I've made him drive me and the cat home to my father's house.
*  Where's your father's house?
*  Detroit area. Oh, my God.
*  That's like 18 hours with the cat.
*  How far is it in the car? 12 hours.
*  Oh, my God.
*  So it's like you try all that time.
*  And when you get there and then when you get there, you're in Detroit.
*  Oh, my God.
*  So a lot of people are like, he's the lucky guy, which and it's like, no, he's not.
*  He's he's he's a saint.
*  It all works out.
*  You know, but I'm sure he's happy.
*  He is happy. He said it's fine.
*  He said it's not that big a deal.
*  You're in a car for 18 hours.
*  Just get Zen about for a cat.
*  That's not even a nice cat.
*  Like he bites.
*  That's a problem. He needs daily medication.
*  You like hire a friend to stay at your place.
*  This that this.
*  Sorry, you did just make a very reasonable suggestion.
*  For a normal, you know, somebody like needs money for a normal cat.
*  But this cat will like he is feral.
*  So was he an actual feral cat?
*  Yeah. So I was I was dating my college boyfriend living out in L.A.
*  And I was like, I moved in with him nonconsensually.
*  That's a whole other story.
*  I got into Columbia.
*  I couldn't afford it.
*  So I decided to stay in L.A.
*  and keep interning, waiting tables, doing comedy.
*  And we were fighting a lot because we shouldn't have been together.
*  So he got me a great friend of mine now, actually.
*  But he brought me this cat as like a bandaid on the relationship
*  that he just found in North Hollywood, basically.
*  That was like dying and sick.
*  And I've this has been like my.
*  Feral cats are weird.
*  They never really get unferal.
*  No, for dogs, feral dogs can eventually become dogs again.
*  I've seen it happen.
*  They usually have like a fear of people, but they eventually calm down
*  like people that have gotten like stray dogs.
*  I had a stray dog off the street.
*  Yeah. And I had a stray cat and that stray cat.
*  I was the only one that could pick that motherfucker up.
*  Yeah, I was the only one who could pet him.
*  Everybody else would he would come.
*  You come near him, he hiss at you and swing at you and run away.
*  Yeah. So you need profite.
*  I went when my husband, I went on a honeymoon.
*  We had a we hired a vet to stay at the house.
*  And my sister, I had her stay there, too, because he likes my sister.
*  But he likes he finally likes my husband now.
*  And it took what, like five years?
*  But like he's like, I'm driving.
*  He's like, every year is like I'm driving because every year I'm like,
*  this will be the last year.
*  Probably. Yeah, because that's lived like 18 years old.
*  But this cat has had serious health problems for four years,
*  requiring multiple daily medications that I have to administer.
*  Because not just anybody can come stay with the cat
*  because they have to administer the medication,
*  which is a hazardous activity for the average person.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  Because you have to do the syringe in the mouth. Oh, fuck.
*  So I hold him. He'll let me do it.
*  Oh, my God. But other people are so crazy.
*  I won't. I said I won't.
*  Like, I won't. Why don't you just let him go?
*  He's probably miserable because he's stable on the medication.
*  He's happy to see me when I'm like he misses me.
*  So like he's OK. He's got it. I get it.
*  Now, talk to me.
*  The thing is, if I'm being honest with myself,
*  even if that weren't the answer, I might still have a hard time.
*  Yeah, it's hard. Yeah.
*  Losing a pet is very hard.
*  You're so connected to them. Yeah. Your baby forever.
*  Well, I went through Marshall seven. Yeah. He's my baby. Yeah.
*  He's a baby boy. Yeah. He'll always be a baby boy.
*  When I mean this, I was when I got this cat,
*  I was a cashier at Boston Market.
*  My life has changed.
*  Yeah. This cat's been with you the whole ride for everything, for everything.
*  Yeah. So I get it. I get it.
*  And he sucks. Like I objectively like nobody's like he's here.
*  You know, have you seen that chimp crazy thing on Netflix? No.
*  OK, it's about that lady that like kept a chimp and the chimp
*  ripped apart a friend.
*  You know, you know that story. No, I've heard it's by the same people
*  that did Tiger King. Right.
*  I've heard it's fucking insane.
*  They said it's way better than Tiger King.
*  They say, OK, I should watch this.
*  I was really into like Jane Goodall as a child.
*  I love Jane Goodall.
*  Jane Goodall is odd, though.
*  You know, Jane Goodall, she believes in Bigfoot.
*  She was I thought it was so cool when I was little how she was like,
*  you know what? I don't want to be part of your society.
*  I want to go live among the chimpanzees.
*  I was like, you can do that.
*  Yeah, crazy.
*  This lady is lady like this.
*  It's apparently we can't really can we play the trailer or get in trouble?
*  OK, so that is the the chimp that.
*  Well, there was the thing about chimps is when they're little,
*  you can kind of tell them what to do because they're little, they're babies.
*  They listen to you.
*  But then when they get to be a certain age, that's a grown adult.
*  Right. Alpha primate. Yeah.
*  They're not listening to you. They'll rip your fucking nose.
*  Yeah. I don't care.
*  And they also have like this very strong sense of fairness.
*  OK, like one of the chimps.
*  There's one this guy that had a pet chimp they had for many, many years.
*  And he got older and it was too difficult to control.
*  And so they brought it to a chimp sanctuary.
*  And so he goes to visit the chimp on the day of the chimps birthday
*  and brought him a cake like they could still visit the chimp.
*  OK, they bring me cake.
*  But the other chimps are jealous that they don't get a cake.
*  And someone had left the door open.
*  So the chimps come out, attack this guy, rip him to pieces,
*  rip his hands off, rip his dick off, rip his face.
*  They ripped his dick off.
*  They go for everything that you that makes you a person.
*  They tear your fingers off.
*  They tear your eyeballs out.
*  They're not even trying to kill you.
*  They're trying to maim you.
*  Yeah, they do.
*  They do some vicious, like that's a crime of passion.
*  That's not. Yeah.
*  And they do it because they are mad at you.
*  It's a different thing than like like a, you know, a wolf.
*  Yeah. Wolf's not necessarily mad at you.
*  Wants to eat you. Right.
*  A chimpanzee wants to tear you apart because it's mad.
*  Because it didn't you didn't bring them a cake.
*  You didn't get a fucking why.
*  Yeah. So you're dealing with like a low level intelligence
*  jealousy, pettiness, like like sense of fairness.
*  And then all this like alpha primate shit that comes with chimpanzees in general.
*  And then you got them captive.
*  So they're basically prisoners.
*  So they're in this cage.
*  They have nothing fun all day.
*  And someone shows up with a cake like, where's my fucking cake?
*  Yeah. Where's my fucking cake?
*  And then they just get out and tear this guy apart.
*  Yeah. Oh, I mean, horrible.
*  I feel like a lot of that was hidden from me as a child.
*  Although when I gave a presentation on Jane Goodall in school,
*  there was like a box set of two VHS tapes and one was like the happy part.
*  And then like VHS, too, was like, I don't remember.
*  I don't remember what was in it.
*  But it was like something graphic and bad that happened to the chance.
*  Or to the chips, like something.
*  I don't remember what it was.
*  I don't remember. It might have been diseases.
*  I don't remember what it was.
*  All I remember is that the school called my mom because I brought him the wrong one.
*  Oh, wow. And it was like I.
*  So called your mom.
*  Yeah. Brought in something that you didn't produce.
*  That was about chimpanzees.
*  But I like shared it. And it was like a disturbing.
*  I don't remember what it exactly was.
*  They're going to learn.
*  Yeah. God forbid the kids learn something that disturbs them.
*  I was in trouble all the time.
*  But how nutty is that thought? Yeah.
*  It's a real true thing.
*  Don't you teach about the Holocaust?
*  Like, what the fuck is wrong with you?
*  Don't you teach about Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima?
*  Yeah. Terrible things have happened.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  Are you going to not teach about them because they're disturbing?
*  I agree. I agree. So ridiculous.
*  I was also, you know, teachers had it.
*  I was always in trouble. So it was like, oh, good.
*  There's a there's a yearbook where there's a picture of the principal
*  and the yearbook and I'm in the picture because I'm there.
*  Because I'm always in trouble.
*  Yeah. But isn't it interesting that you now being becoming a successful person
*  and doing stand up, you would see someone like that and go, oh,
*  you're just in the wrong job.
*  Yeah. Someone's trying to put you at a job at an office somewhere.
*  And that's really not for you.
*  I could never work in a normal office.
*  I never have.
*  I've worked as a waitress and I was a bad one.
*  But sure. And then I saw a lot of people out there that say
*  I could never be a standup comedian. Right. Yeah.
*  And I started doing stand up because I needed to do stand up.
*  I mean, back when I was in L.A. and I was my life was just going to shit.
*  I the boyfriend who got me the cat and we broke up with me and shocking.
*  And then I moved into this shitty apartment and shitty neighborhood.
*  And I was still waiting tables doing comedy.
*  And then I lost.
*  I didn't have that enough money for that apartment.
*  So I had to move in with this bartender.
*  I was sort of sort of kind of seeing from my California
*  pizza kitchen job and not like really.
*  I was like, just because I need to live here, doesn't mean we're together.
*  Together was a mess.
*  I had no car. I was like riding the bus.
*  I got scabies from the bus.
*  Like it was it was a bad it was a dark time. Right.
*  And but I would get on stage and I would talk about it. Right.
*  And that made me feel some sense of power over the things that were making me
*  feel powerless. And I was like, oh, I really like this.
*  I could make fun of this shit and people would be laughing.
*  You know, I would talk about about how broke I was.
*  And people would be laughing and I'd be like, oh, I'm created something out of
*  something that I felt it was going to destroy me.
*  Yes. And it's a classic story.
*  Like every movie, like that's the marvelous Mrs.
*  Maisel story. That's the Lenny Bruce story.
*  The classic story. Yeah.
*  People going on stage and going, what the fuck is wrong with my life?
*  You know, like, hey, I think I'm on to something.
*  Yeah, it really. Yeah. It really was a mess.
*  And but then I kept being gravitated toward that.
*  I mean, even the shitbag thing.
*  I mean, so Jim Norton, who I love dearly.
*  As do I. Yeah. Yeah. He's got he's great.
*  He's the best. He's the best.
*  I did his radio show after the first book came out talking about my shitbag.
*  And he was like, you know, cat, he's like, the human being.
*  I'm really sorry that happened to you. But as a comedian, I'm jealous.
*  And I do have a lot of material from that, you know, because a lot of people
*  doesn't happen to. I'm sure.
*  But sure. And it's so I think it's so much better to have that.
*  People say it's like, oh, it's not.
*  It's so much better to have that than to like, let your trauma define you
*  and try to like lord it over other people.
*  Like, you can't say this thing because this thing happened to me. Right.
*  No, that's not. But you can do that.
*  So you just don't have that same psychological makeup, which is my original point,
*  is that there's a lot of people out there that shouldn't be doing regular jobs.
*  And just give them Ritalin. I don't think it's the answer.
*  Like if you're saying that you can go outside, you can play with bugs
*  and lizards and shit and you're fascinated.
*  Love that. That's what normal people are supposed to be doing.
*  It's so abnormal to be sitting in a room with artificial light
*  at a desk where you're not supposed to move talking about shit.
*  That's not interesting to you.
*  That's normal for a kid to rebel against something like that.
*  I was a hellion, though.
*  I mean, I got like I didn't want to do math and I started chanting like no more math.
*  I got on the table.
*  Like I got in trouble for inciting a riot, is what they said.
*  And my dad was like, she's six years old.
*  Like, this is not. But I was like I was a disaster.
*  I mean, fun. I was fucking fun.
*  That's the thing. I was invited to everybody's birthday,
*  but they wanted me there at least. You know what I mean?
*  I'm I'm still I'm still fun. I'm a fun person.
*  It's not a bad thing.
*  But it's just the problem is the environment of schools is terrible for kids.
*  But I have a lot of fucking energy.
*  But I needed school. I was valedictorian in my high school.
*  There were 10 of us.
*  So was everybody who had a four point now.
*  But I needed to do well at school because I knew my parents couldn't afford
*  to send me away to college.
*  So I'm kind of like if I wouldn't have been on these drugs,
*  what I have been able to do well enough at school because I'm not getting a sport
*  scholarship, you know, what I have or maybe I would have just gone straight.
*  I don't know.
*  But I had to study.
*  I had to be good at school in order to have the success that I did.
*  And at least academically.
*  But then after I graduated from college, I got a full scholarship.
*  I obviously couldn't afford grad school.
*  So then. But listen, I'm hearing you talk right now and you're not on stimulants.
*  You're obviously very smart.
*  So why are you saying that you couldn't have gotten a four point
*  oh, unless you're on stimulants?
*  I don't believe it. I don't know.
*  I feel like I might not have gotten.
*  First of all, we don't know.
*  We don't know. Because you've always been on them.
*  But you're not on them.
*  But you're not on them right now. Yeah.
*  And right now you're very sharp.
*  You know, what's funny is there's people in my real life who have known me
*  for decades, who have not had an in-person conversation with me off stimulus.
*  People I've known my whole life who, you know, still.
*  And you're meeting me for the first time.
*  But you're very sharp and you're very fast.
*  You don't seem like you're slowed down at all.
*  Yeah, I was worried that I would be.
*  OK, but maybe that's just in your head. Maybe.
*  And maybe you would have gotten a four point
*  oh, either way, because you're fucking smart.
*  And maybe all that does is give you speed and you're like, you keep going.
*  And maybe you would have been more introspective if you weren't on them.
*  Maybe you would look at things slightly differently.
*  Maybe you'd have a more balanced and nuanced take
*  if you weren't on fucking diesel fuel in elementary school.
*  The fire fire burn inside your head.
*  And I never thought I'd even consider not taking them any day or every day.
*  I never thought I would consider that, especially even at the beginning
*  of my pregnancy.
*  But that was also the first trimester, which I was like exhausted
*  because I was pregnant. Right.
*  I was like, I can't do anything. Right.
*  And I when you went and you were exhausted at first and then you were on speed as well.
*  So I was off speed and pregnant and off nicotine all at the same time.
*  No. But when you found out that you were pregnant,
*  it was because you weren't feeling well. Right.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah.
*  While you were on speed. Yeah. I was still tired.
*  Yeah, exactly. That's true.
*  So that's why I was like, I'm still like, I don't feel good.
*  I think you're just a fast paced person.
*  And I'm not necessarily sure.
*  You know, I'm not a psychiatrist. No, of course not.
*  Don't listen to me. You're not going to.
*  Well, you are my primary care physician.
*  I know you're going to get right back on as soon as you can.
*  At least to write, I probably will.
*  But that's what I'm saying. Like, are you sure?
*  Yeah. So at least to write, I probably will.
*  But I'm actually. But nicotine or speed?
*  I don't know. I mean, I'm saying I'm the fact that I'm even still,
*  I think both because I'll still have days where I really struggle.
*  And I forget things and I lose things.
*  And I'll and I'll have this whole plan with my husband.
*  And then I'm like, oh, this shit, this is the wrong day.
*  Like, I'm just like most people do. That's normal.
*  Not to this extent. I bet it is.
*  It's normal to be a little scatterbrained.
*  I'm more than a little scatterbrained.
*  I know. But you're fine.
*  So like if I was like if I was an ethical doctor.
*  Right. No, that's coffee. This is coffee.
*  OK, cool. If I was in that, that's actually.
*  There we go. Great. Great.
*  If I was an ethical doctor. I can't have coffee.
*  That's too much.
*  200 milligrams a day is all you can have.
*  I had like already an Americano today.
*  Yeah. If I was an ethical doctor and you came into my office
*  and there was no financial incentive for me to prescribe medication to you,
*  I'd say you're fine. What's wrong with you, Kat?
*  You know, many people would like kill or take a medication
*  to be in the state of mind that you're at all the time.
*  Like the way you can talk and how coherent you are and how articulate you are.
*  And fast paced. You're thinking is very quick.
*  You don't need anything. Yeah.
*  This is all in your head. But you can't write bullshit.
*  That's not true.
*  It's just different because you're not high.
*  You're not speed it up.
*  Fucking smash and keys.
*  You still can write.
*  It don't say like you don't need a medication because writing is complicated.
*  Yeah. Right.
*  I'm not saying you shouldn't take it.
*  I'm not saying you shouldn't have the ability to as long as you're not fucking up your baby.
*  You know, after all that breastfeeding stuff done.
*  But the point is, it's like, I don't I think this whole I need it stuff is nonsense.
*  Well, it's I've started to think that I'm at least might not go back to doing it every single day.
*  Because I was doing I was every, every, every day, truly, except if I was in the hospital.
*  Well, wouldn't it be nice to be able to go on a vacation and not have to take speed?
*  Yeah, it sucks to take speed at the beach.
*  It's not it's not fun to be at the pool.
*  I get how it's been good for you.
*  Yeah. It's been good to you.
*  You've enjoyed you've reaped its benefits.
*  But I don't think you need it.
*  I mean, for you to be here right now, sober in the state you're at, you're as sharp as like most people that I talk to.
*  You're on the ball.
*  Yeah. I mean, it's but I'm scared.
*  You know, I'm going to be like, what?
*  I'm in better health. Right.
*  But that's crazy talk.
*  Of course. But it's my whole stay on heroin.
*  That's my whole life. I was at my first communion on amphetamines.
*  Oh, my God. That's so nuts.
*  Like, think about all the childhood, you know, maybe this baby would be an awesome
*  reset for that. Maybe at the end of the nine months, you'll have a completely different perspective.
*  You'll been off of it so long.
*  You realize like, wow, it's actually better.
*  And I think about nicotine every day.
*  I don't think about the medication every day.
*  So I think I'll definitely go back to nicotine.
*  Maybe I'll use it sometimes.
*  Maybe not every day.
*  I'm definitely not.
*  You say next thing you're two fisted.
*  I know.
*  You got the big lunchboxes.
*  Strawberry lemonade.
*  It was great mixing the flavors.
*  And so what is in the oil?
*  What is the best?
*  Like, let's find I should probably call Adam and ask him.
*  But what is the best oil for vapes that's not as bad for you?
*  I don't remember.
*  How would we Google this?
*  I don't remember.
*  How do we Google this?
*  Is there a difference in the harm that certain vape chemicals can do?
*  And is there a healthy version?
*  So there is. And this is I know there's one that's really bad.
*  And that was when kids were getting their lungs exploded or whatever.
*  Well, there's two kids died.
*  Right. So with that, I did research on this.
*  I spoke to somebody who for an article, an article from National Review about this,
*  who said that she would be surprised if that chemical was in the nicotine
*  vapes at all, because it's pretty much only necessary with THC and that it
*  it was only in like black market THC vapes.
*  Basically, that's what I had heard, too.
*  Yeah.
*  And there was two two different people had gotten some really tainted THC
*  vapes and died.
*  Yeah. Which vaping THC in general is just like that's not that's you never.
*  It's so it's so that's my most boomer opinion that I have is the weed's too strong.
*  Like it's so strong when people like, hey, you want to know.
*  I don't know what's in that.
*  The vape is like, who made that?
*  Yeah. Who put that together?
*  Yeah. Who's the chemist?
*  What bathtub does this get fucking cooked up in?
*  Yeah. At least if you're getting the actual cannabis plant, you know what it is.
*  Right. It's strong or it's not strong.
*  You figure that out. You're going to be fine.
*  You're you're vaping on a month.
*  Where the fuck that's coming from?
*  No. A few years ago, I was out with my friend and I hit his weed pen and I couldn't feel my legs.
*  I was like, I mentally felt not high, which is like the opposite.
*  I was going, I mean, I wanted to feel my legs and I wanted to be high.
*  And I'm like, OK, I'm like, I don't know what to do.
*  I'm like, you got I have to leave.
*  Yeah. And I couldn't feel my legs.
*  And then I got back to my apartment and then I felt completely fine.
*  And I'm like, so it's just temporary paralysis.
*  Yeah. And I'm like, I have no idea what was in that.
*  And I'd never, ever, ever hit a vape weed pen ever again.
*  And I don't think I will.
*  You don't want to be the person that winds up in the news.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I thought you were going to say you don't want to be the person that has to go home.
*  Yeah. Also be in the news.
*  Because your legs stop working.
*  You smoke some fucking gas station vape pen.
*  And I have to tell everyone that I smoked a fucking.
*  Oh, like, well, how do you lose your legs?
*  You know, there's people in the amputation unit that's been to war or whatever.
*  I went to Quickie Mart and I got a vape pen.
*  I ripped a bootleg weed vape pen.
*  I was trying to get high.
*  Is there any benefit to the kind of oils that they use in the homemade robot type?
*  Googling it just brings up a bunch of websites that are trying to sell me stuff.
*  But what I gather from those is that they're all saying you want something
*  that doesn't have nicotine in it, which is a little strange.
*  That's not that. That's what we want.
*  Then you want to add pharmaceutical grade nicotine.
*  So that might be where the problem is coming.
*  OK. Making cheap nicotine. Right.
*  It's just something like that.
*  But what is that word? Dicetal, dicetal free.
*  I saw that a few places. Dicetal. I don't know. Dicetal.
*  Am I saying it right?
*  Vegetable glycerin and propylene.
*  OK. Go back up again. Go back up again.
*  Says the safest e-juice ratio is one that has less propylene glycol.
*  If your vaporizer allows it, try to use 100 percent vegetable glycerin e-juice.
*  I don't know if that's true.
*  What is that? These are not from any great sources.
*  I could read that when they're saying vegetable oil.
*  Are we talking about like what kind of vegetables?
*  What's in that? Is that seed oil?
*  That's all. Yeah, it's just everything says PG or VG mix.
*  And that's what that means is the vegetable glycerin. Right.
*  But what is that vegetable glycerin made out of?
*  Is that made out of like canola oil? Like, what is it made out of?
*  I don't know.
*  Because I know someone was making it with MCT oil and they were trying to tell me
*  this is the safe version. Some dude with a robot.
*  And I love it. Listen, I've got MCT oil in my vapes.
*  If I found out that, I mean, I don't think it's totally healthy or I would be doing it.
*  I mean, if I found out I was dying, I'd begin a vape immediately.
*  Here it says VG is generally recognized as safe by the US Food and Drug Administration.
*  But hold on a second. As VG is vegetable based, there's a much lower toxicity than PG.
*  Or so that's propylene glycol or nicotine.
*  So it's safe to use in e-liquids for vaping.
*  Of course, though, like many things, there's a potential for allergic reaction.
*  But what's it made out of? Vegetable glycerin.
*  What is vegetable glycerin made out of? Google that.
*  I just want to know what they're using.
*  Like what plants, what vegetables?
*  Clear odors, sweetening liquid made from the vegetable oil, such as palm, soy or coconut.
*  OK, palm terrible for you, soy terrible for you.
*  Yeah. Coconut not bad.
*  Coconut is good for you.
*  So it's like, depending upon what kind of oil you get, you're spraying the inside of your lungs
*  with some shit that's generally not good for consumption.
*  Like palm oil is supposed to be bad for consumption.
*  Canola oil is bad for consumption.
*  It causes inflammation.
*  Vegetable glycerin is made by heating triglyceride rich vegetable fats under pressure
*  or with a strong alkali such as lye.
*  That's the shit that they used to get rid of bodies.
*  Is that how you liquefy?
*  Yeah, lye is nasty.
*  It's like how people straighten their hair out to process.
*  Yesterday, the castor.
*  Uh huh. And the was a beaver stax or something.
*  Right, right, right. It's a flavoring and cigarettes.
*  I was finding. Oh, my God.
*  I was trying to figure out which cigarettes use it.
*  But Chris Harris was telling us that he drank this alcohol that they didn't tell him what was in it.
*  It was a shot and inside the shot was a essence of beaver.
*  And it turns out it's a secretion from the beaver's anal gland.
*  Ew. And it was in his mouth for 10 days.
*  He couldn't get the taste of it out of his mouth.
*  But why do you drink that?
*  He didn't know what it was.
*  He was on that show Top Gear.
*  OK. And, you know, he's traveling in some other country.
*  Look, this is one of the local things.
*  And he drank this and it stayed in his mouth for 10 days.
*  There was like benefits. I get it.
*  There's no benefits.
*  But if there's a.
*  It's a flavor that they add in liquor.
*  Jesus. If there was.
*  Cinnamon or vanilla hints.
*  But we saw it with the vodka, right?
*  They had beaver castor vodka.
*  So what is MCT oil in vapes?
*  Google MCT oil in vapes.
*  See if that's legit.
*  Because this guy was trying to say, which is essentially like coconut oils and stuff like that.
*  Is the MCT medium.
*  But is he just. Yes.
*  So this thing says it's just it's trying to find any heating triglyceride rich vegetable fats.
*  Right. So any.
*  But see if someone does it, if they're trying to promote it as a healthy alternative to normal vape
*  oils, MCT oil in.
*  In fact, in vapes.
*  The very first thing that came up was from Weedmaps.
*  It says occasionally vaping MCT oil may or may not be harmful to the lungs.
*  That's so helpful.
*  Just just keep it on the vague side, kids.
*  But I feel like also people who say that it's fine.
*  I mean, they're probably really addicted to it, which I get.
*  Because I've been there. I've been there.
*  It's the best. If I know I was dying.
*  Aerosolized and inhaled MCT oil can be harmful to respiratory health.
*  And Michigan's banning them.
*  Michigan's banning them.
*  But OK, when you hear Michigan's banning them, I go, OK, but did another industry
*  tell Michigan that they're bad so they can sell their fucking bullshit oil vapes?
*  Like, there's so much fuckery going on with all this stuff, especially these unregulated things.
*  Yeah. Here it goes.
*  Can cause lipid pneumonia.
*  Oh, boy, that's not good.
*  Oils when heated and inhaled, oils can cause lipid pneumonia, a serious lung condition.
*  Yeah. I knew a family in California and their kid got pneumonia.
*  He was vaping every day and he wound up dying.
*  He was like, really? 19 years old.
*  Yeah. Apparently he was just vaping constantly.
*  Six years ago, it's the current article to show that MCT oil combined with CBD
*  has increased health benefits.
*  But yeah, that's it's even in.
*  That's very tough.
*  It's so hard to know what's true and what's not true.
*  Yes. Just so much fuckery.
*  Yeah, I have no idea. You have no idea.
*  You have no idea. So hard to know.
*  And I actually was a person who trusted in terms of like doctors more in terms of
*  then COVID happened. And it's like, I don't know how you do.
*  I know. I don't know. I was I don't know how you I mean, I know it was years.
*  I'm still not over it.
*  Well, there's just too many doctors that have a financial interest in following
*  whatever the company line is.
*  And with certain things, they're not allowed to prescribe medications
*  because those medications aren't as profitable as the ones that they're
*  promoted to prescribe.
*  I wanted to bring this up.
*  Then she said, since we don't know, I was going to bring it up earlier.
*  We were talking about it.
*  This says that nicotine replacement therapy could be OK during pregnancy.
*  Well, it's safer, but it's safer than smoking.
*  There's no way I'm ripping darts while I'm pregnant.
*  OK, there's I think that's for people who are like going to be ripping.
*  They're like, listen, if rather than smoking cigs, have nicotine gum.
*  That's such a dude thing to say, because dudes can't have kids.
*  Jamie's like, whoa, so he says it's fine.
*  And my husband still he still vapes.
*  So he still vapes.
*  And it's, you know, wow.
*  But I'm like, I'm you know, I can rub that in his face a little bit that I quit.
*  But it's definitely my friend Duncan.
*  Here's a good story. My friend Duncan has diabetes.
*  He has the kind to get it from diet.
*  He's a thin guy.
*  And I found out he was feeling like shit found out he has diabetes.
*  Like, wow, this is fucking crazy.
*  So cut sugar out of his life.
*  All of a sudden, diabetes goes away.
*  Feels incredible.
*  It's like, I can't believe how much energy I had.
*  Oh, my God, I was poisoning myself all day.
*  And then, you know, he has this like glucose monitor thing.
*  And the glucose monitor thing is kind of his glucose is too high.
*  And he's trying to figure out what it is.
*  It's vaping because all those flavored vapes have sugar in them.
*  So every time he's taken a vape off this gas station bullshit,
*  diabetes from vaping, he's probably got diabetes from vaping.
*  Yeah, that's crazy.
*  Sugar as well.
*  But he's vaping all day.
*  So he's pumping the sugar into his system.
*  And so he realized after he cut all the sugar out that he was still
*  his sugar levels would go crazy.
*  And it was because of vaping.
*  So as soon as you stop that, it went all normalized.
*  Well, sugar is crazy. Crazy.
*  I've gotten into sugar a little bit,
*  which sounds insane to say, but I never like now that I'm pregnant.
*  It's like, what dopamine is there available for you?
*  Not that much.
*  So I'll get dessert.
*  But I feel like I got a pumpkin spice frappuccino last weekend.
*  OK, the smallest one available.
*  It's 12 ounces.
*  I drank this thing immediately.
*  I was like, we have to go home. I don't feel good.
*  And I laid on the couch and I slept for three hours.
*  Right. If you're not used to it, that's a coffee. Mm hmm.
*  I know. I was so sick.
*  And I've gotten into it.
*  I was last night. I was like, I was on the phone.
*  Should I get dessert?
*  He's like, well, every time you do and then you're really sick.
*  So maybe have you seen the blizzard
*  when that guy takes the blizzard from Dunkin Donuts
*  and he puts it next to a clear cup to show you how much.
*  No, it's that drink, that frozen coffee drink.
*  Yeah. And that frozen coffee drink has so much sugar.
*  And he puts like the clear cup next to it so you can see how much sugar.
*  It's one hundred and eighty three grams of sugar.
*  Do you think there's a right?
*  There's a lot.
*  Dunkin Donuts wasn't. Yeah, it was.
*  Yeah, Dunkin Donuts blizzard.
*  That's what it is.
*  It's from Dairy Queen. Oh, it's called.
*  It is. It's like the Dunkin Donuts one called.
*  I know some giant.
*  It's like a frozen pumpkin swirl thing.
*  It's videos on the screen.
*  OK, so this is it.
*  So this it says Dunkin Donuts doesn't say what the thing is,
*  but it's some kind of a sugary coffee type.
*  So gross.
*  Sorry, Dairy Queen, for
*  tainting the name of your wonderful blizzard, which I'm sure has no sugar.
*  That guy's showing you all the sugar that's in that thing.
*  That's so insane to take that much sugar in a drink.
*  But people do it all the time.
*  Yeah, that stack of sugar cubes.
*  That is so bananas.
*  That's one hundred and eighty one.
*  So it's thirty four teaspoons or fifty one point five cubes of sugar.
*  Holy Jesus.
*  It's a giant drink that too.
*  Yeah, but it's also got ice in it.
*  Yeah. If you get rid of all that ice, how much of it is all sugar?
*  It's like you're just drinking sugar and ice.
*  And you see people walking around with those.
*  And I'm like, where are you going to the hospital for diabetes?
*  I couldn't be going anywhere after having.
*  So like, are you drinking this?
*  It's afternoon right now.
*  Well, people get used to the sugar and then the sugar doesn't make them
*  crash as much. Yeah, because I don't do that.
*  But if I do, like if I have like a milkshake, I'll be like, oh, yeah.
*  Well, it hits me because I don't eat it all the time. Yeah.
*  But some people eat it all day long and they just their body just gets accustomed
*  to it, just like alcohol. Alcoholics.
*  Yes, it's very similar.
*  Honestly, it's very similar.
*  It's a real addiction. Sugar is a real addiction. Yeah.
*  And it's everywhere. It's in everything.
*  It's in so many different foods that it doesn't need to be in.
*  But it makes more addictive.
*  I know. And I think it's so interesting with all the things I'm advised to do,
*  like being they don't really say like, oh, you shouldn't have a bunch.
*  I'm sure that's bad. I'm sure it's terrible to have a bunch of dessert.
*  You should be eating organic food. Eating healthy food.
*  You should be eating really healthy, essential fatty acids,
*  eating lots of salmon and things along those lines.
*  But yeah, they don't nobody cares about that.
*  Nobody talks to you about sugar.
*  No, they don't. They're like, don't have sushi.
*  Don't have turkey. Don't have.
*  Oh, by the way, that's a problem.
*  Yeah, the cat, the cat you have.
*  I had him tested for toxoplasmosis. He doesn't have it.
*  Oh, that's crazy.
*  I was I was so like, I mean, I thought for sure if he had it, I would have it.
*  Because he sleeps under my chin every night. Oh, yeah.
*  But I actually we also have a very expensive litter box.
*  We have a robot that clean.
*  Oh, what are those? It's called the no, it's called the litter robot.
*  I've seen those. Do you know that it not only self cleans,
*  it sends data to my phone in real time.
*  So every time he uses the litter box, I get an alert on my phone
*  letting me know how much he weighs.
*  Yeah, so I used to have to weigh him myself to monitor
*  because basically if he gets overweight, he gets diabetes.
*  He's going down. He can't.
*  He has cardiomyopathy.
*  He has which is a heart thing.
*  As your husband, I'd be sneaking food.
*  I'd be giving that cat ice cream.
*  I don't know if he's so patient.
*  I'm like, I don't know how he's like, he's like, the cat's not even a nice cat.
*  I'm like, I know.
*  But, you know, he has herpes to the cat.
*  Oh, boy. Which I was really good.
*  It's a it's a respiratory thing in cats.
*  And because the first time he was, I was confused at first, too.
*  I called the vet, called me, told me, and I was like, but he's a virgin.
*  And they were like, OK, it's it's like they pick it up as kittens.
*  And it causes them to get a cold that comes and goes.
*  So we take some medication called Veralis.
*  He takes that one also.
*  How often does he take that every day?
*  Mix into his food is a probiotic mix into his food.
*  If you didn't give it to them, what would happen every now and then?
*  You get a blister?
*  No, it's not. It's much respiratory.
*  He sneezes and coughs. How bad?
*  Enough where it was like on the pillow in the morning, like gross.
*  Oh, gross.
*  I mean, it was just I was like, oh, it's just on the pills.
*  You just herpes.
*  But then he also he takes steroids every day, too.
*  Oh, boy. And who?
*  And a heart medication. Oh, boy.
*  I know. That's a lot.
*  I know it's listen.
*  But I will do I would do I would keep him on.
*  The thing is, if you could do a ventilator like I would, I'm not.
*  Clonum.
*  The thing is, is no, because he sucks.
*  You know what I mean? Like, but would he suck if you had him from a baby?
*  I don't know. Maybe it wouldn't suck.
*  Maybe it wouldn't suck if you had him as a kid.
*  If he didn't have all the trauma. Yeah.
*  I guarantee that's there's a switch that goes in those feral cats
*  that never really shuts off. No, it's weird.
*  It's a weird switch because like it exists in certain animals.
*  Like there's when they go feral, they just never come back.
*  There's just a giant difference between like domesticated,
*  certain domesticated animals and feral cats are the best example
*  because feral cats are so different.
*  Domesticated cats are wonderful.
*  Like, hey, buddy, look, yeah.
*  Yeah, not they sit in your lap.
*  They touch your legs and go up like this up and down with their little claws.
*  Yeah, he'll do that.
*  But then he'll just bite you.
*  He'll be deciding to like this is a feral cat.
*  He used to do that, too.
*  But the difference in between that and an actual cat in the wild is profound.
*  Yeah, no, no one's looking out for them.
*  And that switch has already gone off.
*  They're not being taken care of.
*  But if you took care of them from the time he was a baby, it'd be interesting.
*  Maybe it'd be a good cat. Maybe.
*  I don't know. I would be willing to do that to clone them.
*  Or would you think some pet cemetery shit would go down?
*  Oh, no, not that. I think it'd just be so hard.
*  Because what I love about him is like all this shit we went through.
*  You know, right. He was part of me through everything.
*  And, you know, from, you know, going through all that shit in L.A.
*  and then he lived with me in D.C., which is a horrible place.
*  And then, you know, New York and everything.
*  So he's like symbolic.
*  It's the time in my life.
*  I dedicated my first book to him, him and Joan Rivers.
*  It was him and Joan Rivers.
*  Neither of whom can read this. That's why I dedicated to Joan Rivers.
*  How's my favorite? My favorite conspiracy theory.
*  The real Cooke's believe that they took out Joan Rivers when she said
*  Michelle Obama. Yes, yes. That conspiracy.
*  Yeah. People are like, look at this video.
*  Look at this video. She says this.
*  And then what happens?
*  It's so funny.
*  Those those fucking the really loony conspiracy people.
*  Oh, they're hilarious.
*  They're so there's so much entertainment and that's one of my favorite ones.
*  Oh, that's Joan Rivers.
*  She was 80 years old.
*  Yes. Plastic surgery. I know.
*  For like the 80th time.
*  Like that shit is so bad for you.
*  I know. Getting put under is so bad for you.
*  I know. And when you're 80, it's so dangerous.
*  But it's probably addictive to get all that shit done.
*  I mean, I've not had plastic surgery, but when I get old, I might want to.
*  Like I might want to get like a facelift.
*  Well, I think in the future you won't have to do that.
*  I think they'll have an ability to regenerate skin tissue
*  and make your skin much healthier.
*  There's for sure they're already doing these things
*  where they micro needle your face and cover your face.
*  I've done that. Exosomes.
*  I've done that. Yeah, that I've done.
*  But it has a significant impact.
*  Red light therapy has a significant impact in your skin elasticity and your collagen.
*  But I think in the future, they're going to be able to regenerate tissue.
*  And I think they're pretty close to that.
*  Yeah. I think you're going to need to get your fucking lizard face.
*  I mean, I'll do it, though.
*  I get creeps me out, though, when women get a mouth that's too big.
*  Yeah, I get Joker face because they're their fucking face is being pulled. Yeah.
*  So they have a smile and they always show some gum.
*  I know. I think it's addictive.
*  I think you get like a little bit more and a little bit more.
*  And you don't realize how crazy you start to look.
*  Well, it's for sure body dysmorphia. Yeah.
*  You know, it's the same as people who have anorexia,
*  the same as people who are bodybuilders who think they're tiny.
*  It's all people have a propensity to develop,
*  at least certain people do this kind of disease where you don't see yourself
*  as other people see you. Right.
*  And it can get real weird if you start doing stuff to your face. Yeah.
*  Like we played a video compilation of these these two brothers.
*  I don't know what they do. They're famous for some reason,
*  but super handsome when they're young, like handsome.
*  Yeah. Like model look like model.
*  And as they got older, they started shooting shit in their face.
*  And then they became like, like pinwheel from Saw.
*  The whole thing is like super bizarre.
*  And if you see the madness take place, like over the years, like here.
*  So this is what they look like. Yeah. This is what they look like now.
*  But let me show you what they used to look like when they were young.
*  Look, why do they? Yeah, that's ah, they're just good looking guys.
*  See if you can find a video of the guy over the years,
*  because the video over the years is wild because you get to see his face moving,
*  you know, and you see him and you go, oh, it's like a good looking guy,
*  like good looking normal guy.
*  Yeah. So this is this is them when they're already fucked up. Right.
*  This is them when they're younger.
*  And go back to that real quick. Look at that.
*  They're good looking, good looking, very good looking, very genetic,
*  lottery type shit like model type. Yeah. They're great looking guy.
*  And now look at them. They look insane. Yeah.
*  Instead of just looking like an old like Kevin Costner, just an older, handsome man.
*  You know, it's also like so I like, you know,
*  and I'm very proud of having been on TV for 10 years.
*  I have my original lips. I have my original teeth, which is like a big deal.
*  People get like the big, there's a lot of bad veneers going around,
*  like a lot of really bad. There's probably a lot of good ones though.
*  Of course. I like, so my mom died. It'll be 10 years in November.
*  I like that. I kind of look like her. If I fucked up my face too much,
*  I probably wouldn't look like her anymore. Like I like to look like myself.
*  Yeah, that's a good thing. And, but I, I, I don't know. I mean,
*  people, you always think usually maybe a little bit and people go more and more
*  and more. I mean, maybe when I, I don't like.
*  It's a dangerous road and when actresses do it, it fucks up their career.
*  I think it does.
*  Well it does for like some because they go away because they don't look like the
*  same person. Exactly. Like the girl from dirty dancing.
*  I've never seen dirty dancing. I've never seen any movies.
*  The only movies I've ever seen is I've, I watch happy Gilmore over and over again.
*  You don't see any movies other than happy Gilmore. So I've seen Billy Madison.
*  How much Adderall will you do when you watch it? Happy Gilmore?
*  No, I've seen, I just movies are long. Okay. So I don't, I mean,
*  but I, I've seen. So she got her nose fixed. This is like her older,
*  but when she was younger,
*  she had this very prominent nose and then she got it fixed and like she was
*  unrecognizable. It's cool to look different from everybody else in some way.
*  Yeah. But the problem is when everybody knows you as the person who looks like
*  that, like Barbra Streisand, if Barbra Streisand got a nose job, it would be crazy.
*  Like what are you doing? You're not Barbra Streisand anymore. We love the old you.
*  That's what we like. We don't want you doing that. That's nuts.
*  You're changing the shape of your nose and it's really obvious. Yeah. Yeah.
*  That's I, I do recognize her, but it's crazy when dudes do it.
*  Like politician dudes and also they got that frozen.
*  The eyebrows are up and his forehead's that movie. Like, hey bro,
*  real housewives. Yeah. Like, Hey bro. Yeah.
*  You just looked different three weeks ago. You can't do that. Yeah.
*  You should do that. Yeah. I don't know. Who, who,
*  why are you scared of a brow movement when you're a man?
*  Especially as a man. That's,
*  I don't get why men do it at all because men are allowed to get old.
*  Men are allowed, you know, with women it's, it makes a little more sense. Men.
*  It's like, if you are 80, you can have a girlfriend who's 30.
*  It happens all the time. Right. But women, not so much.
*  People like, yeah, yeah. Yeah. It's like,
*  when you see Rupert Murdoch with whatever his latest wife is,
*  everybody does it. Everybody does. Everybody who's older.
*  It's, it's very common. You don't even have to be that rich.
*  There's a lot of those old rich guys though that have like bomber wise.
*  Of course. Yeah. It's crazy. It's crazy to watch.
*  That's why I say my husband's only two years older than me.
*  So that's actually, I think I'm technically like 10 years older. Right.
*  If you take society into account, he's actually like, I'm a cougar. Right. Yeah.
*  For going for a guy that's only two years older than me. Crazy. I know.
*  It's like the, in general, especially like with old rich guys,
*  like none of them are married by their age. No, I told him, I'm like, babe,
*  I'm like, you're in finance. Your wife's not even born yet.
*  But he said to me, he said that he usually gets bored in relationships,
*  but with me, he prays for it. He's like, I'm never bored. He's like,
*  nice change. He's like, I wake up every day. I never know who I'm going to get.
*  Oh, that's hilarious. Are you more or less stable off the amphetamines?
*  I less less stable, but I'm also pregnant.
*  So I'll be doing s***. I don't know if it's a, for example,
*  he'll say something to me, but I'm very self-aware, which is good.
*  I think I'm very, I think so. I think so.
*  I've had a lot of therapy, which I think is helpful. Like when I've needed it,
*  I don't know, I don't go all the time, but I'll be,
*  he asked me recently if I could pick some things up around like,
*  this is your stuff. I was like, I'll just leave. If you want me to just leave.
*  And I'm like, Oh my God, sorry. That was, that was a bit of an overreaction.
*  But I don't know if that's because I'm not medicated or because I'm pregnant.
*  It's probably a little bit of both. I mean,
*  certainly there's something going on inside your body that's significant.
*  And then on top of that, you're off speed.
*  That's why it'd be interesting for you to wait a little while.
*  I think I'm going to, which I never thought I would.
*  You probably should. You might like yourself more after nine months.
*  Yeah. Cause right now you're still in the hell of it.
*  It is. How many months it's been since you stopped?
*  So whenever I found out I was pregnant at the end of May.
*  Okay. So just a couple of months. Yeah. Yeah. June, July. Oh,
*  and we're in September now. Okay. So three months. Yeah.
*  So this is like a new thing. You know, your body's probably still equalizing,
*  you know, normalizing, getting down to the regular levels.
*  And it's weird when I see myself in the mirror,
*  I still like do a jump scare because I'm like that, who's that?
*  Cause I was so skinny before I was really skinny before.
*  Now I have like a belly cause I'm supposed to, right?
*  But I do a jump scare a little bit. Really? Yeah. But I'm going back out.
*  I mean, I'm going back back out on tour when the book comes out.
*  So I'm going to be super pregnant, super pregnant,
*  five days a week on Gutfeld two days a week on the road. Wow.
*  So that's going to be a lot. Are you worried about that?
*  Like becoming exhausted and that that would have a detrimental effect.
*  I'm worried about being exhausted,
*  but I'm not worried about having a detrimental effect. I mean,
*  because I'm just going to do it and I love it. Like I love being on stage.
*  I love doing what I do. Well, as long as you get enough sleep. Yeah.
*  But it's going to be tough at the end. It's going to be,
*  you're going to do it all the way to the end. Yeah.
*  I'm doing it all the way until I can't fly anymore. So the middle of December.
*  Wow. But I, you know, it's, my husband says he's going to come with me.
*  His, his joke, he has like a couple of joke, he has like five jokes.
*  And one of them is he's like, I'm going to come.
*  So she has someone to yell at. That's his bit. He has a few jokes.
*  He's in the military. What else does he say? He loves,
*  he loves when people ask him if he's ever been hunting.
*  Cause then he gets to say just people. Yeah. It's another one.
*  I like that one. Yeah. He likes that one. I'm trying to think what else.
*  He's got like a five solid bits that he does, but you know,
*  it's crazy that you're going to do it all the way up until nine months.
*  That's, that seems, why not just like stop doing it like six?
*  Cause I, cause I'm a person of extremes.
*  I'm always like, I want to take it to the limit every single time.
*  And I also, even while you're pregnant,
*  like what if you give birth prematurely when you're on the road?
*  I don't think I will. Oh, well you've had a lot of experience having babies.
*  No, but they said, so they said I shouldn't fly past 34 weeks. So, um,
*  that would be December 28th ish. And my last show is I think December 15th.
*  So that's, I'm just listening to what they're telling me. That's good.
*  But I, and I also, I think it's going to be,
*  I really like the, I'm really passionate about the subject matter. You know,
*  I'm, I'm, I love doing the shows and it's,
*  why wouldn't I do it other than, you know, what you just mentioned?
*  It's funny that people would instantly want to label you as a right-wing person
*  because you're on Fox. And then also it's funny that just people do that anymore.
*  Whatever they did when they first created Fox,
*  because the Fox was essentially the first real opinion based news source that
*  was very right-wing that was on television.
*  And then that gave the rise to,
*  or at least gave some of the motivation to places like CNN to develop these
*  editorial based shows and opinion based perspectives that really annoyed and
*  polarized so many people.
*  And it used to be that there were certain stations that would have objective
*  news and you would get objective news and you would have right-wing people given
*  their perspective and left-wing people.
*  Look Gore Vidal and William F Buckley debated live on television multiple times
*  in a row.
*  And it was like one of the biggest events on TV at the time,
*  like people were allowed to have differing opinions and they'd be on a show
*  and we would let them talk things through.
*  And even then I'm sure it was polarized. It's always going to be,
*  people are always going to be tribal.
*  But today it's so much more ridiculous than at any time I could ever remember in
*  my life.
*  Well I think that one of the biggest problems with today is not just that
*  there's a lack of independent thinking,
*  but that people have difficulty even perceiving it when it happens.
*  So if I say something that is critical of Kamala, then people are like,
*  oh she's MAGA, she's super MAGA.
*  Or if you say something critical of Trump, then it's like,
*  oh you're a communist and you're going to go for it.
*  And they don't even perceive that, hey,
*  maybe someone could be this other thing where they just kind of don't fall into
*  either camp. And I get that people, yeah.
*  Maybe you just have a point and just listen to what the point is.
*  But it's, and the parties don't mean anything in a lot of sense.
*  I've been at Fox for almost 10 years now.
*  So I used to get shit on for, I'm super anti-war.
*  I'm an anti-war person. I think, you know, it's,
*  it's a lot of, not I think,
*  we know they lie to us about a lot of these things.
*  And then we know that people get promoted and they get rich who work and,
*  you know, they move on from working as generals to working in weapons companies,
*  et cetera. We know all this stuff.
*  But that used to be something that the left would agree with me on and the
*  right would yell at me about. And then it was,
*  Trump was becoming anti-war with the Ukraine. And then it was reversed.
*  Then I was like, I'm a Trump puppet for thinking and saying the things that I've
*  always thought. So it's just, it people, it's just,
*  people even notice that though. They don't even notice it as it's happening.
*  Because they're really just committed to their tribe. Exactly.
*  It's these blue no matter who people are, red till dead people.
*  Then you can trick them into,
*  this is one of the reasons why like if I was the grand manipulator of the world,
*  if I really believe there's one cabal of super geniuses that's running
*  everything, I would try to see if I could do that. Yeah. I would say,
*  let's see if we can get the left to support, like censorship,
*  pro-war, invasive politics,
*  like entering into people's homes and classrooms and, and, you know,
*  siphoning up their information in order to protect trans kids in Detroit,
*  whatever it is,
*  come up with some fucking reason and make everybody get a part of a centralized
*  digital currency. Cause that's better for everybody.
*  Put everybody on an app so we know if you're vaccinated, that's the left.
*  If I wanted to show that people are so easily manipulated that there is no left,
*  there is no right. It's mostly nonsense. It's mostly people just apply,
*  they're just subscribing to a predetermined pattern of beliefs and behaviors
*  that they think is good and makes them a part of the tribe.
*  It's exactly what it is. It's exactly what it is. And it,
*  cause when people say, Oh, are you moderate? You're just like moderate.
*  According to what, what are these two pillars that have been set up? They're not,
*  it's not real and it's always changing.
*  And it goes so far to the left and so far to the right that what,
*  what used to be crazy is now normalized. Like hormone blockers for kids,
*  like being able to take away parents rights because the child wants to
*  transition and they want to be able to do it without the parents,
*  without the parents say so. That to me is 13, 14 years old.
*  The stuff with the schools is crazy to me because it's,
*  it shouldn't matter what it's about. But there was no time in history.
*  We would have accepted that. No,
*  to say that you can't tell the parents what's going on with the kids at
*  school is to say that the state has more ownership over your kids than you do.
*  That's some creepy communist shit.
*  And it's not just creepy communist shit, but it's prescribed.
*  It's like,
*  this is what you're supposed to believe in if you want to be a part of the
*  progressive left.
*  Yeah. And then, but then of course the right takes it too far.
*  But you're like drag, no drag queens, you know, it's,
*  it's definitely be allowed to be a drag queen,
*  but I don't know if you should have drag queen story hour for five year olds
*  when there's no parents around.
*  Also when the kids can't read or do math is my thing.
*  I think that all of this stuff, it's also very, I've,
*  I've noticed it became more of an argument after COVID.
*  I think there's a lot of distraction from, Hey,
*  these kids lost a lot because I think it's so crazy how it's this radical idea
*  to say the department of it. When Trump said the part,
*  I'd give her the department of education. People go, he hates kids. It's like,
*  okay, well look what they did and look what they're continuing to do. I mean,
*  kids are not, yeah, exactly.
*  The academic results are terrible.
*  There was no school for two years. Some places just getting rid of a department
*  or disbanding a department doesn't mean you don't fund that thing anymore,
*  but it probably would be better if there was something more competitive.
*  Exactly.
*  Because if you just give it,
*  just like we were talking about the homeless problem in California,
*  if you just give it to an organization, an institution,
*  it's a government funded institution has no obligation to be profitable,
*  has no obligation to be effective. And you just say,
*  we are spending a lot of money on the homeless problem.
*  And what you've really done is just employ a bunch of people and they've done
*  very little.
*  Well they've done a lot in terms of probably their own incentives and their own
*  power and their own.
*  Apply that to basically infrastructure, education, everything.
*  It's just the same kind of thing. It's like,
*  I'm not this person that says the free market will figure out everything,
*  but in a lot of cases you'd be better off with some competition.
*  So you'd force people to be more effective. You'd force results.
*  You would have to,
*  you would force people to be accountable for whatever decisions they've made and
*  what the results of those decisions are.
*  There's no accountability.
*  There's no accountability. And that's a real problem in this country.
*  And that used to be something that the left feared.
*  The left used to fear corporate interference and big business and big
*  government. They used to fear that. They used to fear all that stuff.
*  And now they're all in on it. It's so weird.
*  Yeah. And for me, I mean, I'm a huge, I mean,
*  first amendment is so important, right? That's if you don't have that,
*  you don't have anything.
*  Well you don't have a job without it. I don't either.
*  No, of course I go to, I would be in jail a long time ago.
*  Think about what they're putting people in jail for in England,
*  just posting things on Facebook.
*  But I get shit from both sides for depending on what I'm defending in terms of
*  the constitution, something being constitutional. I mean, with the,
*  obviously with the left, it's like, what also was crazy to me is people,
*  a lot of the same people were the Trump is Hitler people were also the hate
*  speech laws people, which is like,
*  how can you think this government that's led by Hitler should be in control of
*  what you can and can't say? That doesn't make sense to me. But sometimes I also,
*  flag burning has to be constitutional because you have to be able to like buy a
*  flag. And if you can't burn a flag, you bought like, come on,
*  like that's government protests. You have to be able to do that.
*  I don't like it. I would never do it, but you shouldn't put people in jail for it.
*  Yeah. Trump said he wants to put people in jail for a year. Yeah.
*  And I was like, Oh dude, it's like, you know what I mean? Like he, he,
*  he got shot. He looked awesome when he got shot. I mean, he really, I mean,
*  I, if I got shot, I would not look that cool. Right. Fist pumping. No, no,
*  I'd be like, yeah, it was amazing. When he got shot, I was like, Oh, that he won.
*  I really thought after he got shot, I was like, he just won the election.
*  Well, I think they did too. That's why they shuffled Biden out and put Kamala in.
*  And they're like, let's just gaslight these motherfuckers into a coma and push
*  this through. Yeah, I think so too. I think so too.
*  100% if they had a full year of Kamala versus Trump,
*  like a full year of her running and doing interviews, who'd have a much more,
*  talking. Yeah.
*  We'd have a much more balanced understanding of who she is and how this is
*  going to look and what's going to be like if she becomes president.
*  Absolutely. Because right now people are just riding on gas. Yeah.
*  They're fucking riding on gas. But it's so powerful. The,
*  and you can see it that everybody's in on her. That's really powerful.
*  People are excited about her. Alexa. Alexa's in on her.
*  Alexa thing's crazy. Pop culture, you know, everyone's in on it. And it's,
*  it's also, we're in this, I hate,
*  I hate election years because it's just like, if you don't vote for blank,
*  this whole country is going to go down. Like both sides say it.
*  So it's just like, it's no, whoever wins,
*  it's going to be shitty and just in different ways.
*  And maybe some of the same ways it's just not.
*  What do you think would be the shittiest? Like not in terms of for the country,
*  but in terms of people's reaction,
*  do you think more violence will take place if Trump gets an office or more
*  violence would take place if Kamala gets an office?
*  Cause I anticipate there's going to be some craziness after the election.
*  Of course. Once someone decides, whoever someone is, whoever's president,
*  whatever, whenever it gets decided, there's going to be some madness. Yeah.
*  You're gonna be some real madness.
*  And I get scared of that kind of stuff too,
*  cause I know that a lot of times when people do that, they think they're,
*  they're making a point. But boy, if you're against government control,
*  those kind of like real angry riots and protests are an amazing opportunity
*  for them to clamp down on your rights. Yes, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Absolutely. When that happens, it's like, okay, well then we need to cry.
*  Federalized police and this and that. It's like, it's crazy. I really do.
*  I am concerned about it for the same reasons for the absolutely.
*  And it's going to be bad no matter what in terms of the reaction of the other
*  side. I mean people, I'm not looking forward to it.
*  I'm like, I can't wait for this election to be over. And then I'm like, Oh,
*  it's going to be even worse.
*  Probably will. I mean, especially if,
*  if you believe the conspiracy theories that some of that stuff is funded,
*  like some of that stuff is organized, some protests and riots,
*  they seem to be organized, right? And I'm not going to be a conspiracy theorist,
*  but there is a thing called an agent provocateur. It's always existed.
*  And they send people in to disrupt protests and turn them violent and make
*  things chaotic. That's always been the case,
*  especially if they want to push a very specific agenda that,
*  you know, the people are fed up and they're angry. And so when,
*  remember when the George Floyd riots were going on and they'd find pallets of
*  bricks just laying around?
*  Yeah. Well that was crazy because I,
*  anybody ever, some people had like reasons for certain bricks being in places,
*  but there was a few of them where they're like,
*  people just said that they just got dropped off there.
*  And that's exactly where everything popped off. Like why are there pallets of bricks?
*  There's never just pallets of bricks laying around.
*  No, I have no, yeah, I have no idea.
*  But if you were going to organize a riot, wouldn't you just leave some bricks?
*  I'd leave some bricks for my riot. Yeah.
*  If I was like, look, this is what we're going to do. We're going to,
*  we're organizing,
*  we're spending all this money to get these college kids to invest in this.
*  Then we're going to bring in Antifa and they're going to go crazy.
*  And we're handing out masks and then we're going to leave bricks around.
*  And I also think it's sad because I think that there were definitely legitimate
*  points to be made and are about criminal justice, I think.
*  But boy was that handled the war. I mean,
*  so they go from that to people, to people, you know,
*  setting buildings on fire and then CNN doing the, you know, mostly fiery,
*  but mostly peaceful with the famous. It's like, come on,
*  you don't got to defend that, you know, like nobody, like people,
*  you look ridiculous. Exactly. But then it got completely bungled.
*  And so in the name of criminal justice reform,
*  now it's like people who are actual violent criminals can be allowed out easier.
*  Nobody wanted that.
*  So then now the pendulum is going to swing in the other direction where,
*  you know, it's going to be even more law and order. And it's going to be,
*  like you said, it's going to be rights at stake, civil liberties at stake,
*  which is what this was supposed to be all about to begin with.
*  Well, this is the ultimate goal of, I mean, again,
*  I'm not saying this is happening,
*  but this would be the ultimate goal of a communist dictatorship.
*  You cause chaos, you step in to stop the chaos.
*  You install new rules to make sure that there's no more chaos anymore.
*  You protect, you cause a problem. You bring up a solution.
*  That solution allows you to gain more control and you just keep doing it.
*  You keep doing it until you have ultimate control over the people. Yeah.
*  And I'm not saying it's happening either, but in general, in general,
*  the fear is used by the government a lot. It's really, I mean,
*  even going back to talking about war and national security and we need to do
*  this next thing you know, I mean, look at the Patriot act. I mean,
*  people were like, you have to be able to, to protect you doing this,
*  say banning tick tock, all these things.
*  And you look into what they're really doing and the power that it would really
*  give them. It's like, Oh, this isn't about really just banning tick tock.
*  What did Kamala Harris say recently about Elon Musk and Twitter having to follow
*  the same rules as Facebook? Yeah. What did she say? Yeah. What did she,
*  I don't know. I didn't hear what she said.
*  It was something about how Elon's going to have to follow the same
*  rules as Facebook. That's so first of all, what rules. Yeah.
*  And also didn't Mark Zuckerberg just come out with a statement saying that he
*  regretted giving in to the government's request to take down COVID-19
*  information. Yeah. And yeah. And then the laptop story.
*  He just came out with like, it was a big statement because for a lot of people
*  they were really furious about it. Claim a video clip portrays Harris saying
*  that she will shut down X.
*  I don't think she said she would shut it down if she wins 2020 for pleasure
*  elicited and Musk has lost his privileges. The fact that's false.
*  Harris was referring to Trump long before Musk and Twitter rebranded it as X.
*  Um, so is that what she was saying from that video?
*  So was the video her saying that why should Trump,
*  why should Twitter be allowed to have Trump on if Facebook can't have him on?
*  Is that what it is?
*  When I'm looking for the video,
*  I'm seeing as like 20 within the last 24 hours post a claim is false.
*  Right. But that is not what we were talking about though.
*  We were talking about something slightly different.
*  Let me see if I could find it for you.
*  She was shut down X.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*  I'm not saying that she said she would shut it down.
*  What I'm saying is that she was saying that why should Twitter not have to
*  follow the same rules that are being followed by Facebook.
*  Right. What I typed in was Kamala Harris, Twitter rules.
*  So that's the videos that were popping up.
*  And I'm sending it to you right now, Jamie. This is what I'm looking for.
*  Okay. So I need to know what she's referring to here,
*  but like listen to this statement.
*  Yeah. I think this is from that.
*  Go ahead and play it. Let's see what it says.
*  So she's probably talking about Trump being on Twitter. Is that what it is?
*  She was talking to Jake Tapper. So right.
*  You can't say that you have one rule for Facebook and you have a different rule
*  for Twitter. The same rule has to apply,
*  which is that there has to be a responsibility that is placed on these
*  social media sites to understand their power.
*  They are directly speaking to millions and millions of people without any level
*  of oversight or regulation.
*  Okay. Right away. There's no way to misconstrue that.
*  What does that mean?
*  Oversight and regulation for free speech is ridiculous.
*  Yeah.
*  Just that alone. There's no way to misconstrue that. Right?
*  What she was saying is what I was thinking she was saying.
*  She was saying she wants government oversight and regulation for social media.
*  That's crazy.
*  It's crazy for anyone to want it because if the only reason you want it right is
*  because you agree with the ideological bent of the platform,
*  wait until someone else is in charge of it or wait until there's a different
*  government in charge.
*  It's also saying that the very thing that Mark Zuckerberg regrets should be
*  happening. Like she's essentially saying,
*  why should they have different rules for Facebook than they do for Twitter?
*  Like what rules? Like what rules? We don't have rules.
*  We have first amendment rights of free speech.
*  I think it actually is even crazy that he's admitting that, you know? I mean,
*  good for him. Absolutely.
*  Trump said something pretty scary for him.
*  He said that if he finds out that he interfered with the election,
*  he's going to be in jail for the rest of his life.
*  That's pretty scary.
*  That's pretty fucking scary because it's very likely that he might wind up being
*  the president. And if he winds up being the president,
*  they start investigating this stuff. If I was Mark Zuckerberg,
*  I'd be pretty fucking freaked out by that statement because it is election
*  interference. For sure.
*  Whoever was running Twitter who gave into the FBI's request to take down the
*  a hundred button laptop story,
*  they definitely interfered with the way people voted because if people found out
*  that that laptop was legitimate and all that stuff was true,
*  there there's a certain percentage. I don't know what the number is,
*  but there's a certain percentage of people that were maybe on the fence and
*  that could have influenced their vote one way or another.
*  And it would could have given Trump fuel because he could have been talking
*  about it. See,
*  I told you that this was real and they've been lying.
*  And it would also prove that Biden lied during the debates.
*  I don't understand how anybody didn't think it was real though,
*  because Hunter never even denied. He was there.
*  When all those people signed that letter, all those intelligence people,
*  former intelligence, 51 signed it. Guess who didn't sign it? Hunter Biden.
*  Right. That's what I thought from the, I was like, okay,
*  if that was me and someone was saying there was a laptop going around of me,
*  you know,
*  doing all this shit,
*  banging all these people on camera and smoking all these drugs. I'd be like that,
*  I would be like, that was not me. I would be like, you know,
*  that'd be pretty important for me to come out and say that.
*  If it happened today, you could claim it was AI. Yeah. Easy.
*  Well that's out there with everybody. Me included, sadly. Forever. Forever. Yeah.
*  And not only that, it's going to change and get way more complex.
*  And there's nothing you can do about it. Cause you knock it down.
*  It's like whack-a-mole. It's like, then there's another one,
*  then there's another one. There's nothing you can do about that. But that,
*  you know, with all this stuff, this talk,
*  like that whatever she was saying right there is not what you want to hear from
*  somebody. You don't want to hear they're going to censor social media.
*  They were talking specifically about Senator Warren talking about banning
*  president Trump's account. And that was her response to it.
*  Yeah. But she was also talking about oversight.
*  She talked about oversight very specifically and clearly.
*  Yeah. It has the quote right here.
*  Yeah. And what's the rule that she's talking about?
*  The same rule should apply,
*  which there has to be a responsibility that is placed on these social media
*  sites to understand their power.
*  They are directly speaking to millions and millions of people without any level
*  of oversight or regulation. And that has to stop.
*  That's all you need to hear.
*  Like that right there is not something you want to hear from someone who
*  respects the first amendment. That's not how it's supposed to be.
*  Also, who's they? It's just a collection of people.
*  Not only that, if you're talking about oversight and regulation,
*  are you talking about the exact same people that were trying to get Twitter and
*  successfully did get Twitter to take down the higher Biden laptop story and make
*  it impossible to share that video saying that it was a misinformation when it was
*  not.
*  And if you don't do anything to correct and to hold people responsible that
*  pushed out that misinformation and no one's punished for it and there's no
*  retribution, there's no repercussions at all.
*  Like what are you saying then? Then what are you saying? It's okay.
*  If your side says things that aren't true and you can regulate in a way that's
*  not based on fact or reality,
*  but based on a result that you want to take place and that's fine.
*  So we don't have freedom of speech. No, of course not.
*  And then then you're talking nonsense. This is talking crazy talk.
*  Maybe she believed it was real back then. Maybe she believed it was real.
*  Maybe she believed it was important that the gut,
*  but if you've got ahold of the Twitter files and you see what Michael
*  Schellenberger and Matt Ty B and all those people that went through that stuff
*  with a fine tooth comb,
*  the stuff that they found out should make you realize like, no,
*  you can't have the government tell you what you can and can't say.
*  They don't always tell the truth. They're often influenced.
*  Sometimes you have rogue actors.
*  You probably have one or two people that's responsible for making the call to
*  Facebook or to Twitter. So it's on them.
*  It's on these people with whatever fucking influence that they have and whatever
*  people are talking to them behind the scenes. We can't have that kids.
*  It's bad for everybody. Yeah.
*  And the, just the idea of that there's certain information that's misinformation
*  is just the government, government sanction information.
*  But they can't even let you debate it. They want to stop it.
*  As soon as they want you to stop it,
*  the only solution to bad information is good. Of course,
*  that's how it's supposed to be.
*  If they want to stop you from saying something and then it turns out that what
*  you were saying was true, no one should trust them ever again.
*  There should be some sort of a comeuppance and there's no comeuppance.
*  There's no discussion of it. It's never talked about.
*  It's just plowed on through and we move on to the next thing with no
*  acknowledgement at all that you guys fucking bullshitted us and lied to us for
*  years.
*  And now you want to control social media to stop lies.
*  And the lab leak theory is one that really, I mean,
*  people's careers were destroyed over being like,
*  maybe this virus came from this lab full of viruses where it was found right
*  outside of us. And they were like, you fucking crazy ass. You should,
*  but it was only because certain information was seen as acceptable and sanctioned
*  and certain information was seen as not.
*  Well it's way creepier than that. Of course, it's actually suppressing it.
*  No, I get it.
*  There's a business behind it and they use their money and their influence and
*  their control of the media to fuck you. You got bullshitted.
*  You got bullshitted by business and business.
*  They got together with media and they all had a plan. What are you playing,
*  Jamie? What are you watching over there?
*  More bullshit. It's just, there's so much bullshit, but also less bullshit.
*  If you think about overall, because there's way more truth now, right?
*  Like you get way more independent journalism than we've ever had access to
*  in the history of the human race. And you get so much of it.
*  So you get all this media propaganda and mainstream bullshit.
*  But on top of that, you get a lot of Jimmy doors.
*  You get a lot of independent people that are telling the truth.
*  You get the Glenn Greenwalds.
*  You get the Matt tie.
*  Eby's you had all these people that are just telling you Michael Schellenberg
*  is telling Barry wise, telling you what the fuck is actually going on and not
*  attached to some large corporation.
*  Yeah. But it's also saying the government is the only one that's allowed to be
*  wrong. Right. Because if what they say is misinformation turns out to be true as
*  was so many things, that's okay.
*  But it's not just wrong. You were lying. Of course. Of course. Like Fauci being
*  like, Oh, we made up six feet. Like, Oh, we didn't really know.
*  It's just actively lying. Yes, absolutely.
*  There's a difference between being wrong about something and just lying and then
*  getting truth removed, you know, and shaming doctors from Stanford and Harvard
*  and making them out to be kooks.
*  Some of the people that were the top of their field and they had dissenting
*  opinions because they're experts and they're watching this bullshit go down by
*  bureaucrats. And they're like, you motherfuckers and people say, just stay
*  home. That drove me nuts.
*  I feel like how can you say that when you're still at work?
*  When you're still at work, right?
*  I mean, I was lucky to still have my job and people had to shut down.
*  Even New York's not the same anymore as it used to be because a lot of these
*  businesses closed down forever.
*  What made New York so special was a lot of those small businesses, restaurants,
*  things like that. They can't afford to be open and just not have customers for
*  that long. So now a lot of that's like Dunkin Donuts.
*  Are you seeing the difference in New York with the spike of immigrants?
*  I haven't really. I don't go outside that much.
*  There was some recent statistic about the percentage of violent crimes,
*  robberies and assaults that were created by migrants, illegal immigrants that are
*  in New York right now.
*  Yeah, I'm not familiar with that.
*  I mean, I also truly don't go any like I go to work in my apartment and that's
*  pretty much it.
*  I was going to read the article, but I saved it.
*  See if you can find it though, because I thought it'd be an interesting thing to
*  talk about. Like at what point in time, like I know that Eric Adams, the mayor,
*  is like, stop coming here, go somewhere else.
*  And Kathy Hochul is like, get out of here, go somewhere else.
*  But you still have a sanctuary city and you still are paying them to stay there.
*  That's the thing that gets me is I'm somebody if you are nonviolent, you want
*  to come contribute to our economy, then I think you should be welcome to do so.
*  But the incentives where you're paying for things.
*  Here it is. Immigrants.
*  It's on New York Post.
*  Migrants flooding New York City's justice system, making up 75 percent of
*  arrests in Midtown as pathetic sanctuary city laws, handcuffed cops.
*  Yeah, I saw this thing where someone was complaining to these cops about someone
*  doing something illegal and they say we can't arrest them because this is a
*  sanctuary city and they're migrants.
*  So like they just do wild.
*  It was somewhere in Colorado.
*  So like you could just do wild things and no one could do anything because you're
*  in a sanctuary city.
*  And I think it's I think it should be very simple.
*  I think that if you want to come contribute to the economy and you're
*  nonviolent, you should be free to do so.
*  I don't think we should be paying people, I mean, to come over to the city.
*  What do you think they're doing?
*  Yeah, that's what they're doing.
*  What do you think they're doing?
*  Then why do you think they're doing it this way?
*  I mean, there's many explanations.
*  There's a bunch of conspiracies and then there's also the idea of people not
*  wanting to be called xenophobic.
*  Yeah, but if you not want to be called xenophobic doesn't mean you have an open
*  border. The idea of just completely abandoning any idea of security concerns.
*  Yeah, I think it could be more.
*  It's sad because there are people who want to come here and work and should be
*  able to and have problems.
*  They can't come here.
*  But then there's people who just it's not even the problem.
*  You don't even blame the come here.
*  You get a free this, you get free that free place to stay.
*  Why wouldn't these people all come?
*  Right. Do you think they're bringing them in here to buy votes, though?
*  I don't. I'm not convinced.
*  That's the most interesting one.
*  I'm not convinced by that.
*  Well, Nancy Pelosi was on Bill Maher and she was talking about providing a path
*  for them to all be citizens.
*  And that's what she wants to do. Make them documented, document them.
*  Aren't a lot of people from these countries conservative, though?
*  Well, it depends on which countries from Cuba, for sure.
*  There's definitely people who are also conservative.
*  But the thing is, most people look out for their best interests and you can buy
*  them. I mean, if you're the party that let them through and gave them money and
*  allowed them to establish a foothold in America and now their families here and
*  they're doing much better.
*  Well, you would definitely vote Democrat because they're the people that hooked
*  you up. That just seems like a natural human incentive without even having
*  to bribe them to do it.
*  If you're giving them loans and helping them get houses and making it so they can
*  vote and giving them a clear path to citizenship.
*  That seems like if I came here from Guatemala and I didn't know a lot about our
*  political system and the people that hooked me up, I'd stick with them.
*  So you probably are going to get a higher percentage of those people that if you
*  could ever do this and create a path with these people who are illegal immigrants
*  and get entered into the country illegally, can get a quick path to you would
*  have a lot more voters.
*  A lot. You'd have a lot.
*  I mean, it doesn't seem it sounds crazy to say, but it doesn't seem crazy to try
*  if you're trying to figure out a way that you can win and win in the future, like
*  almost every time. Wouldn't you like just bring in voters?
*  I mean, I've heard I've obviously heard the argument before.
*  I'm not. I'm just not I'm not super convinced by it.
*  I think that there's a many other things that play into it.
*  But in general, my problem is with the extremely large welfare state in general
*  and where the money goes and how bad the government is at spending money.
*  Yeah. I mean, because it's also the same thing as California's in New York.
*  I mean, there's so much money spent.
*  Wasn't a Bloomberg or excuse me, de Blasio's wife that was in charge of like
*  the homeless mental health initiative.
*  You want to miss in a bunch of money?
*  It's like I'm sitting there.
*  I used to live in Hudson Yards and my husband and I are sitting in this.
*  We've since moved. But we're sitting there.
*  We were looking down in the park watching like some dude get a blow job from, you
*  know, some crack head blowing someone else.
*  And it's like, I feel like there's a lot still going on here with this mental.
*  Where's my money all going? Right.
*  In general. And I feel like with, you know, immigration, I think also the two sides,
*  there's a lot of incentives that people get from politically.
*  Yeah. You know, well, the dreamers labor.
*  Here's the thing about cheap labor.
*  And this is what Tim Dillon's been saying.
*  He said he's like he thinks they're bringing in cheap illegal labor.
*  And that's way construction businesses like if you kicked out all the illegal
*  immigrants, he was like a lot of construction businesses fucked.
*  They'd be fucked. And he said there's a lot of people that don't want those jobs
*  anymore. And they're sneaking in people to fill those jobs.
*  He thinks that's part of it.
*  And that makes sense. But you ever see that documentary?
*  Wow. Wow. Country.
*  It's fucking great. It's on Netflix.
*  And it's all about this cult that put together this compound in like the Pacific
*  Northwest. And one of the things they did is they brought in homeless people by the
*  buses. They found all these homeless people.
*  You can be a part of our community.
*  And these homeless people get there like, wow, finally have a place I belong.
*  These people were all psyched. They belong to this community.
*  And then they voted. So they took over the whole town by busing in voters.
*  So they brought in these. They just grabbed homeless people from everywhere and they
*  integrated into the community.
*  That's a South Park episode.
*  They had them vote. But they really did.
*  Yeah. They had this is like in the 80s or 90s.
*  So they had them vote.
*  What year was that? What year did that take place?
*  It might be the 2000s. Anyway, had them vote.
*  And then once they took over the town, they kicked all the homeless people out.
*  Get the fuck out of here. And the homeless people are like, I thought you loved me.
*  I thought it was a part of the team.
*  And these people like for once in their life, they had direction, they had meaning.
*  They were part of a community. They're trying to get off the dope.
*  They're feeling better about themselves chanting and really believing all this thing these
*  people are talking about. And they really just used them.
*  Their political pawns. Yeah.
*  Well, it's the same thing as remember how the Dream Act, the Dreamers was like such a big deal
*  when Trump said he was going to remove the protections.
*  And but then, OK, so why have they not been protected now?
*  So why has there been no bill?
*  They said if everybody cares so much, people, they don't care.
*  That's like that. That's like my overarching belief is it's just that politics, they just
*  don't care about you.
*  That makes people fight in their real life with people on the behalf of people who that
*  don't even care you exist.
*  They can't. They can't care.
*  There's too many people.
*  I mean, just imagine wanting that job, first of all.
*  No, I can't.
*  And then imagine like the stress of how is Trump doing it at 78 years old?
*  How is he dealing with the stress of doing this?
*  No. Like and he's doing podcasts and it's like, what the fuck, man?
*  He's started a podcast with Theo.
*  The podcast with Theo is amazing.
*  It's amazing. Yeah.
*  He did one with Lex yesterday.
*  So it's just like, how do you have the energy to keep that fuck that job?
*  I would never.
*  And how can you you can care as much as you want about you could try to care.
*  But there's so many things to care about.
*  Yeah. There's so much going on and everything's a fucking fire.
*  Everything's on fire.
*  The economy's on fire.
*  International relations on fire.
*  The economy. I went I mean, I went and got two coffees and two shitty egg sandwiches
*  with my husband the other day.
*  Shitty ones, you know, the ones that are pre-made and you just heat them in the heat.
*  It was over 60 dollars.
*  What? Yeah.
*  Is that New York City?
*  Yeah. Fucking get out of there.
*  Why do you why are they doing that work?
*  And that's why they is fuck stupid.
*  I move their fucking business to Connecticut.
*  I move anywhere.
*  I'm all about it because that's the only reason I'm there.
*  Yeah. Go somewhere else.
*  And I don't go out. Right.
*  I guess it's fun if like you're young.
*  But when I was there and I was young, I was poor.
*  So I never really got now I'm married and pregnant.
*  So I'm not really going out. Right.
*  I'm going home into work and you can't even live in Long Island because it's too hard.
*  It's too hard to get over that.
*  We're making that we're still renting and I'm making that decision.
*  I'm like, do we like buy a house somewhere?
*  But then I'm in Jersey.
*  But then I then you get takes you an hour to get to exactly if you leave at six in the morning.
*  Exactly. Those deals.
*  Yeah. Right. Which is worse.
*  It's it's hard.
*  And if you want to do stand up, god damn it.
*  You kind of have to be in the city.
*  Like, it's so hard to do that unless you're single and free.
*  Like when I lived in New Rochelle, I lived in New Rochelle because I couldn't afford to live in the city at the time.
*  And I was doing a lot of road gigs.
*  I needed a car. I needed a parking spot.
*  And if I lived in the city, a parking spot was like 500 bucks a month or something like that.
*  It was crazy. Yeah.
*  Half of my rent for a spot to put my car.
*  I had to have a fucking car.
*  So I used to have to drive in the city to go and do spots.
*  So I do spots in the city.
*  I have to pay to park.
*  I'd always lose money.
*  I never made any money.
*  If I lived in the city and just hopped around the subway and took cabs, I could have made a living doing stand up in the city.
*  But I had to do road gigs in order to just make a living just to be able to do sets in the city.
*  Yeah. No. And I've just started going, you know, getting into going back up just around the city again and just like, oh, what am I doing this week?
*  And hey, can I get a spot at this place?
*  Because I quit stand up three times.
*  Now I'm back at it.
*  It's it's you can't really ever quit it.
*  I feel like some people can.
*  I mean, I think I could quit it if I quit it.
*  I thought I could.
*  I quit it during covid for like eight months and I was thinking why I was quitting it.
*  Well, while you know, I was like, who knows if this is ever going to happen again.
*  I was thinking, I'm OK.
*  Like, I love it. I really love stand up.
*  It's fun.
*  I love comedian.
*  Stan Hope said it best.
*  He's like, I could quit comedy, but I couldn't quit comedian.
*  Yeah. Which is like totally right.
*  It's like the hang is like it's too they're too fun to hang with.
*  They're too fun to be silly with.
*  Everyone knows there's no boundaries.
*  Everyone's being hilarious.
*  Everyone like last night, we were in the green room and Brian Simpson came up with this new bit and everybody's like given it like he said this thing.
*  It was really funny.
*  Go, dude, that's a bit.
*  He's like, you think so?
*  Like, fuck yeah.
*  And then he hit it with another tagline and then somebody else jumped in.
*  Then he had another tagline.
*  Like he created this bit right in front of him.
*  And he was like, oh, I can't wait to go on stage and tell that I was like, oh, like those kind of moments.
*  Those are the most fun moments.
*  And I think only comics are going to appreciate that.
*  You know, no one else is going to understand what even just happened.
*  That guy just has a bit.
*  There's not only just a bit, but it's a root of what's going to be a real chunk of material.
*  He's just started off with this hilarious premise that has a few really good taglines.
*  And then four months from now, that's going to probably be a closing bit.
*  It's like one of those deals.
*  It's like, I can't stop hanging out with those people.
*  It's too fun.
*  Oh, it's too fun.
*  But I mean, for me, I quit a few times and I quit most recently also during covid.
*  And then when I wrote the first book, I started doing a live show with in their slides involved.
*  Every slide has a punch line.
*  And then next thing you know, I'm going up around the city now doing just like stand up as well in addition to my live shows.
*  But now it's pretty much I'm going to have no time to just do my my shows and then gut felt five days a week and the baby
*  growing the baby.
*  Maybe you do need speed.
*  I'm telling you, I'm telling you.
*  But it's you know, they don't let you.
*  Well, they do. The fact that they would let me take it.
*  I was like, yeah, fuck that.
*  Because if there was ever anything wrong with the baby, right.
*  I'd be like, that was my fault. Right. Right. Right.
*  That was my fault for taking amphetamines during my pregnancy.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Fuck that.
*  So I thought I'd be honestly, I thought when I I thought I'd be more scared of having it.
*  And I am scared. I have no idea what I'm doing.
*  But I've also just been like too tired.
*  Yeah. Which is kind of nice.
*  Right. That probably like eases some of the anxiety.
*  I think you need a nap. Yeah.
*  And then once you have the baby, then you're going to need a lot of naps.
*  Yeah. Baby brain is real in the beginning.
*  You think you're like out of it now when you don't get any sleep and the baby's up and then you got to take turns.
*  Like you you're you're going to be like sleep deprived for several months.
*  Yeah. At least. At least. At least.
*  I mean, I I've it's crazy because only recently have I accepted that this baby is going to like live in my apartment.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I bet you're going to want to get out of there.
*  Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah. You're going to want to get a house.
*  You're going to want to be somewhere safer and quieter.
*  Somewhere with outside.
*  Yeah. Somewhere where you can can play.
*  Yeah. Baby can't play on the balcony.
*  It's just I just you know, I have friends who raise their whole families in New York City,
*  like kids from baby all the way to grown up.
*  And those kids are different. They're little assassins.
*  Yeah, I'm worried. I don't want to have to explain to my toddler dude like jerking off on a street corner with a needle in his arm.
*  They know too much at a young age.
*  I don't want to have to. I mean, the stuff that you see just it's not as bad as it was during Covid.
*  It was crazy. People were shooting up all over the place.
*  Not as bad, but still, I mean.
*  Remember when people were using the streets as like racetracks?
*  I was crashing cars because there was no one on the street.
*  So people were going like 150 miles an hour down Broadway.
*  There was I when I live in Hudson Yards.
*  Also during Covid, there was a dude had a chick bent over a car,
*  fucking her in the daytime, in the daytime.
*  And he was like howling. He was like, wow.
*  And I'm looking around and there's nobody nobody's doing anything.
*  You know, what do you want them to do?
*  No, right. Like nobody wants to be in the splash zone.
*  Nobody wants to go anywhere near all the terrible things that are going on.
*  Is that that bad?
*  You know, I mean, they're not doing anything when someone smashes windows,
*  steals clothes and I would be upset if that were my car.
*  When de Blasio let those people have those smash and grabs
*  and was telling them to get it out of their system.
*  Remember that? Yeah.
*  That was the strategy.
*  Just let the riots burn themselves out and don't arrest anybody.
*  Like, what are you fucking doing?
*  Well, no personal property.
*  That's common. That's some communist shit, too.
*  It was great. It was just it didn't make any sense.
*  It was all failed leftist philosophies from like the 1960s
*  that nobody really believes in in practice.
*  And they're they've never worked.
*  You can't just let people fucking smash and grab things.
*  You're going to destroy the fabric of society.
*  You're going to so many people are going to be indoctrinated into looting
*  and stealing that maybe have never done that before.
*  If you have these mass, if you have like these mass groups of people
*  that break into a mall and 200 people, how many of those people
*  have ever done anything like that before?
*  Probably a lot haven't.
*  And now all of a sudden they have and they do it multiple times.
*  Then it becomes a normalized thing.
*  Yeah. And they realize there's no you've you've created a real fucking problem.
*  Well, you feel dumb for not stealing at a certain point.
*  It's like, why am I still paying for this shit?
*  But you can't I can't buy anything at a store.
*  I have to get like essentials, toiletries type shit.
*  You have to just get it online.
*  You can't go to a store in New York because it's all there's no one working there.
*  There's a few employees.
*  You got to press the button every time you need something.
*  Everything's locked up.
*  Birdcrusher went viral today because I think Breitbart
*  put a video of his because he went through a Rite Aid.
*  Yeah, I saw someone commenting on that, though, that Rite Aid is going out of business
*  and that stores like one of the ones that's closing.
*  Where people get their amphetamines.
*  But you know why they're going out of business because they got looted.
*  Everything's locked up.
*  I see what you're saying.
*  But it doesn't make sense that they're going out of business.
*  So they locked up everything.
*  No, no, they locked up everything because people were stealing like crazy
*  because they passed a fucking law or anything under nine hundred dollars
*  or whatever it was, they weren't allowed to arrest you.
*  So people just run in and throw deodorant and fucking hairspray.
*  Everything in a bag and walk right out the door and no one could do a goddamn thing about it.
*  Video showing deserted Rite Aid's bare shelves after bankruptcy goes viral.
*  Is this Bert? Yeah.
*  Look at Bert went viral.
*  Bert's so happy he's never going to stop doing this now.
*  He's going to go everywhere.
*  How do you go to every Rite Aid there is?
*  Bert Kreischer, who showcased the empty shelves,
*  incorrectly attributing them to theft, incorrectly.
*  First of all, it's the reason why they're locked up.
*  Go show the video.
*  So is this show the video?
*  Because the you want me to send it to you? You got it.
*  OK, because saying saying that that's that's kooky to say.
*  That's really kooky to say falsely attributing them to theft.
*  Or is this one maybe?
*  Look at this. This is our deodorant.
*  Look, everything's locked up.
*  But that I think this is empty.
*  So this is probably is going out of business.
*  Yeah. And I guess thieves just come in and take whatever is expensive.
*  But I think this is going out of business because it's not locked up.
*  Yeah, this is this is incorrect.
*  This is classic.
*  So I thought these were locks, locked boxes.
*  OK, Bert's wrong.
*  But he's not wrong, because the reason why they go out of business
*  is because they've been looted.
*  So like they they've abandoned several major cities, right?
*  They've moved out like a lot of businesses have moved out of San Francisco.
*  A lot of businesses moved out of L.A.
*  for a very specific reason, because of these looting.
*  Yeah. Like this is real.
*  Like what what what companies have pulled stores
*  because of the after effect of looting?
*  Let's find out. Yeah.
*  I know they have in Oakland.
*  I think they have in San Francisco.
*  Let's Google different questions with drug stores.
*  What drug stores have pulled out of San Francisco?
*  I think it's Walgreens.
*  Wall. So what's the difference between Walmart and Walgreens?
*  I mean, Walgreens is drugs.
*  Walmart is the big place that but they have drugs there, too.
*  Yeah. But they don't have a pharmacy.
*  They can hang in there. Yeah, they.
*  They're an institution in many places that close around 900 stores
*  through the next three years.
*  Nine percent of them are.
*  Wait, it then closed six in San Francisco,
*  including five throughout downtown and one on Venice Avenue.
*  Yeah. Drug stores.
*  Drug stores used to be like the most profitable fucking business you could own.
*  Yeah. And now they're like, we're just getting robbed.
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, I.
*  So Bird's kind of right.
*  He's not right why those shelves are empty at that moment,
*  because they're they're they're going out of business.
*  But that's why they're going out of business.
*  Well, those would be locked up.
*  Because they'd be to Nordstrom.
*  Half of the retailers free fleeing downtown San Francisco.
*  Well, because brick and mortar wasn't doing that well to begin with
*  because people are buying shit online. Right.
*  And then you just let people go.
*  People were going to store because you can steal it.
*  So crazy. You can steal it.
*  They want society to collapse, like allowing stuff like that
*  and not making corrective measures to make these retailers feel comfortable
*  so they stay in your community without doing anything to save them
*  and letting them pull out and not making any corrective measures is so nuts.
*  Yeah, it is nuts.
*  But it's nothing's changed.
*  I mean, I can't New York's stuff has been locked up forever now.
*  Right. But this is a new thing, is what I'm saying.
*  Like, yeah, this is not this didn't exist in the year 2000.
*  You never saw this.
*  So in the last 24 years, all of a sudden, it's become a thing
*  that people are looting stores on a regular basis
*  to the point where they have to move out of cities because there's no correction
*  in the way they enforce the laws.
*  Well, it's also not going to change. Right.
*  Like New York, it's not going to have the Republicans, not going to win New York.
*  They might.
*  It could get sideways enough for a Republican, a Rudy Giuliani type
*  character can get in there.
*  That depends on how much they have the system rigged.
*  But I think there's a real possibility that someone could reach
*  or some conservative Democrat, you know, some law and order Democrat.
*  That's possible. Yeah, you could have one of those.
*  But it's going to have to people are just going to have to get fed up.
*  And the problem is if they don't get fed up and they keep voting
*  for the same thing like they seem to do in California and a lot of other places,
*  they're never going to change.
*  It's just going to keep getting worse.
*  And I don't understand that.
*  It's like, how much do you love your ideology
*  where you don't realize they're fucking your life up?
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  I mean, it's and because I think I mean, I just have no hope.
*  I don't think that I don't think it's going to get any better.
*  I don't know. I mean, you know.
*  Yeah, I do.
*  I have faith in people.
*  I really do.
*  I think we come really close to fucking up a lot and we pull ourselves out of the ashes.
*  And I think there's been if you just follow the course of our society
*  over the last 100 years, there's been a lot of ups and downs.
*  There was prohibition.
*  There was World War One, World War Two, Vietnam.
*  There's a lot of things where it looked like society was over Kent State.
*  Oh, my God. What's going on?
*  Martin Luther King gets shot.
*  JFK gets shot.
*  There was a lot of like terrible moments.
*  And then things got better.
*  And then things, you know, it's always if you look on a chart,
*  there's always generally speaking, over time, there's less crime, less problems.
*  The economy does a little bit better.
*  Everybody's cost of living changes.
*  Like your your the way you live, your life improves overall.
*  Generally, I think if you look at like a thousand years to today, it's obvious.
*  There's a clear path.
*  It's just like, got to make sure that whatever dip we're in right now, we correct.
*  Yeah, I mean, I have all the things that we're doing wrong.
*  It doesn't mean you can't do all the good things that like progressive people want to do.
*  And in terms of like funding education and helping people get over drug addiction and homelessness,
*  all those things should be funded.
*  Like it's a good idea to have more healthy, happy people in our society.
*  But also, you can't rob the store.
*  You can't. You shouldn't just be able to sneak in across the border because terrorists are a real thing.
*  You can't. You can't rob a store.
*  And then also just with letting people, I mean, violent criminals out is another thing where it's like, dude, nobody wants this.
*  It's crazy.
*  Nobody wants this person who's convicted, you know, has this violent, violent history to be out on the streets.
*  Except really super progressive DAs who think that the criminal justice system is inherently racist.
*  I think there's plenty of things wrong with the criminal justice system.
*  I don't think anybody should go to prison for for drug.
*  I think drugs should be legal. I think all drugs should be legal.
*  I think for sure.
*  But I think that that's different than saying crimes with people who have committed crimes with victims should be allowed to go
*  crew more victims.
*  Right. The thing about drugs is already illegal.
*  So if drugs were legal, all the negative aspects of drugs other than addiction and overdose are already illegal.
*  Yeah.
*  People do math and break into a house because they need money for more math.
*  Like that's already illegal.
*  You're not supposed to do that.
*  Exactly.
*  And the problem with drugs being illegal is the same problem they have with prohibition during the you know, the 19 whatever it was,
*  30s in this country.
*  What year was it when alcohol?
*  What year?
*  The exact year was like seven or eight years.
*  Right.
*  Where alcohol was illegal.
*  I think it was in the 20s.
*  Mostly.
*  But what year did it end?
*  It ended a couple of years before they made marijuana illegal, which is hilarious because it's a complete shift.
*  Yeah.
*  Literally took the people that were chasing alcohol.
*  They chased him after marijuana.
*  1920.
*  So 13 years.
*  Yeah, that's nuts.
*  13 years.
*  But people were still boozing.
*  Of course.
*  They're just dying.
*  But it also, my point was that it pumped up organized crime.
*  And that's where Al Capone got rich and all these people got rich.
*  They're bootleggers, moonshiners.
*  Well, that's the that's where NASCAR comes from.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the main reason why a lot of people point to, you know, look at this place where it was decriminalized.
*  It didn't work.
*  It's like, well, that's decriminalized, not legalized.
*  A and you don't have to have all these other things too.
*  But a lot of the places, look, it didn't work in Portland with the decriminalized because Portland was already in a fucked up
*  shit. A lot of it.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  Portland needed rule.
*  They needed Jesus.
*  Jesus should have come to Portland and sorted that place out.
*  But instead they got like, just do whatever you want, man.
*  And then, of course, they're already addicted to drugs.
*  So they're just going to do more drugs.
*  But if you look at what they did with Portugal, that had a profound effect.
*  You look at there's countries that have decriminalized drugs and it's been very beneficial.
*  But you're always still buying them from criminals because even when it's decriminalized, it's not legal to sell them and profit from them.
*  But it is legal to sell Adderall.
*  And it's like we're in a screwball, fucked up world where we have things that we've accepted as being OK just because they're grandfathered in.
*  It's so fucked up.
*  And then other things like weed, which is the best example, but other things like psychedelics.
*  So many benefits to psychedelics and also just so many comparative to alcohol and what that does to people versus not really benefits, if any.
*  But you can be like, hey, I get fucked up and drink whenever.
*  It's everywhere.
*  It's all fine everywhere.
*  But psychedelics, you can go to jail.
*  It's all dumb and it doesn't make any sense if you don't want to prop up the organized crime, because there's a reason why the cartel is worth billions and billions and billions of dollars.
*  It's because of us, because we have drugs.
*  They're illegal and they bring the drugs over and sell it to us.
*  And that's how they make money.
*  Absolutely.
*  If you don't want to fix that, just say it.
*  Just say it.
*  Because if you want to fix it, there's only one way to do it.
*  And the one way to do it is to regulate it in-house.
*  Like make it make it in America, regulate it in America and then use a responsible portion of that for treatment.
*  A lot of that treatment, which should include psychedelics.
*  So if you want to make things legal and then set up Ibogaine clinics everywhere, I bet you would get a lot of clean people that would ordinarily have a problem.
*  But I bet Kat would still be taking nicotine and doing speed.
*  I still like nicotine amphetamines, but I think especially with with, you know, with veterans mental health, but just really for anybody who wants to do it, even for fun, I think it should be allowed.
*  But I mean, in terms of violent crime, there's a lot of people that have had profound release and just something that allows them to move on past the death of a loved one.
*  There's certain people that get devastated by things and psychedelics have helped them in tremendous ways.
*  And they just denied the FDA just denied, you know, MAPS has run this long term study on MDMA.
*  And now they have to go through more studies.
*  And it's very unfortunate because people have benefited tremendously from that kind of therapy.
*  Yeah. And I mean, if you look at with veterans, it's like you send them over to these wars and, you know, a lot of people don't come back normal from that.
*  How could you expect them to come back?
*  And people love to say, support the troops, support the troops.
*  They don't think about what that really means.
*  And it's because it can look a little uglier, a little more complicated than just, you know, saying that or wearing like a flag pin on your suit.
*  And I think in general, when it comes to mental health, we've never like talked about mental health more.
*  But people are struggling because we have such little leeway for people who are going through a mental health crisis.
*  If you make a mistake, that mistake defines you.
*  Well, there's not just that.
*  There's so limited resources in terms of how to deal with your mental health problem.
*  If you're not allowing people to use psychedelics and you're deciding and most of the people that are deciding are also people that haven't experienced psychedelics.
*  Right.
*  Which is really crazy.
*  Yes.
*  It's really crazy.
*  Well, that's the government.
*  They're legislating things they don't understand.
*  Like literally.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially in this regard.
*  Absolutely.
*  I completely agree.
*  If you really wanted to help the troops, you would give them access to that stuff because there's been a lot of people that have had.
*  Tremendous results.
*  It's not saying it's going to work for everybody.
*  It's not a cure all.
*  It's not a panacea, but it's a tool.
*  It's a tool in the toolbox and we need a lot of tools.
*  There's a lot of people out there that are hurting.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Help them.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I mean, a huge, huge supporter of that.
*  The world would be a better place.
*  It's crazy that we still have to argue about this in 2024.
*  I know.
*  With all the information that we have now on the internet and all the people that have had to go to Costa Rica and have these retreats and come back and be cured of opiate addiction and all these problems that they've had.
*  And we're still like, more tests.
*  Yeah.
*  More tests.
*  But here's some fentanyl.
*  More tests.
*  Yeah.
*  But here, take your oxys.
*  More tests.
*  But you need speed.
*  You should be able to make that choice.
*  And I mean, psychedelics are just a huge, huge, huge benefit.
*  I mean, I'm a huge believer in that, actually.
*  Well, I'm a believer in freedom.
*  Yes.
*  I'm a big believer in a person, a human being should not be able to tell another human being what they can and cannot do with their life and their body if it doesn't hurt anybody else.
*  Exactly.
*  And in my mind, psychedelics fall into that area.
*  And if there's no benefit, no objective benefit, then why are all these people enthusiasts?
*  Why are all these people doing it?
*  Why are all these people talking about profound experiences and how much it's benefited them?
*  And the people that are saying that you can't do it, have you done it?
*  Do you know what the fuck you're talking about?
*  And if you don't, probably you shouldn't be the one deciding on this.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  You should let people decide.
*  The more freedom you have, the better it is for everybody.
*  But, you know, they're worried about the whole system getting like 1960 again.
*  You know, like tune in, turn on, drop out, all that crazy shit that was going on when people became flower children.
*  Yes, but also so what?
*  Yeah.
*  But is that is homelessness better?
*  If you had a hundred thousand hippies in L.A.
*  just like selling flowers in the street, would that be worse?
*  Yeah, I think that psychedelics, I mean, psychedelics, I think can be beneficial for people who have trauma, but also for just anybody.
*  If you want to be able to experience that, then you should be free to experience that.
*  Yeah. And if it was legal, you'd be able to find out who can and cannot take it.
*  Yes.
*  Because there's some people they got a screw loose and something goes, har har.
*  And, you know, they eat mushrooms and also they think they can fly.
*  Like people get a little nutty and certain people don't come back.
*  Especially acid. I've heard some acid stories.
*  Yeah.
*  Didn't come back.
*  Yeah. But I mean, of course, but you hear stories about everything.
*  But you don't know until you run studies until you when things are legal and you allow people to run these studies and you come up with effective dosages.
*  You find out what people are allergic to, what's this chemical reaction that people have, maybe certain medications that you shouldn't cross with it.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah, like it'd be to your point.
*  It's like you've never heard a story about someone doing alcohol and it going badly or someone doing pharmaceuticals.
*  And it going badly if you want.
*  I mean, I think that I mean, what a huge tool to be able to diminish the ego in a person.
*  And what an amazing life changing thing that can be.
*  And to say you can't do that because I said so is crazy to an adult.
*  To an adult.
*  And the person is telling you is uninformed.
*  They've never tried it.
*  They don't know what they're talking about.
*  And there's no real there's no real rational.
*  If you if you could just have a conversation with the person, not like a debate, not in front of Congress like this, just you and me for hours.
*  Let's just sit down for hours and you tell me why you think that psychedelics should be prohibited for all adults.
*  You tell me why.
*  And I'm going to tell you why I think they should.
*  I'm going to ask you some questions.
*  Well, what do you think they do?
*  And then you would get a sense over the course of a couple of hours to talk to this person.
*  This person has no fucking business telling people what they can and can't take.
*  They're just bureaucrats.
*  They're just bureaucrats and they know that there's a certain there's a certain amount of people that are going to it's going to benefit them to vote in a certain way and state a certain opinion.
*  And there's a certain amount of vested interests, a certain amount of special interest groups that would like them to continue to vote in a very specific way.
*  And that's that's their God.
*  That's who they that's who they go with.
*  Yeah.
*  It's nothing to do with what's good for everybody.
*  No, no.
*  And people just it's they just have this framework of like, well, that's that's a crazy thing.
*  That's bad.
*  Drugs are bad.
*  Those are bad.
*  I can't.
*  That's crazy.
*  Can't do that.
*  And then people who have had experience with them might feel differently, but that doesn't matter.
*  It's a sign of a six aside because then the people who have experience with them are people who do drugs.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  And those people never want to be president.
*  Isn't it ironic?
*  You'd want the president to like to do something.
*  A little bit.
*  Some sort of a psychedelic experience one time to just connect with God real quick.
*  Come back and go, OK, yeah, I think we could do better.
*  You know, I think it would be better if more politicians did mushrooms.
*  It probably would.
*  But they probably get less politicians.
*  They'd probably just quit.
*  They'd be like, I don't want to do this job.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I mean, to be to be able to person who could just gaslight 250 million people on a regular basis, like you have to be out of your mind.
*  Like you have to be really a crazy person to stand in front of people and lie about the economy and lie about job numbers and lie about this and lie about that.
*  Like that's the most unsycadelic perspective ever.
*  Yeah, it really is.
*  What's the worst?
*  What's the most unsycadelic job?
*  I would say White House press secretary.
*  Yeah.
*  You're a professional bullshit.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  You're just soothing everything over and making everything seem normal and making it seem like they've done an amazing job and everything's under control.
*  For the sake of just upholding the system.
*  And it's just psychedelics make you think, you know, they make you realize also that you're going to die in a good way.
*  Right.
*  Because the things you worry about in your life feel a little bit less ridiculous when you are more familiar with your mortality.
*  Like, oh, we're kind of just all here.
*  We're all people.
*  And we're you're able to do things to your consciousness to see things differently.
*  So that that just makes you view things differently.
*  And I think that what's healthier than that?
*  And like you said, it's not for everybody.
*  There's people who definitely they can't do it.
*  Things can go badly.
*  Regular life is too fucked for them.
*  There's people that regular reality is too slippery.
*  They shouldn't be doing anything.
*  Those people need some other kind of help.
*  And I don't know what that help is.
*  I'm not a psychiatrist, but I do know that for a lot of people, they're beneficial.
*  I know a lot of people shouldn't drink.
*  But yet alcohol is legal.
*  And you know, and all these things are things that we need to learn.
*  And the only way we learn them is if we have access to them.
*  We know what the real benefits actually are and what the real risks actually are.
*  We know what the real risks of Jack Daniels are.
*  It's like there's a long history of people drinking themselves to death.
*  To death. Yeah.
*  And not only that, but killing other people.
*  Oh, yeah. Like getting behind the wheel, driving.
*  But also getting violence.
*  Oh, yeah. Getting.
*  I mean, just alcohol.
*  Just getting beat up in the street because you're fucking drunk and you mouth off to somebody.
*  Now you're in the hospital with a broken skull.
*  Like, there's so many detrimental side effects to alcohol.
*  But yeah, no one is saying we should make alcohol illegal.
*  No. Could you imagine if that was their next pitch?
*  Yeah. Prohibition.
*  We need to bring it back.
*  Are you talking about?
*  But if they say it with weed, everybody's like, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That's the way safer drug.
*  Yeah. It's way safer.
*  Yeah. Way safer.
*  Way. It makes everybody a lot more peaceful.
*  It's way less violent.
*  You also don't hear people waxing poetic.
*  I mean, myself included.
*  I'm not going to sit here and be like, well, what alcohol can do is all these real.
*  I mean, can it be fun to get drunk sometimes?
*  Yeah, I guess.
*  But it's like the next day I'm never like, man, I'm so glad that I drank all that booze.
*  They really just opened my eyes to the.
*  No, it's no.
*  Alcohol is the perfect example of no biological free lunch.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Rush that fun time you feel when you're lit like, whoa, you saw them.
*  I'm sorry. Yeah.
*  And everybody's like, yeah.
*  Yeah. The next day you go.
*  The sun is killing my fucking head.
*  Oh, for me, it's the emotional like everybody hates me.
*  Everybody. It's the opposite of what psychedelics can do.
*  You're like, it gives you some perspective on the world and your place in the world.
*  And then alcohol puts the next morning.
*  It's the opposite of that.
*  It's like everyone.
*  The world revolves around how mad it all is at me.
*  Right. You know, like, what did I do?
*  What did I do?
*  You think about some loud, stupid shit you said?
*  Oh, I'm like, why did I do that?
*  And then I will text the texting.
*  I'm like, what did I say?
*  And then you think and then I think that I am going to be deposed in a court for some shit.
*  And all these messages are going to be a shit that I was saying when I was like, to me,
*  it's pretty clear which one.
*  But there's only one of them that I could go to jail for doing.
*  Right. It's not it's not.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  It's also been here before people.
*  Yeah. Like, what are we doing making nature illegal?
*  It's so stupid.
*  The whole thing is stupid.
*  It's just and it's stupid.
*  And the fact that we still allow it is so crazy.
*  And no one's it would have it sounds trivial to people that don't do it.
*  Right. But if you allowed people control of their consciousness and to have
*  consciousness and to have these kind of experiences, you would have a lot more
*  people that are thinking about things and a lot more considerate and careful way.
*  And that's what I think the benefit of it is.
*  Yeah. Even if it's not maybe you're really not contacting God or aliens.
*  Whatever it is. But just the benefits of having it.
*  But I think there's a lot of things that can make people more kind and considerate,
*  like in a very counterintuitive way.
*  I think martial arts do jujitsu, especially.
*  They're the nicest people I've ever met.
*  Well, you have friends from jujitsu are the nicest fucking people
*  because every day they're trying to kill each other.
*  And they don't have any of that in regular life.
*  There's no chest puffing.
*  There's no douchebaggery.
*  Like people that are like the guys that I know that train three, four times a week
*  and are really interested in jujitsu, doing it all the time.
*  There's some of the most peaceful, calm, easygoing,
*  measured, even when they talk to people in confrontations, very measured
*  because they're coming from a place of strength.
*  And most men in particular, they come from a place of trying to pretend
*  they have strength in order to like intimidate you to get up, to get out,
*  like get you on your back foot, get you on the heels.
*  Fuck you, man.
*  Like that kind of douchey kind of shit is just insecurity.
*  Yeah, these guys don't have any of that.
*  And it's just a healthier like I don't think everybody should do jujitsu.
*  It's too hard. Don't do it if you don't.
*  Probably not for me.
*  But I think there's a lot of things like that in this world.
*  I don't think it's just psychedelics.
*  I think there's multiple.
*  I think yoga plays a big factor in that.
*  I remember I got in a car accident when I was on yoga, when I was on yoga.
*  I was like, we're on yoga.
*  I haven't heard of that one.
*  We were doing yoga so much.
*  Me and Ari Shafir, Bert Kreischer and Tom Segura, we do the Sober October.
*  And every time we do Sober October, we have these things that we do
*  where we're like, well, the fitness challenge or you have to do.
*  I think we had 15 yoga classes in the month.
*  So you had to do like a yoga class every other day for a month.
*  And I got really into it.
*  I was doing it a lot.
*  And this guy rear ended me on the highway and I had a really nice car.
*  And he crashed into me and he was on his phone.
*  He was texting and he was illegal.
*  And he didn't have a driver's license.
*  Oh, shit. What a mess.
*  And I was so calm about it.
*  I was like, OK, I was like, I'm OK. You OK?
*  And it's like, I'm just going to take off.
*  You know, I'm just going to get my car fixed.
*  I just took off.
*  Luckily, he didn't wreck my car.
*  He just bent the back.
*  It was a Porsche. It was a 911 GT3, a very nice car.
*  But his car, a little bullshit car, like a little Honda Accord.
*  And when he slammed on the brakes, it basically went under the back of my car
*  and bumped it up in the air and it stalled out.
*  And his car was pretty fucked up.
*  He couldn't drive off, but I could drive off.
*  So I just drove to the comedy store.
*  Yeah. And I was like, OK, why was I so calm about that?
*  I wasn't even mad at that guy.
*  I was like, he's an illegal alien.
*  Excuse me, immigrant, undocumented minor, whatever he is, undocumented immigrant.
*  Just some dude who came from Mexico.
*  His day is a tough day.
*  I said, why don't you have a license?
*  I go, he goes, I can't because I'm illegal.
*  I said, OK.
*  I go, but yet you still drive.
*  And he goes, I have to for work.
*  I go, I get it. I get it.
*  But it was like a very calm.
*  He said he was sorry. I believed him.
*  It was just a mistake.
*  He fucked up. Traffic could slow, you know, L.A.
*  traffic like all of a sudden comes to a screeching halt.
*  And sometimes people aren't ready for it.
*  And I really think it was yoga.
*  I think I didn't even get mad at the guy.
*  All right. Take it easy.
*  I just drove away.
*  I drove away and I thought about it afterwards.
*  I was like, why can't it be like that with everything?
*  Like, why?
*  Like, what would help me be like that in every situation to treat every
*  interaction with people like as as calm as possible
*  and never, never really get totally upset by anything?
*  Just it is what it is. No big deal.
*  And I was like, man, that's probably a great tool just for society.
*  Just if most people, if yoga was a thing that most people did every day
*  in the morning, what impact would that have just in the overall population?
*  How nice people are to each other.
*  It would probably be huge.
*  Probably be huge.
*  Yeah, I've never I was raised in a household where yoga was the devil.
*  Really? Yeah. The devil.
*  My mom was really Catholic.
*  Oh, so like it's a bad.
*  I mean, I'm not I don't know if that's obvious.
*  Stretching that I'm not Catholic.
*  I know, but exactly. Yeah.
*  But there's something I don't know.
*  I I I I I never got into it.
*  For Jesus. Yeah.
*  Come on in. Someone do yoga.
*  Just take the poses and Bible verses.
*  Yeah, I don't know. Some prayers, you know, I am not.
*  I am not Catholic.
*  I'm not religious at all anymore, which is why I think that
*  I'm always looking for things like I'm always looking for a way to be religious
*  or in some sense, spiritual, which I've never done.
*  Ayahuasca, I really want to do Ayahuasca.
*  I've done other things that have been beneficial to me,
*  but I'm searching for that thing.
*  I'm searching for that.
*  I want to believe in something greater than myself.
*  I think that's normal for people. Right.
*  And I think that's why a lot of atheists, they talk like religious people.
*  They talk about atheism the same way religious people talk about their belief
*  in God that they absolutely know it's true.
*  It's kind of the same thing.
*  There's nothing I do not believe in.
*  See, I'm not that. There's God.
*  I'm not that. Yeah.
*  I'm just agnostic.
*  I'm kind of like, who am I to say what there is and isn't?
*  Yeah, I can appreciate that.
*  I think there's something going on. Yeah.
*  I think there's something going on that we're a part of that is too big
*  for us to grasp. Yeah.
*  I think we're like a hand waving over a fucking earthworm.
*  And earthworm has no idea what's going on because I think it's too big.
*  I think just the idea of this
*  infinite space that we live in with who knows how many galaxies.
*  And we're on this planet and we're making babies
*  and you're cooking one up inside your body right now.
*  And you're going on stage doing stand up and we're having an election.
*  And we might have a nuclear war.
*  And all this shit is happening all throughout the universe, all over the place,
*  not just here, but probably in an infinite number of planets everywhere.
*  The whole thing's too big.
*  And for you to say there's no God, God's not real.
*  It's like you have no idea.
*  You have no idea.
*  By the way, the evidence of there being something
*  that's a that's forcing this in a general direction is overwhelming.
*  There's something that's whether it's some natural properties
*  like Brett Weinstein calls it Darwinian evolution, that it applies to everything
*  and things get better and improve and evolve that.
*  Yeah. But what is causing that?
*  And what made that?
*  What is what is the overall force behind this whole thing?
*  And what's its goal?
*  What's it? It seems to be moving in a general direction all the time.
*  And that that direction is like constant improvement of life forms,
*  of societies, of technology.
*  It's moving in this fucking direction.
*  Like, how do you know it's not God?
*  How do you know it's not the way God works?
*  How do you know the universe isn't God?
*  And this is the way it expresses itself.
*  Yeah. The craziest.
*  This is the most normal thing to do is get pregnant.
*  But it's the craziest trip I've ever had.
*  Like, all I did was have sex.
*  I didn't pick up a license.
*  And now there's going to be a baby in my apartment.
*  Wait till you start talking to that baby.
*  That's what's going to be crazy.
*  This is going to be a human that's going to have opinions
*  and it's going to tell me no.
*  Yeah. I didn't smoke any fucking six.
*  I smoke no cigs.
*  And now you're trying to tell me, no, I'm going to be like,
*  I should have smoked a pack a day with your ass talking to me like that.
*  Yeah. But then they'll say, look, I didn't ask to be born.
*  Yeah, exactly. They're going to find.
*  Why did you make me? Stupid bitch.
*  You fucking did this. It's your fault.
*  No matter what, the kid's going to find a way to hate you. Right.
*  Like that's going to find a way to I don't I don't know.
*  But it's it's the craziest.
*  It's the craziest trip.
*  And I think it's also that's part of it.
*  I'm always like looking for.
*  I'm just like looking for meaning.
*  I want there to be something so badly. Right.
*  And that's and I think I think we all do. I really do.
*  Well, I think that's why people like psychedelics.
*  I think that's why I mean, it definitely can make you view the world in a different way.
*  And then compared to all the other.
*  I mean, the worst drug I ever did was Accutane.
*  Oh, it made me want to kill myself. Yeah.
*  This was last summer.
*  I mean, I actually was suicidal.
*  Like I went off of multiple people in my life had that same same situation.
*  The way more dangerous drug for me than shrooms.
*  Accutane. Yeah.
*  Andrew Santino, the hilarious comedian, talks about it.
*  He said it was one of the worst experiences. Really? Yeah. Me too.
*  Yeah. My brain, I was finally decided
*  I was crying on the bathroom floor because I was going to die and everyone I know is going to die.
*  Oh, my God. And again, always been true.
*  Always been true. My husband found me on the bathroom floor.
*  And I stopped taking it about a month before it worked out of my system.
*  And then I went back to normal.
*  But at that time, I was like, I've lost myself.
*  I'm never going to be myself again.
*  Whenever you have a medication and one of the side effects is suicidal.
*  I know those those ones freak me out because they'll just say it real, real.
*  Yeah. These people are holding hands and spinning around in a wheat field.
*  Suicidal ideation. What? Yeah.
*  I experienced that.
*  I experienced my brain being hijacked in a bad way by a drug for for zits.
*  I was like, I'll just and I was, you know, you can't drink on it.
*  So I was like, I was having these extreme reactions.
*  Stone cold sober.
*  But I was on the show sometimes that I would be so depressed
*  and people would be email.
*  I'm getting emails like you were like acting like a bitch or this and that.
*  And it's like, no, no, no. You know, I want to kill myself.
*  I don't think I'm too good for people. I want to kill myself.
*  And it's just scary. It was very scary.
*  Well, I'm glad you got off it.
*  Yes, I'm off. That one I'm never doing again.
*  Yeah, that one's catchy.
*  Listen, Kat, I really enjoyed talking to you.
*  I really enjoyed talking to you, too. Let's do this again.
*  Yeah. Tell everybody about your book one more time, please.
*  It's called I used a copy of it here.
*  I have it outside. I left all my shit outside.
*  No worries. It's called I used to like you until it's called.
*  I used to like you until
*  and it is all about how one single thing should not be enough to write.
*  Another person off. It's about independent thinking.
*  It's about connection.
*  And I spill a lot of tea on myself in the book because so the point I'm naked
*  on the cover, my body looks nothing like this anymore, but covered in hate mail
*  with the idea of like vulnerability in the face of overwhelming hatred.
*  That's great. So I, you know, I had the idea of and you read it, too.
*  I did read the audiobook. Fantastic.
*  Thank you. You did that.
*  Yeah, you have to.
*  I have a very distinctive voice.
*  Also, it's like, God, it's not that hard, folks.
*  Do it. I'm talking about a lot of very personal things in the book.
*  I want to know.
*  No, I'm talking about a man.
*  She gets some old man to do a British guy.
*  Our first period.
*  Don't worry. That's not in the book.
*  Well, thank you.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  It was a lot of fun. Thank you very much.
*  OK, bye, everybody.
