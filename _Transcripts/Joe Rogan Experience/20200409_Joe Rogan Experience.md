# Joe Rogan Experience #1456 - Michael Shermer
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 09, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiTI5LrCSA)
*  Okay, here we go. Three, two, one, boom, and we're live. Mr. Schirmer, how are you, sir?
*  I'm fine, thank you. I'm still breathing.
*  It's good to see you again. We were just saying before we got started that the last time we
*  saw each other was we went to dinner about six weeks ago, and you're thinking that that
*  might be the end of that kind of stuff.
*  That was my last time I've been in a restaurant, actually. I think restaurants, of course,
*  will reopen, but I think the kind of social distancing we're seeing now, it's not going
*  to go all the way back to the way it used to be. I think we may quit shaking hands and
*  hugging to the extent that we used to, although I don't think we'll ever go all the way to
*  the Japanese model of social distancing. I think there'll be modifications like that.
*  The other thing I've been thinking about is the change of remote meetings and education.
*  I'm in the studio here in Santa Barbara where I've been recording lectures for my Chapman
*  University class, Skepticism 101. I just upload them and share them with the students, and
*  then they watch them, and then I send them a quiz. They take the quiz, they send them
*  back. Now, that's not a complete replacement of a brick and mortar building with a small
*  class seminar discussion, say, but it does adequately replace a lot of traditional education
*  that you don't really need to be in a classroom for.
*  Do you think that this is preparing us for the ultimate, where we embrace the symbiotic
*  relationship that we have with computers and become one with the machine?
*  I mean, it seems like we're becoming closer and closer to some sort of an electronic community.
*  It's weird.
*  I think it was happening slowly already, and this is kind of a jumpstarting. I mean, already
*  tech companies like Zoom are having to ramp up their game because the systems are crashing
*  because pretty much everybody's doing Zoom meetings now. Then they have to adjust to
*  Zoom bombing because, of course, there's people like that out there that just want to screw
*  with you.
*  Then I was also thinking about things like theaters. Why do we need to go to theaters
*  anymore? I mean, I love watching a movie on a big screen, but the screens we have at
*  home now, big television screens, super high def, why not just watch movies at home?
*  Well, I don't think we're going to have much of a choice. I was reading an article this
*  morning about AMC theaters. They might have to go under because of this.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, it's not good. I mean, you got to think these companies are accustomed to having a
*  certain amount of money come in every month, and they never, no one anticipated anything
*  like this, where all businesses are just going to shut down. Gyms, I mean, how many gyms
*  are going to go under? How many yoga studios? I mean, it's a strange and trying time for
*  people who have small businesses, for sure.
*  Yeah, one of my cycling buddies owns the La Cunha theater complex and, of course, rents
*  out the space to different retailers, including the theater managers. Anyway, he was telling
*  me that they normally pay $93,000 a month in rent, but they bring in like $7.5 million
*  a year or something, so it all balances out. But they just told him, we're not going to
*  make our rent this month, so he has to go to his mortgage company, the bank, where he
*  pays off his mortgage and says, I can't pay you this month because these guys can't pay
*  me. Okay, so multiply that by $10 million or $100 million or something, and that's kind
*  of what we've been going through.
*  Yeah, and I don't really understand the economics of the stimulus package, of how they're going
*  to be able to distribute it and sort of balance people out. It seems like it's just a small
*  bandaid on a very large wound.
*  Yeah, well, of course, the government can't just print money indefinitely. Then we're
*  going to get huge inflation, and that could be catastrophic. So this conversation that
*  people have been wanting to have, but they get hammered every time they bring it up,
*  I think at some point we're going to have to have in the next few weeks, is the economic
*  and costs to people's lives compared to what we're doing with social isolation to save
*  people's lives. And at the moment, we're in the mode of there's no dollar amount you can
*  put on a human life. Therefore, total social isolation, no matter what it does to the economy,
*  is what we're going to do now.
*  Well, but at some point, there's an economic calculation, like how many people are going
*  to die, say, in the next year if we never open the economy? Of course, we will. But
*  at what point do you do that? The supply chain dries up, you can't get not just toilet paper,
*  but food supplies start to dry up, and then you get social unrest. There's risks there
*  too. And the idea of putting a dollar figure on a human life is repulsive to most of us,
*  I think intuitively, in this context. But in fact, we do it all the time. In terms of
*  an automobile company has to pay off the family of somebody who died in their car, well, there
*  are people who do those calculations. Like what's the value of a human life? And the
*  figure is, well, the high end figure is about $10 million. After 9-11, the families got
*  paid off, I think it was $250,000 a person times the 3,000 something. And so it sounds
*  so cold, like who does those calculations? Well, statisticians do that sort of thing,
*  and attorneys and accountants work on that, and judges and juries have to face it. And
*  that's kind of a normal part of other aspects of life that we're not used to thinking about.
*  Most of us don't think about it. But at some point, that's the kind of calculation we're
*  going to have to do for what we're in now. Do you think that there is another way to
*  do this? There's been some talk of isolating the people that are high risk, isolating the
*  people with underlying conditions, people that are elderly, things of that nature. Do
*  you think that that's a way that they can move forward?
*  Yeah, for sure. But again, we have this egalitarian mode, that doesn't sound right. It sounds
*  like a death panel. Some group of government agents are going to tell us who's going to
*  live and who's going to die, and that feels like we're sliding into conspiracy-mongering.
*  But in fact, that is what you have to do, is a kind of a triage. And South Korea has
*  been pretty good about this. Testing everybody, they jumped on it right away. They did that
*  track and trace. They got it right down to, I think it was the 31st patient they found
*  who had gone to two church services, and then she was in a car accident and taken to the
*  hospital. And that's when it spread from there. That one day, I think it was in late February
*  when that happened, and they just jumped all over it. Total deaths in South Korea, I think
*  is just a couple hundred compared to most other countries.
*  That's pretty impressive.
*  It is, and they've been super careful about isolating people and targeting the people
*  that most need the tests and so on. That's just the kind of thing I think we have to
*  do.
*  What do you think about what's going on in Germany? Because Germany is very fascinating,
*  right? I mean, so many of these European countries, particularly Italy, are experiencing this
*  very high death rate. But Germany, they must have exemplary healthcare. They must be doing
*  something right, or be robust and healthy individuals. Is it a genetic thing, you think?
*  Is it a healthcare thing? Because they have a very low death rate.
*  I think they have a high, tight culture, a very tight culture. That is when, my wife
*  is from Cologne, Germany, so I know this from personal experience, but also there are studies.
*  Michelle Gelfand does these studies on loose and tight cultures, and that Germany is a
*  very tight culture. That is to say, very law and order, law abiding, and when the German
*  government says, all right, this is what we're going to do, people do it. Americans
*  are not that. We're a much looser culture, more freedom oriented. If the government says,
*  you can't go to the beach, well, the hell with it. I'm going to the beach anyway. Germans
*  don't do that.
*  They do have a really good healthcare system, and they jump right on it. I think that's
*  one explanation. We've seen yesterday this rise in deaths of African Americans versus
*  Native Americans, and having to do with income, but of course, money is just a proxy for something
*  else, which has to do with the quality of the healthcare they get, the food that they
*  eat, how healthy and exercise prone they are, or not, diabetes, obesity, these sorts of
*  things. Down the line, when you're attacked by a virus like that, can have an effect on
*  your immune system, and therefore the response to the disease. I think those are the kinds
*  of cohorts we're going to have to target to save lives. I think countries like South
*  Korea and Germany have been doing that pretty well without pushback.
*  Yeah, I'm hoping. My best hope out of this is that it's a wake up call for people that
*  don't take care of their bodies. People that get through this, you dodge the bullet, now
*  let's clean that diet up, let's get you moving, let's start some exercise on a regular weekly
*  basis, get some nutrients into your system, eliminate all this sugar and bullshit that
*  people eat, and take care of your body, take care of your immune system, let's pump everything
*  back up to sustainable levels. That very well could be the difference between people who
*  contract this virus and survive versus people who contract this virus and don't.
*  Absolutely. How could it not hurt to be healthy, fit, and have a good immune system, even if
*  for some reason we can't find the exact connection to this particular virus, just as a global
*  thing, even if you do all that and it turns out there's no connection to this particular
*  virus, this is still a good thing to do.
*  You've been cycling, I know you're a cycler, and so you were actually riding your bike
*  today, right?
*  This morning, actually this is really funny, this kind of world we live in, there's no
*  more group rides of course, and all the big tours like the Tour de France have been cancelled.
*  So there I'm riding along this morning and I see up ahead of me TJ Van Garderen, who's
*  the top American pro right now, and apparently he lives over in the kind of Santa Ynez Valley
*  area and here he is cycling along in Santa Barbara by himself, so I'm chasing along to
*  see how long I can stay up with this guy. And of course he's much younger and faster
*  than me, but all of a sudden he just stops and he picks something up from the ground,
*  so I pull up and he holds up a $5 bill and he goes, look, I found five bucks. I'm like,
*  it's the little things in life, I'm just going to make your day. He was happy with the five
*  bucks and I got to say hi to the great TJ Van Garderen, so that was kind of funny.
*  That's awesome. I don't follow professional cycling, but I can understand your enthusiasm
*  if he's the top guy. That's pretty cool.
*  Yeah, it was. So I think just working out every day, I mean you mentioned every week,
*  I think people need to work out every day.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  And I find the more you work out, you don't have to eat as much because your body becomes
*  more efficient at processing fuel, so I have less desire to eat.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Not me, baby. When I work out, oh my God, I get so hungry. Yeah, I don't know.
*  I've been doing that, after you were promoting that, the daily fast, don't eat from dinner
*  time and I try to make it to like 11 or 12. And if I work out in the morning, if I go
*  for a couple hour bike ride, I can make it because you're doing something. You have to
*  be active because if you're sitting around, then you're going to get hungry.
*  I do that. Yeah, I do intermittent fasting. I try to do 16 hours. You know, the only time
*  I don't do that is when I have explosive work that I'm doing in the morning, like if I'm
*  doing Muay Thai or something like that that requires like a lot of it. Then I'll just
*  have a couple pieces of fruit, but I keep it pretty light. But other than that, I try
*  to do 16 hours. I do a 16 hour non-feeding phase and then just eat in the other time.
*  And your body gets accustomed to it. It's not hard. It's not hard to do because it becomes
*  normal.
*  The other thing I did that I've been recommending to people that are not into cycling or something
*  like that is I got these wrist and ankle weights just at the local sporting goods store, but
*  you can order them on Amazon. Just five pounds each wrist, five pounds each ankle and just
*  walk briskly. I just take my dog to the local park and we just go up this hill and down
*  up and down this hill with these weights and you don't have to run. You know, I know people
*  don't like running. I don't like running all that much. But with the weights, you get,
*  you know, extra upper body and it works the big muscles of your legs. You know, without
*  it, I know a lot of people hate running. So, you know, it's like, you don't have to run.
*  Just walk, get the heart rate up, work the big muscles and, you know, circulate the blood
*  and all the bodily fluids and so on. And that's just good for general health. And I do think
*  that has to help for response to the coronavirus. Again, these populations that are more targeted,
*  you know, there's a lot of obesity and diabetes and some of these other secondary, you know,
*  these preconditions as they call them. And, you know, there's this peculiar thing we're
*  all doing now. Like what I've done for years is you look in the obits and you see, okay,
*  well this guy, he was older than me or he had this or he had that doesn't apply to me.
*  You know, we all do that with the coronavirus. Okay. Oh, that person was older. They had
*  this precondition and so on. You're hoping that somehow I'm going to dodge this bullet
*  of that. It may not be, but it's all a game of probabilities of just stacking the odds
*  in our favor. You know, who knows if that'll make a difference for you or me personally,
*  but on average it's got to make a difference. This is a, it's such a strange virus, isn't
*  it? In terms of the way so many people are asymptomatic. Yeah. So I, this idea that it
*  came to America, what January 28th or something in Seattle, I have a feeling it's going to
*  turn out to have been earlier like in December. I was just reading this nature paper on the
*  origins of the virus. They were sort of debunking the myth that it was a creation of a bio weapons
*  lab in China. There is that conspiracy theory, which is not completely crazy because of course
*  there are, there are bio weapons labs that do this kind of stuff. There was that one
*  in Russia a few decades ago where they had a leakage. But it looked like I've read this
*  article twice. I don't understand it because this isn't what I do, but you know, they really
*  showed that it very, very likely made the leap from probably bats. You know, bats are
*  mammals. Bats are very respite respiratory. They're, they're very social. You know, there's
*  this cave in Texas where there's like 20 million bats that live in this cave. I mean, they're
*  just pressed in. It's like the same population of Mexico city and they come out at night
*  and so on. And you know, these wet markets in China, it's, it's not that wet markets
*  by themselves are bad, but you know, say you have dead fish, it's a wet market, but live
*  animals and particularly mammals like bats, then it's easy to make that leap. So, you
*  know, the coronavirus, it's, you know, it's a, it's a, they call it a novel coronavirus
*  for a reason. It's novel. You mean there's other coronaviruses around? Yeah. Common cold
*  is a coronavirus. And you know, so there's, I have a, I have a feeling, Joe, we're going
*  to have this virus with us permanently. I mean, this is what Fauci has been saying that
*  It's not going to just go away and then we're done. I think we're going to have probably
*  a mutated, a more modest strain of it forever. And we'll just have to get our flu shots for
*  that one every year and, and, you know, just kind of mitigate it that way.
*  Yeah. Have you been paying attention to this, these potential remedies like hydroxychloroquine
*  mixed with Z packs and zinc? What are your thoughts on that?
*  I took it for two days. Did you?
*  Yeah, I did. Yeah. Well, a couple, I don't know, maybe a month ago now, my doc, who's
*  also a good friend and a fellow cyclist, he's the guy that did my neck surgery. You know,
*  I had a fusion on my neck after I had a bad bike crash last year. And so he's a good friend.
*  And so he just texts me out of the blue and goes, Hey, have you heard about this hydroxychloroquine?
*  I'm no, I never heard of it. Oh yeah. The, you know, the malaria drug. Okay. All right.
*  So now he works at a big hospital in LA, Huntington hospital. And, you know, so I could, I can
*  understand why he, you know, was doing it as a precautionary thing, as a prophylactic
*  against it. And there's some evidence anecdotal, you know, but anyway, so I tried, he wrote
*  me a script and I tried it for two days. It's pretty toxic. You know, if you, if you follow
*  the, the prescription exactly, you know, the chances of having bad side effects are pretty
*  low. So when Trump says, you know, what have you got to lose? Of course, nothing's risk
*  the, the exact prescription, then the chances of having bad effects are pretty low. Unlike
*  that guy in Arizona that, that found it in his fish tank cleaner or he had some, it was
*  some fish anti-fungal chemical and he drank it and died. Okay. You know, you can't do
*  that kind of stuff, but that would apply to any kind of medication. Right. Anyway, so
*  I tried it for two days and I, you know, I didn't feel good. You know, I work out and
*  then I came back one day and my wife says, you know, you stink like a toxin, like, like
*  poison. I'm like, Ooh, okay. Yeah. I think that's not good. Well, you're not supposed
*  to take it unless you get in contact. Right. Or you think you could have been in contact.
*  Well, I, you know, I don't know. Um, again, it could be that lots of this, that's the
*  weird part, right? The, I don't know. The, I don't know. The, I don't know. The, that's
*  what keeps people up at night. You're lying in bed. You're like, what about that guy? He
*  was close to me. What about this? What about that? What if someone, someone at the grocery
*  stores got it and I touched the cart? Two of my cycling buddies had really bad colds in December,
*  dry cough, fever, you know, all the symptoms and they're now saying, huh, I wonder if I had it
*  in December. Yeah. And the reason this is important to know is because that would increase the size of
*  the denominator of the equation where you have the number of deaths divided by the number of people
*  that got it. And it's that bottom number. We just don't know because the testing has just been ramped
*  up. So there might be lots of people that had it in January and February and they got better. We,
*  we just don't know. Or they were symptom free and they didn't know they had it. Or maybe even
*  earlier, say December, that nature paper I referenced, they, they trace it back. I don't
*  know how they do this genetically with mutations or whatever, but to say mid November in China.
*  So, you know, people were coming from China to the United States and throughout November and December.
*  So it's entirely possible it's been here longer. And therefore the death rate is not nearly as
*  catastrophic as it seems like it could be. Is there a way to test whether or not you've had it
*  for antibodies? I think there's a test now. I don't think it's in the United States. Where was this?
*  Maybe it was, maybe it was South Korea, but just a pinprick. And they can tell if you've already had
*  it based on the antibodies in your blood that would only be there if you had the coronavirus.
*  I think it, I think it was South Korea that was doing that. And that absolutely has to be done
*  because we have to know what the number is. And, and also if you've had it and you have the
*  antibodies in your blood, then you can donate your blood and give it to somebody. And then that would
*  be something like a vaccine. Yeah, that's all very promising. You know, it's really interesting too,
*  because this has become such a hot political topic. You know, there's so many people that are angry
*  at Trump, but they were angry at Trump back when he was closing the travel from China, which turned
*  out to be a great idea. And, you know, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted today a compilation of CNN and
*  all these other different networks giving out bad information way back in January, bad information
*  saying, this is going to be fine. Don't worry. You know, it's not as deadly as the flu. You should
*  worry about the flu. You know, don't change your plans. Don't do anything. So a lot of people got
*  this wrong. And, but so many people are trying to make this a political point right now. And it's
*  really, it's so, so useless. It's, you know, pointing fingers and everything at this point in
*  time. It's like what they need to concentrate on now is just getting masks, getting PPE equipment,
*  keeping people healthy if they can, and then educating people on how to keep your immune
*  system strong. And let's, you know, let's try to, let's try to get people to understand the
*  consequences of not taking care of your body. This has to be the worst job in the world,
*  president. No matter what, no matter what you do, everyone's going to have the people are going to
*  hate you. Who would want that job? I don't know. Cause it doesn't even pay that well compared to
*  other professions at the top end of other professions. You know, there's a lot of articles
*  now about how autocrats around the world have been taken advantage of the, of the pandemic to
*  increase their power and civil liberties, you know, in Hungary and, and, and Turkey, even Israel,
*  China, of course, Putin and Russia and so on. And Trump usually gets lumped in there. Like
*  he's an autocrat like Oban and Erdogan and Netanyahu and so forth. Okay. So then,
*  so had he closed, let's say, do the counterfactual, let's say he closed the borders in
*  late January or early February or something like this. I mean, just, just, just clamp down on, on
*  all travel and so on. He would have been totally accused of being an autocrat. He's, you know,
*  he wants to be a dictator and look what he's doing. Okay. So he doesn't do that. And then he's
*  accused of, you know, not doing enough when it looks like we should have done more. And then,
*  you know, the other day when he said, well, I'm not gonna, I'm not going to tell all the
*  governors what to do. You know, I'm going to honor state's rights for now. And of course he
*  gets hammered for that. And it's like, but, you know, but that's actually, you know, that's not,
*  that's not what an autocrat would do. An autocrat would say, yeah, I'm telling everybody what to do.
*  Right. Exactly. So, you know, I think maybe we should, you know, drop all the polarization
*  politically rally around the president, even if you hate him. Just look what happened after 9 11.
*  You know, I mean, Bush was pretty hated by the left and, and most liberals came around and said,
*  all right, you know what, we're going to support this guy at least for a few months until, you
*  know, we figure out what's going on here. And most of the liberal democratic congressmen and
*  senators voted for the war and, you know, for the invasion of Afghanistan and including Iraq,
*  including Hillary. Right. So, you know, maybe we ought to do that. I know people just can't stand
*  Trump and just the idea like saying something nice or supportive or not being critical seems
*  hard to do, but maybe this is way worse than 9 11. Yeah. And it, it's, it, you're, what you're
*  saying is totally correct. It's, it seems like the polarization is even worse though than when it was
*  2001. It seems like it just keeps ramping up and Trump is such a naturally polarizing figure that
*  it's gotten, you know, the, the left versus right has gotten so extreme right now. It's almost
*  impossible for rational discourse. And this is one of the reasons why it's a good time now to talk
*  about your book, given the devil is due. I was just showing this graph of the people that self
*  identify as centrist versus now, which is more polarized. You have this two hump camel here,
*  and that's from 2000, 1994, 2004. And then close to today, when did that shift? Is that a Trump
*  shift that little dip in the middle about 2000? Well, really under Obama, about 2008, the
*  polarization got worse and worse. I mean, we can speculate why, but that's pretty much when it
*  happened around 2004, 2005, and it gets ramped up. So just pollsters asking people, you know,
*  how do you self identify, you know, centrist far left, far right, you know, strong Republican,
*  strong Democrat, whatever. And so that, that middle ground has been, has been shrinking,
*  the centers have been shrinking and the polls have been increasing. So more and more people
*  are polarized now, you know, conservative talk radio and television or, you know, MSNBC, you know,
*  whatever you want to accuse the media. But in general, I think we've just been more polarized
*  in the sense of not just saying, well, I disagree with you. I think you're wrong,
*  but that you're evil. You're immoral. You know, this is, you know, the worst thing that's ever
*  happened to us and so on. This kind of ramping up of the cat catastrophism, you know, is not healthy.
*  No, no, it's not. You know, another thing I wanted to talk to you about, Michael, is there's an
*  article today in the Atlantic, which is really interesting. It's about technology. It's
*  contact tracking technology. And this, there's a real concern about this stuff. First of all,
*  the idea is great that if you, that this could free America from quarantine. So this is always
*  the risk, right? The risk is just give up a little bit of your civil liberties, give up a little bit
*  of your freedom, and we're going to keep you safe. And, you know, it brings you to the old Benjamin
*  Franklin quote, you know, he who would give up liberty for freedom deserves neither,
*  neither liberty for safety. I'm sure I fucked up that quote, but this technology is very interesting
*  because they're using it in South Korea and they're using it in Singapore. And I, I, the title of the
*  article in the Atlantic is the technology that could free America from quarantine. And it's out
*  today. And they bring up this conundrum. I mean, nobody wants to give up civil liberties and civil
*  liberties lost or rarely regained. And this is the real concern here that if you do allow people to
*  track who you're in contact with and make sure that, okay, you're testing negative and you're
*  in contact with people that also test negative. So you're okay. You're okay to travel now. Like
*  this is, you know, this is a very weird thing and it gets us into very gray area. How do you feel
*  about this? I feel about it this way. I, I'm in general, I'm against that sort of thing. I like
*  the idea of privacy and that I do have a right to not be tracked. And, you know, you can't have
*  cameras in my home or my yard and so on. In general, I think across the board, that's a good
*  principle. And it follows the constitution. I think there are times, say national emergency like
*  this, of course, there's always the risk that, you know, any autocrat can declare a national
*  emergency, grab the power, never give it back. And I mentioned examples of this before in Turkey,
*  say. But the difference here, I think, is, you know, we do have a constitution, we do have state's
*  rights, we do have courts that litigate these sorts of things. I could see a reasonable measure
*  being taken for, let's say, we're going to do the following for six months until we see what happens
*  with this pandemic. And then once that's over, then we're going to revert back. Now, let's say the
*  governor or the president says, well, I'm not going back. Well, then you have courts, then we, and you
*  sue the state or you sue the federal government for violations of civil liberties, and then you
*  can get them back. Right. But that's never happened. We've never gotten back. What happened with the NSA
*  when Edward Snowden revealed how much tracking is actually going on? I mean, that's never been
*  reversed. I know, I know. Yeah, I know. It was very, I watched that show when you had them on and,
*  and oh boy, that was pretty disturbing. Very disturbing. And what was also disturbing was
*  that now it's been proven that the Obama administration lied. They lied about what,
*  you know, it was like just metadata. There was no, no concern. That it was not just metadata.
*  They were, they were able to read people's emails. Right. Yes. And you know, these, this program was
*  started under Bush. And so supposedly when Obama became president, it's like, you know, the
*  transparent president. So we're going to, we're going to stop doing that. Well, that's not the
*  case. So here's a good argument for, you know, WikiLeaks and the Pentagon papers that I, I
*  recognize is valuable that we wouldn't have known that without Snowden or the, or the Pentagon papers.
*  And, you know, it's good to know what, you know, what your government is up to. And, you know,
*  in our mutual favorite subjects of conspiracy theories, you know, we didn't know about a lot
*  of the things Kennedy was doing and Johnson, you know, all the way back to Eisenhower lying
*  about the Vietnam war, for example, until the Pentagon papers came out. And then in the 90s,
*  the church committee on conspiracies from the seventies, a lot of those documents were
*  released. And there was that, that, that business about the operation Northwoods
*  where Kennedy administration people brought to him this idea of a false flag operation over Cuba,
*  make it look like the Russians were harassing our aircraft or our airports as an excuse to
*  invading Cuba or assassinating Castro and so on. It's like, you know, like when you had Alex Jones
*  on, he talks about false flag operations and most of us skeptics go, Oh, that's a bunch of nonsense.
*  And then you read these documents that are revealed in the, in these released secret documents,
*  like, wow, okay, so we did do that. Not just that signed by the joint chiefs of staff,
*  vetoed by Kennedy was like, what the hell are you doing? You know, and then finds himself dead
*  less than a year later. Right. And then all the shenanigans of American intelligence agents
*  manipulating elections and South American democracies in the, in the model of, well,
*  he may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch. Right. So we'd rather, we would rather
*  support the fascist dictator rather than the communist dictator. It's like, what are we doing
*  that anyway? Right. Well, that's what we do. It's like, wait a minute. Does the public know about
*  this? Did Congress approve this? No. Okay. So, you know, this is one reason people believe
*  conspiracy theories is because a lot of them are true. Yeah. Not all of them, but I point to with
*  you, um, with the Epstein case, like you were one of the first people that, I mean, as a, literally
*  you're a professional skeptic and you looked at some of the evidence, you like, Oh, well, you know
*  what? This might be a conspiracy, you know? And when I said, when Michael Shermer thinks it might
*  be a conspiracy, it's probably a goddamn conspiracy. There's been enough of them. I'm still not sure
*  about that one because after I posted something about the, you know, the two cameras broke or
*  whatever, somebody wrote me from that prison saying all those cameras are always breaking.
*  It's a little convenient though, that, you know, he winds up strangling himself in a way that Michael
*  Batten, the famous autopsy doctor says is completely inconsistent with hanging and much
*  more consistent with someone strangling you, including the actual area where he was hanging
*  from supposedly, like it's consistent with someone strangling you from behind, not consistent with you
*  hanging by your own weight. Yeah. After Weinstein got his, um, sorry, Weinstein got his conviction,
*  I thought, Oh boy, but they better have a real suicide watch on this guy. Cause he's, he surely
*  has a black book just as big as Epstein's. Oh, I'm sure. Well, I think what he's got is probably
*  more incriminating to him though. You know, I think what he's got is probably, Hey, I had sex
*  with all these starlets and turned them into big celebrities. And this, and I bet he probably
*  doesn't want that out, especially at this stage of the game. Nothing. I don't think anything he's got
*  is going to make him look good. And I think with the thing with Epstein is he knew way too much
*  about too many powerful people. There's just so, so many connections that could be made with that
*  guy. And that, you know, to this day, people are asking questions that people like Bill Gates don't
*  want to answer or Prince Andrew or any of these people. They're like, you know, I don't want to
*  talk about this. Yeah. I didn't hear the one about Gates, but Prince Andrew, of course, Gates
*  apparently flew on the Lolita Express four years after he was convicted. Oh, okay. Wow. All right.
*  According to the Daily Mirror or whatever the fuck it was. I don't, I would, I would ask Jamie to
*  look that up, but I've got his computer right now. Go get up on your iPad, find out if it's true,
*  if Bill Gates flew on the Lolita Express, because that's what I was reading today. There, people
*  were trying to ask Bill Gates, but it's so hard to know what's true and what's not true today.
*  That's the thing is there's so much data and so, I mean, one of the things that's really sad
*  about the loss of respect for mainstream journalism and mainstream media is, well,
*  if we can't count on them, then who's regulating the independents? Who's regulating these websites?
*  Who's regulating these people that are just, you know, so-called independent journalists that are
*  just tweeting things and finding things and putting things up on their websites? It's so hard to
*  tell who's telling the truth and who's not. And who's right?
*  Yeah, when I was, when I was working on the giving the devil his due, I had to, this was kind of a
*  challenge to me because I feel like there's so much fake news, real fake news and, you know,
*  and just bogus theories and particularly in my areas of, you know, quack medicine and cancer
*  cures and now coronavirus cures, you know, like Jim, you know, the old televangelist Jim Baker was
*  selling those silver pills that you're supposed to, silver derivative pills that were supposed to
*  fight the coronavirus, whatever, you know, so a lot of that stuff is dangerous to have out there.
*  But as a civil libertarian, I feel like, well, but I'm a free speech fundamentalist. I really
*  believe, you know, people short of just lying about somebody or giving away the nuclear codes
*  or something like that, you know, just let a thousand flowers bloom and just see what, you know,
*  what this shine sunlight on all of them and see which ones rise to the top because they're
*  supported by evidence. There's a risk to that. That is to say, you know, people will take bad
*  information and they'll go shoot up a pizzeria or something like that. Now, now these, you know,
*  this conspiracy theory about 5G related to the coronavirus, that is to say the theory is that
*  5G is causing people to feel ill, to take ill and that the government made up the corporations,
*  made up this story about the coronavirus as a distraction from 5G. Okay. This is nonsense.
*  That's so criminally stupid. You know, do you know who Lil Duval is?
*  No.
*  Of course not. He's a hilarious comedian who also has a great Instagram page and he put something
*  up today. He retweeted something. It says if a hundred and four hundred and eighty four countries
*  have Corona and only five countries have 5G towers, why the fuck would you dummies, why the fuck would
*  you idiots think that 5G towers are causing COVID-19? It's such a great thing. And so many
*  people like, oh yeah, oh well. And then I literally heard someone say, well, maybe,
*  maybe the 5G causes the coronavirus and then they spread it to other countries. Like, oh God,
*  you don't even understand viruses. Yes. Well, part of the, of course that's, you know,
*  that was accused with 4G and 3G and, you know, cell phones back in the late nineties and early
*  two thousandth there was the scare about, you know, holding the phone up to your room. We all
*  started doing that and that this is maybe causing brain tumors. And, yeah, of course you can, you
*  can find anecdotes. You know, this guy spent a lot of time in his cell phone and he got a brain
*  tumor over here on his left temporal lobe or whatever. The problem is, well, what about the
*  hundreds of millions of people that hold their cell phones up and they never got brain cancer.
*  Exactly. And then there's the physical aspects of it. The, the energy from the cell phone itself,
*  or even these 5G towers is not strong enough to break chemical bonds like DNA to cause mutations
*  in cells to then become cancerous. There's not a physical mechanism, A and B, the counter examples
*  that you always have to, what about the countries that don't have 5G? Yeah. What about all the people
*  that use, use these things or stand or live near cell phone towers? They didn't get cancer.
*  You know, so you have to look at all the different options and our focus tends to be on the one cell.
*  So I always use this heuristic for my class of teaching skepticism is a two by two matrix where
*  you have four cells. So I did this with this, there's this documentary film coming out about
*  horror films that are haunted or cursed, horror films that are cursed. So like,
*  you know, the, the, which, which is the one where the actors died in the helicopter acts. Oh,
*  the Twilight Zone, the movie and, you know, the Exorcist and these other films were bad, you know,
*  bad things happen to the actors that are in horror films. Okay. The problem with that is you're only
*  focusing on one cell that is horror films that are cursed. Then there's horror films that are
*  not cursed. Nothing bad happened to the actors in those. And then there's non-horror films,
*  regular films, which bad things happened to the actors. And then non-horror films that are not
*  cursed. Right. So when we just focus on the one cell, it's easy to find examples that fit it.
*  But something like The Shining, which is a super horror, scary film, you know, nothing bad happened
*  to the actors and, or just take some other film like The Godfather with whatever, that's not a
*  horror film and nothing bad happened to the actors and so on. So when you look at all the different
*  options, this is just a way to think about any particular claim that then there's really nothing
*  left to explain because you're just plucking out anecdotes. Well, people love coincidences.
*  They really, really love coincidence. They're fun because they love to believe in spiritual
*  connections and they love to believe in clairvoyance and they love to believe in haunted
*  things. Jamie pulled up the article. It's actually in the Sun. It says, Bill Gates breaks silence on
*  Epstein admitting he made a mistake in judgment by meeting with the pedo tycoon, it says. So
*  the whole story about it, who knows, but he is quoted in there.
*  Yeah. I know some scientists. A lot of scientists met with him, right? Yeah, because he was,
*  he had a way of attracting famous scientists because he had a lot of money and he said, look,
*  I can fund your lab, help fund your lab to the tune of millions of dollars. You know,
*  it's hard to resist that. And then maybe you go down that road a little bit and then you start
*  hearing these rumors about his personal life and you're like, well, yeah, but the money's good for
*  the lab. And, you know, somewhere down the line, it becomes obvious it was a bad thing. And it,
*  but it's too late. You already went down that road. So that, you know, it's hard to judge people
*  after the fact and the hindsight bias, you know, we look back and go, how could anybody have ever
*  had any association with them? It's like, yeah, but that's, you know, we know, we know stuff now
*  that maybe not everybody knew the extent of it back years ago. Now, this book that you wrote,
*  Giving the Devil is Due, the idea is talking to people whose opinions you disagree with and that
*  there's a lot of value in that. Why did you write that? And what were you trying to get out of this?
*  Well, in general, I've been kind of a civil libertarian most of my life in that respect,
*  but to be honest, I was kind of inspired after the episode we did of your podcast with Graham
*  Hancock. And I've since gotten to know him and I thought, you know, I was not really fair to that
*  guy. I really didn't give him a fair shake. And there's value in people like him who
*  challenge the mainstream. Now, it's not that outsiders can't make contributions, they can.
*  And we generally tend to be skeptical of outsiders because they're mostly wrong most of the time,
*  but so are scientists wrong about most of their hypotheses. So I do think if you apply the
*  principles of free speech as originally laid out by John Stuart Mill in 1859, his book on liberty,
*  where he said, Okay, look, you might be completely right, but by listening to somebody else, it
*  strengthens your own arguments. So like, for example, I have my mostly pro-choice students
*  watch Ben Shapiro videos defending the pro-life position on abortion because if they can't
*  articulate his position, his arguments, and then debunk them, then their pro-life
*  choice position is not all that strong. That's the first one. Second one, you might be partially
*  right and partially wrong and by listening to somebody you disagree with, you improve your
*  arguments. Or you might be completely wrong and then you've had an opportunity to change your mind.
*  But more importantly still, if you silence people, you refuse to listen to them, then what happens
*  when you take up a contrary position? You come up with some idea that goes against the grain and the
*  norms or worse laws are in place to silence you. Now you've just given up your opportunity to be
*  heard because you've previously endorsed the idea of silencing people. And I don't just mean legally
*  like passing laws, although that's disturbing enough, like in many countries like Canada,
*  Austria, Germany, Switzerland, France, Australia, and New Zealand, it's illegal to deny the Holocaust.
*  By which I mean, if you say, Well, I think 1 million Jews died, not 6 million. Therefore,
*  I don't think the gas chambers were used the way we think they were. Therefore, I don't think the
*  Nazis had an intentional plan to exterminate European Jewry. That's now illegal to say that.
*  Now I've debunked all those claims. I think they're completely wrong. And even if the people who claim
*  it are themselves anti-Semites, I know it's in somebody's heart or minds, but let's assume the
*  worst just for the sake of argument, I would still defend their right to say it. Because
*  let's say by analogy, I'm in the middle of a debate about how many Native Americans died
*  since Columbus came here. And now the figure is, I don't know, 90 million, 70 million, 50 million.
*  It's debatable. But let's say I'm a historian and I say, I think it was 10 million. And I think it
*  was mostly by germs, not by guns and steel. Am I a Holocaust denier? And therefore I should be
*  silenced or worse jailed for my illegal hate speech. And so this is why I wrote a letter to
*  the judge in David Irving's case in Austria. David Irving is a notorious Holocaust denier in England.
*  So he flew to Vienna from London to give a speech at one of these kind of far right groups in a hotel
*  somewhere. And he got flagged at the airport. They scanned the passport and boom, he's arrested.
*  And he was put on trial and convicted and sent to jail. He didn't even speak. He was just going to
*  speak. And so that essentially is a thought crime. And so even though I completely disagree
*  with their arguments, and maybe I don't even want to like these guys because of their attitudes
*  about Jews, I don't like that. But still I would defend them. So I would apply that to
*  pretty much anybody who's out there like that, because that's the only way we can really improve
*  how we think about things to understand the truth about the real world is to listen to people that
*  disagree with you. Those are the ones that the Second Amendment or the First Amendment free speech
*  in general is for. And I agree with that. But can I give you the counter argument? The counter
*  argument, particularly online, is that people develop these bubbles. They develop these
*  bubbles where everyone agrees with your perspective. You isolate or self-isolate in these bubbles.
*  And there's this theory that you can indoctrinate young impressionable people into hateful or racist
*  or ideologically disturbing ideas by finding them isolated in these thought bubbles. So if they get
*  onto particular message boards or a particular website where they subscribe to a YouTube channel
*  or some video channel, then they all meet up in the comments and they agree with each other.
*  But they're all wrong. But they can find confirmation bias in these large groups of people
*  that are also wrong, and they feed off of each other. What do you think about that?
*  It does happen, for sure. And my first response is to encourage people to get out of their bubble. So
*  if you read the New York Times, you should read the Wall Street Journal and vice versa. Now,
*  of course, that doesn't apply to most people online. But there's new research now since the
*  2016 election by a number of political scientists and cognitive scientists, nicely summarized in
*  Hugo Mercier's book called Not Born Yesterday. And he shows that those Facebook and online bubbles
*  against Hillary, say, or for Trump or vice versa, probably had next to no effect on the actual
*  election. That is to say, if you believe that Hillary Clinton was running a pedophile ring out
*  of a pizzeria, whether I convince you that that's not true, you're very likely not going to vote for
*  Hillary no matter what. Somebody that believes that is already so far down the rabbit hole,
*  say down the spectrum of where they are politically, they're never going to switch positions.
*  And even the idea of just sort of slightly negative stories about Hillary or slightly
*  negative stories about Trump that might nudge people, it doesn't look like it had much effect
*  at all. Hugo shows that most political advertising is a complete waste of money. It does nothing,
*  doesn't change people's votes. All it does is reinforce to your team, say in the primaries,
*  that you're the best candidate. So it might work for that. But in terms of getting Republicans to
*  vote, say, centrist or Republicans to vote Democrat, the advertising probably had no effect at all.
*  And the same thing with corporate advertising and things like that, it probably doesn't really work.
*  And so I've been thinking about this with the Nazis, because I've written a lot about that.
*  The problem to explain is how do you convert an entire nation of people from this highly cultured,
*  educated, intelligent, Western civilization-leading culture into Nazis that are willing
*  to exterminate Jews and other people? And the answer I think is now, you don't, you have to.
*  You don't have to. Most of them didn't endorse the Nazi ideology. They like some of the
*  economic policies in the 30s that got Germany out of the Depression. Hitler built the Autobahn,
*  and all that stuff, trains ran on time. But the exterminationist ideology that the Nazis had,
*  most Germans did not go that far. Now, the anti-Semitism was rampant in Europe, including
*  Germany and Poland and Russia especially. But most of the people that held anti-Semitic views
*  about Jews were not exterminationists. They didn't think the Jews should be hauled out and
*  sent to camps and exterminated. That was very much a Hitlerian thing. So I've now gotten to the point
*  where I think no Hitler, no Holocaust, probably even no Hitler, no World War II. Most German people
*  did not want war. They were begging him to stop after he annexed Austria, for example. It's like,
*  that's enough. At some point, these other countries are going to go to war with us,
*  and we don't want that. But Hitler, so the way this thing hovers in midair for 13 years in that
*  case was pluralistic ignorance or the spiral of silence, where everybody thinks everybody else
*  thinks something, but they don't. And then the punishment of dissenters, anyone who descends,
*  who speaks out either in the press or just privately, we're going to jail them, silence them,
*  censor them, send them off to camps or whatever. So the KL system in Germany and the Gulag system
*  in Soviet Stalinist Russia silenced people who would have dissented that would tell the rest of
*  us who think everybody else thinks this is the way everybody believes, but they don't, will never
*  know because we don't hear those voices. They're silenced. So with those two things, pluralistic
*  ignorance and the punishment of dissenters, you can have this Nazi ideology or Stalinist ideology
*  hover in midair even though no one really believes it. And it's just think of North Korea, when Kim
*  Jong-un's father died, Kim Jong-il, and you saw those videos of people just weeping in the streets
*  for days on end. I mean, mostly these, I mean, it's like who actually believes that they feel this way?
*  Well, we don't believe it. They are obviously faking. Does the regime believe that they are
*  in mourning over the loss of the dear leader? No, because they maintain the concentration camp
*  system and they lock everybody up who descends even a little bit. That tells us they don't
*  actually believe people feel that way about their regime. So they didn't care if people believe,
*  they just wanted compliance, right? They wanted to make sure that people, I mean, they had a long
*  period of time where they forced people to mourn. They wanted them to weep in the streets and they
*  jailed people for as much as six months for not mourning enough. That's crazy. Yeah, it's horrific,
*  but that's how you run a dictatorship, right? Under fear. This is a story where Stalin gave a speech
*  and then got a standing ovation that went on for like three minutes and then six minutes and
*  eight minutes, nine minutes, 10 minutes, 11 minutes. Everybody's going, oh crap, please,
*  somebody sit down. Finally, some apparatchik sat down and he was properly arrested the next day
*  and sent off to the gulag. Really? Yeah. Wow. 11 minutes, not enough. Now, it's not just him
*  they want to silence, of course. It's a signal. Like, this is what happens if you don't maintain
*  this charade. We all know it's a charade. Isn't that an issue with social media, right? I mean,
*  there's people that are writing hateful things on social media, but then there's people that are
*  writing things that are just disagreeable. And when they get silenced, this is oftentimes something
*  that sends a signal to other people to not say disagreeable things, not say questionable things,
*  not say things that is contrary to the orthodoxy. Right. That's right. So even though we don't have
*  censorship laws like other countries we've been discussing, there is this self-censorship that
*  happens out of fear of being canceled in the so-called cancel culture or just squelched by the
*  language police, the politically correct police. So when I ask a show of hands of my students every
*  semester, how many of you self-censor? That is, you want to say something, but you don't on abortion
*  or immigration or any kind of politically charged issue, they all raise their hand. Oh, yeah, everyone.
*  I would never say something, not just in class, but in the dorm rooms or just wherever students
*  are gathering. That's the chilling effect. So giving the devil is due is pushing back against
*  that. I know you don't want to give your devil, your devil, the devil is whoever you disagree with.
*  I know you don't want to. I don't want to either, but we have to for our own safety sake. If I want
*  to be heard and I want you to take me seriously and listen to what I have to say, I have to
*  respond in kind. I have to practice the principle of reciprocity or interchangeable perspectives.
*  I have to see it from your perspective. Well, he wants to have his voice, so do I. And so as a
*  principal, it doesn't feel intuitive like, no, I don't want to give everybody a voice, but you know
*  what? I'm going to override that impulse and do it anyway, if nothing else, selfishly for my own
*  safety sake. So my other case chapter in the book besides Graham Hancock is Jordan Peterson.
*  Now, you know, after I saw him on your show and then I saw him getting hammered
*  in the media, especially online, I'm just viciously attacked. It's like, God, who is this guy? Anyway,
*  then I met him and got to know him a little bit. It's like, he's not at all like what these people
*  are saying. He's a wonderful guy. He's the most misrepresent, excuse me, misrepresented person I've
*  ever met in my life. Willfully, willingly misrepresented. They do it on purpose. They
*  know what they're doing. They want to paint him out with just a series of very quick,
*  easy to use adjectives that turn him into a monster. And they don't have anything to back that up,
*  anything. And it's really strange. It's so disturbing, but it's a very strange left wing
*  characteristic. And again, this is coming from someone who's on the left, but it is a left wing
*  characteristic. This need to misrepresent someone, paint them in a straw man fashion
*  as some sort of an evil person so that you can dismiss everything they say that is uncomfortable
*  or that is contrary to your accepted ideology, the ideology that you subscribe to and that you're
*  defending and that you've identified with. And I think this is a real problem. A real problem that
*  we were having is that people identify with their ideas. If their ideas fall apart, somehow or
*  another they're falling apart. They are a part of the ideas. They're not just a person who has a
*  thought and they can, like if you and I disagreed on something, I would hope that we could just talk
*  about these ideas as if they are separate from us. But oftentimes that's not the case. Oftentimes
*  people, they so identify with those ideas that when those ideas are challenged, they are challenged.
*  They get emotional. They get angry and they will lie. They will willfully misrepresent you in order
*  to strengthen their position. And this is a terrible, terrible thing that I see. And I see it so much
*  from my side. I see so much of this from the left and it's so discouraging and it's so infuriating.
*  And this is one of the things that I love about the concept of your book. I love about this idea
*  that we need open discourse and discussion. And I think we're dealing with a couple of things here.
*  One of the things I think we're dealing with is the limited kind of communication that's available
*  through social media. It's very limited. Writing something in text, as someone responds in text,
*  we're missing on so much nuance. We're missing so much of what it means to interact with someone
*  socially. If you and I are sitting across from each other, person to person, if I say something
*  insulting to you, I have to see you get upset. I have to feel it. I have to look at you. I have to
*  feel like, what kind of an asshole am I that I said that to you? Why did I hurt your feelings?
*  There's all these things that happen when people are interacting with each other socially,
*  looking at each other in the eye, these cues. This is what made us human. This is what found
*  community. This is one of the basic tenets of rational discourse, is the ability to communicate
*  with each other in a comprehensive way, in a nuanced way. So much of that is eliminated
*  entirely when you put things to 140 or 280 characters. I'll occasionally get really nasty
*  letters. Somebody will email me. I mean, really nasty, like, you're a piece of shit, you fucking
*  man. Just on and on like this. Sometimes I'll write them back and go, are you having a hard day?
*  You know, I didn't mean to be offensive. I was just trying to make this point. And they always
*  write back, oh my God, I'm so sorry. I didn't know anybody who's going to respond. Oh, wow.
*  Yeah, no, I take it back. What you're just saying is so common. I hear that from so many people that
*  are in the public eye that say something back to someone that says something rude to them.
*  And the person is sort of like, well, I didn't mean it. Because it's just a shitty way to
*  communicate. Sending someone an email or writing a blog about someone or tweeting some nasty shit
*  about someone. It's a terrible way to communicate. It's such a one way. You know, it's a very limited
*  way to communicate. It's far inferior to actual person to person communication.
*  So my chapter on Jordan, you know, I present his views and they go, here's where I agree with him.
*  Here's where I disagree with him. And to his credit, I sent him a copy of the chapter and I
*  said, would you blurb my book? And he did. He wrote me that nice long blurb. And he says,
*  this is a rather difficult book for me to blurb, given that the entire and entire chapter is devoted
*  to criticizing my claims about pragmatic truth, vis a vis scientific truth. However, and then he
*  says nice things about it. So to his credit, you know, this guy disagrees with me, but dang it,
*  at least he's willing to talk to me. He's a great guy. People just don't know him. They just don't
*  know him. I love that guy. And I've had people say, you know, like, what kind of a piece of
*  shit are you for platforming people like Jordan Peterson? I'm like, my God, if you went to dinner
*  with him, just sit down at dinner with him and me and you would realize what a great guy he is.
*  He's a great person. He really is a very great person. It's just misrepresented. And he's become
*  this lightning rod for hate from the left. And, you know, I mean, I don't even think he's really
*  right wing. I mean, he thinks of himself as a classical liberal, which is a very weird
*  definition. I mean, it's more of a centrist than anything, but he's not right wing.
*  Yeah, no, no, definitely not. The problem you identified, though, or just a moment ago was that
*  if people identify with their beliefs, that is the specific, say, political platforms like
*  on immigration, abortion, civil rights, whatever. Those are sort of secondary to the deeper core
*  moral values that people hold. I define myself as a liberal. I define myself as a conservative,
*  Republican, whatever. And so when you attack one little thing here, well, you know, I agree with
*  you on this and this and this, but you know, on the abortion thing, I think you're wrong. And here's
*  what, you know, the the impulse is, well, but if I give if I gave up on that one, then I'm going
*  to lose all these other ones. And then I've given up my identity. Right. So like when I used to
*  debate creationists, intelligence, design theorists, and so on, you know, I could tell that,
*  you know, if I give people a choice, like you have to choose between Jesus and Darwin
*  for your life, you know, they're not picking Darwin. Okay. Because, you know, this sort of belief in
*  their Christian dogmas about Jesus, that is their core being. Who cares about Darwin and, you know,
*  whoever the scientist was. But if I say keep Jesus, keep your whole religion, I don't care
*  what you believe. But the science is really good on this. And here's why you should follow the facts
*  and you don't have to give up anything for it. And it's like, oh, okay, I'll listen. Right. So
*  and like with more recently with climate change, you know, most people, most of us don't know much
*  about climate science. It's a technical science. The models are super complex. People send me these
*  papers. I don't really understand them. You know, but but if you self identify, say, as a conservative,
*  then climate change is just a proxy for something else. Like, I believe in free markets and free
*  enterprise and I'm pro business. And those guys over there, you know, they want to attack that.
*  Now, unfortunately, Al Gore's success with his film and books and so forth, then affiliated
*  climate science with a left wing liberal cause. Therefore, conservatives have to go against it,
*  even though neither side knows all that much about climate science, it's become something else
*  that you identify yourself as. So we have to take that out of the formula. Like you keep your
*  worldview that you define yourself as. Don't give up that. But just follow the facts on these
*  specific issues. Yeah, the polarization is the thing. It's right. If you are on one side,
*  you have to subscribe to the whole menu of ideas. And if you like if you're left wing,
*  you can't really be pro life. You know, and if you're if you're right wing, you're supposed
*  to have a certain amount of skepticism about climate change. Right. So when somebody publicly
*  signals where they stand on, say, climate change, well, what they're really saying is, look, I'm,
*  I am publicly declaring my commitment to my team. Yes. Yes. That's a problem, right? That's a
*  problem. The virtue signaling the the the the the saying I have loyalty to this position because
*  of this is my tribe. That's right. And so a lot of cognitive science studies of reasoning
*  shows that we generally don't reason toward finding the truth, but defending positions that
*  are part of our team ideology or sort of collective whole. And in this case, we've been talking about
*  left and right, but you know, there's there's religious or economic ideologies and so on that
*  are part of that. And so even if you don't know anything about it, it's a virtue signal that I'm
*  in that team. And, you know, OK, fine, we're all on teams. That's that's fine. Defend your team. But
*  you know, what I try to do in the book is disentangle the specific issues. Let's just take
*  them one by one. Like, why can't I be personally against abortion? I don't want to do that. But I
*  and I recognize, say, Ben Shapiro's arguments for the rights of the fetus. But I also think
*  we have conflicting moral values there, the rights of a woman and and the history of the
*  way women have been treated. And men have always tried to lord it over over women's reproductive
*  choices historically. And this has always led to bad things like infanticide and back alley
*  abortions and so on. So I got to err on one side or the other. You know, I recognize and acknowledge
*  your arguments are really good, Ben or whoever is a pro lifer. But I still hold this position.
*  I think there's a lot of progress that can be made socially to kind of reduce the tension when
*  you say, I acknowledge your position. I understand it. You know, steel manning the argument. And then
*  the person on the other side feels like, well, at least this guy's listening to me. Yeah. Well,
*  I think that's a that is the best topic when it comes to that, because it's when you get to
*  particularly we get to late term abortions. Boy, that's a very hard thing to defend morally and
*  ethically. And it's also one of the things about the abortion topic is that it's so uniquely human
*  in that it's such a messy topic. It's not there's not like here's a clear one. Don't murder people,
*  right? Don't just go up to people and murder. And everyone's like, Yeah, yeah, that's clean.
*  That's that's a that's a clean subject. Abortion is not that clean. Like, when is it okay? Is it
*  okay when the fetus is not a fetus when it's just a bundle of cells? Most people are like,
*  Yeah, well, it's not it's not really anything then. Well, it will become a person though. When
*  when do we decide? Well, that's such a messy subject. And it's such a human subject. And I,
*  like you, I am on the side of pro choice. And I think that it is the woman's choice to decide
*  whether or not she wants to keep the baby. But I also recognize that a certain point in time,
*  that choice becomes very different. The choice becomes very different when it's a six month old
*  fetus. Like, what is what are we saying there? If you if you are just I am pro choice period,
*  okay, are you pro choice up until the day of birth? Like, when do you back it off? When do
*  you back it off? And it is a subject that people do not want to breach. They don't want to touch it.
*  And particular particularly people on the left when it comes to deciding when it's okay,
*  when it's not okay, because they feel like this is angling towards an elimination of a woman's
*  right to choose. And it angles towards this. It's very difficult conversation, where you recognize
*  that there is a difference between someone who's seven months pregnant, and someone who's seven
*  days pregnant, there's a very, very big difference. And if we can't acknowledge that, then we're being
*  tribal, we're being ideologically driven, we're sticking to our position, because we feel like,
*  if we concede that this is a complex issue, then we open up the door to possibly losing
*  a woman's right to choose and losing these reproductive rights.
*  Yeah, I think part of the problem also is that we tend to dichotomize most moral issues is right or
*  wrong, good or evil. And the problem is that the law has to draw the line somewhere, we have to
*  have a law and to get along and so forth. So we have to say the drinking age is this instead of
*  that, or driving ages, this and the point at which you can have abortion is right here.
*  But most of life is much more on a spectrum, a continuum. So here I make the distinction in
*  the book between binary thinking and continuous thinking. Most moral issues are on a continuum,
*  you know, like immigration, you know, it's like, we close the borders, what, don't let anybody
*  in ever? No, no, no, we got to let some in. Okay, then we should open the borders. You mean,
*  you want to just open the borders up and let everybody in? No, no, no, I'm not saying everybody.
*  Okay, where do you draw the line? Right. And it's another messy human subject. Yeah, yeah. But if
*  you think of it like, well, it's a continuum instead of a binary choice. And you know, whatever
*  answer, it's not just right or wrong, good or evil, that there's, you know, different places to set
*  the dial. So something and here, you know, the comparative method of looking at what different
*  countries do as experiments, thinking of those as experiments, like, you know, Japan has a very
*  tight, you know, they've slid it way down here, they let almost nobody in Australia is a little
*  looser, but, but, but tighter than us and so on. And you kind of look at the consequences of letting
*  this many people in or that many people and see what it does. Of course, all countries are
*  different. Some are more diverse, some are more homogeneous, you have to account for that,
*  and on and on. So here, I think, you know, instead of thinking of it in these kind of polarized black
*  and white, you know, it's either this or that. And if you're on this side, then you're on the bad
*  side. You know, that that's not helpful. So instead of binary thinking, continuous thinking, abortion,
*  certainly, you just articulated it perfectly. I mean, seven days, oh, come on, you know, it's,
*  it's just a bundle of cells. But now it looks like, you know, by 20 weeks or so, you'll pain,
*  you know, the some consciousness comes online, you know, around 24 weeks, 25 weeks, you know,
*  at some point, you got to draw the line somewhere around there. Now, scientists, of course, they
*  don't want to put lines anywhere. It's a day by week by week, day by day, even hour by hour,
*  the development of the connectome that creates thought and so on. There's no good place, but we
*  have to have a line somewhere. So the law has to do that. But that then forces us into that binary
*  thinking, which is not helpful. And it creates this, this is like the line in the sand, this
*  polarization line between these two sides. And I think that so much of what people subscribe to
*  when they do choose an ideology, once they choose an ideology, they, they have this conglomeration
*  of ideas that they adopt, and they adopt in order to be accepted by the tribe. And it's, this is
*  also a very unique aspect of human communication and civilization that we, we have to adhere to
*  the principles and the ideologies of that tribe. So you just take on all these thoughts.
*  And it's one of the real problems with only having two choices in this country when it comes to
*  politics, and when it comes to just styles of life, you know, and there's so many people that
*  take great relish in switching teams too, which is interesting, right? It's like I was a liberal
*  my whole life. And then one day I woke up and realized I was being a moron, you know, and now
*  I'm a pro Second Amendment, pro Trump, MAGA, make America great, keep America great. It's interesting
*  because those are sometimes the most, the most passionate supporters of the new side, whether
*  they're, they're newly liberal or newly conservative, or, you know, some of the people that are the most
*  interesting to talk to are people that used to be vegans, and are now carnivore. They're just,
*  they just eat meat. And I was realizing I was being a fool and like, Oh my God, it's,
*  it's the same thing. It's with, it's with almost every style of living, you can find a contrary
*  style that people find appealing. You know, there's people that used to be atheists that become
*  Muslims, and they, they, they, they wear, you know, the hijab and they, they fully adhere to the Quran.
*  It's really, really interesting because I, I've spent a lot of time watching religious scholars
*  online talk and watching them preach and watch, and there's something, and as a person who's very
*  agnostic, when I watch that, it's appealing to me. There's a certain aspect of the confidence that
*  they have when they're talking about what God wants or what, you know, what Allah has in store
*  for you when you die or what you should do because it's written in this particular religious text.
*  The confidence that they have when they describe these things is very alluring, even to me. It's
*  not like I'm going to join, but I'm sitting there in front of my computer and I'm recognizing,
*  Oh, I see the appeal here. Like, it's not, it's not that it's working on me, but it's attractive
*  to me. I see it. I see how this works on people. And I find it incredibly fascinating. And I think
*  it has to have some sort of an evolutionary reason. There's some sort of an evolutionary benefit
*  that adhering and being accepting of the morals and the ethics and the ideology of the tribe
*  is that that's how you stay alive. That's how you find other like-minded people to stick with you.
*  Steve McLaughlin Yeah, I'm glad you do that because that's really the only way to figure out why people
*  believe whatever it is they believe. You know, so monitor your blood pressure when I say this,
*  see it from Hitler's perspective. Like what? Well, he had a perspective, you know,
*  Steve McLaughlin Well, his perspective was fueled by meth and testosterone shots and,
*  you know, cocaine. Steve McLaughlin His Dr. Morell probably fucked him up pretty good.
*  Steve McLaughlin Oh my God. I mean, the stories of Hitler and Hitler's use of recreational drugs
*  in order to fuel his escapades. Steve McLaughlin Yeah, there was that book about that a couple
*  years ago. I like that. But just in general, I mean, a good Hitler biography like by Ian
*  Kershfahler, the definitive biography, it's two massive volumes, each are like 600 pages long.
*  I mean, it really gives you insight what he was thinking, why he did what he did, why the people
*  responded the way they did and so on. And but we should be able to do that without somebody saying,
*  how can you take Hitler's perspective? Because I just want to understand, you know, why evil happens.
*  I mean, my friend and colleague Roy Baumeister wrote that great book on evil, in which he actually
*  went and interviewed serial killers and rapists in prison and said, you know, why did you do it?
*  And, you know, he discovered that they all had this perspective, like, well, this is why I did it.
*  You know, I had a crappy childhood or, you know, I felt that, you know, that it was totally justified.
*  That guy dissed me or she cheated on me or they all had justifications. And it was kind of
*  interesting to see the rationalizations behind their arguments. Now, from the victim's perspective,
*  the perpetrator is just pure evil. He did it because he enjoys suffering, the suffering of
*  other people. Now, there are some psychopaths or sadists that do that, but they're very small in
*  number, very tiny percentage of the population. Most people in prison that are killers or what,
*  they did it for moralistic reasons. You know, he took my parking spot. So I, you know, we got in
*  a fight and then I killed him or, you know, this guy slept with my girlfriend. And so I had to do
*  something and defend my honor. And one thing led to another. And here I am in prison. They almost
*  all have good moralistic reasoning. So the problem is not that we don't have enough morality.
*  Actually, we have too much morality, too much moralizing about other people that are harming
*  us. So, you know, back to the free speech issue, the moment you say we're going to create a category
*  called hate speech. Okay. What goes in that bin? Right. Well, you know, so, and so I document in
*  the opening page that this really begins the United States with in 1919 with the Schenck versus the
*  United States decision by the United States Supreme Court to uphold this conviction of this
*  guy named Schenck, who was head of the Socialist Party in Philadelphia in 1918. He was distributing
*  flyers to draft age men, telling them that the conscription is equivalent of slavery,
*  because the 14th Amendment protects your right to bodily autonomy. And when the government says,
*  we're drafting you into the military and we're sending you to Europe, this case for the European
*  Great War, you know, we now own your body for the next four years. Okay, so this is what and so
*  here's the famous lines from Oliver Wendell Holmes, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes,
*  Schenck versus the United States that we're all familiar with. The most stringent protection of
*  free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic.
*  The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of
*  such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive
*  evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree.
*  So clear and present danger. Okay, so we you might say, okay, so somebody incites a group to riot and
*  cause violence or something like that. So that's going to be called hate speech. But note what he
*  considered at the time a clear and present danger. Protesters of the draft and their argument is
*  pretty reasonable. You know, I mean, you can disagree with it and say, no, I think in times
*  of national crisis, we have to abolish, set aside the 14th Amendment and conscript young men into
*  the army and send them off to war to potentially die. That's our right to do it to protect our
*  nation. But we should be able to debate that. But the moment that happened in 1919, then category
*  creep or category expansion happened where more and more things got put into the bin of clear and
*  present danger. So you're now doing something that I consider to be a clear and present danger,
*  a threat to our nation, our state or our community or whatever. So that category just got bigger and
*  bigger. And then so back to why liberals used to defend free speech, and now it's more conservatives
*  doing it and liberals are in favor of censorship begins with this idea of something like in the
*  60s, where we began to become sensitive to the words we use to describe other people.
*  So the N word describe African Americans, obviously, that the one we'd all agree with.
*  Yeah, that's bad. We shouldn't do that. Okay, what about the C word to describe women are called
*  Jews kikes or, or Vietnamese column gooks or whatever? Yeah, yeah, those are all hate speech.
*  The bin starts getting larger and larger. Then all of a sudden, you end up with these lists of
*  microaggressions. I reprint one in the book from UCLA, the entire University of California system in
*  2014 issued this long list of things you can't say, like, where are you from? Or, wow, you're
*  good at math to someone who's not Asian or, wow, you speak English so well, you know, these are now
*  considered hate speech, that they could trigger people's feelings of being hurt. And that is a
*  form of clear and present danger to the sort of serenity of our community. And all of a sudden,
*  this category is now huge is where are you from really on that list? It Yeah, it is. Yeah. Wow.
*  Yeah. My wife gets this all the time, because she's from Germany. And she speaks perfect English.
*  She has no accent. And people go, Wow, I can't believe you speak English so well. Or, wow,
*  I can't believe you're not from America or something like that. And she instead of being
*  offended, she just says, Thank you, I paid attention in school. But it's just bizarre that
*  where are you from would be considered a microaggression. It just we can't make things
*  so sensitive. And this is one of the things that I hope comes out of this horrible tragedy that
*  we're experiencing, as if people realize what actually is important, and we spend much less time
*  concentrating on stuff that's not really important, because there's no real problems, you know, the
*  the one of the problems with society being so good. And this is arguably the best time ever in
*  human history. And Pinker points to that with statistics, and gets criticized, like harshly
*  criticized by people on the left that say, No, it's not. It's the best time for white men. And
*  then they'll start going crazy about all the things that are wrong in the world. And he's saying like,
*  Yeah, no one's denying the things that are wrong in the world. There's always been things wrong
*  in the world. There are less things wrong in the world today than ever before. And one of the
*  reasons why people can get upset about these things that many people consider to be not that
*  significant, like asking someone, Where are you from? Is because there's no war, there's no real
*  thing on our beaches, there's no real horrible tragedy that's taking place every day in our
*  communities. You know, I had a friend, my friend Shuki was from Israel. And I went over his house,
*  and they would be playing bongos and laughing and dancing and singing. And I'm like, I go,
*  Why? I go, Why are Israelis that come to America? Like, why? Why are you guys so fun? Like, you have
*  like, it's so they like, they'll do like laughing and singing. And he goes, you know, in his crazy
*  accent, he was like, Hey, where I'm from, he goes, you could die any day. He goes, So when you're
*  alive, it's party, party, party. And that was his take on things. He just wanted a party. You know,
*  he was a really fun, loving guy, because he'd experienced some tragedy, and because he'd
*  experienced this horrific condition in the Middle East. Whereas here in America, when things get
*  better, we find more shit that's not that important to complain about. I think in a way, it's a sign of
*  moral progress in as much as it used to be people would protest really horrific inequalities,
*  and prejudices and bigotry against African Americans and so on. Well, we've improved so
*  much on that. And I wish the left would take more credit for that, because the liberals were drivers
*  of the civil rights movement. So when they now say, you know, things are as bad as they've ever
*  been, or worse than they've ever been for African Americans, and so on, they're in a way they're
*  saying, you know, our immediate ancestors who supported these civil liberties, they had no
*  effect at all. Martin Luther King, he didn't do anything, because look, things are just as bad as
*  they were in King's time. That's kind of conceding that there's been no progress, and therefore,
*  there's no point in trying. Well, it's also statistically foolish, because it's inaccurate.
*  You know, I mean, we should reinforce the positive.
*  Of course. Yes, right. But when you see like a campus eruption at Yale over, you know,
*  the Halloween costumes business with Nicholas Christakis, you know, I mean, that, you know,
*  we all looked at that and went, Oh, my God, this is ridiculous. But in a way, it's a sign of progress.
*  Like students in the 60s used to, you know, protest the Vietnam War, or, you know, the way
*  blacks were treated in the South. Those are, you know, those are really legitimate things to
*  complain about and protest about. But there aren't as many of those around anymore for students to
*  get all riled up about. And they still have those moral impulses, like I want to promote what's right,
*  and I want to be against evil. And I'm all fired up here with my moral module dialed up to 11. And
*  I'm going to go out on the streets. What am I going to protest? Those Halloween costumes, you know,
*  people that's cultural appropriation, and so on. Remember, there was a, tell the story in a book
*  about this taco Tuesday at Cal State Fullerton, I was invited to give a speech there years ago
*  about protecting free speech over this issue that caused the campus to just erupt in protest about
*  taco Tuesday. It's like taco Tuesday. Yeah, that's cultural appropriation. You know, the Mexican
*  community is being appropriated by these whites eating tacos like we're in Southern California,
*  where is there no tacos? I mean, this is not only that food, you know, the guy who tried to
*  patent taco Tuesday, LeBron James, LeBron James, didn't he? Jamie, isn't that what happened? Yeah,
*  he talks about taco Tuesday on his Instagram. I was on his Instagram and he's like, you know what
*  today is. And then he shows his talk taco Tuesday, you know, okay, what is he allowed to do it?
*  I mean, the whole thing is preposterous. It's delicious food. You know, it's not like we're
*  saying that, you know, white people created it or anything like that. I mean, and cultural appropriation
*  is so ridiculous in so many ways. But one of the most ridiculous ways it is, is that it prevents
*  people from enjoying some amazing aspects of the diverse cultures that we all coexist with,
*  especially here in America. I mean, this is such a legitimate melting pot. I think it's amazing that
*  you can go to all these different places and that, you know, there's a guy, I'm trying to remember
*  his name, Rick Bayless, I believe his name is, and he's a famous Mexican chef, but he's not Mexican,
*  but he cooks Mexican food and he loves Mexican cuisine. He takes all these trips to Mexico
*  to learn with the Mexican masters. And he has a famous restaurant in Chicago, where he has a full
*  authentic Mexican menu. And people are furious at him, because here he is this white guy selling
*  Mexican food. Like, what do you expect him to do? Like, do you have to be born a certain patch of
*  dirt to enjoy a style of food? And don't you think that he is actually boosting the signal
*  and letting people know that there's some amazing things that come out of Mexico? This is an homage
*  to Mexican cuisine. He's not trying to claim it, but you know, hey, this was invented in Chicago.
*  You know, this is not really Mexican. No, he's saying this is from Mexico. He talks openly about
*  the various parts of the country of Mexico where this style of cooking came from and,
*  you know, and how it emanates from the traditional ingredients and he cooks them in traditional ways.
*  And it's fantastic, like really widely praised restaurant with amazing food. And this guy gets
*  shit on for it. It's crazy. This is not one of these perverse reversals, because it used to be
*  like in the 19th century, there was this idea of kind of a pure European culture and other cultures
*  were somehow not as good and they define culture in a very specific way. And then, you know, kind
*  of liberals then were pushing back against that saying, no, no, no, you know, all cultures are
*  equal and culture is a whole blend of different, you know, migrations and people mixing. And that's
*  what culture, that's what makes culture rich. It's fluid and changing and so on. And now all of a
*  sudden, liberals are saying, no, no, there's a pure correct culture that only the people born
*  there can use, you know, adopt those cultural features. That's the complete opposite of what
*  liberals used to argue. Starting with anthropologists saying, no, no, no, this crazy idea that whites
*  have white supremacists have and if you are European cultures, bunch of nonsense. Europeans
*  are just as amalgamated with lots of different cultures as anybody else. There is no real
*  European culture. Yeah, it's a weird time. And I, again, I connect this to the fact that we didn't
*  have as many real problems as we used to. And when you talk about Yale with Nick Christakis, I think
*  there's this thing that kids do when they're coming of age, they're separated from their parents and
*  they want to establish that so many of these older people were wrong about the way life is and they're
*  wrong. We're going to show them what's right. And we have a new way of living. We have a new way of
*  thinking. And we want this campus to be safe. We want safe spaces. And a lot of it is about taking
*  control of their environment and enforcing their ideology and creating something that's in a lot
*  of ways is very ego driven because they're trying to show that they're making a change in the
*  environment around them. And they have good intentions while they're doing it. It's just
*  their brains haven't fully formed yet and they don't have a lot of life experience. And this
*  pattern shows itself over and over and over again. It's a constantly repeating pattern where these
*  kids go away to college and become self-righteous and then try to impose their viewpoints on the
*  older people. It's very, very common. And it has these psychological building blocks to it that you
*  can kind of see why they're doing this. Yeah, I mean, if you want a safe space, go to a college
*  campus. These are about the safest environment you could be in in all of America, which itself
*  is safer than it's ever been. At Javan University, we have a safe space group. And so I went to one
*  of their meetings once just to see what it was all about. This is mostly LGBTQ people that were kind
*  of concerned about being insulted or assaulted. And so anyways, I said, well, how many incidences
*  have there been on this very white, very pleasant campus here in Orange County? Well, we don't have
*  any numbers because we're not allowed to ask and keep track of how many incidences there are. No,
*  the police can do this, but this safe space group or the administration can't do that. So well, then
*  how do you know it's worse than it was, say, five years ago or it's the same or it's better? Well,
*  we don't know. And then I said, okay, give me some examples. What are we talking about here? What's
*  the issues? And like one of them was, for example, a gay couple where I think it was two guys walking
*  along a sidewalk and now Chapman's is in the middle of the city of Orange. So it's ringed
*  with houses and just the regular city. So some guy on a pickup truck drove by and said something
*  like, fucking faggots. And I said, okay, yeah, that guy's a dick. He's an asshole. So what are
*  you going to do now? I mean, are you going to give the power to that guy in the pickup truck
*  in which now you see yourself as a victim? Now, technically, yeah, you're a victim of a sort of
*  a hate crime or whatever. He said something nasty. But then what? Why not just say, fuck off,
*  asshole, or don't say anything, or just ignore it and just move on with your life? Because there
*  will always be assholes. There are fewer assholes than there used to be. As I like to say,
*  conservatives are more liberal now than liberals were in the 1950s. We've all had our consciousness
*  raised, the moral sphere has expanded and so on. That's a very good point the way you just said
*  that. Conservatives are more liberal today than liberals were in the 1950s. Socially, just think
*  about that. I mean, it used to be where even most liberals were against gay marriage, say, for
*  example, until 2011. Really, the switch began and then 2015, it changed completely with the Supreme
*  Court decision. But if you look at interracial marriage, that was illegal until 1967. And pretty
*  much most Americans, including liberals, were against it. Now, conservatives are all in, no one
*  objects to interracial marriage by conservatives. They've all shifted in that liberal direction.
*  I think the gay marriage thing, I think that's pretty much fallen off the radar of anybody's
*  discussions after the Kate Baker incident in Colorado. I think nobody's really talking about
*  that anymore. Gay marriage, it's like the Seinfeld episode, yeah, whatever, dude, who cares? I mean,
*  not that there's anything wrong with that. It's become kind of just a Seinfeld level joke now.
*  I think pollsters won't even ask that question anymore. Are you in favor or against gay marriage
*  in a couple more years? It'll just fall off our social radar.
*  Well, not totally though. Remember when Pete Buttigieg was running for president before he
*  had dropped out? There was this one woman that found out that he was married to a man and she
*  tried to take back her vote. Oh, no, I didn't hear about that. Oh, it's a crazy video. It's a crazy
*  video to watch this. You know, I pity her that first of all, I pity her that she cares, that she's
*  and then she's developed this ideology or she's been subjected to this ideology that she thinks
*  there's something wrong with two gay people that are married, but she was like, no way, I'm not,
*  there's no way. And she was trying to take her vote back. She didn't know. She's like, I didn't
*  know he was gay. And she was upset by it. Yeah, they're out there. There's a few of them out there.
*  I would say this would be in my category of there's always going to be a few assholes driving
*  around in their pickup truck saying fucking Vegas and you know, what do you do about it? Again,
*  just, you know, you can't give those kind of people that power over you. Well, this, I feel
*  pity for them. It's sad. It's sad that someone would care. It really is sad that you would care
*  about someone's sexual preference or any of those things. And as a comedian, it's a real pain in the
*  ass because you can't even make fun of gay people. You can't make fun of anything that gay people do
*  that's legitimately funny because it's be considered hateful, but all, all people are funny.
*  Like people are funny and you should be able to make fun of all of us. We're all, we're so silly.
*  We're the weirdest thing on this planet is as far as I can see in terms of like how complex we are
*  and how so, and some gay people are funny. They do, they do funny things, but if you make fun of
*  them, it's a, it's in our world today. It's considered homophobic. And I just think that's,
*  it's so crazy coming from a person who's not even remotely homophobic. I've been called homophobic
*  because I've made fun of certain things that gay people do that I think are silly. Again,
*  a perverse reversal the way it used to be, you know, liberals were always in favor of comedians
*  poking at the power structure and the prejudices of our time.
*  Well, the thing is it's, it's punching down now. The idea is that you're punching down on people
*  that are maligned and, you know, people that are, they find themselves in a position in society where
*  many people on the left consider them a protected class. But my position is we're all okay.
*  Everyone's fine, but we all have our own idiosyncrasies and our own behavior patterns
*  and our own things that are pretty fucking funny. There's a lot of humor to it. But we,
*  with love, you know, that all of this is with love, that even making fun of Boys Town and how
*  raucous it is on a Saturday night, it doesn't mean you hate gay people. It's an observation.
*  I mean, it's a fucking fantastic place to be if you're a young gay guy looking to get laid,
*  but it's a hilarious place to be if you're a straight person driving through. It doesn't
*  mean you hate anyone. And the problem is that those people like the guy in the pickup truck
*  yelling the slurs to make people feel bad, those people still exist. That's the problem.
*  But my point is not as many, not as many, much better, much better. Yeah. And the denial of that
*  it seems silly. Yeah, exactly. Because it denies that we made moral progress. People like Dr. King
*  and the other civil rights leaders didn't have any effect. And that's not, first of all, it's wrong.
*  They did have an effect. We made a lot of progress. But also, the effect I worry about is
*  that it's going to tell younger people today, don't bother trying because nothing ever changes.
*  Right. Yeah, there's definitely some of that. You know, it would be great if all of the hate
*  went away. It would be great if there was no prejudice, no racism, no sexism, no homophobia,
*  none of those things. But one of the things about when you see someone acting foolish in a way
*  that is discriminatory, one of the things about it is you recognize that this is a pattern of
*  behavior that human beings can fall into. And it's some of the worst aspects of tribal behavior.
*  And recognizing the folly of others is very beneficial to your own personal growth.
*  You can realize how, if you're there, when you see someone yell out a hateful slur to a gay couple,
*  it's terrible that it happens, but you can experience how stupid that person has to be
*  and how sad it is that those people exist and recognize that, oh, okay, this is what it's like
*  to be these people. This is what it's like. And it's like when you see people making mistakes
*  and doing terrible things and doing dumb things, the good thing about it is you can learn from
*  other people's foolish thoughts. Yeah, well, research shows that when you know somebody,
*  say, who's gay, you're less likely to be homophobic, just the exposure to them.
*  And so part of the effect of the cause of moral progress is bottom up. Now, sometimes you have
*  to pass laws to get people to change, like to abolish slavery in the United States. We needed a
*  war and 750,000 people died about that. And sometimes you have to send in the federal troops,
*  like I think it was Eisenhower did that to desegregate Alabama schools that were segregated.
*  And you remember the governor said, segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.
*  And I forget who was president at the time, he said, no, you're segregating and we're sending
*  the, you're integrating your schools and we're sending in federal troops, men with guns to make
*  sure you do it. Okay. Sometimes you have to do that. But most of the change happens from the
*  bottom up of just oppressed people's saying, you know what, stop that. Don't do that. I don't like
*  it when you say that, you know, and it began with the N word and just kept expanding. So there's a
*  logic to where we ended up today, where you have this big bin of microaggressions and so on. But
*  there was a logic to it, like just saying it's hurtful to do that. And most of the effects have
*  been good. They have been positive. Just, you know, when Ellen comes out on her TV show,
*  that's just a little thing there. Or when South Park, you know, makes fun of all different
*  religions, you know, that gets perspective on things. Humor is good. Television scripts,
*  movie scripts, the way characters talk. Richard Dawkins makes this point about you could pinpoint
*  to the decade when a novel was written based on the words that are used to describe Jews,
*  blacks and women. And, you know, but no one said, okay, we're going to pass laws to say you can't
*  use these words to describe Jews, blacks and women. We all just change the way we talk about
*  other people in a way that's more liberal, that's more all encompassing, that's more egalitarian in
*  that sense. And it's not clear how exactly that happened. Just incrementally, little bit by bit.
*  You know, it's just, it's like trying to figure out when a word started to be used. It's like,
*  it's really hard. 9-11 or gays. I remember in the late 90s, there was a couple of atheists that
*  wanted to quit using the word atheist and call us the brights. We are the brights.
*  And of course, that didn't stick. It was pretty obvious what the, you know, what the antonym to
*  the brights were, the people that believe in God, they're the dims. Right. Okay. So the dims are
*  not going to be fond of that. Okay. So that never took off, you know, by, by trying to change
*  language by fiat from the top down, okay, here's the new rule. We're all going to use this word.
*  That doesn't work. It's just expanding our consciousness, expanding the moral sphere,
*  just including more people in your honorary circle of friends and family members or
*  honorary family members or people that you will treat with respect. That, that's has been happening
*  just tiny bits every day, a little bit here and there. And over the decades, you see it when you
*  look back at the numbers like Steve Pinker does. But, but it's hard to pinpoint the day that that
*  happened. Do you know who Darryl Davis is? Yes. The LA sheriff, right? No, no, no, no, no, no, he is
*  a, this man right here. He's a blues musician and he has, yeah, he's converted over 200 KKK members
*  and Nazis and got, yes, he's amazing. I talked to him on the podcast. He's an amazing guy. And it all
*  came up from him doing a show and talking to a guy who said, I I've never had a drink with a black man
*  before. And he's like, how is that possible? And the guy said, I'm in the KKK. He thought the guy
*  was joking. And then the guy pulls out his card and then he's like, what? And so he tells this guy,
*  hey, here's my phone number. When I'm in town again, I'll be in town again. Let's sit down and
*  have a conversation. So the guy comes to see him again. When he's in town, he strikes up a friendship
*  with this guy. And four months later, this guy hands him his robe and he says, I'm leaving. I'm
*  leaving. And this guy was like a grand wizard of the KKK. He said, I'm stepping down. And he's had
*  that effect on 200 people and done it on a person to person basis. Cause he's such, first of all,
*  he's an incredibly articulate guy. He's very intelligent and probably more articulate and
*  intelligent than the people that he's talking to who consider themselves superior. So they talked
*  to him over a long period of time and they realized like this guy is so well read and he's so fucking
*  smart. Like I'm dumber than him and I'm a white guy. What is wrong? So they eventually wind up
*  giving up on their racism and they're friends with him now. And they, it was more important to them
*  to be friends with him and to continue their friendship with him than it was for them to stay
*  in the KKK. And he's had these guys who are like henchmen for the KKK quit, give it up and become
*  his friend. And he brought in all these robes that these guys have given him, including like
*  Nazi flags that they gave them and the bands they wear around their sleeves and Nazi uniforms. And
*  it's amazing, but it's that one-on-one thing that you were talking about. You're less likely to be
*  homophobic if you know a gay person and you like them. You're like, well, that's crazy. They're
*  just people. You're less likely to be racist if you're around black people and you meet them and
*  you get to know them. And you're like, well, we'll just, we're just people. We're just people who
*  look different. That's it. Right. That's it. That's right. Isn't it that movie, KKK Clan or
*  the Spike Lee movie, isn't it about this guy Davis? Oh, I don't know. I don't. I was trying
*  to remember. I don't think maybe it was somebody else. Yeah. I don't think so. Yeah. I don't think
*  there's a movie made about him. I mean, there should be. He's just doing it like old school
*  door to door. I mean, he's really doing it. What is that term when someone does it from the bottom
*  up? I mean, that's really what he's doing. He's like grassroots. Yeah. Grassroots. Thank you.
*  That's really what he's doing. Like grassroots converting people that were racist to realize
*  the error of their ways. There is some evidence still preliminary that reading novels makes you
*  better at mind reading. That is reading the minds of other people. What's called theory of mind.
*  That is you can put yourself in somebody else's shoes and see the world through their eyes.
*  The idea is that by reading novels, you transport your point of view into the character that you're
*  identifying with in the novel and then you see the world through their eyes. The way this is
*  tested is they measure the kinds of things that people read or they actually have them read
*  passages like from a Jane Austen novel. Then they take this eye test, this test where you look at
*  just a block of eyes. I would show you a picture of just this where you can kind of see the way
*  the corner of my eyes is squinting or not or whatever, what the emotions are. They have like
*  six different emotions and then you have to guess what the emotion is of this picture you're looking
*  at. Hundreds of them you go through. Anyway, the correlation was that people that read a lot of
*  novels or that kind of fiction that has that interchangeable perspective are better at mind
*  reading. They're better at reading emotions in the eyes. Anyway, a lot of this hasn't been
*  replicated yet but it's kind of new. Still, the idea is that the rise of the novel since the
*  Enlightenment in which just common people become more literate and literacy rates were going up
*  over the centuries. It used to be like 10% of the population was literate. Now it's 99% whatever.
*  There's a curve going up there. As people start reading more and then they start reading novels,
*  they start taking the perspective of others. So, Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin
*  was the first time most whites had ever read anything about what it was like to be a slave.
*  They were horrified. Like, oh my God, I had no idea that this is what it's like. Abraham Lincoln
*  famously said when he met her, so you're the little woman that started this great war.
*  In a way, that's right because a lot of people, I've never met a black, I have no idea what a slave
*  even is if you're in the North. Now I see why this is so abhorrent. Back to this idea of hate
*  speech, again, once you go down that road, the argument I make in the book is that in the 1850s
*  there were Southern congressmen who fought against Northern abolitionists coming down to give speeches
*  in the South or publish articles in newspapers in the South or get books published and distributed
*  in the South that were pro-abolitionist. Their argument was this could lead to slave revolts
*  and riots and violence, therefore we have to silence that. Now, they didn't use the word
*  hate speech, but that's what today it would be called. Abolitionist speech to abolish slavery
*  is hate speech? That's insane. And the same thing in the Civil Rights Movement. In the 1960s,
*  there were people in the South that said, you know, when Malcolm X comes down here or Martin
*  Luther King comes down here and they give a speech, this is not good. This is, to use
*  the Supreme Court justice's words, a clear and present danger to the peaceful nature of our
*  society. We have to silence them. Yeah, that's a similar conversation I had with a friend who's
*  very progressive. There was a thing that was going on for a while where people were saying
*  punch Nazis. And what I think they were really saying is they were sort of proclaiming their
*  connection to this progressive ideology, proclaiming it so much so that, hey man,
*  I'm willing to fucking draw blood. I'm willing to punch Nazis. And so I was saying that this is a
*  dangerous thing and they said, well, why do you think it's dangerous? I said, well, first of all,
*  what if they punch you back? Then you've got a real fucking problem. You know, like you're espousing
*  violence. Like that's always a bad idea. And second of all, I've heard a lot of people called
*  Nazis that I don't think are really Nazis. Like Ben Shapiro, he's Jewish. I've seen people call
*  him Nazis. I've seen it written. I'm like, who's- He's wearing a yarmulke. Yes. And people still
*  call him a Nazi. So the point is like, who is to decide who is a Nazi? If you're saying like,
*  there's a guy and he's running the gas chamber at a concentration camp and he's relishing the
*  fact that he's going to put these Jews to death, that's a Nazi. Well, yeah, punch that guy. Okay,
*  yeah. But that's not what you're talking about. You're using this word in this very sort of
*  flippant way and it becomes very dangerous to just say punch Nazis because you're just deciding
*  people are Nazis who are definitely not Nazis. And a lot of them are actually Jewish, which is
*  patently insane. I think that beam started after somebody punched Richard Spencer
*  on the sidewalk. He was out giving one of his little white supremacist speech and somebody
*  punched him. Now I have to admit, people like Richard Spencer, Jared Taylor, these are just
*  assholes. And there's videos of them taunting African-Americans that are out singing,
*  We Shall Overcome. And these guys are there laughing at them and kind of up in their faces.
*  And emotionally, I feel like I would just like to punch that motherfucker because that is wrong.
*  But this is why we can't go down that road because the whole point of a civilized society is we can't
*  just have people punching each other. What we need to do is put that guy on a vacation with
*  Daryl Davis. That's right. Really. Make him so he can't go anywhere. He's got to hang out with Daryl
*  for many days at a time. And by the end of it, hopefully he would get it. Then hopefully he's
*  as we were talking about earlier, not so connected with those ideas that those ideas are him.
*  We've got to be, as a society, more flexible in the way we hang on to ideas. And I think that's
*  something that needs to be taught to people because there's a sort of a built-in reaction
*  that we have to defend our ideas. And when you're young and you're learning how to debate things and
*  you're learning how to argue things, the sting of losing is very personal. And so you sort of
*  people build in these defense mechanisms into their personality, into their vernacular,
*  into the way they communicate where you do think of your ideas as a part of you.
*  But if you really care about you, you should care about objective truth and you should care about
*  recognizing when an idea that you're holding onto sucks. If you are valuable, if you care about
*  yourself, you should recognize when an idea that you're clinging to is not a good one.
*  Yeah. Yeah. There was that documentary film about white supremacists by that Muslim woman. I forget
*  the name of the film and her name. I'm sorry, but she's basically hanging out with, I think it was
*  Richard Spencer, Jared Taylor, and a few of the others, particularly after Charlottesville.
*  And they're talking to her. You could tell they really like her. First of all, she's an attractive
*  woman. So you see these guys are like, oh boy, this attractive woman's paying attention to me.
*  She's very disarming in this way. And she says, well, just tell me what you believe. So they
*  articulate all their beliefs about why brown people are inferior to white people and so on.
*  And she's like, you know, I'm brown. They're like, oh, this doesn't apply to you.
*  Oh, I see. Okay. Why not? Well, because, you know, I know you like, right. Yeah. I think there was a
*  line in there where he said, well, I know you. So these things don't apply to you. It's like,
*  right. Okay. Therein lies the problem. We just don't know these other people. Okay. So we
*  stereotyped them. And, you know, that's part of our cognition, stereotyping. It's a perfectly
*  normal thing. We stereotype all kinds of things. We put them into bins, cognitive bins, so we can
*  keep track of them and distinguish them from others. Unfortunately, we do that with people.
*  Yeah. And it's a normal thing that people have done since the beginning of time to sort of
*  recognize who's in your tribe and who's not back when we were these little groups of 50 people and
*  get invaded by another group of 50 people. And you had to be loyal to your group. Yeah. My friend,
*  Jared Diamond, tells a story of, you know, he goes to Papua New Guinea every year to go birding.
*  And then now he's been doing anthropology work as well. But back in the day, he said they would go
*  out birding and he'd have one of his Papua New Guinean hunter gatherers with him on some hiking
*  trail somewhere in there, cut their binoculars and so on. And they encounter some stranger from
*  another tribe. And Jared's like, Hey, let's go talk to that guy. And his buddy is like, are you out of
*  your mind? We could be killed. We don't know who that guy is. And in Papua New Guinea, you might be
*  eaten as well. That's right. Not just killed. So, you know, but the point of Jared's story is that
*  that's the environment in which we evolved. There's a kind of a logic to xenophobia. Like
*  other people are dangerous. You know, like that my favorite line from A Few Good Men where Jack
*  Nicholson is schooling the Tom Cruise character, you know, about, you know, you can't handle the
*  truth. What's the truth? The truth is we live in a world with walls and on those walls are men with
*  guns. And you want me on that wall. You need me on that wall. When you're at parties enjoying your
*  freedom, I'm on the wall. Right. And I remember seeing that thing and yeah, that's actually true.
*  That's a very good description of the way we evolved. It's a very walled off tribal
*  environment that we evolved these moral emotions. So there's a logic to xenophobia that we've been
*  pushing back against by saying, okay, let's increase our sphere of who we count as a member
*  of our tribe. We've been getting better at that, but we're pushing back against those natural
*  impulses. Like it's a little risky to do that. We have to be careful about that. So autocrats tend
*  to jump on that and go, well, you know, immigrants are dangerous people or brown people are dangerous.
*  What do you know? White supremacists do that. And, you know, so that's a, that's a long history
*  we're pushing back against. Well, these ideologies that people subscribe to, I saw a lot of them
*  evaporate when this lockdown took place because a lot of my friends that are anti-gun were asking
*  me how to get a gun. Like, what do you do? How do you get a gun? I'm like, you want a gun? My wife
*  says I should get a gun. A friend of mine who says his wife is always like, you're never getting a
*  gun. We're not having a gun in this house. The moment the shit hit the fan, she goes, we got to
*  get a gun. That was her. And he was laughing. He's like, she told me to get a gun. You believe this?
*  And he grew up in the South. So he's used to being around guns, but this is, this is when people
*  realize like, well, there's a reason why people are preppers. Some of them are insane. Yeah. But
*  it's also, Hey, if the fucking grid goes down, there's no power. You should have a, at least a
*  certain amount of food to sustain you for a little while. It's a good idea. It's a good idea to have
*  a method of filtrating water. It's a good idea. And then I've also gotten a ton of questions from
*  people on how do you get into hunting? How do you get into hunting? Like, and it's like, it's a
*  complex question. It's a long road. It's not an easy thing to learn how to hunt, but from people
*  that never had any interest in it before, but now they realize like, Hey, I went to the grocery store
*  today and there's no fucking meat. Like I want meat. Like what, what do I do for food? Like,
*  Oh, there's animals roaming around. That's what, okay. How do you get these animals? Like, what are
*  you doing? And it's, you know, you realize why people hold onto certain beliefs that some people
*  find distasteful. Yeah, there's a certain logic to hoarding. Even if no one wants to do it again,
*  it's like this pluralistic ignorance problem. Everybody thinks that everybody else wants to do
*  this, but of course they want to do that. The solution is you just put limits. It's like hunting,
*  hunting licenses and you have a limit to how many you can shoot and so on, you know, and, and lots
*  of industries have adopted that to solve the tragedy of the commons problem. My local Vaughan
*  solved it by saying you can only buy one packet of toilet paper per shopper per day. That's it.
*  And I think everybody was kind of glad about that. Like, okay, good. Now there's toilet paper on the
*  shelves. I don't have to worry about hoarding. I have to worry about that asshole taking two and
*  I get none. And, you know, and, and really it's even if you buy say, well, we're just selfish
*  creatures. Yeah, we are. That's right. But we're all, but we also want to do the right thing,
*  but we need some kind of norms and laws and customs or whatever in place to kind of attenuate the
*  inner demons and accentuate the better angels and that everybody can see that. And then they feel
*  better about like, okay, I'm just going to buy one in my kind of hoard or whatever. Now you mentioned
*  the South, there's interesting research, Richard Nisbet and his colleagues on the culture of honor
*  that's more common in the South than in the North. And that in a culture of honor, you solve your own
*  problems. You don't turn to authorities or the state. Okay. And kind of in general, on average,
*  also in the South, particularly in African-American communities, law enforcement and
*  the judicial system has not been very fair. So you can't really trust them. So you do kind of
*  have to take the law into your own hands. Therefore there's more guns, more gun violence in the South.
*  There's kind of a logic to it. And that so it is, but did these famous experiments that are kind of
*  amusing now where you'd have subjects come in and fill out a form for some fake experiment they
*  were doing. And then you have to walk down the hall and give the form to the person in that room
*  at the end of the hall where in the hallway, there's like a bank of lockers or filing cabinets or
*  something. And there's somebody working there and pulling out the door or whatever. And as the person
*  walks by this person working there, who's just a shield for the experiment kind of leans back and
*  bumps into this person and says, asshole. So the question is, what does this person do now? So anyway,
*  they do all follow up surveys and they drew blood and all this stuff. Students from the North were
*  like, yeah, whatever. I don't care. They would apologize to the guy that said asshole. People
*  from the South, they're like, that motherfucker called me an asshole. And they were mad. And then
*  when they drew the blood, their stress hormones were higher, testosterone was higher. And so anyway,
*  his theory is that democracy came late to the Southern United States. The rule of law
*  and the idea that the state has a monopoly on the legitimate use of force, which is how government
*  is defined. And therefore, Southerners had to kind of take the law into their own hands.
*  That is to say, we're going to develop a culture of honor and we're going to take care of matters
*  ourselves. Because everybody wants justice. Everybody wants right to be done and wrong to
*  be punished. That's normal. And if the state's not doing it, if the state says, we're going to
*  do that, so you don't have to do it. So we're going to disarm the citizenry and we're going to take
*  care of that through a court system and a police system and so on. But if they're not doing it,
*  or they're doing it unjustly and some communities like African American communities are treated
*  differently, then of course they're going to push back. So that's why there's more gun sales and
*  more homicides in the South and in the North. And anyway, I just thought of that when you mentioned
*  that. It's a very interesting subject. So your book comes out when? Is out now? Tomorrow.
*  Comes out tomorrow. Tomorrow's officially, but you can actually order it. I just checked on Amazon
*  this morning. It's like, oh, it's already for sale. Okay. So tomorrow will actually be today
*  because this is going to be released tomorrow. So, and it's called Give the Devil His Due.
*  Giving the Devil His Due. Giving the Devil His Due. Yes. So the little chess piece there is our
*  director thing. The little devil there. Yeah. Excellent. All right. Well, I always enjoy
*  talking to you, Michael. I really appreciate you. And hopefully next time I see you, we can actually
*  have dinner together again. We will. We'll give you a big hug. We'll do it in the studio next time. That's right.
*  All right. We'll be back to that. All right. All right, man. Take care. Thank you. All right. Bye. Bye. Bye, everybody. Bye.
