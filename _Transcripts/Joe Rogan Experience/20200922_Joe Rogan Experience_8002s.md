# Joe Rogan Experience #1539 - Jenny Kleeman
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [September 22, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EED-LEWOCv0)
*  Hello, Jenny.
*  Hello, Joe.
*  Thanks for doing this.
*  I appreciate it.
*  I'm totally psyched to be here.
*  Thank you so much for having me on.
*  My pleasure.
*  So, your book, Sex, Robots, and Vegan Meat, did you have alternative titles that you...
*  I'm really, really shit at titles.
*  I just can't do it.
*  It's a good title.
*  I thought it's an excellent one.
*  Yeah, it works well.
*  It's my editor, Chris's title.
*  It's not my title.
*  Did you have ideas?
*  I had really bad ones.
*  I think when I wrote the proposal, it was called Future Humans or something.
*  And he just said, no, no, no, no, no.
*  I can't do titles.
*  I write things that are very, very long.
*  I can't do nice little short things.
*  So anyway, my editor at the publishing house, Picador, came up with a title and I loved
*  it.
*  Excellent job, Chris.
*  Way to go.
*  Yes, he's a smart guy.
*  Well, it really covers the subject matter so well and so succinctly.
*  So I am concerned with all the things you appear to be concerned with.
*  So I'm really excited about this conversation.
*  Good.
*  Let's start with Sex, Robots.
*  This is the first part.
*  I'm sure you've seen Ex Machina.
*  Yes, I have.
*  It's a fantastic movie, right?
*  Brilliant.
*  Yes, totally.
*  And confusing because I think there will be a time, whether it's in our grandchildren's
*  life or when, where that's a real concern, where we do have artificial humans that don't
*  have any empathy.
*  They're programmed whatever way we decide to program them and they're insanely similar
*  to us.
*  Yes.
*  And people are going to have sex with them.
*  Yes.
*  It's this idea that, I mean, there are people who are working on this stuff now.
*  That's what my book is about.
*  It's about like I went and met the people who are doing this stuff now.
*  We have this idea that comes from science fiction of like Ex Machina or Chris from Blade
*  Runner of these like totally perfect beings who are really dangerous.
*  And that doesn't exist at the moment, but it is going to exist.
*  It is going to exist at some point.
*  There will be something extremely realistic that gives a very good illusion of being human,
*  even though it's not.
*  And there are lots of reasons to be concerned about this.
*  And there are some really solid kind of feminist reasons to be concerned about this because
*  the vast majority of the robots being made at the moment are in the female form.
*  But for me, the thing that I was worried about is what happens in a future where it's possible
*  to have a relationship where only one half of the partnership matters, where you don't
*  have to have empathy for your other half.
*  You don't have to care about what their ambitions are, what their desires are.
*  They'll always laugh at your jokes.
*  They never get period.
*  You never have to meet their family.
*  And what is that going to do to us as human beings when empathy is no longer a requirement
*  of the relationship?
*  Jenny, the way you're wearing your microphone, it's rubbing against your clothes because
*  you're trying to look cooler.
*  Because I move about too much.
*  There we go.
*  Is that better?
*  Perfect.
*  Excellent.
*  Yeah, that is a real concern.
*  I've thought about this a lot because I'm very concerned with...
*  There's two ways of looking at it.
*  One way of looking at it like we, at one point in time, there were single-celled organisms.
*  And then millions and millions of years later, you have human beings.
*  Why would we assume that this is the end?
*  It's clearly not.
*  There will be better iterations.
*  I have a feeling that one of the ways we're going to bring that about is through technology.
*  My real fear is that there will be no more biological life.
*  My real fear is that we will slowly integrate, we'll be symbiotic with some sort of technological
*  creation, and then eventually we'll realize all the things that are holding us back, they're
*  biologically based.
*  Whether it's sex or gender or emotions or all these different things that seem to cause
*  conflicts.
*  And then if we figure out a way to convince this future version of human beings to just
*  give in to the matrix, that's our future.
*  You know what?
*  I would have kind of agreed with you on that take about a year ago, except for what's happened
*  over the past year, which has just smacked us in the face, reminding us that biology
*  always wins and that we're much more likely to be wiped out by some biological thing that
*  we have no control over whatsoever.
*  Because ultimately that kind of reading of the future depends on this idea that we will
*  be able to control things really well, that there will be nothing that kind of comes out
*  of left field that can destroy us.
*  I'm sorry, but wouldn't that be a great argument that biology is the issue?
*  Because if we did have something that we could put our consciousness in that doesn't have
*  problems with viruses, wouldn't that be an excellent solution to the problem that we're
*  in?
*  We have a problem with our immune systems because we're essentially symbiotic organisms
*  already.
*  We have all these bacteria and all these different life forms that live within us.
*  If the balance is off or your immune system is bad, then a virus gets in there, you're
*  basically being attacked by another life force.
*  Well yes, but I'd say that's the difference between a perfect world and a real world.
*  I think it would be almost impossible for us to be able to develop technological solutions
*  that were perfect, that didn't have glitches in them, where you could upload yourself faithfully
*  and exist in this realm of consciousness where you were separate from your body.
*  There would be problems with that and you'd be relying on this technology to embody you
*  in many ways.
*  I just basically think that technology can't solve everything.
*  Technology can do fantastic things but it can't solve... the most important human problems
*  have to be solved by changing human behavior rather than relying on technology.
*  Maybe.
*  Maybe.
*  I see what you're saying, but most technology, although it's not totally reliable, is more
*  reliable than human beings.
*  Your phone works and it's much more consistent than most humans.
*  Occasionally your phone will screw up if you drop it a lot, but so will people.
*  If you drop them on their heads, they'll screw up as well.
*  But you're relying, you're giving the person who creates that technology a lot of your
*  trust and you're giving them a lot of power.
*  And so essentially that phone is only as good as the person who made it and as much as they're
*  fulfilling their pledge to give you what they say they're giving you.
*  And actually you're disempowering yourself if you're relying on a piece of technology
*  that's created by a corporation to do something that you could do yourself basically.
*  And so that's what my book is about.
*  What I've been looking at is these fundamental parts of human nature and how we're relying
*  on technology to solve problems for us because it's a bit of a shortcut to say, okay, I'm
*  going to get a machine to do that.
*  I'm going to get a machine to be my girlfriend or machine to do any of these other things.
*  But in fact, there's lots of unintended consequences of doing that.
*  And in fact, you kind of you take away some of your agency if you're relying on a machine.
*  Well, you certainly do.
*  My general concern is that we won't be necessary.
*  I think this idea of human beings and agency and all these things are wonderful if we decide
*  to stay human.
*  But what I'm concerned with is when I talked to Elon Musk and he was telling me about Neuralink
*  is going to radically increase the bandwidth between human beings and information.
*  When you start stuffing wires into people's brains and you make some sort of weird Bluetooth
*  connection to an app or some other piece of technology that allows you to interface with
*  it and have access to information at a much more rapid pace.
*  That seems the beginning of the end of what we call the biological human.
*  I'm really worried about this.
*  I'm not worried in a sense, but I see the writing on the wall and I see people as having
*  a short lifespan in terms of like this version of human being that we're enjoying right now.
*  I don't think this is going to last.
*  Well, it's certainly not going to last because something's going to come and wipe us out.
*  But whether or not we're superseded by technology depends on a whole lot of things.
*  It depends on everybody having this technology all over the world.
*  It depends on this technology working properly.
*  I think there will always be people who can't get their hands on it, who will be living
*  in a different way and maybe a better way.
*  While we all get wiped out because we're all connecting to Bluetooth and telepathically
*  being inside each other's consciousnesses and getting messed up because of it, there
*  will be people who can't afford this technology who will be just quietly forging ahead.
*  This is the whole thing.
*  It's like the difference between you never know where technology is going to take you
*  until you put it in practice.
*  Even the iPhone, when Steve Jobs invented the iPhone, his projections, his most ambitious
*  hope was that it would take 1% of the market in the first year.
*  He had no idea we would all become completely addicted to these things and that we can't
*  put them down.
*  This is the thing.
*  Nobody knows where it's all going to go.
*  It might wipe us out, but there will always be people who don't have it who survive that
*  apocalypse.
*  There are some people in remote parts of the world that don't have phones now, but that's
*  what's fascinating.
*  If you go back to the movie Wall Street when Michael Douglas is on the beach and he has
*  that big brick phone and he's a baller, he's a big player.
*  He's got this crazy phone.
*  He doesn't even have to have a wire there.
*  Remember that?
*  That was the big deal that this guy was so cool and so rich that he could have a phone
*  and talk to people that are nowhere near him with no wires.
*  That was unusual.
*  Now you could go to remote parts of the world and you'll see folks with cell phones.
*  Very poor people in third world countries.
*  They all have cell phones.
*  I feel like that is probably going to be what's happening with all future tech.
*  The rich people have it originally, initially, and then it'll trickle down to other folks
*  as well.
*  The real worry, when we're talking about haves and have nots now, that's a big issue today,
*  is income inequality.
*  When you have people that can afford Neuralink or whatever the next version of that is or
*  future iterations, if it really is that effective and it makes you that much more productive,
*  you're going to have a massive advantage, assuming it works, over people that are just
*  naturally using their biological brains and the gap will be even wider.
*  Then there'll be real revolt.
*  Also with things like, for example, artificial wounds.
*  If you can have a baby without anyone being pregnant, then there will be a great inequality
*  between women who can carry on working and not have to deal with all of this stuff happening
*  to their bodies.
*  Companies might pay for you to grow your baby in a lab or in a bag instead of inside your
*  body and you can carry on working.
*  Then there's a future where being visibly pregnant might be a sign of having an unplanned
*  pregnancy or of low status or of being a pretty bad mother because you hadn't really thought
*  about it.
*  This technology has the ability to create enormous, not just advantage and disadvantage,
*  but also reinforcing class problems in a really huge way because we will end up looking down
*  on people who don't have the ability to participate in this new world where there are opportunities
*  provided by this technology.
*  Now we're getting really into the weirdness because we're really talking about money,
*  more than we're talking about the development of a human being because you know you're a
*  mother.
*  Strange things happen when you have a baby inside of you.
*  You have a connection with the baby.
*  The baby has a very bizarre connection with you and the outside world through you and
*  your feelings and senses.
*  To pawn all that off on some fucking robot just seems really weird.
*  I hope that never happens.
*  That freaks me out.
*  It's kind of already happening now though because it is already happening now in one
*  respect in that they're doing experiments with animals where they're doing it, but it's
*  already happening now with surrogacy.
*  All of the arguments that you make now about the connection, the bond and all of that,
*  they apply to surrogates as well.
*  Surrogacy is a very difficult area ethically to get into, but it's the only way a lot of
*  people have of having babies at the moment.
*  That also is an issue with income inequality comes into play as well with people that really
*  don't want to do it and they do it because it's the only way they can earn a large sum
*  of money so they carry other people's babies inside of them.
*  It's weird stuff.
*  You are renting out your body even if you're doing it for the most noble reasons to give
*  the greatest joy to a couple, you are basically saying, okay, you can have this part of my
*  body for nine months.
*  What we were talking about earlier, I'm with you.
*  I love human beings.
*  I love all our weirdness.
*  I love our flaws.
*  I love the conflict and the resolution of that conflict.
*  I think we're amazing.
*  I love talking to people.
*  That's why I started a podcast in the first place.
*  My concern is that we're going to be obsolete.
*  I really think that if technology continues the way it's currently going, this exponential
*  rate of improvement and with artificial intelligence and all the various things that people are
*  working on, including artificial limbs that are going to be superior.
*  They're talking about replacing eyes within our lifetime.
*  They're going to be superior to the eyes that we currently use.
*  All these things lead me down if I sit and think for a long, well, where's it going?
*  Well, it's going to artificial people.
*  It's going to something that's superior to us, just like we're superior, at least on
*  paper, to single-celled organisms.
*  Well, yes, and there's the transhumanist argument that we're going to be augmenting ourselves
*  and transcending our bodies.
*  But that depends on two things.
*  One is this idea that human bodies are kind of flawed and need to be rejected and improved.
*  But the other thing is that all of this stuff depends on whether or not we want to buy it.
*  This stuff is out there.
*  We can say, no, we don't want that.
*  We'd rather be inferior and flawed human beings because that's better than being perfect
*  and rendering ourselves obsolete.
*  We don't have to go down that road.
*  Just because these things exist, it doesn't mean that we have to buy them.
*  We have to use them.
*  No, that's absolutely true.
*  You're absolutely right.
*  But I think people are going to do it, and I think more people are going to do it than
*  not.
*  No, I believe in human beings.
*  I think that there's going to be a kind of backlash and a revolution against all of this
*  stuff and people will say, actually, there are certain areas.
*  Where I want to be flawed and imperfect.
*  But maybe those people will become second class citizens and be completely inadequate
*  in this new economy of enhanced humanity.
*  You're depressing me now.
*  You can get depressed thinking about this, but I look back on chimps or our ancient hominid
*  ancestors and I said, well, if you talk to them and say, hey, let me show you your future.
*  Your future is filled with iPads and electric cars and you can fly in a metal tube that
*  gets you across the entire continent in five and a half hours.
*  What do you think?
*  They'd be like, fuck that.
*  I'm sticking with the trees, man.
*  This is where it's at.
*  Bananas and eating bugs.
*  This is life.
*  What you guys are doing is nonsense.
*  Everyone's depressed and you don't even have to worry about being eaten by a big cat.
*  No, you're doing it wrong.
*  I mean, totally.
*  I mean, yeah, the idea of whether or not our life is better now that we have the capacity
*  to do all of these things is really up for discussion.
*  Sure.
*  What is better, right?
*  What's better is are you enjoying it more?
*  Do you feel more fulfilled and happy?
*  Arguably more people are depressed and more people feel disconnected because of technology
*  than ever.
*  If you've read, you know, Jonathan Haidt, have you read his book, The Coddling of the
*  American Mind?
*  I haven't.
*  It's an excellent book, in particular when it discusses children and growing up with
*  technology and social media in particular, how difficult it is.
*  And for girls, especially for whatever reason, they experience more bullying and more depression.
*  There's more cutting, more suicides, and there's a giant uptick that coincides directly with
*  the advent of social media and cell phones.
*  It's really weird because there's this thing that we're adding into our life that causes
*  all these complications and is incredibly addictive.
*  I have a 12 year old daughter and it's hard to get her to put her phone down like, hey,
*  put that down.
*  She has a time.
*  She can only use it for an hour and then it just won't let her use it anymore.
*  But during that hour, it's like a feast.
*  You know, it's crazy.
*  It's weird to see and it's disturbing.
*  And part of it is I see her enjoying it.
*  I see her doing TikTok and laughing with her friends and taking pictures with weird filters.
*  But part of me thinks this is a little demon that works its way into your life and it makes
*  you unsatisfied and unhappy.
*  For a lot of people, the weird comparison aspect, particularly when you're an adolescent,
*  very dangerous for kids.
*  That's what it is.
*  I mean, that is the kind of key to being unhappy is comparing yourself with other people.
*  I mean, the key to happiness is to not compare yourself to other people and just be happy
*  with your lot.
*  But you know, it's not just teenagers.
*  I'm completely addicted to my phone.
*  I remember one time I put my phone in to be repaired.
*  The screen was cracked and I felt like I'd lost a limb.
*  I was constantly thinking, oh, it's my phone.
*  And then having to remind myself it was in for repairs.
*  They are incredibly addictive things and have a very incredibly powerful effect on your
*  brain.
*  You know, all of that stuff that's proven about the dopamine hit you get when you get
*  a notification.
*  We all pray to that, not just teenagers.
*  But yeah, the comparison stuff.
*  And also there's the fact that I think we're now living in a world where the problems that
*  we have are not huge existential problems.
*  We're not constantly living with death around us all the time, although maybe this year
*  things are slightly different.
*  But you know, in a world where we're not constantly under threat, our kind of sphere of what should
*  concern us has got smaller and we're kind of cannibalizing ourselves and looking for
*  creating problems.
*  Whereas in the past, we would have been too busy running away from tigers or whatever,
*  whatever you might think.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  And there's other issues also where people are comparing themselves with things that
*  aren't real, like filters and all this weird stuff.
*  I posted a picture on my Instagram that my 10 year old took of me.
*  We were at dinner and I made an ugly face and she put me through this filter and turned
*  me into a beautiful girl.
*  It's really bizarre.
*  And I posted it up on my Instagram said, this is me.
*  Like I want you to know how crazy this is.
*  I showed the original picture and then I showed the picture that my daughter created.
*  I'm like, this is how insane these filters have gotten.
*  It gave me hair.
*  It gave me beautiful lips and smooth skin.
*  And it's and people were stunned because there's a lot of people I didn't know that it
*  existed until my daughter did it to me, like until she showed me.
*  I mean, I knew that it was pretty similar, that you could do some weird stuff with
*  filters, but I didn't.
*  I had no idea you could turn an ugly man into a beautiful girl.
*  Like it's it's really weird.
*  So there's a lot of girls.
*  People are having like surgery so that they can look like filters as well.
*  They're so used to seeing themselves in this way.
*  And I don't know if you have this so much in the US, but we certainly have here this
*  fashion for incredibly big lips and young girls having loads and loads of stuff put
*  in their lips. And so they begin to look more and more like, you know, cartoons
*  because that's the kind of perfection that they're used to seeing in these images.
*  Yeah, we do have that, unfortunately.
*  It's it's a weird one.
*  I think people got so used to boobs being ridiculously big that they thought that,
*  well, we'll just do that with lips, too.
*  But and but yeah, and buts.
*  The but one is very strange.
*  But it's all weird. But it just it changes the geometry of your face and it makes
*  people weird.
*  Like they get odded out by you.
*  They see you with the lips and like, oh, that those lips don't go with that face.
*  Like, why are those lips on that face?
*  Like people who have thick lips, it generally if they're naturally have thick lips,
*  you know, there's the Fibonacci sequence with your face.
*  It works. You see it.
*  And like, oh, that that's your face.
*  That those beautiful lips belong on your face.
*  But when someone has like thin skin and like angular, narrow features and these crazy
*  fucked up lips, it's it's your your your body like you gasp, like you tighten up
*  when you see like, oh, what have you done?
*  Like, what have you done to your face?
*  So I think when people in the future look back on us, like when we look back on, I
*  don't know, two or three centuries ago where people were those tiny corsets and
*  think, oh, my God, I can't believe that was in fashion.
*  I think people in the future will either look back on us and and just laugh that we
*  we did this to our lips or they will all have lips like that and look back at you
*  and me and think, oh, you know.
*  Those regular looking people.
*  I'm worried about genetic engineering as much as I'm worried about artificial
*  intelligence and symbiotic relationships with technology.
*  I'm really worried about things like CRISPR and how they're going to affect the
*  future, what the future shape of human beings is.
*  I think that if we really get to a point where we can edit genetics and every woman
*  looks like Wonder Woman and every man looks like Thor, we're we're going to be in a
*  really weird place.
*  Certainly. And also because, you know, so much of this stuff is like being developed
*  for really noble reasons, like we're going to stop people from being sick, we're
*  going to stop people from having diseases.
*  And it's hard to argue against that.
*  And also that the kind of the the limits on people using this stuff are kind of
*  voluntary things that the country sign up to.
*  I mean, China gets a bad rap for using this stuff, but at least they Chinese
*  scientists do sign up to lots of ethical codes.
*  There's nothing to stop scientists in North Korea or in Russia or countries like
*  that that don't care about these ethical codes from from doing whatever they like
*  with this technology. And that's the point is that we need to be able to have these
*  discussions before this technology is out there and be able to to be critical about
*  technologies that might be able to do incredible amounts of good so that we're
*  ready for them, basically.
*  Right. That is part of the issue is like the people that create the technology, it's
*  like they get to a point where they're they're editing genes and they're doing it
*  for these good reasons.
*  But then that technology exists.
*  It's sort of like when Oppenheimer created the bomb, like what he was doing, they
*  were trying to do it first because they knew that Germany was working on it and
*  they they they knew that this was something that was very important to be first
*  with. And but then once he detonated it and he realized what he had done, you know,
*  that famous quote from the Bhagavad Gita that he said, you know, like as the bomb
*  blew off, he said, now I am become death destroyer of worlds.
*  Like it it it dawned on him like, what have I done?
*  And I think that's probably going to happen with genetic engineering when they when
*  they're doing it initially and they're trying to help people with leukemia and all
*  sorts of diseases. But then you see everyone looks like the Hulk, you know, and
*  then you live a thousand years.
*  Then we have massive overpopulation problems because nobody dies and people have
*  bulletproof skin. This is not outside of the realm of possibility.
*  This is all in the wheelhouse of genetic engineering.
*  If they just keep doing what they're doing right now and you extrapolate, you go
*  forward a hundred years.
*  Things can get really bizarre.
*  The point is that nobody can control where their inventions will eventually go and
*  who will control them and what they'll be used for.
*  And like, you know, one of the things I've looked at is meat grown in laboratories.
*  So if you could if you could eat meat without killing animals by cloning the cells
*  of a live animal and the people doing that stuff, they're vegans and they're animal
*  rights activists who are like the animal rights argument.
*  We haven't won that argument.
*  People are still eating meat even though they know it's really cruel.
*  So we're going to give them what they want, but do it in a in a way that doesn't
*  involve killing animals. And we're going to try and make it cheaper and better for
*  you. And that is a noble intention in many ways.
*  But then, you know, they can't say that in 20, 30 years time, they're not going to
*  be bought out by some giant meat company that doesn't care at all about animals or
*  people or anything else.
*  And, you know, nobody can control how technology is going to be used and who is
*  going to be using it and what for.
*  That's the thing. But we do have this is this is where I'm kind of more optimistic
*  than you that we as human beings have have the power to say that we don't want
*  this and that we aren't going to go for this.
*  And there are enough of us that we can you know, there can be a critical mass of
*  people who say we're not going to allow this to happen for it not to happen.
*  I would say I love your optimism, but I feel the same way about you saying that as
*  I do when the Green Party is running for president here in America.
*  Like, we don't need the Republicans. We don't need the Democrats.
*  We're going to start a third party.
*  And I'm like, good luck.
*  Most most people are crazy.
*  Most people are going to jump right on board and get fake eyes.
*  They're going to do it. They're going to want to be able to read minds.
*  Like, come on, Elon Musk, drill into my brain, stuff those wires into my mink.
*  But it's not going to suddenly come out there and be there on the market.
*  As we said, like the first people who are going to get it are going to be very rich
*  people who have it. And then there will be a backlash of other people saying, hey,
*  it's not fair. The rich people can read my mind.
*  Maybe nobody should be able to read anybody's mind.
*  It's not going to all of a sudden happen.
*  It's not going to be like a science fiction movie. That's the thing.
*  No, I don't think it's going to happen quickly.
*  But I think it's going to be one of those things that we just accept, just like we
*  accept cell phones. You know, we if you had a cell phone 50 years ago,
*  people would think you were a warlock.
*  Now, all of a sudden, it's normal.
*  It's a normal part of our life.
*  And I'm worried that that is going to be the same with whatever,
*  whether it's Neuralink or whatever future inventions that we have that enhance
*  brain activity.
*  And it's already happening with things like IVF.
*  You know, like when IVF first came in, like total science fiction,
*  so much backlash that these were Frankenbabies.
*  And now it's just like so normal. It's advertised on the tube here.
*  Yeah. And people talk about it at casual conversations.
*  No, we had our kid through IVF. Oh, cool. It's normal.
*  Yeah. The sex robot thing.
*  I share the same concerns that you have about the
*  there's a thing that people do when we get to know each other.
*  We we want each other to like each other.
*  And as we grow up with, you know, as boys grow up with girls, they learn how
*  what girls like and girls learn what boys like.
*  And we learn to be better people because we want other people to like us.
*  It's part of the whole process of the development of a human being.
*  If all of a sudden you can have sex with this perfect woman
*  that you could spit on and pee on and do everything and she's always going to be
*  there for you.
*  We mean, it's a gross image.
*  I'm sorry. But this is the real worry that there's no consequence to any
*  of your actions and you could do whatever you want.
*  It's it's like there's a video game mode called God mode.
*  I don't know if you play video games, but it's the most boring thing in the world
*  because when you play on God mode, you can't die.
*  So all of the consequences of playing the video game have been removed.
*  Like when you play a video game, you have a certain amount of life.
*  You have a finite lifespan.
*  You know, if you're playing a shooter game, you have a finite amount of bullets
*  and you got to run around and find more bullets.
*  That's part of the fun of the game is that you could it could end.
*  You could lose. But when there's no consequence
*  and I feel like there's got to be the same thing in dating, right?
*  If you're not nice to people, they don't call you back.
*  They don't like you.
*  And then you go, well, what have I done wrong?
*  And then you learn and you grow.
*  If there's no learning and growing, you need feedback.
*  Yeah. Yes.
*  And you need to not.
*  This is the thing is about having a domestic echo chamber
*  to have something in your house that is always laughing at your jokes
*  and always likes the same music as you in the same movies as you,
*  unless you program it to disagree with you.
*  But then again, all that matters is what you want. Right.
*  I think that's going to be very damaging and corrosive.
*  And particularly because the people who are making this stuff
*  at the moment justify it by saying we are making this for people
*  who otherwise wouldn't have a relationship.
*  Bereaved people, socially awkward people, people who are disabled.
*  We're giving them a chance to have some sort of companionship,
*  which they wouldn't be able to have otherwise.
*  But what these people need is they need some human contact.
*  You know, they will be further isolated by having this kind of perfect
*  illusion of a partner, because that's just not reality.
*  The whole point about human beings is they're unpredictable
*  and they disagree with you and they have in-laws and menstrual cycles
*  and ambitions and stuff.
*  And it's incredibly important to grow as an individual
*  to not always get everything you want.
*  Yeah, I'm totally with you on that.
*  Yeah. It's like that scene in Ex Machina where you realize that
*  the genius has this bizarre sexual relationship with these robots
*  that he's created and particularly the Asian robot,
*  where you can kind of tell her what to do.
*  And you're like, oh, wait a minute, is that it's not a person.
*  But why do I feel like it's a person?
*  Like, I feel like he's a fucking creep, but it's not a person.
*  He's doing this to wow.
*  So it sort of highlights these strange dilemmas.
*  Like you're going to create a nation of sociopaths
*  with oddly perfect female companions.
*  Yes, and almost kind of worse than that is I interviewed these
*  these sex robot manufacturers in China who make very, very realistic
*  sex dolls that they're putting AI and animatronics into,
*  but really, really realistic.
*  The AI isn't so great, but they look really realistic.
*  And I asked them, you know, how come you're doing this?
*  And they said that actually, what this is really ultimately about
*  is about having service robots in the home that ultimately you can have
*  robots that will cook and and clean for you at the moment.
*  But they look like movable trash cans and they're not appealing.
*  And so actually what we're doing is making them look nice.
*  So you want to have them in your house.
*  And if you want to have sex with them, you can.
*  And what that description is basically of is a slave.
*  Yes. Yes. This is what they're making is slaves.
*  They're making things that look human, but will do all the things
*  that human beings don't necessarily want to do.
*  And so my concern is there's a whole branch of ethics about, you know,
*  should robots have rights and, you know, are we, you know, should we should they
*  have should they have legal protections?
*  I'm not so much interested in that.
*  I'm interested in what does it do to you, the robot owner,
*  if you have this relationship with a being that looks very, very human,
*  but isn't human and the mindset of being a slave owner where you
*  you you can suspend your empathy for something that looks very human.
*  How does it corrode you and affect you to be having that kind of relationship?
*  I mean, I see a Black Mirror episode ready to happen, right?
*  And then I see like someone pretending that they have robots,
*  but they really have human slaves.
*  That's a really good idea.
*  You should make it seems like that could really happen.
*  I think there's going to be a branch of ethics that gets developed
*  to deal with artificial life.
*  If we get to the point where we have control over artificial life
*  and that artificial life has been programmed to actually mimic our emotions,
*  because if if you have something that cowers
*  when you hit it and when you scream at it, it hides in the corner
*  and cries and weeps and you get you get off on that.
*  You think that's fun.
*  Like, what what is that?
*  You're not doing that to like if you have a basketball, OK?
*  And you like to punch that basketball and scream at it
*  and call it a bitch and throw it in the corner.
*  Everybody's like, OK, like it's just a basketball.
*  Like you're fucking weird.
*  I don't know why you're doing that.
*  But, you know, if that's what makes you feel better, fine.
*  You want to scream at your basketball and not at a human being.
*  That's fine.
*  But what if that basketball looks like a human being,
*  talks like a human being, has emotions that are programmed into it?
*  Like, how realistic does it have to get before we rebel against this idea?
*  No, totally. And part of the part of the question about child
*  sex dolls and child sex robots is part of all of this.
*  That some people say that you should give pedophiles
*  child sex dolls and child sex robots like like it's a kind of methadone
*  that it will wean them off offending.
*  But we all know instinctively that that's wrong because it's more likely
*  to to to feed that desire than to satisfy it.
*  We all know that.
*  But then how is that any different from saying, you know, you can give people
*  who are sex offenders, female dolls and robots or or even men who are a bit
*  aggressive or or even, you know, whatever it is, it's like if it's wrong
*  to have a child sex doll because you relate to it like a child,
*  then that same kind of thought process has to carry over
*  when you're talking about adult dolls as well.
*  We will relate to them like they're human.
*  That's the whole point.
*  Yeah, it's a very messy situation.
*  Like once they're created and once they actually do mimic real human beings.
*  It's going to be very strange.
*  And I completely agree with you when it comes to pedophiles
*  pedophiles and a child robot doll.
*  Like that's that's not going to fix anything.
*  No, but we know that.
*  And that's the interesting thing.
*  Like we have a kind of instinctive reaction.
*  No, that's wrong.
*  But then if you think, OK, well, then why is it OK to have?
*  I guess because adults can consent and kids can't consent.
*  But we know that with a child doll or a child robot,
*  it's wrong because you, the person owning it, are going to be
*  treating them like a human and relating them like a human.
*  It's going to encourage you in the real world to go off and behave in a bad way.
*  So it's the same sort of argument.
*  Yeah, even in an inanimate one.
*  Like if you went over a guy's house and he had a real doll,
*  you know, one that doesn't move, but, you know, he's like,
*  well, I just prefer that to masturbation.
*  You're like, oh, I don't know.
*  Like masturbation is normal,
*  but that's one step removed.
*  Like, that's weird. That thing looks really real.
*  Well, the thing about real dolls is that they because they don't move.
*  I mean, obviously I went to the real doll factory
*  and because they don't move and speak, they're still like a fetish.
*  And it's a very niche thing.
*  You have to be turned on by dolls or you have to have an incredible imagination
*  where you can imagine them coming to life.
*  The thing about robots with artificial intelligence and AI
*  is that you don't then they're not so much of a niche and a fetish.
*  They are a ver similitude of a human being.
*  They are they are trying to
*  to be to be a replacement relationship, really.
*  And with a robot, it's much more about the relationship than about the sex,
*  because you can have sex with a doll.
*  The whole point of a robot is that you can have a relationship with it.
*  Yeah, it's the Joaquin Phoenix movie She.
*  Yeah, that movie is that she or her her her.
*  Yeah. Where he has a love relationship
*  with this voice, essentially.
*  I mean, that's what we're talking about.
*  We're just talking about it in the physical form.
*  I'm I'm worried that this is inevitable.
*  I just it seems inevitable.
*  It seems like if this these companies are already developing ones
*  with wonky AI, it's going to be like the difference between that brick
*  that Michael Douglas had on the beach and, you know, a Galaxy S20 Ultra,
*  you know, the newest, latest, greatest cell phones.
*  They're just going to get better.
*  And it's going to get it is totally inevitable.
*  They'll always be quite expensive, but it is totally inevitable.
*  And there's a there's a guy called Dr.
*  David Levy, a British guy who wrote a book in 2007 called Love and Sex
*  with Robots, where he predicted by 2050
*  human robot marriages would both be legal and acceptable around the world.
*  And I think he thinks that's going to happen sooner now.
*  But yeah, I think this technology is inevitable.
*  It doesn't exist so much at the moment, because at the moment
*  you've got these robots that look very realistic because they're like real dolls.
*  And the AI isn't bad, but they can't walk.
*  Walking is really, really expensive to develop and it drains a lot of power.
*  So they haven't worked out how to do that.
*  That's the kind of next frontier.
*  So you haven't got this this science fiction fantasy of like a robot
*  that will come and knock on your door and deliver herself and say, hello,
*  I'm your new girlfriend or whatever it is.
*  We're quite a way off that.
*  But it is going to happen.
*  Whether or not it'll be cheap enough for everyone to have one is another matter.
*  But it's definitely going to happen.
*  Do you think that people will propose laws to prevent this?
*  Like once it starts seeming like it's inevitable,
*  once the general public goes, hey, wait a minute, like this is not good.
*  And then people realize that their romantic relationships,
*  like they're going to be replaced men and women and women, too.
*  I mean, women are going to be tired of men's bullshit.
*  You know, I think that's probably true.
*  But then, I mean, I can't speak for all women here.
*  But I think certainly my experience and I don't think this is a minority view
*  is that women find the idea of having sex with something that you don't know
*  genuinely wants you to be very unsexy indeed.
*  And it's much harder like all of those real dolls.
*  They make male real dolls.
*  They're bought by gay men like women.
*  It takes a it's very, very difficult.
*  It's not sexy to have sex with something that isn't really into you.
*  Basically, isn't that kind of the same thing with Playgirl?
*  Like Playgirl, the idea was, well, women should have a magazine like Playboy, too.
*  OK, you know, buys it.
*  Gay men. Exactly.
*  Male sexuality is very, very it's a very, very different thing.
*  But I do think there'll be women who want companions and forget about the sex.
*  There'll be women having relationships, certainly
*  with with very realistic male robots, too.
*  Definitely. But in terms of whether or not they're going to be laws against this,
*  there's a campaign against sex robots in the UK that at first was trying to get
*  laws banning sex robots or the development of sex robots in the UK.
*  And now it's kind of soften their stance and says they just want proper
*  discussion ahead of maybe making some laws.
*  But the point is, the cat is out of the bag.
*  We could, you know, we could ban it in the UK.
*  People will be making them in Korea or in somewhere,
*  unless there's a kind of global decision not to do this.
*  And there are too many rogue states for this not to happen.
*  So it is going to happen.
*  And always, you know, the law is really out of step with technology.
*  You know, if you look at things like revenge porn,
*  something that we know instinctively is so wrong.
*  It's been really hard to criminalize because of the way that we all live now.
*  Everybody's taking pictures, everybody's sending them all the time.
*  People can upload them and ruin someone's life in a moment.
*  And, you know, the law is kind of grinding on slowly, trying to keep up with all of this.
*  And so, for example, in the UK, what's illegal in terms of sex dolls is
*  if you're not allowed to import a child sex doll.
*  So it's the importation of it that's illegal, not having one,
*  but trying to get it into the country just because the laws are kind of so old and creaky.
*  So I don't think actually it's something that we can stop with laws.
*  We can stop it by saying, actually, I don't want this.
*  And I'm prepared to accept compromise in my relationships.
*  And I'm prepared to accept that in order for me to grow as a person,
*  I need to be challenged and not constantly in a relationship
*  where all that matters is what I want.
*  Yeah. I mean, all those things sound right.
*  I agree with you.
*  It's not that I'm saying, no, no, no, you're wrong.
*  It would be better if these sex robots took over.
*  My real worry is that it doesn't matter what we think is right,
*  that technology always goes towards innovation.
*  It always goes towards improvements.
*  It always goes towards technology advancing where it's more effective,
*  more available, easier, better, cheaper, faster.
*  This is what we always do.
*  This is what we've done with every single thing we've ever invented.
*  And it's got to happen with that as well.
*  But I think the difference between our position is that you think
*  the march of technology is completely inevitable and there's nothing we can do
*  to kind of shape it or stop it. It's just going to happen.
*  Whereas I think I think none of this is inevitable.
*  And I think human beings are capable of, you know, adapting and changing
*  without technology.
*  And like this year is a really good example of this, that we're all waiting
*  for a vaccine. The vaccine has not arrived.
*  And so we've we've kind of saved ourselves by changing our behavior
*  and changing our behavior in a kind of altruistic way by staying at home,
*  even though like we might not get sick with coronavirus or wearing masks
*  for other people's benefit.
*  I think human beings are really adaptable and we can adapt
*  by changing our behavior rather than relying on technology.
*  And this march of technology only exists if we continue to always think
*  that technology is the solution.
*  People have to make this stuff and people have to buy this stuff
*  in order for it to march on.
*  And we always have the power to say, you know what, I don't want it.
*  I think reasonable people like yourself.
*  Yes, that's going to happen.
*  But clearly, you've seen videos of spring break in Fort Lauderdale
*  where kids are making out half naked on the beach.
*  Nobody gives a fuck about coronavirus.
*  And then there's maps that show the spread of them leaving Florida
*  and going all through the rest of the country and then all these infections
*  and show up there.
*  Totally. But there's a critical mass of there's enough people
*  that are being reasonable that when those things happen, it's really shit
*  and people get ill, but it's not the end of the world.
*  That's the point.
*  I think most people are reasonable and are able to behave in a kind of way
*  where where the good kind of wins out.
*  I think I agree with you on a lot of these things.
*  However, when I look at human beings, I try to look at human beings
*  as if I was from another planet, if I was an alien.
*  And I looked at them without any connection to the way they think
*  or behave or their culture.
*  And I said, well, what do these things do?
*  Well, this is what they do.
*  They make technology.
*  All they do is make technology.
*  They're obsessed with materialism, which plays into technology.
*  It plays into this want and need for the bigger, better, faster, greater thing
*  that comes around every year.
*  And that's what fuels them to work every day.
*  They go to work and they toil.
*  And one of the things they they reward themselves with is the newest, greatest thing.
*  And this is the fuel for this technological growth.
*  And this technological growth appears unstoppable
*  because it seems like that's all the human animal does.
*  If you looked at it from afar, objectively,
*  all I'm seeing is a constant wave of technology.
*  But I don't think that's true because we don't just make technology.
*  We also talk to each other and we communicate like you and I are now.
*  And we have discussions and we are capable of incredible change
*  and that we could live in a world where, you know, it was OK to keep slaves
*  and impregnate your wife every year and keep her in the kitchen.
*  But through having these discussions, we can really, really change the way we live
*  very drastically from one generation to the next.
*  It's not just technology.
*  You know, it's also what defines a human being is that we use technology
*  and that we're social animals.
*  And those are two different things.
*  And the idea that the the technological advancement is always going to win out
*  isn't necessarily what I buy.
*  I'm not saying it's going to win out.
*  I don't think it's going to win out.
*  I think it's just it's inevitable.
*  And I think we're going to.
*  But they're both inevitable.
*  And as a society, we can make change just as much as we can make change
*  by using technology.
*  Yeah, that is the fascinating balance. Right.
*  I mean, most people today are aware that they're addicted to their cell phones,
*  yet most people still use their cell phones.
*  We were aware that it's harming us, but yet we still use them
*  because we just know it's just a phone.
*  No big deal. But you know, it's a big deal.
*  Everybody I know it's a big deal.
*  I know I check my messages too much, but yet I still check my messages too much.
*  And I and I'm aware of it.
*  And I've read a lot of books about it.
*  But I think if you thought it was harming you enough,
*  if you thought it was destroying your brain cells, you wouldn't. Right.
*  The point is, it's about it's about how you weigh up harm and you think, yeah,
*  you know, I should probably be doing other things.
*  Oh, I shouldn't be constantly checking the Twitter feed of that person
*  I hate that's bad for my soul.
*  But you still do it because it's bad for your soul, but only a little bit.
*  And if it was really, really corrosive and bad
*  and then you would stop.
*  I mean, yeah, maybe if you're a healthy person
*  or maybe you're one of those people that likes to pick scabs
*  and you just you just keep scratching.
*  That's possible. Yeah, I'm I'm worried for people.
*  I really genuinely am.
*  And this is as a person who enjoys people.
*  I just I don't know how much time we have left in this form.
*  Like when I look at the archetypal alien,
*  when you see those little gray men with the big heads,
*  I'm worried that what that is is like we instinctively know that that's our future,
*  that we're going to be these genderless, weird things
*  reproduced through some sort of, you know, some sort of some sort of technology
*  instead of these bizarre, imperfect
*  biological creatures with emotions that we you and I both enjoy so much
*  because of all those all the weirdness.
*  I mean, my whole business, everything I do is about the weirdness
*  of people, whether it's standup comedy, whether it's podcast or even fighting.
*  When I do commentary on fighting, that's all the weirdness
*  and imperfect nature of the human animal.
*  And I think it's awesome.
*  I mean, I love people.
*  Don't get me wrong, I'm not rooting for technology to do this,
*  but I see the writing on the wall.
*  It's it's not pretty.
*  Well, the thing is, it's all about the richness of the human experience.
*  What makes it interesting to be human, which isn't just the basic functions
*  of our life or basic logic, you know, the fact that we have art galleries
*  everywhere and music, you know, music, which is completely, completely illogical.
*  It's because there's more to being human than those basic functions.
*  And when you talk about, you know, sexless aliens reproducing without sex,
*  like that kind of stuff is going to happen quite soon.
*  And, you know, I looked into quite a lot of this.
*  We can make like gametes, we can make cells.
*  They can do this in mice.
*  You can make sperm and eggs out of cheek cells.
*  So you could make an egg out of your cheek cell and sperm.
*  There'll be a future where people can make sperm and egg,
*  whichever one they need for whichever relationship they're in,
*  and that you can grow a baby outside the human body and we will become
*  less and less gendered. That is going to happen.
*  You know, the end of sex for reproduction is quite possible
*  that we will just have sex for fun and then we'll do babies
*  in this kind of very controlled way.
*  But we're always going to be weird human beings.
*  We're always going to like strange things like dancing around to music,
*  all the stuff that can't can't be explained.
*  And the drive to be weird and the drive to to to be illogical is very,
*  very powerful. And I just think
*  I think I'm not so deterministic about stuff.
*  And when I was when I was like doing all the work for my book,
*  I was quite worried it was going to be really depressing because, you know,
*  in in a book like mine, like you come you come to a conclusion
*  where it's like, well, there's a future where women might be obsolete,
*  where we can be replaced by robots and artificial uteruses.
*  And, you know, misogynist men can live without us or, you know,
*  all of these things are really dark and worrying.
*  But that's that's to buy a particular view of human nature as
*  as being a kind of slave to whatever comes next.
*  And we're too kind of weird and idiosyncratic,
*  I think, to be done away with that easily.
*  Well, I think the weird and idiosyncratic nature of people,
*  something that you and I both enjoy.
*  But, I mean, I think if you can replace men with cheek cells,
*  I mean, if you really can do that, if you really get to the point
*  where you can create sperm from your nose hairs or whatever
*  and you don't need a man anymore, what's or a woman or a woman.
*  Yeah, it's called in vitro gametogenesis, in vitro gametogenesis.
*  You can make gametes in vitro of anything.
*  And they've done it in mice and they're going to try and do it in humans.
*  So it is going to happen.
*  But it means, you know, gay couples can have babies without anyone donating anything.
*  That's the good part. That's the good part.
*  The bad part is no no more people having sex to make people.
*  And then we're going to realize as a society,
*  all of our problems are caused by emotions if we were just logical.
*  So we figured out a way to remove emotions.
*  And here's the thing.
*  Emotions, the good part about emotions are dopamine and serotonin. Right.
*  We all agree. And dopamine and serotonin, we can actually reproduce that in your own brain.
*  So we can have the same feelings of love and the same feelings of happiness.
*  But without all the illogical behavior that ruins lives.
*  So there'll be no more jealous boyfriends burning your house down.
*  There'll be no more chaos, no more murder, no more violence, no more any of this.
*  Everybody needs to sign up.
*  Or, you know, or you're a barbarian or you're some terrible person who who doesn't want progress.
*  Yeah, emotions are holding us back.
*  That's what I'm worried about.
*  It's like a slippery slide into us becoming something,
*  something different and more more predictable.
*  Man, this is really dark.
*  But you're right. I mean, well, I mean, it's it is quite possible.
*  As a as a thing.
*  Yeah, it is dark for us as a species.
*  I mean, I think the the the idea, you're right, that those emotions, they can be
*  artificially induced anyway, and it's the natural emotions that are.
*  But all of this is depending on a world where there's a system where everybody has access
*  to all that technology or all those drugs or all those whatever.
*  And, you know, there will be accidents.
*  There will be babies born naturally.
*  There will be, you know. Yeah.
*  Yeah. And then and then maybe those people will will have, you know,
*  because they will be naturally selected in a different way.
*  Maybe they will have a completely different take on things that will save us all.
*  The thing that's really scary about the whole being able to make sperm and eggs
*  from cheek cells is that it means you can make an infinite number of eggs.
*  So at the moment, the number of babies a couple can have is limited by the number of eggs
*  a woman can produce.
*  And if you can make eggs from cheek cells, then you could have a billion eggs.
*  Which means that you could you could, you know, conceive a million fetuses
*  and you could artificially select like the best one.
*  So you don't need CRISPR for that in terms of genetic engineering.
*  When you can make unlimited numbers of fetuses between a couple and choose
*  which is the best one. And that's not, you know, if this thing can happen,
*  that you can make eggs.
*  That's not a difficult thing to do.
*  And we're not that far away off all of that.
*  Yeah, there's so many things to worry about.
*  I had a conversation once with Ray Kurzweil, where he was talking to me about
*  the ability in the future that we'll have the ability to download consciousness
*  into a computer and that you'll be able to take your consciousness
*  and put it into a computer, because essentially consciousness is something
*  that we're going to be able to replicate it.
*  It's going to be something that we can just recreate with computer programs
*  and software and all.
*  And my thought was, why?
*  OK, well, what if someone's crazy?
*  What if like some Kim Jong-un guy decides to make a billion of him?
*  Like, if you have this world, this artificial world that you're going to live in,
*  if you're going to live inside this computer, right?
*  I'm assuming there's some sort of an environment that's compatible
*  with the human consciousness.
*  So you're going to create some, you know, real world multiplayer game
*  where people live inside of it.
*  What's to stop someone like Donald Trump from making a billion Donald Trumps?
*  Right. What's to stop you from doing that?
*  This is like a big, big philosophical experiment then,
*  because the question is, why would it matter if this is all virtual and none of it's real?
*  This is basically a computer simulation.
*  Why does it matter if in that computer game, there's a billion Donald Trumps
*  and Kim Jong-il? Right.
*  Or why does it matter if you want to piss on your sex robot and punch it?
*  Like, it's not even a person.
*  I guess the difference with that is because it's going to change you as a person
*  when you get used to behaving like that, whereas this uploaded consciousness world,
*  no human being is around to see it.
*  You've uploaded your consciousness.
*  It's doing its own thing in that world.
*  That world is a parallel universe where nothing matters.
*  But I think the idea of uploading your consciousness is very interesting
*  because there's an incredible narcissism in that.
*  There's this idea that people will want to know you after you're gone
*  and your your consciousness deserves to be preserved.
*  There isn't enough space in anybody's kind of, you know,
*  how could you deal with a world where the consciousness of every human being
*  who's ever lived is in there?
*  There'd just be too much going on.
*  Do you know what I mean? Oh, yeah.
*  If you could remember all of your ancestors, you know, how would that affect you
*  if you constantly had the judgment of your great, great, great, great, great,
*  great grandparents to deal with as well as your parents or whatever?
*  I don't think that would be very good.
*  Well, not only that, like, who's to say that once they do upload your consciousness
*  into some computer, that they won't have some infinitely better version
*  of this software and hardware down the line?
*  Are they going to transfer you again?
*  Are they? Do you?
*  And who's going to do that at some point in time?
*  Exactly. Are we going to be able to take your consciousness
*  and continually upgrade it?
*  Are you going to have to sign on to some some gold group?
*  Like, well, if you sign up to this path, this plan, you know,
*  we upgrade you every two years to the newest, latest, greatest software.
*  And, you know, you get a wonderful place in heaven.
*  Like, what are we doing?
*  I know. And who's to say that we were not going to be doing CRISPR
*  for people's consciousnesses and editing out?
*  We'll say, we'll take out your mental illnesses
*  and then eventually we will take out your your irrationality
*  and your bad moods and your antisocial habits.
*  And then, you know, so, yeah, the point is, you know,
*  nobody who develops technology can ever control where it goes.
*  And the problem is, we're really uncritical about technology
*  because we're so used to science fiction where technology is either really bad
*  or it's wonderful.
*  There's never this gray area in between where it's sometimes really
*  could be used for real good, but has a potentially really dark application
*  if it's used in a society that isn't fair or that has certain ideas
*  about certain individuals.
*  And that's the reality in which we live.
*  Whereas, you know, at the moment, we're stuck between, I don't know,
*  the Terminator and, I don't know, some sunny future.
*  You know, there's nothing.
*  Is there ever a sunny future, though?
*  There's I don't know of any science fiction movie where it looks awesome in the future.
*  It's always like really distraught, dystopian.
*  Hmm. Yeah, I can't think of any positive ones at the moment.
*  I'm sure there are.
*  There must be.
*  There's quite often in science fiction, there's technology that's being used
*  for incredible good.
*  There's just, you know, we've solved that problem or, you know,
*  yeah, we no longer, you know, we've got we can grow meat without killing animals
*  and that's all fine and everything's fine and that's sorted.
*  It's no longer a debate.
*  And even things like, you know, like in Blade Runner, yes,
*  the robots there are bad, but they're also perfect and flawless
*  and don't have any problems with them.
*  Do you know what I mean?
*  Yeah. Anyway.
*  But yes, most science fiction is dystopian because it's about our inner fears,
*  about how we we can't really control anything.
*  What it also seems like one of the things that people enjoy is
*  we enjoy enduring and recovering and overcoming obstacles.
*  And if we get to a point where we've removed that,
*  where will the joy come from?
*  There will be more obstacles.
*  We'll always invent more obstacles.
*  This is the whole thing that when, you know, when you live in a country
*  where there is no longer the threat of nuclear war, starvation, death,
*  there'll be another obstacle with, you know, body dysmorphia or whatever.
*  We'll invent something else.
*  Do you know what I mean? Like, yeah, we will.
*  I mean, I think I think that human beings are
*  we are constantly trying to control everything around us.
*  And we're constantly in fear of the chaos around us.
*  And that's why we use technology to try and give us this
*  illusion of control over the world.
*  And there are some things that we really can control.
*  And technology has been great at doing that.
*  You know, I'm I I'm very grateful for technological advancements
*  in birth control that mean I haven't been like perpetually pregnant
*  for the past 20 years is a great thing that I can control that part of my body.
*  But ultimately, there are many things that we just can't control.
*  And that technology doesn't solve problems.
*  It circumvents them.
*  It gives us a kind of easy way out of them instead of forcing us
*  to confront the cause of the problem.
*  It's just like plastering over them.
*  And so, yeah, I think a lot of of the human condition
*  is this struggle between wanting to control everything
*  and having to deal with the fact that ultimately we have no control over anything.
*  And also implementing our ideas.
*  And that's that's part of the problems that people are constantly trying
*  to come up with new, better ways to do things.
*  And then we implement these new, better ways to do things.
*  And then we deal with the repercussions and the consequences of these new changes.
*  Totally. Of the way that we've implemented.
*  Yeah. Yes. And and this there's a I've got the perfect example of this,
*  which is when I was in Las Vegas doing part of the reporting,
*  I went and interviewed a man who'd made a sex robot, a very bad sex robot in Las Vegas.
*  And then I went back to my hotel and they were playing really, really loud music
*  in outside the entrance to the hotel to try and get people to come into the casino.
*  And I went up to my room and there was like a dish next to my bed
*  of different kinds of earplugs of like silicone earplugs, foam earplugs,
*  wax earplugs, all these solutions to the problem caused by the management there.
*  And they could just turn the music off.
*  But instead, they've given you this profusion of solutions.
*  Which hotel were you at?
*  Oh, I can't remember. It was in downtown in L.A.
*  and not in L.A. in Las Vegas.
*  I can't remember the name.
*  The name of it was a while ago.
*  It was this ridiculous.
*  It wasn't it wasn't even a grimy hotel, but it's like a good example of this
*  is also like with our phones, we're all addicted to our phones,
*  so we can't sleep properly.
*  So people are taking melatonin so that they feel sleepy.
*  But you could just put your phone down.
*  Do you know what I mean? Yeah.
*  So we've become addicted to different orders of magnitude of technology
*  to solve problems caused by technology.
*  Do you ever go camping?
*  I'm not a big camper, but I have been camping, yes, many times.
*  The interesting thing about camping is if you do it for enough days,
*  you realize that your brain, when it gets dark out,
*  you start preparing to go to sleep.
*  And normally, you know, like eight o'clock at night, I'm wide awake.
*  I'm wide awake for several hours at 8 p.m.
*  But when I'm camping at eight o'clock, it's like, well, let's get ready.
*  Let's eat and crash.
*  You know, you sit around the campfire, talk a little bit
*  and you get ready to go to sleep.
*  That's just what it's.
*  But that's your natural cycle.
*  We've circumvented that with light.
*  I mean, if you look at the, you know, the effect of technology on human beings,
*  it doesn't have to be something as fancy as a perfect sex robot lights.
*  Like artificial lighting has changed human society, human brain chemistry.
*  If you look at 150 years ago when everybody went to bed
*  and it's simple things that we don't have to go to sleep as soon as it gets dark
*  and how much we have changed because of that.
*  It's incredible.
*  So that's the other thing is the things that really have
*  have potential for radical change on human society, human behavior and human biology.
*  They don't have to be very fancy and high tech.
*  You don't have to have Elon Musk's, you know, Bluetooth brain chip.
*  There's one even more insidious aspect for lights.
*  And that's it's disconnected us from the universe.
*  The one of the things that you realize when you do go camping,
*  when there's no lights is, oh, my God, we're in space.
*  Like you see all the stars and it's extraordinary.
*  When you go like I went to the Keck Observatory once in Hawaii.
*  Well, I've been a few times, but one time I nailed it where I went,
*  where there was no moon and the sky was clear and it was stunning.
*  And to this day, I still I'll close my eyes sometimes and try to remember that.
*  Remember what it was like because you could see the whole Milky Way.
*  You could see every the Keck Observatory is very high on the big island
*  and it's above the clouds.
*  And in fact, when we were driving there was cloudy and I was like, damn,
*  this is going to suck.
*  We're going to get all the way up there and we can't see anything because these clouds.
*  But then you pop through the clouds and then you get to the observatory.
*  And it is amazing.
*  The just without looking through a telescope, just the amount of stars that you see.
*  It's so stunning.
*  It changes your relationship to to life and to this experience that we're having here on Earth.
*  We're so delusional when we don't see any stars.
*  We have streetlights and we're looking at our phone and we're watching TV.
*  We have this bizarre idea of what life is.
*  But then when you're there and there's nothing but the stars in the sky, you go,
*  oh, no, this is an organic spaceship.
*  We're hurling through space on this ball.
*  And I thought this was everything, but it's nothing.
*  When you see all those stars, it just it's it humbles you in a way that our ancestors
*  were humbled and why they were so obsessed with the constellations, why they're so obsessed
*  with the zodiac signs and all the different ways that these would study all the lights
*  in the sky and try to figure out what kind of relationship we had with those lights.
*  We've lost all that.
*  We've lost the context and the perspective on our existence that we need, really.
*  But then again, also, would we could we really function if we were constantly aware of how
*  infinitesimally small and incompetent we are?
*  I guess it would liberate us from being so obsessed with gazing at our own navels.
*  I think it would probably be humbling in a way that would eliminate a lot of unnecessary
*  hubris. I think there's a lot of dumb.
*  Shit that we do that is connected to this sort of dulled perception of our place in
*  the universe. And I think if we could see it and it could humble us the way it humbled
*  the Mayans and all these other civilizations that were constantly fixated on the celestial
*  gods and all the all the different lights in the skies, I think I think it would be
*  better for us. But I think my fear is that all of this is like we're.
*  And again, this is looking at it outside of a human being.
*  All of this is leading us towards this complete total immersion in technology.
*  And one of the best ways to get us to not think about our position in this vast infinite
*  universe is that we don't see it.
*  What was the best way to not see it?
*  Technology blind you, literally blind you to the most spectacular vision the world has
*  ever known. The most spectacular vision is the heavens, is the sky, the stars, the Milky
*  Way, all the galaxies that are visible to the naked eye.
*  That's that's what gave people so much wonder and and created so many myths of what's
*  going on up there. Well, if the best way to eliminate that and have us fixated totally
*  on ourselves and become self-centered is to blind us to it.
*  And that's what we've done. We've done that with lights.
*  But I think it's also all of this is also to do with capitalism and that capitalism
*  depends on us all feeling incomplete and like we need the next big thing in order to be
*  complete. So we need this bit of technology will solve this problem or I will be fine.
*  I will be happy if I have bought this thing or if I bought into this solution.
*  And there's no money to be made saying, hey, what you really need to do is get a proper
*  night's sleep, go and do some exercise.
*  But you don't need to. You don't need anything fancy to do some exercise.
*  You know, eat a little less if you're trying to make lose weight.
*  But all you need to do is eat a little less.
*  There's no money to be made in that way.
*  So we're kind of we are robbed of our context because capitalism depends on us thinking
*  that we can control everything and be a kind of self-determined beings if we just buy the
*  next thing and are always focused on our own project and what we're going to do next to
*  achieve the goal we want.
*  There's there's no money to be made in telling people everything as it is right now is fine
*  and good and you should just appreciate it.
*  Right. We don't do that.
*  You're you're absolutely right.
*  But that's what we were talking about earlier when I was saying that I feel like materialism,
*  which was is one of the great plagues of humanity.
*  This desire for for shiny things that are supposedly going to make us happy is also
*  fueling technology, because in order to keep up with the human desire for these things,
*  we're constantly creating newer and better things.
*  So all of our ridiculous instincts to acquire these things are literally fueling the
*  innovation of technology.
*  But again, I would say I agree with you.
*  But again, I would say like we have the power to say, you know, I don't need these earplugs.
*  I'm just going to turn the music down or or, you know, I don't want this sex robot.
*  I'm just going to deal with, you know, we ultimately we have the power of being consumers
*  and the consumer has the power to not want something.
*  And that's where real power lies in being in control of your desires and not just being
*  led along by someone saying you need this, you need this, you know, having the power to
*  say, I don't think that I do need this and I'm fine just as I am.
*  I agree with you, but I don't think people are going to say that.
*  I think they're going to give right in.
*  I don't think anybody's moving to a log cabin in the woods either.
*  I think you're like one out of a million, one out of a million.
*  And we look at those people like they figured it out.
*  You don't have to move to a log cabin, though.
*  You just need to say, you know, I've got a house that suits my purposes and it's fine
*  and I'm happy with it and my life is good.
*  I don't you know, I'm not I don't care if people look at what car I've got and judge
*  me on it. Those people aren't worthwhile.
*  I mean, I'm not saying that you give up all your possessions and become a hippie.
*  I quite like having stuff, but I reached a point in my life where, you know, I've got
*  a job that I love and I have two kids.
*  I have a lovely family and I am very, very aware of feeling like I'm there and I
*  am I have everything that I want and other possessions.
*  They might be nice, but actually I feel fulfilled.
*  But then when you feel fulfilled, you're aware of how the how much the world is
*  constantly trying to tell us that you'll only be fulfilled when you've got this
*  or when you've done this.
*  But I would I would submit that you are a very intelligent, introspective person.
*  And I think that's rare.
*  I don't think a lot of people feel very fulfilled.
*  A lot of people have a different view of human nature.
*  I think most human beings are really good people who just want to get along and that
*  they're. Oh, I agree with that.
*  I agree with that. But what don't you agree?
*  Well, I agree. Most human beings are really good people that want to get along.
*  But I think they will give in the siren song of materialism and technology and all
*  these different things, because I don't think they're as introspective as you are.
*  You're looking at it and you're like, this is perfect.
*  I've got this. I don't need any more.
*  This is fine. I realize all the things that are fucking up my life and fucking up
*  society. And I'm not going to give any of that.
*  But you're an author. You're someone who thinks all the time.
*  You literally spend hours every day thinking.
*  We need we need to encourage critical thinking.
*  There isn't really enough of that.
*  There is 100 percent.
*  At the moment, like particularly in the way that we communicate now, which is about
*  people being angry and then other people being angry and then other people enjoying
*  watching the two sides fight.
*  The skill of being able to think critically and to to enjoy the gray
*  area where both sides are kind of right here.
*  I think that we're going to move away from this era because it's you know, I
*  don't think we're going to get more and more polarized because it's only so far
*  that we can all go without killing each other.
*  Basically, we're pretty far polarized.
*  Pretty far apart. And you know, and in the UK as well, you know.
*  But eventually, I think when we are no longer enjoying being spectators
*  or participants in this sort of violent debate, you know, we'll we'll be looking
*  we'll be able to look at the gray area and look at what's valuable in that.
*  And we need to encourage critical thinking and not just take not taking sides.
*  You know, I agree with you 100 percent.
*  And I hope this is where it gets ironic, because I feel like conversations like
*  this are what help people because they it resonates.
*  What you're saying resonates with people.
*  They hear your words and they go, she's right.
*  She's right. I got I'm going to a judge.
*  I'm going to adjust the way I think.
*  But it's technology that's got us to this position in the first place.
*  We're more polarized now with more connection than we've ever had before.
*  We have more connection with each other than ever before.
*  But the problem is that connection is very crude.
*  It's very clunky and through the quality of the connection.
*  Yes. It's through texting and this this weird thing we're doing with Twitter and
*  Instagram. It's like we're more connected, but we're more connected in a way that
*  doesn't we don't feel it.
*  And so I tell you more polarized.
*  What really the big difference now is that, you know, a friend of mine said to me,
*  he's totally right. And it's something that I've discovered over the past five,
*  ten years that if you want a superpower, the superpower is to listen, to really
*  listen to what what people are actually saying and not what you want them to say
*  or how you know to really, really properly listen, because people are just not
*  listening to you anymore.
*  And I have, you know, in one respect, I write books and I write really long
*  articles. And when I do those interviews with people, I interview them for a long
*  time and I transcribe it all myself.
*  I don't use a computer or pay anyone else to do it.
*  And it's so dull and I hate it.
*  But that's where I really understand what people are saying.
*  And that's where I get all the ideas for structure.
*  And then I have another part of my work that I do is I present a radio show, which
*  is completely the different a different thing where I'm interviewing people for
*  like six or seven minutes.
*  And I'm learning I'm learning the skill of that and part of the skill of when
*  you're doing really short interviews, you're meant to kind of ask questions that
*  force people into saying saying things or trap people in a way.
*  And the performance is you asking the question rather than you listening to the
*  answer and thinking, OK, what would be an interesting question to ask next?
*  And that is much more common.
*  I mean, I love my radio show. I'm not saying my radio show is like that, but I'm
*  saying I'm learning how to deal with a world where that's what's traditionally
*  done is the style of interviewing is a kind of a dance that you do with people
*  instead of asking a question where you think the answer might be interesting and
*  then really listening to the answer.
*  People don't really do that anymore.
*  And if they did, you know, you can you know this more than more than anyone else,
*  the power of giving people proper time and really, really listening and
*  responding, because in the world that we're living in now, people feel like they
*  don't have time for that.
*  One hundred percent.
*  I think everything you're saying is why podcasts are so popular today.
*  Yes.
*  Yes. Particularly a podcast like this where there's there's very few people
*  involved. It's basically just you and me and my producer Jamie's over here working
*  the controls. That's it.
*  And because of that, we can explore these ideas in long form.
*  And what I've learned over the years is to listen and to to just my the whole
*  concept of having a conversation with a person with a with a person trying to
*  think the way they think.
*  Don't try to be right.
*  Don't try to get them in a gotcha.
*  I don't ever try to do that.
*  I just try to I try to figure out what you're thinking and then I'll present you
*  maybe something that's contrary or controversial.
*  Or I just want to see how you react.
*  And I want to I want to I want to feel the way your brain works.
*  And I want to I want to let you breathe.
*  I want to give you room to explore these ideas and thoughts.
*  And when people listen, they're essentially allowing you to think for them in a way.
*  They're like you're you're talking and they're like, oh, Jenny's got some really
*  good points. Like it's working in their brain like, oh, OK.
*  And you don't get that in a short form.
*  No, you don't. And the popularity of your podcast shows that people really want
*  that. They want to be able to really explode ideas and hear the different parts
*  of that you can take through an idea.
*  Whereas most news journalism is about forcing news lines out of people, like
*  getting this politician to say that they fucked up or getting this celebrity to
*  admit that they did whatever or, you know, managing to skewer someone into saying
*  something or admitting something.
*  And and it's just it's the opposite of what I do.
*  It's the opposite of what you do.
*  But most people assume that's what the public wants is these new lines.
*  Or have you heard this has happened?
*  That's happened.
*  Whereas actually, I think people are really hungry to hear properly, you know,
*  nuanced debates where different sides of things are weighed up and people are not
*  kind of sparring.
*  Yeah, they want to hear people explore ideas.
*  That's what they really want to hear.
*  And they want to hear people explore ideas honestly, whether they're not
*  manipulating people's words or not playing weird games.
*  They're just trying to find out how each other views things.
*  And I hope there's an appetite for that.
*  As somebody who generally does, you know,
*  the articles I write are like five thousand words.
*  They take a long time to write. I write books.
*  You know, I hope that that people are always going to see the value of that,
*  because doing that kind of stuff takes takes time and it takes thought and energy.
*  And it's it's not as disposable as doing this quick interview where you're you know,
*  you're really clever and you've managed to get someone to say something or admit
*  something that they haven't admitted to anyone else.
*  But that's that's where the real meal is,
*  is in the really, really long stuff where people are actually listening to each other.
*  Have you thought about doing a podcast?
*  I'd love to do a podcast.
*  I did I did a like a podcast documentary, a kind of true crime thing
*  where I kind of did a story as a podcast.
*  I did it was a story about this Dutch
*  fertility doctor who was really successful in the 1980s.
*  And and then it transpired recently that the reason why he got such great results
*  is he was using his own sperm to inseminate all his patients.
*  And there are now like 70 Dutch kids who all look like him who are trying to get
*  justice. It's a great story. Yeah, I heard about that story.
*  That's insane. I did that. But then I would love I mean,
*  a podcast like this where I'm sitting and interviewing people, I think I've probably
*  I probably enjoy that too. You'd be great at it.
*  You really should do it. You'd be fantastic at it.
*  I really think that's I mean, you're built for it.
*  Endorsement. I would love I would love to do it.
*  I guess it's all about picking the right people, isn't it?
*  I mean, how do you choose who comes on your show?
*  Just has to be interesting.
*  That's all I do.
*  Luckily, there's no one telling me who to have on.
*  So I just find people's books interesting or I find the subject matter interesting or
*  I'll watch a video interview with them with someone else.
*  I like the way they think.
*  And I just want to talk to them.
*  That's it. That's the only the only motivation.
*  And occasionally some of them are famous.
*  You know, like there's some really interesting, famous people.
*  But that's it. Or maybe an artist that I really enjoy or whatever it is with an
*  author. I really enjoy their work.
*  I just I just like to talk to people that I'm interested in.
*  And that's my only that's my compass.
*  Like, have you ever asked to speak to somebody and it's turned out they're not
*  that interesting? Yeah.
*  Yeah. About a few of those.
*  I don't need to mention any names.
*  Yeah. That's the question where I'm trying to get a news line out of you.
*  Yeah, I don't want to be mean.
*  Yeah, there's there's there's some that I thought were going to be interesting.
*  It just turned out to be sad.
*  You know, it just was it was depressing.
*  And, you know,
*  but I think you're you're lucky in that you have a reason to have a podcast,
*  which is that you're a comedian, you know, you do your ultimate fighting thing.
*  You have you as a brand.
*  And for me, the problem that I've had as a journalist my whole life
*  is that people always say, like, what kind of journalist are you?
*  And I'm a journalist who, like, I look at stuff I find interesting,
*  whereas most other journalists, they're like, you know, I'm an environmental
*  journalist or I write about women's issues or I'm a political specialist.
*  And I've only ever I've been I'm like you.
*  Like, I want to do whatever interests me.
*  But I haven't been given the same
*  opportunities to do it because I don't have that other thing, which is I'm a
*  comedian, so you should come along with me and what I think, because, you know.
*  Yeah, but you're a respected broadcaster.
*  Like, people know who you are.
*  You're an author, a published author.
*  I think if you build it, they will come.
*  I really do.
*  I really think you should do it.
*  OK, well, if you say so, then I've got to.
*  Please, please do it.
*  Let's talk about vegan meat.
*  I want to talk more about that because
*  I've always found the vegan substitutes to be very disgusting and weird.
*  Weird because this is a thing that you don't like, right?
*  You don't like the fact that people are eating meat.
*  So I understand you're trying to indoctrinate people, but look, you don't
*  have to eat meat, you could have this fake burger that's actually terrible for you,
*  actually worse for you than real beef, but filled with all these disgusting
*  processed oils that mimic the taste of beef in some strange way.
*  So why don't you have that?
*  I've always found that to be so weird because I feel like if you do veganism
*  correctly, it's great to have vegetable dishes that taste good.
*  But shouldn't they be fucking vegetables?
*  Like, why are you tricking yourself?
*  Like, what do we like if you're a cannibal and you're like,
*  can we all agree cannibalism is bad?
*  Yes, we can. OK, so let's have fake babies that you can eat.
*  Like, we would never agree to that, right?
*  But yet we'll agree to these fake burgers.
*  That's like we all know what a burger is.
*  It's ground up meat.
*  So you have a fake burger.
*  Like, why are we doing that?
*  Why can't you just eat vegetables?
*  Why we have to play these weird gymnastic, mental gymnastic games?
*  The people who make this stuff.
*  So there's two things.
*  There's plant based meat, which is meat substitutes, clever meat substitutes made
*  not from animals. And then there's the stuff that I look at a lot in the book,
*  which is meat that is is grown from cells that are cloned in a lab,
*  medium grown in a lab.
*  So but with both of them, they all come down to a particular view of human nature,
*  which is that human beings are incapable of change, that human beings should be
*  eating less meat because it's bad for our bodies.
*  It's bad for the planet.
*  Enormous contributor to carbon emissions, antibiotic resistance, water pollution,
*  water wastage, land wastage.
*  It's a disaster.
*  You know, zoonotic diseases, diseases that jump from animals into humans like swine
*  flu, bird flu, maybe coronavirus are linked to animal agriculture.
*  So we have to stop eating so much meat.
*  But this particular the people who make this stuff think human beings are not
*  going to change. So we have to give them what they want.
*  We have to give them what they want.
*  So we have to make a burger that looks like a burger, because the whole premise
*  behind all of this is that the kind of ethical campaign of animal rights has
*  failed, that you can see pictures of animals in abattoirs and yet people still eat meat.
*  Like they shut their eyes when they open their mouth.
*  They just don't want to see it.
*  They know it's cruel, but they like it because it's tasty.
*  And so we've got to give them something
*  that looks the same and tastes the same, but isn't the same.
*  And that's how the kind of animal rights campaign will win, not with arguments,
*  not with saying, oh, you should just like vegetables more.
*  And so it's quite a dim view of human nature, which is, you know, we're never
*  going to win people over with arguments.
*  So we're going to give them something. And yeah, maybe very unhealthy.
*  I mean, some of the plant based meats that's being made now is very convincing.
*  And but it's ultra processed food.
*  And also to make those plant proteins taste and feel like animal proteins,
*  you have to ship a lot of elements from around the world and put them together.
*  So it might be responsible for a lot of carbon.
*  And actually, you know, I think we just need to eat less meat.
*  You know, the argument of meat being bad for you, most of those arguments are
*  epidemiology arguments, meaning you ask people, what do you eat?
*  How often do you eat meat?
*  And then you find out who's having heart attacks.
*  It's not meat being bad for you.
*  It's usually that the people that eat meat are eating a lot of other shit, too.
*  They're usually eating French fries and drinking soda.
*  And there's a lot of contributing factors to them being unhealthy.
*  There are some things that you can pull out, like, you know, colon cancer is really
*  connected to to red meat.
*  There are different there are different, you know, when you talk about meat being
*  bad for you, that's a big umbrella.
*  And yes, obesity is caused by a lot of different things.
*  But over consumption of large quantities of meat is connected to heart disease.
*  But again, it's connected through these epidemiology studies.
*  That's the way it's connected.
*  There's no one who's shown a study, people who eat grass fed grass
*  finished beef and organic vegetables only over a period of X years.
*  What are the results? Because I guarantee you it's they would be healthy humans.
*  That's what societies where people don't eat like where people generally immune
*  epidemiological. But when you when you look at societies where
*  traditionally there is not a dairy culture or a beef culture, how those societies have
*  changed when when it's become fashionable to have dairy in those in those cultures
*  and what kind of diseases have sprung up because of that.
*  I think I mean, I would need to go and look at the evidence base.
*  But I do think there's quite a well established link between over consumption.
*  And I mean, over consumption of meat.
*  So like eating it every day several times a day.
*  I don't think there is. I've looked into it.
*  I think, yeah, the real issue is human beings have eaten meat since we were human
*  beings. We've always eaten meat.
*  This idea that all of a sudden meat is bad for you.
*  Meat is protein and water and amino acids.
*  It's not bad for you.
*  What's bad for you is, first of all, processed sugar and nasty carbohydrates and
*  and those fake burgers.
*  All that shit's terrible for you.
*  What's bad for you is hydrogenated vegetable oils and all the sugars and all.
*  Yeah, but I would say what's bad for you is the over consumption of anything.
*  So, yeah, human beings have eaten meat since the beginning of time, but you would
*  kill one animal and then live off that one animal for a really, really long time
*  and then maybe go quite a few days without getting another kill the same way.
*  It's the greediness and the over consumption of it that's bad for you.
*  Well, obesity for sure is bad for you.
*  So the over consumption of anything,
*  meaning too many calories, more than your body's burning off and you get obese.
*  Obviously, that's terrible for you.
*  But most animals are edible.
*  So when human beings were evolving, we ate whatever we could get a hold of.
*  Most plants are inedible.
*  And when you're running around trying to figure out what you can eat and what you
*  can eat, the animals that survived are the ones that ate other animals.
*  If you just run around, unless you're an animal like a cow that figures out, well,
*  I'm just going to stick to grass because grass seems to work out for me.
*  Well, what happens when we feed cows things that aren't grass?
*  They get really sick.
*  I mean, that's one of the problems with if
*  you ever watch any of those documentaries on on how they raise cattle to make them
*  fat and you see, oh, it's horrific what happens to their stomachs and their bodies.
*  And when you see a well marbled piece of meat that people think is delicious,
*  that's a dying animal that that animal is dying.
*  That's why it's so fat.
*  But that's not normal.
*  And this juicy steak that's well marbled,
*  it's because you've made that thing sick, that poor animal sick.
*  And now you're eating a sick animal.
*  That's well, there's two things I'd say to that.
*  And one is, yes, I mean, the problem is industrial agriculture,
*  producing a factory production line of animals because we are all eating meat so
*  much, it is unsustainable.
*  The only way to produce it and produce it
*  cheaply enough is to produce it in that way.
*  And it's disgusting.
*  I saw some of these farms from the outside as part of part of my research for it.
*  And it's like it's it's disgusting and awful.
*  There's the Harris Ranch that's in between L.A. and
*  San Francisco, the nickname is Cowshwitz because it's like a giant concentration
*  camp for cows, it's horrific, they're all just crammed in there.
*  But then I think you also have to be careful talking about it being natural to
*  eat meat on the basis of the fact that as cavemen, that's what we did.
*  It is natural, but that doesn't mean to say that that meat, that's a reason why we
*  should continue to.
*  I'm talking to you as someone who is still a carnivore.
*  I still eat meat now, even though I wrote this this book where I set out the
*  argument for why eating meat at the levels that we're doing now is completely
*  unsustainable. So I like the way it tastes.
*  But the thing is, there's a lot of the way that we live now.
*  You know, it was natural for us to be naked and for us to die when we were 30.
*  There's a lot that was natural before
*  that that we don't necessarily live with now.
*  And the point is, I think a lot of people are very defensive about their right to
*  continue eating meat because we really like it.
*  It's tasty. It's part of our culture.
*  It's something that we don't want to let go of.
*  And that's why people are going to all these great lengths to give us these kind
*  of substitutes because it's such a big part of who we are.
*  But it's difficult to make an argument
*  that it's right for us to continue eating meat because it's natural, because it's
*  good for us, because those arguments, I think, don't necessarily stand up.
*  But it is OK to say, I want to continue eating meat because I like the taste of it.
*  I think the argument that it's it's right
*  to eat meat is a very tough argument to make when you talk about factory farming.
*  And I agree with you 100 percent.
*  It's disgusting.
*  And it shows the worst aspects of human nature that we have conceded that the best
*  way to feed people en masse is to stuff these animals into these
*  disgusting factories and these huge warehouses and have them live in their own
*  shit like you've seen pigs and cows and chickens and all these animals that are
*  treated this way. I don't think that that is the only way to raise animals.
*  And if you if you talk to people that specialize in regenerative agriculture,
*  they can not only can they not have this massive carbon emission,
*  but they can generate carbon neutral farms.
*  There's a guy named Joel Salatin who runs a farm called Polyface Farms that he
*  speaks to people all over the world about this particular style of regenerative
*  farming and about letting these animals live like they would naturally only eating
*  grass. He he he sets up these enormous chicken coops in their mobile where these
*  chicken coops, he moves them all throughout the farm.
*  So these chickens can go out and free range and then come back in.
*  And he loses a tremendous amount of chickens to natural predators like hawks
*  and eagles and things along those lines.
*  But his his take on things is that it's completely immoral what human beings have
*  done in the name of profit as far as raising animals and that it should have
*  never been done. And that that is the main argument against animal agriculture is
*  factory farming.
*  Yes, but I would say that even though that sounds great and it is great, there is not
*  enough land on planet Earth for all the meat that we're currently eating to be
*  produced that way. And particularly as the population is increasing.
*  It is true. You know, I think we'd need like five other planets for everybody to
*  continue eating meat at the level that we're doing that we're eating it now.
*  The population of the Earth is going to be, you know, 50 percent again what it is now
*  by 2050. Unless they factory farm, unless they factory farm the way they're farming
*  it right now. There is no way that we could meet the
*  demands of, you know, of all of those people eating meat, particularly if
*  there's going to be nine billion people on the planet by 2050 with the land that
*  we have now. So you're talking about an expansion of
*  population. But with the current population that we have right now, is it
*  sustainable to live in a way where they don't have to factory farm?
*  I think it is. I think it is sustainable if we eat less meat.
*  That's the thing. If we don't eat it twice a day, seven days a week, if we eat it
*  twice a week, it's a complex issue.
*  And I honestly don't think neither you nor I have all the data at our fingertips
*  where we could argue this. But I think we'll both agree that,
*  first of all, factory farming is fucking disgusting.
*  It's horrific.
*  And it's, I mean, I think it's one of the worst things that human beings do
*  in terms of not just our impact on the world itself,
*  but also how we feel about what we do.
*  There's something if you know that you're eating something that was tortured
*  most of its life, but you do it anyway just because it's delicious.
*  How could you respect yourself?
*  Like, how do you feel about yourself?
*  I think it's very bad for us to accept factory farming.
*  And in America, we have these ag-gag laws that are even more disturbing where, say,
*  if you work in a factory farm and you find the conditions to be horrific
*  and you film it and take photographs of it, you go to jail.
*  They'll arrest you.
*  They'll lock you up for showing horrific
*  actions that will disgust most of the people that are eating that food,
*  which is really crazy.
*  Well, I think, I mean, most people when they eat food,
*  they know kind of theoretically that it is produced generally through a lot
*  of cruelty, but they just push it out of their minds.
*  Yeah. You can't thinking about that on a daily basis.
*  If we agree that most people are good people, they don't want to feel like
*  they're complicit in the torture of animals on a daily basis.
*  But that is what's going on at the moment, really.
*  And even the ones that live a good life, they still have to be killed for us to eat them.
*  Well, they don't live forever if you don't kill them.
*  I don't know if you know that.
*  It's not like if you don't kill them, they become fairies.
*  It's not very nice to be killed.
*  No, it's not.
*  But if they do it effectively and humanely, it's instantaneous.
*  And they do that raw to the brain.
*  It really is instantaneous.
*  It's a very messy, complicated argument, though.
*  Right. Is it OK for human beings to kill their animals?
*  Yes.
*  And for me, what's interesting is like, I am on an intellectual level.
*  I buy the arguments.
*  I totally agree with the arguments for not eating meat.
*  I wrote all about all of this.
*  And that's why I was a kind of interesting person to go and look into this world of,
*  OK, so if you could grow meat without any animal dying.
*  And I ate a chicken nugget that came from a chicken called Ian who's still alive.
*  So I ate a piece of meat from an animal that's still alive.
*  So I'm the kind of dream target market of this stuff because...
*  How vile was it?
*  It was really bad.
*  It was bad in a way that you don't really expect because
*  it tasted like chicken because it was chicken.
*  But it's chicken cells that have been
*  grown in a lab and they're in a kind of mass, a mushy mass.
*  So it wasn't like it didn't have it didn't have the texture of meat at all.
*  It didn't have, you know, fibres in it.
*  It wasn't a cut of meat.
*  And, you know, when you eat meat,
*  but the texture is not quite right or something's not quite right,
*  you have a kind of primal response where your brain is saying,
*  throw it out. Yeah.
*  So I had that.
*  But then I had all these PR people looking at me going,
*  it tastes like chicken, doesn't it?
*  And I was like, yeah, it tastes like chicken.
*  A chicken that's cancer.
*  Yeah, a chicken has been mushed up and stepped on and rolled into a ball.
*  So it's not ready yet.
*  But ultimately, these people are thinking they will be able to grow a cut of meat
*  and they'll be able to they will be able to grow a steak, a beautiful steak.
*  Yeah. At the moment, it's really, really difficult to do that.
*  They can grow them.
*  I don't think the argument is just a taste argument.
*  I think the argument is a health argument because I think there are some in the
*  neighborhood of the high 80 percent of people that try veganism and quit.
*  And a lot of them, I mean, I've had a bunch of them on my podcast that talk
*  about it, Miley Cyrus is one, Mike Tyson was another.
*  They they just give up because they don't feel good.
*  And immediately upon eating meat, they start feeling better again.
*  Some of them become pescatarian.
*  You know, some people don't have problems
*  with fish because they don't have eyelashes and they don't really look like us.
*  And it's like if you kill something, kill them.
*  But the thing is, the moral argument against eating fish is even greater.
*  It is going to get overfishing.
*  You know, we're doing genocide in the oceans with the fish.
*  And the way we do it is even more horrific.
*  Yeah, it is really horrific.
*  And we can't farm fish in the same way.
*  We can't do the awful things that we're doing on factory farms with animals.
*  We can't really do that with fish because they die.
*  Most fish don't really like living in those conditions and they just don't.
*  They just don't grow properly.
*  But yeah, it's it's terrible.
*  But yeah, no, with with
*  the thing about me is it's a very efficient way of getting that nutrition into your
*  body, you can get that nutrition in other ways.
*  I mean, I'm sounding like a vegan here,
*  aren't I? I'm not a vegan, you know, I'm not a vegan at all.
*  No, but I know you're right.
*  I have friends that are vegan that do it right and it can be done.
*  I just don't think it's optimal.
*  I don't I don't believe it's optimal.
*  We haven't worked out how to do it yet, but it is it is possible.
*  And it's not like the only way to get
*  adequate nutrition is to have a hamburger or whatever.
*  Certainly not a hamburger.
*  I think I think the argument for this this vegan meat, the creating meat in a lab is
*  really the future.
*  And I think they're going to be able to do it.
*  The question is, they're going to be able to do it.
*  As you're saying that where it has the texture of an animal that's been like
*  animals that taste good or animals that are healthy to me, like I enjoy grass fed
*  animals and I enjoy particularly wild game because wild animals, they live a wild
*  life, they taste better. It's it's there's more chew to it.
*  It's like there's more substance to it.
*  If they can figure out how to do that in a lab, that's going to be fascinating.
*  They could figure it out.
*  And that will be a difficult thing to do,
*  because the reason why the texture is different is because those animals exercise
*  eating muscle and you're not going to be exercising those little things in the lab,
*  even if you're growing it.
*  So that is a really it's a really, really tricky thing to do.
*  And the other thing is that food is really an intimate experience.
*  Eating is a very intimate experience.
*  And people don't forgive when if you eat something that's disgusting, you don't try
*  it again. And so the issue with this is whether or not the first products that
*  come onto the market are going to be good.
*  And if they're not, you could have some giant bubble and it will be a bubble and
*  there'll be hype cycles and then people will try and do it again.
*  Eventually, people will get there.
*  But, you know, the sort of thing that I
*  think would would satisfy you and make you feel like this is great.
*  We're really, really far off.
*  Well, what I was going to get to is those real ethical concerns with creating a
*  headless animal that use electrical muscular stimulation to keep active and
*  you develop muscles through that.
*  Like that's going to freak people out even more.
*  But don't worry, it can't be alive.
*  It's never been alive.
*  So we've created this thing with like a, you know, that's bolted into this machine
*  where you're shocking it constantly in order to keep the muscle strong.
*  And then you eat it.
*  But it's never had a head.
*  It's never going to have a head.
*  So it can't really experience pain.
*  Very interesting, because because the whole I hadn't thought about this, but
*  you're quite right. It's like the whole appeal of this stuff is this is meat, not
*  from animals. But if you have to make it behave a little bit like an animal so
*  that it has the right texture, where does that work in terms of the
*  philosophical approach, the ethics of this?
*  If it's not an animal, but it's been moving like an animal, is how much is it still
*  de-animalized?
*  Yeah. Don't you think that's where it's going to go?
*  Like if somebody wants a bone in rib eye and they're like, hmm, well, there's a way.
*  There's a way.
*  And they just decide to recreate an artificial cow and clone the whole thing.
*  But sans head.
*  And then you will actually have a bone in rib eye from an animal that you can
*  ethically eat because it never really had a chance to be alive and just be a cow.
*  I think we're much more likely to have a 3D printed steak that isn't very good at
*  first, and then they finally work out on a molecular level how to make the strands,
*  the fibers exactly like the piece of game that you like so much because it's lived
*  in the world. I think that's more likely than a headless cow on a treadmill.
*  Maybe.
*  Bob the Beef Scientist comes up with some
*  headless animal that tastes way better than those mushy cloned animals.
*  He's like, look, I understand what you're saying.
*  We shouldn't kill animal.
*  Well, this isn't even an animal.
*  This is just a headless cow that's attached to a bunch of wall sockets.
*  We just charge that fucker up every day.
*  And he's got big, thick, meaty muscles because he's been electrically shocked,
*  shocked constantly into contracting and relaxing those muscles.
*  I mean, one of the arguments for this for
*  this meat growing in labs is that an animal is quite an inefficient
*  conveyor of calories because animals, as well as growing flesh, they also flap
*  their wings and they pack and they run around and so they burn the calories they
*  take in. And so the scientists have done kind of equations that for every
*  for every one calorie that you eat from beef, it's taken 36 calories for the cows
*  had to ingest 36 calories to produce one calorie of beef.
*  So I think the argument that you make the meat and then you get the meat to exercise
*  will kind of undermine that idea of it being more calorie efficient because the
*  meat will be spending calories by moving around.
*  I can't believe it.
*  If it doesn't have a head.
*  Yeah, it's like, how are we going to sustain this thing?
*  I'm sure my scientists shaking their head at my stupid idea like that is not going
*  to work that way. It's an interesting philosophical principle,
*  though, because it comes down to the point of what is what is life?
*  What does it take for something to be alive?
*  Is it alive if it's moving around but it doesn't have a brain?
*  And that was something also that I looked at is that we have a very
*  unsophisticated idea of what life is.
*  And while we while we do that, it's quite
*  dangerous that we're tinkering around with it and growing, growing things, cells
*  when we haven't really sat down and thought about what we really mean when we
*  say that something's alive.
*  It also is interesting that we've sort of
*  conceded that we're going to continue to overpopulate the planet.
*  Yes, like, listen, it's hopeless.
*  We have seven billion now.
*  We'll have 10 billion in 50 years.
*  Let's just deal with this and just, yeah, that's a giant problem.
*  Good ways that we could tackle overpopulation, the really positive things
*  like if women have an education, they have far fewer children.
*  That's kind of the point.
*  That's the point of my book, really, is that this is the most
*  ridiculous overshoot engineering to solve this problem.
*  We could educate women and eat slightly less meat.
*  But no, we're not going to do that.
*  We're going to go to a lab where we're going to clone.
*  It's just ridiculous.
*  What does it say about us as human beings that instead of using these solutions
*  that are within our power, we want to have our cake and eat it.
*  And I think that technology is going to be able to provide us with that.
*  And the thing about the meat grown in labs is it does sound like there's no downside.
*  But nobody really knows if it's better for the environment to grow meat in this way.
*  There haven't been enough studies on it.
*  But let's say even that it is.
*  The people who are going to own this technology at the moment,
*  the startups are trying to get investment from Cargill and Tyson and big meat
*  companies that have the infrastructure to distribute meat.
*  And those are companies.
*  I mean, you know what happens in those in their meatpacking plants where people
*  have amputations all the time, they don't care about they're not very ethical
*  companies, shall we say. And so it's very likely that this industry is going to be
*  taken over by people who don't care about animal rights or human rights very much.
*  They just want to make sure that they're in control of the meat market.
*  Yeah, they're just going to want profit.
*  It's just going to be the bottom line.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's a it's a it's a human problem.
*  It's like many human problems.
*  It's messy and complicated and nuanced.
*  There's a lot to it.
*  And what if it's bad for you?
*  Like what if this lab grown meat turns out to be particularly
*  problematic with our digestive system?
*  They can they can make it they can make it good for you.
*  They can take out whatever's bad for you.
*  They're saying that they can make they can make kosher bacon because it doesn't
*  come from a pig and they can make foie gras without without all the ethical
*  problems of force feeding that this is the perfect meat because they can engineer
*  it down to every last cell.
*  But again, we don't know what the unintended consequences of any of this stuff is.
*  And we only find out through experience, which is the frightening thing.
*  Yeah, I'm curious.
*  I mean, I wonder if we could do that with fish.
*  I mean, if they're growing fish, are they fake fish?
*  Real fish from fish cells is a company called Finless Foods,
*  that is the pioneer in all of that and and they're growing fish at the moment.
*  The same way they're growing beef like this.
*  Yes. Yeah.
*  Have you tried that?
*  No, because the people I interviewed there, they they weren't kind of they were much
*  less full of hype and they're like, no, no, no, it's not ready.
*  What we've got yet isn't ready.
*  But the thing about fish is it's harder
*  because with with meat, you can make burgers and sausages where it doesn't really
*  or nuggets where you don't really need cuts of meat.
*  Whereas with fish, you really do need cuts of meat.
*  And especially because we're so used to eating sashimi.
*  We know what raw fish is supposed to taste like.
*  So you can't use the the smoke and mirrors of cooking it in this butter and adding
*  these herbs or whatever.
*  So fish is kind of harder in some ways,
*  but the need for it is even even greater, I would say, than than for meat.
*  Well, it would be nice if they could figure out how to repopulate the ocean.
*  That would be wonderful, because if you talk to people,
*  particularly if you watch any documentaries on tuna and tuna fishermen in Japan
*  and the way it used to be just 50 years ago and what it is now,
*  it's a radical decrease in the population of the tuna.
*  It's it's really frightening because we've done it in such a short period of time
*  and so efficiently and there's no one hitting the brakes.
*  I mean, they're just
*  the only parts of the ocean where which is still healthy are in like
*  either so far away that it wouldn't make any financial sense to go fishing there
*  or they're in politically contested waters like where you'd start a war.
*  If you went there,
*  we've pretty much taken all the fish out of the ocean that we can do.
*  And also, like the people who rely on the ocean,
*  these people who live on the coast are really suffering.
*  And quite often they're the poorest people.
*  So it's a total disaster what we've done to the oceans.
*  So, yeah, it's another human problem.
*  We're weird. We're bad.
*  It's not so much that we're weird and bad.
*  It's what is bad about human beings, I would say, is our greediness.
*  And we don't have to be greedy.
*  And we live in a system that is encouraging us to be greedy all the time
*  and assumes that we are greedy and that we just want more and more and more
*  because that's what's required for the system to carry on working.
*  Whereas, in fact, we don't have to be greedy.
*  We can say this is enough.
*  Yes. People like you, again, introspective, intelligent people who are rare.
*  Well, it's not just that I interviewed this guy.
*  There is one guy I could find.
*  So normally there are people who campaign against all of these technologies.
*  And I'm sure I was going to find some crazy animal rights group or some vegan
*  group that, you know, because animal rights activists, they can get nasty.
*  And certainly in the UK, they've done some very extreme things to fight against,
*  you know, animal cruelty as they see it.
*  And there's no organized opposition to growing meat in labs, even though there are
*  there are some some animal rights reasons to be worried about it.
*  At the moment, a lot of meat that's grown in labs is grown in this stuff called
*  fetal bovine serum, which comes from the calves of the hearts of calves
*  that are fetuses when their pregnant mothers are being slaughtered in the abattoir.
*  They put a needle into the heart of the calf and pull this stuff out.
*  And this serum is the medium in which the cells are grown.
*  And they're working on finding other ways of growing the cells.
*  But at the moment, that's the best stuff to use.
*  So you'd expect there to be some animal rights argument, some fight against these
*  people, but there isn't because it's seen as the silver bullet that's going to stop
*  people from eating meat. But I found one person, this British sociologist,
*  a vegan sociologist who is who says that, you know, actually,
*  the answer in all of this is that we have to stop thinking of meat as being, you know,
*  the answer isn't to have a sort of techno fix that solves the problem.
*  We just have to stop feeding meat to our kids so much and then they won't have such
*  an appetite for it. You know, the appetite is learned.
*  There are people who've been vegan for a long time who, when they try and eat meat
*  again, they can't digest it or they think it's disgusting or they hate the texture of it.
*  Those people are pretty rare.
*  You think you think people rush back to it with open arms?
*  I think they do. I think they smell like fat steak cooking.
*  Smells amazing.
*  My sister's been vegetarian for like 30 years.
*  If she eats meat by mistake, it's revolting to her in her mouth.
*  It just feels kind of you think that's odd.
*  Well, as someone who loves meat, I can't I can't empathize with it,
*  but I can understand if you haven't had it for a while, it's like eating a piece of
*  muscle, delicious muscle.
*  But anyway, he said he said the answer is to the way that cultural change happens
*  is it's to do with the world that your children grow up in.
*  And we need to just and I kind of buy that.
*  I mean, I think about my son, my son is six.
*  You know, we had some upstairs neighbors who are in their 70s.
*  They're a gay couple. They got married.
*  This is just completely normal for him.
*  And it's you know, it's normal for me as well.
*  But it's still a little bit because it's not the world that I was born into where
*  that happens all the time.
*  I'm still like, oh, wow.
*  Congratulations. Whereas for my son, it's like, yeah, you know,
*  men marry women, men marry men, women.
*  He's been he's native into that world.
*  And I think that's how you get social changes by making the next generation
*  native into a world where where people think differently.
*  And I think the way that we're going to save the world, I think vegans will save
*  the world not by doing the plant based meat or by growing meat in labs, but by
*  getting people not to feed their kids meat.
*  That's the answer.
*  I don't know.
*  It's disgusting.
*  I don't think it's healthy for children to not eat meat.
*  But you can get the nutrition you need elsewhere.
*  You can.
*  It's not bioavailable the same way it is with meat.
*  Meat is the most efficient way to get protein, most efficient way to get amino
*  acids, it is the best way to get B12 and B12 deficiency is one of the biggest
*  problems with vegans.
*  I can't believe I'm here on your podcast
*  making the vegan argument here as somebody who is not even a vegetarian.
*  It's it's it's possible with some people to do it well.
*  But there's also biodiversity in human beings.
*  People are very different in what they can and can't consume.
*  Obviously, some people can't eat certain nuts or they'll die.
*  And other people have no problem with it whatsoever.
*  We all come from different parts of the world.
*  And that's that's another problem with whether it's even with meat eating.
*  Some people, their body just does not agree with eating meat or other people.
*  I mean, there's there's some science to
*  it's really disputed to what what blood type you are.
*  And, you know, I happen to be positive, which is supposed to be really good for
*  meat. I eat a lot of meat and very healthy.
*  I've never had a problem with it.
*  But I know some people that don't like meat.
*  It doesn't sit well with them.
*  But I know some people that have a real problem with grains.
*  And I know some people that have a real
*  problem with certain certain green leafy vegetables make them sick.
*  It sounds crazy, but it's just it's true.
*  I mean, people, people are people.
*  We are diverse.
*  And so it is a very it is a very efficient way of getting nutrition.
*  But you also have to disentangle how much of our desire for meat is cultural rather
*  than biologically necessary.
*  When my daughter was one years old, she was a baby.
*  My wife was holding her and I was cooking ribs and she's literally pulling away
*  from her mother trying to get a hold of my ribs because they tasted so good.
*  She could smell it.
*  And then she's got that.
*  We have a video of this of her with this little rib bone.
*  And she's like
*  with a little tiny mouth.
*  But presumably that wasn't the first time she ate meat.
*  That was the first time she ate meat.
*  That was the first time she ate meat.
*  Yeah. She wasn't I don't even think she was one.
*  She was she was tiny, like she wasn't even walking yet.
*  It was it was genetic.
*  There was something in her little brain and her senses from smelling it.
*  She wanted that meat.
*  Maybe it's because it's my kid.
*  I don't know. Maybe it's learned.
*  I think, you know, maybe there is something primal about it, but that doesn't
*  know, but there's also a lot of primal stuff about us that we don't act on.
*  I know. I love eating meat.
*  I just feel like we need to not have so much of it.
*  I mean, it used to be like a big treat in England.
*  We have, you know, in Britain, we have the Sunday roast, which is this
*  traditional, you know, you would have one kind of big feast on a Sunday
*  of a sort of giant family to get together.
*  And it was an occasion.
*  And I think maybe we need to have that more of a culture of that, really.
*  But the answer is not telling people they should not eat any meat at all.
*  I think also because I think that's
*  you ever talk to people that are proponents of the carnivore diet?
*  I have never spoken to any of them.
*  You should. Yes, I have.
*  It's fascinating. Here's what's fascinating.
*  It's all anecdotal, of course, but there's a lot of people with autoimmune
*  disorders that have completely cured those autoimmune disorders by eating only meat.
*  They literally only eat meat and they eat nose to tail, meaning they eat organs.
*  They eat a lot of organ meat.
*  They get most of their vitamins from liver and heart and kidneys.
*  And they eat fatty cuts of meat.
*  And they're basically semi ketogenic because if you eat a certain amount of
*  protein, your body develops this.
*  There's a process called I think it's
*  called glucogenesis, where your body converts protein into glucose.
*  So it actually keeps you from being ketogenic,
*  but it's because you're eating so much protein.
*  It makes you smell really bad, doesn't it?
*  This kind of stuff makes you smell bad.
*  See, that's a vegan talking to you right now.
*  Someone's trying to tell you if you eat the meat, you're going to smell bad.
*  Your breath will be bad. You know what smells bad?
*  Broccoli farts. People eat broccoli.
*  That's bad, too. I don't know.
*  Is this the diet that Jordan Peterson is on?
*  Jordan Peterson is on that diet.
*  But I would say he's not a good poster boy for it.
*  Not the best because Jordan has had a lot of problems.
*  It was good for his autoimmune disorders,
*  but he's had a few problems with publicly recently with benzodiazepine and
*  all those getting off these antidepressant drugs and anti-anxiety drugs.
*  There's some other doctors, though, that are proponents of this particularly.
*  And they actually are prescribing it for people with autoimmune disorders,
*  particularly people with arthritis and arthritis issues,
*  because a lot of people find that there's particularly with grains,
*  there's a lot of inflammation issues that certain folks have with grains and
*  glutens and all sorts of different things that are really basically fairly new
*  in terms of human evolution of our consumption, like breads and things along those lines.
*  Yes. But then again, that goes back to this idea of our insides being
*  that we're internally cavemen and that we're designed to eat a certain way and be
*  a certain way when we don't have to be that way because we have access to
*  a wide variety of different kinds of, you know.
*  Right. But the thing is, they're talking about health consequences with this wide
*  variety. And when they have an elimination diet and one of the best elimination diets
*  is this carnivore diet because you're really, really cutting out everything.
*  On the carnivore diet, are people not getting cancers?
*  Well, it's not. Here's the thing.
*  It's not that studied and it's not there's not that many people doing it.
*  And there have been people that have done it for decades.
*  But again, all this is anecdotal.
*  You would have to study people.
*  And I know Harvard is actually in the middle of some long term carnivore
*  study that they're doing.
*  They're trying to find out whether or not there's any real science to any of this
*  stuff because there are these people that have these autoimmune disorders that are
*  clearing up. I did it for a month.
*  It was pretty fascinating. It was really interesting.
*  Why did you stop?
*  Well, because I love food.
*  I just love food. You know, I love pasta and I love bread and I love vegetables.
*  I love all kinds of food.
*  And it was it's very limiting to only eat meat.
*  But I did it for a whole month.
*  I ate nothing but meat for one month.
*  I mostly steak and liver and wild game and a lot of animal fat.
*  I felt great.
*  It's kind of crazy how good I felt.
*  Yeah, I lost 12 pounds and I had energy all day long.
*  That was what was weird about it was there was no lulls.
*  Like my energy stayed at a constant state all day long.
*  Very strange.
*  It's you should try it just for a good maybe.
*  Maybe that's my next book is, you know,
*  investigating the carnivores and seeing if they're all right.
*  The weird thing is the complete elimination of brain fog.
*  I found that fascinating.
*  I mean, I did a video afterwards where I
*  showed how much weight that I had lost because I had gotten kind of fat.
*  I had been eating too much.
*  I'm a glutton.
*  And if given enough time, like I will eat.
*  I eat so much.
*  I eat massive amounts of food.
*  I just I don't know what it is.
*  I just have always been a glutton and I work out a lot.
*  So I stay pretty lean.
*  But sometimes I can go off the rails or I just I just I'm not even hungry.
*  I just keep eating.
*  You know, it's really kind of a crazy thing.
*  But on the carnivore diet, I did lose a lot of weight.
*  But it's it's very limiting in terms of like I enjoy food.
*  I like restaurants.
*  I enjoy a chef's creation.
*  I think it's fascinating when they combine all the different flavors.
*  And I love the art of it.
*  I love the art of cooking.
*  I think it's an amazing art form that you enjoy with your face.
*  You know, it's incredible.
*  I love I love food.
*  So to me, it's like I'm not going to do this forever.
*  I just can't.
*  I enjoy too many different things in terms of flavors.
*  And I also respect the culinary art form of cooking.
*  I think this is it's it's to me, it's a different kind of art.
*  It's like it's like music or literature or all the other different ways people
*  express themselves, but they express themselves through food.
*  And I respect that exactly it, which is that food is not just nutrition.
*  It's culture.
*  There is the culture of how we eat and the ceremony of eating together
*  and appreciating the food and the way that food is displayed.
*  And actually, probably the culture is more important than the.
*  Yes.
*  Well, it's definitely more important than the nutrition.
*  Otherwise, we'd all just be taking pills and not eating.
*  Do you know what I mean?
*  Well, you wouldn't get the nutrition from pills, though.
*  That wouldn't work.
*  No, but if you could, people wouldn't because and not just because they want
*  the taste in their mouths, but they like the way that it breaks up your day,
*  that you sit down, have a meal, it represents a certain occasion.
*  Yes.
*  And it's a huge part of what it is to be human is to eat and how our meals are
*  assembled and how all of that.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's the point.
*  When things are cultural, they're not we can change because we can change our
*  culture, whether or not we want to is up to us.
*  But yeah, that's also one of the more
*  interesting things about food is going to a place and experiencing this new culture
*  and their new food.
*  Yeah.
*  Going to Thailand and eating authentic Thai food or going to Italy and eating
*  authentic Italian food, that is to me, it's like one of the great ways of
*  experiencing a place.
*  I mean, the late great Anthony Bourdain, who was a friend of mine,
*  is the reason why I changed my opinion of food.
*  I just think it tasted good.
*  But then I watched his program and I realized, oh, this is an art form.
*  I had a blind side.
*  I didn't. I had a blind spot.
*  I didn't look at it as an art form.
*  But his passion for cuisine, for chefs and for the way that they prepared and sourced
*  the food from these, you know, these fresh markets and got everything pieced
*  it together and then presented it.
*  I was like, oh, I was looking at this wrong.
*  This is art.
*  I didn't think of it that way.
*  Now I think of it that way.
*  That's why I can't be carnivore.
*  I just like food too much.
*  Just it's too important.
*  I like wine. I like all of it.
*  I like all of it together.
*  And also ultimately, a lot of this comes down to what is life for?
*  What is your life for?
*  I mean, there are these people who are life extensionists who do whatever they
*  can to prolong their life, but you would argue that the way they're living,
*  it's not a life worth extending.
*  It's boring.
*  You have to make choices in your life about what do you want from life?
*  Are you going to do something that's a little bit unhealthy because, you know,
*  we all make choices.
*  For me, it's really difficult, though.
*  I mean, in terms of having written the book,
*  I've had people interview me about it who are vegan, who have asked me,
*  how come you're not vegan now?
*  How come having written all of this?
*  And it's really, really difficult because I try to explain, well,
*  you know, I'm eating less meat and, you know, there isn't a moral argument
*  you can make other than I really, really enjoy it, which makes you sound really
*  superficial, but I enjoy it and I have a family that enjoys it.
*  And it would involve a huge disruption in our lives.
*  Yeah, it's a weird one, right?
*  I think the real argument is health.
*  I really do.
*  I was vegetarian for six months back when I was fighting.
*  I did it to try to make weight and my performance suffered.
*  And, you know, you could argue that I wasn't doing it correctly.
*  And I'm sure I wasn't.
*  But, boy, when I started eating meat again, I felt so much better, like
*  instantaneously, I felt better and then it corresponded with.
*  To do it well, you just to do to live really well on a vegan diet,
*  you have to be very organized and you have to plan.
*  And I don't think people I don't think everybody could do that.
*  Well, I think you have to be first of all, it has to suit your body.
*  You have to be organized.
*  You have to be diligent and you have to be educated.
*  You have to really understand supplementation and do it correctly.
*  One last thing I want to talk to you about is death.
*  Yes, another thing that you cover.
*  Please expand on your thoughts about death.
*  So I was looking at the perfect death
*  and that we have this kind of dream that you could maybe take a tablet and fall
*  asleep painlessly and peacefully at a time of your choosing.
*  But actually, that that doesn't really exist or rather it does exist.
*  There is one substance that you can take that will give you that death.
*  And it's a particular substance.
*  It's what they give. They used to give prisoners on death row.
*  It's what they give animals when they put them to sleep.
*  But it's illegal to possess privately almost everywhere in the world.
*  And so at the moment, if you want to be in control of your own death,
*  you either have to put yourself at risk of a death that isn't very nice by doing
*  some risky things that might not work out for you
*  and might be horrible for people who find you.
*  Or you have to get a doctor to help you die in a place where assisted dying is legal.
*  And so I was writing this from the perspective of being in the UK where it's
*  not legal at all.
*  And I was looking at there are some doctors that will for a fee teach you how
*  to kill yourself in the best possible way, like either how to get hold of these
*  illegal drugs or other ways of killing yourself that are supposedly
*  peaceful and painless. And what is the drug?
*  What is the thing that they used to give?
*  It's called Lembutal. It's a barbiturate.
*  So the company used to make it is a Danish company called Lundbeck.
*  And they stopped providing it to death row facilities,
*  I think in 2011, because it became
*  very controversial that they were doing it.
*  But it's the same barbit.
*  It's what Marilyn Monroe took when she killed herself.
*  But I wouldn't recommend anyone try and get it, because at the moment,
*  if you try and get it, you have to do lots of stuff on the dark web
*  and you might be sent the wrong stuff and nobody wants to be taking the wrong stuff
*  when you've decided you're going to die.
*  So, yeah,
*  basically, the investigation that I was doing was looking at,
*  whilst we haven't worked out how to give everyone the right to die,
*  there are people who are stepping into that void and telling people,
*  I can give you control over your own death.
*  I can give you the perfect death.
*  And I looked at different people who've
*  invented death machines that can supposedly do this.
*  But there is a guy at the moment called Philip Nitschke, who has developed this
*  3D printable capsule, which looks like a kind of James Bond vehicle.
*  Or a kind of, I don't know, a spaceship.
*  You get the plan.
*  So you have to be a member of his organisation.
*  You get the plans and then you go and you print out this capsule.
*  You pour liquid nitrogen into the base of it and then you lie inside and die in about two minutes.
*  Yes, so I saw this being displayed.
*  It was I went to Venice to this design show in Venice where it was being unveiled.
*  And it was a sort of strangely beautiful thing.
*  But it's a kind of symbol for me of how
*  ridiculous this is, if we're talking about overshoot engineering again,
*  all we need to do is give people the right to die.
*  We don't need to be able to give people the means to 3D print their own death.
*  Because ultimately, I think it's probably a good idea if other people are involved
*  and doctors are involved, because who's to say that you wouldn't decide to do this
*  if you were drunk or bereaved or might one day decide that you wanted to live?
*  And until we've kind of worked out
*  how to frame laws in ways such that vulnerable people aren't exploited or
*  vulnerable people aren't killed using these right to die laws,
*  there are going to be people who step into the void and give people who maybe
*  shouldn't necessarily have it, a way of killing themselves.
*  It's another very human problem in that it's very messy.
*  Like if you have someone who has terminal cancer and they're constantly in pain
*  and they're going to die, why do we have this archaic idea
*  that they have to ride this out to the end?
*  Totally. Although there's anything noble.
*  The language we use a bit about their fight
*  against cancer or them losing their battle.
*  I mean, I really think you talk about, you know, if aliens were looking at us,
*  I look at it in terms of people 200 years from now, when they are studying this era
*  in history, what will they look back on and think?
*  God, they were barbaric at that time.
*  And I think the two things definitely are
*  drugs and the right to die and the fact that we let people suffer.
*  But the people who want this death machine or who are trying to buy Nembutal
*  that I looked at, they aren't terminally ill.
*  They're people who are kind of baby boomers who are used to having control
*  in their lives and being in charge of their own destiny, who are terrified
*  of things like getting dementia or motor neurone disease and terrified
*  of losing their dignity.
*  And so they want to be able to own something
*  in their home or have the plans to something that will mean that they'll
*  still be able to be in control at the end.
*  But death is, you know,
*  the point is, it's a symptom of the fear that we have of death rather than
*  an actual solution to that problem.
*  I think we also have the fear of people making an error,
*  like people who are they're experiencing great grief or they're experiencing
*  the depression that comes from the loss of a job or a broken relationship or whatever
*  it is, and they would make a hasty decision that they would regret later.
*  Well, obviously, they can't regret it,
*  but other people in their life are certainly going to regret it.
*  But but if they just hung in there,
*  if they just hung in there and wrote it out and sought counseling and sought
*  the advice and the love of friends and family, they could get through this
*  and be stronger on the other side and find a new relationship,
*  find a new job, whatever it is, and you don't have to pull the cord.
*  But the thing is, like, who are we to tell people when they can and can't?
*  That's where it gets really strange.
*  That's what this doctor says.
*  This doctor is a libertarian.
*  And he says it's ridiculously paternalistic
*  that doctors should be able to say, I know your mind better than you do.
*  I know you better.
*  And he says that you could develop an AI that could tell whether or not somebody
*  was of sound mind. He personally thinks if you're depressed,
*  you should still be given the advice on how to take your own life.
*  It's still your choice.
*  It's a choice that you can make rationally if you're depressed.
*  If you're mentally ill, that's a different matter.
*  But he's saying it's all about taking back control.
*  The individual, it's your life.
*  You should be in charge of it.
*  But the problem is, there are so many stories.
*  I mean, I don't know if you've seen that
*  documentary, The Bridge, about people who jump off the gate.
*  And there's that person there who survived,
*  who said who talks about that visceral feeling of being in the air and thinking,
*  oh, my God, what have I done?
*  Yeah. And the point is, you kind of do need
*  human gatekeepers to take you through the decision that you're making.
*  And I think the idea that I just think most of the doctors who are in places
*  where the right to die is legal, who are involved in making those decisions
*  are not people who are reveling in their power,
*  but they are people who are genuinely trying to find out if this is what you
*  really want. And I think you kind of do need those gatekeepers when you're
*  because it is always a life or death decision.
*  It has to be the right decision every time.
*  It's just it's a strange thing that we
*  impose our own ideas on whether or not a person can or cannot end their life.
*  Like we say, no, no, no, you have to keep going.
*  Like the law says you must keep going.
*  It's very odd because it's
*  I
*  I want them to get better.
*  Like I want people who are feeling
*  depression and want to end their life. I don't want them to do it.
*  I don't want them to.
*  But I also don't think that I should be
*  the person who can tell them whether or not they can or can't.
*  But in some countries where the right to die is legal, so, for example,
*  in the Netherlands, in Holland and in Belgium, you can you can
*  you can be given the right to die.
*  You can be helped to die if you're depressed or if you're a chronic alcoholic
*  who can't who says, I don't think I'm ever going to be able to beat this.
*  It's making me miserable.
*  And I think a really large proportion of the number of people who are
*  euthanized in those countries have something like depression.
*  So that's not to say that you could you wouldn't allow people who are depressed
*  to take their own lives.
*  It just means you have to have come to a conclusion that
*  there's no reason to think they're ever going to feel better.
*  That's the point.
*  And if there's ever a case to to objectively think that someone might be able
*  to feel better with medication or counseling or a change of circumstances,
*  then then there has to be hope for people.
*  Well, the alcoholic one is a weird one because
*  have they exhausted all possible alternatives in that case?
*  Have they explored psychedelic therapy, which is illegal, but massively effective
*  for people that are addicts, particularly Ibogaine.
*  Ibogaine is incredibly effective for people that have addictions to opioids,
*  alcohol, even cigarettes, even lifestyle problems.
*  And yet it's completely illegal in this country.
*  But there's lots of people trying to.
*  There's lots of entrepreneurs working on it, aren't there, on
*  finding a way of getting it to market?
*  Well, they're doing clinics in Mexico.
*  I have a friend who owns a clinic in Mexico.
*  And he started this clinic after he went down to Mexico to do.
*  He had lower back pain from an injury that was severe and got hooked on opioids
*  and went to Mexico, went through an Ibogaine clinic and got therapy and then
*  completely snapped.
*  He was completely cured of it and realized, like, OK, there is an actual real
*  workable alternative to all these different methods of getting off of it.
*  And it's some for some reason not available on this patch of dirt.
*  I have to drive across a border, this weird fucking wall and go to this place.
*  And that's where I can do it. But it works.
*  So he just started up a clinic in Mexico
*  and started bringing people that he knew had problems with it.
*  And it's not again, not just opioids, but alcohol, all sorts of behavior problems.
*  It's a very ruthlessly introspective experience.
*  Apparently, I haven't I haven't currently personally rather done it.
*  But I know many people who have and they said it's been amazingly beneficial.
*  I know several people that have kicked pills that way.
*  It is incredible, really, that we have good drugs and bad drugs.
*  This is what I mean, like in 200 years time.
*  The idea that, you know, that still in the UK,
*  you know, pretty much everything is banned.
*  And even there are epileptic kids who've had to fight to say that they they they
*  need cannabis based medication, it stops their seizures.
*  They've had to really, really fight for this in the UK.
*  But it's because of, you know, it's because of the way politics works.
*  But it's it is it's ridiculously short sighted.
*  And the sort of thing that's going to be that we're going to be really embarrassed
*  about one day, I think that it was ever like this.
*  But but yeah, there's amazing stuff going on.
*  There's there's amazing, you know, boundaries being crossed if we would just
*  allow ourselves to embrace them.
*  And, you know, I'm a pretty hopeful person.
*  That's the thing. And I really believe that human beings are capable of wonderful
*  things and that's why that's why I feel like
*  there the idea of entrepreneurs taking advantage of our anxieties and saying
*  that they can make money by providing us with quick solutions that stop us from
*  looking at why we're afraid or why we're greedy or why we don't want to compromise
*  in relationships, I think it's a real shame.
*  I agree with you, Jenny.
*  I really enjoyed talking to you.
*  I really did. And I really hope I really hope you do a podcast.
*  I think you'd be amazing at it.
*  I've got to now, don't I?
*  If you say I've got to do a podcast, then I've got to do a podcast.
*  I hope you do.
*  But until then, your book, Sex Robots and Vegan Meat,
*  it's available now everywhere.
*  Is there an audiobook? And do you read it?
*  There is an audiobook and I read it.
*  Yes. Excellent. I love doing it.
*  So, yeah, get the audiobook, get the ebook, get the book.
*  It's a good book.
*  Thank you very much, Jenny. Appreciate you.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Thank you. Bye.
*  Bye.
