*  How are you feeling out there, you, you truth warrior? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=15.24s)]
*  I keep waiting to be done with this. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=21.72s)]
*  Yeah, done with COVID. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=23.84s)]
*  It'd be nice to be done, right? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=24.84s)]
*  They will not let it go. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=26.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's strange. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=27.92s)]
*  It's strange now because it's also strange what bothers me. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=30.16s)]
*  And I try to emphasize this as much as possible. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=35.8s)]
*  And I even had to do this recently with some close family friends. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=38.3s)]
*  You've got to take care of your health. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=42.16s)]
*  You have to take vitamins. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=43.64s)]
*  You have to eat right. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=45.24s)]
*  You have to. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  If you don't do that, your body doesn't function well. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=47.24s)]
*  That includes your immune system, includes everything. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Includes you know, inflammation. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  It causes a host of diseases in your body. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=53.64s)]
*  You got to take care of yourself. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=56.56s)]
*  That should be the most important message that everyone's putting out. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  Not just podcasters, but the government. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=62.0s)]
*  Health officials. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=64.84s)]
*  Everyone should be saying that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=65.84s)]
*  You should really supplement with vitamins. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=66.84s)]
*  You should really get your nutrient levels checked if you can. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=68.48s)]
*  Even if you can't do those things, you can eat decently. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  You can try to exercise moderately. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=76.76s)]
*  Look, I know a lot of people have complicated lives. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=78.48s)]
*  They have kids. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=81.2s)]
*  They have work. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=82.2s)]
*  They don't have much time. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=83.2s)]
*  I get it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=84.68s)]
*  Even if you can work out a half hour a day, three days a week, and not eat too much, you're [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=86.48s)]
*  in much better shape. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=91.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's been some studies done recently that something really crazy, like 20 minutes [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=93.0s)]
*  of exercise, like twice a week, improves your overall all-cause mortality score. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  Just a little bit. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=106.48s)]
*  Moderate stuff. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=107.48s)]
*  Like nothing crazy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=108.48s)]
*  Like do some push-ups and sit-ups and some jumping jacks and you're good to go. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=109.48s)]
*  You have to do something that gets your body moving, or it doesn't think that it has to. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=112.8s)]
*  It atrophies. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=118.12s)]
*  It's just an unfortunate aspect of our biology that we are not like other animals. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  Other animals get stronger too as they exercise, but we've all seen animals that are super [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=127.44s)]
*  muscular that don't do anything. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=131.04s)]
*  They're different. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=133.64s)]
*  They only live 13 years, right? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=134.88s)]
*  The whole thing's different. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=137.2s)]
*  Thus, we're this long-term species with intelligence and ego and justifications and all sorts [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=139.12s)]
*  of weird ways that we will procrastinate and justify bad behavior and unhealthy choices. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=146.32s)]
*  It's just a constant battle just being a human being. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=155.28s)]
*  No one wins that battle. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=158.32s)]
*  You just win battles. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=160.08s)]
*  Win like daily battles. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  No one wins the war. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=163.32s)]
*  Everyone dies in the end. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=164.44s)]
*  Everyone dies in the end. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=166.08s)]
*  I wrote about this on the Substack. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=167.28s)]
*  We were just talking before we started about when I didn't see you, but when you were in [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=170.52s)]
*  Vegas in July and I was in Vegas in July for I was playing poker. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  Gambling is, and I like to gamble. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  I don't have a moral problem with it, but gambling destroys people too. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  Overeating destroys people. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  Gambling destroys people. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=187.8s)]
*  Gambling destroys people. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=189.0s)]
*  Drugs destroy people. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=190.0s)]
*  As human beings, we've set up all these modern things to take advantage of our dopamine, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=191.72000000000003s)]
*  and we're not really built for it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=196.76s)]
*  We're not. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=198.67999999999998s)]
*  We're certainly not built for phones. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  So many people are getting destroyed by social media. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  Their lives have become wrapped up in arguing with people. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  I just think that's super unhealthy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=207.04s)]
*  There's some aspect of it that's very beneficial and positive. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  I think you get a lot of information that you wouldn't have gotten. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  I think you get to see people's perspectives that occasionally are very inspiring and very [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=214.84s)]
*  unique and interesting. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=220.32s)]
*  I love listening or reading things from other people that I think have very good perspectives [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=221.6s)]
*  and interesting perspectives. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=228.32s)]
*  It's a rare opportunity to talk to people that you wouldn't be able to run into. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=230.56s)]
*  If we lived in the 1970s, you'd have to cultivate these interesting people in the physical person, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=234.16s)]
*  which is probably better for you, but not available for most people. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=239.2s)]
*  We tend to imitate our atmospheres, and you see that in thought bubbles. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  I think that's another problem that we have with social media. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=249.48s)]
*  There's these thought bubbles. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=252.56s)]
*  People gravitate towards them. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=255.2s)]
*  You stay in them. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=258.4s)]
*  If you're busy, you just get affirmation from that thought bubble, and you never think outside [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=259.8s)]
*  the box. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=264.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=265.28s)]
*  Look, I don't know what we do about social media. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=266.28s)]
*  Obviously, my career ... Well, I guess I was on with you one time before COVID, talking [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=270.08s)]
*  about cannabis, but- [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=275.68s)]
*  Before you got kicked off. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=276.68s)]
*  Before I got kicked off Twitter. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=278.16s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=279.4s)]
*  Then I got put back- [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=280.4s)]
*  Let's talk about that, because you came on for your book that I've referenced many times, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=281.4s)]
*  and it's called Tell Your Children. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=284.48s)]
*  I think it's important. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=286.88s)]
*  I think when we talk about these things that some people like to use recreationally, even [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=288.6s)]
*  gambling that you talked about, we have to be aware that there's consequences to these [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=294.44s)]
*  things too. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=300.56s)]
*  It's not an even ride. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  It's not like every person is going to handle every situation well. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=303.08s)]
*  We had a podcast yesterday with Kurt Angle, an Olympic gold medalist in wrestling, and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=307.12s)]
*  he was the WWE champion. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=312.68s)]
*  Amazing guy. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=314.68s)]
*  He had a real pill problem. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=315.68s)]
*  He had a pill problem because he broke his neck five times. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=317.44s)]
*  He wrestled in the Olympics with a broken neck, broken vertebrae in his neck, and won. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=320.59999999999997s)]
*  Just a freak of freaks. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=327.52s)]
*  He can do that, but- [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=330.91999999999996s)]
*  But he got hooked. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=331.91999999999996s)]
*  He got hooked. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=333.84s)]
*  It's like a man whose mind is as strong as any fucking human has ever walked the face [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=334.88s)]
*  of the earth. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=339.64s)]
*  You can win the gold medal in the Olympics in wrestling. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=340.64s)]
*  Wrestling is one of the most competitive, grueling, insane physical contests that are [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=344.32s)]
*  in the Olympics. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=350.4s)]
*  It's like boxing and wrestling are two of the craziest. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=351.4s)]
*  Judo, Judo's pretty crazy, but God, those guys are strong mentally, and for that guy [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=354.55999999999995s)]
*  to get hooked on pills. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=360.0s)]
*  A guy like that, imagine. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=361.84s)]
*  Because it's not about how strong you are. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=364.96s)]
*  It's just if they click with you in some way, you're going to have a problem. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=366.35999999999996s)]
*  I also had Peter Berg on the podcast who's brilliant. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  Peter who did that film for Netflix, the series is out now, Painkiller, he said he tried an [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=374.91999999999996s)]
*  Oxycontin once recreationally, and he was like, oh my God, this is amazing. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=380.84s)]
*  I could never do this again. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  I'll never do this again. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=387.79999999999995s)]
*  But he's got a mindset that can see that and go, oh, I see where this is going. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=389.36s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=394.56s)]
*  So look, there's always been this stuff, and the legalizers, whether it's drug legalizers [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=395.56s)]
*  or people who want more gambling, they always say the same thing. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=401.88s)]
*  Well, you can't really stop people from doing it, and so you got to make it safe for them. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=405.88s)]
*  Here's the problem with that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=411.44s)]
*  Here's the flip side of that. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=412.68s)]
*  When you legalize it or normalize it, you wind up opening it to people who otherwise [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=415.84s)]
*  wouldn't do it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=419.79999999999995s)]
*  True. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=420.79999999999995s)]
*  Let me go back to gambling because I think it's a little bit less emotionally charged [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=421.79999999999995s)]
*  for people. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=425.08s)]
*  Once upon a time, if you wanted to gamble legally, you had to go to Las Vegas, basically, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=426.23999999999995s)]
*  or maybe Atlantic City after 1978, but basically you had to go out to the desert and find that [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=430.88s)]
*  gambling and deal with the mob. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=435.12s)]
*  Or if you wanted to bet football, you could probably find a bookie, you could call a friend, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=438.88s)]
*  but it was going to be some guy who might break your arm if you didn't pay. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=444.88s)]
*  So you could do it, but it was discouraged and not that easy. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=449.88s)]
*  Now we have gambling in 23 states, we have lotteries on every corner, and just in the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=453.8s)]
*  last five years we have sports betting on your phone in many states. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=461.08s)]
*  So it couldn't be easier. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=466.44s)]
*  So what does that mean? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=467.72s)]
*  It means it's going to wreck people who it would never have been available to before. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=469.24s)]
*  That's just a function of freedom, right? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=475.8s)]
*  Freedom would be go to Vegas and do it and we're not going to really judge you for it, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=479.44000000000005s)]
*  but you've got to go get it. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=483.04s)]
*  So make it less accessible. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=484.32000000000005s)]
*  This is more, we're going to promote this because both private interests and the state, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=486.32000000000005s)]
*  state governments, make money from it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=491.44000000000005s)]
*  You can see it from their perspective too. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=494.04s)]
*  Why should we give the revenue to Vegas? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=496.08s)]
*  We can handle it here. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=497.64s)]
*  Our residents should be able to gamble here. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=498.64s)]
*  There's a percentage, whatever that percentage is, and I don't know if it's genetic or if [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=502.04s)]
*  it's based on personal experience in gambling. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=506.28s)]
*  Maybe it's like OxyContin, like Peter Berg took one, but if he took as many as Kurt Engel [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=509.64s)]
*  did, he would be physically hooked too. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=513.92s)]
*  Maybe there could be just you chasing bad money a couple of times and next thing you [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=516.48s)]
*  know you're doing it all the time. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=521.64s)]
*  You see it, okay? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=525.2s)]
*  You see the people who can't stop, who know they don't have this money, who know they're [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=526.2s)]
*  going to the credit card advance machine for the fifth time that weekend. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=531.5200000000001s)]
*  They can't stop. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=535.44s)]
*  So how do we balance that with the freedom to be able to do it? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=536.6s)]
*  How do we say that it has to be regional? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=541.44s)]
*  How do we say that you can go to Vegas, it's totally legal, but you can't gamble in Michigan? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=544.2800000000001s)]
*  That's a fair question. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=549.12s)]
*  I don't have a good answer to that. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=550.6s)]
*  So is the solution that we just have to have more people available for counseling and more [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=552.4399999999999s)]
*  rehabilitation centers, is that the solution? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=560.48s)]
*  I don't really think that stuff works very well to me. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=563.04s)]
*  Here's what I do think. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=565.8s)]
*  I think putting it on people's phones is a mistake. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=566.8s)]
*  I think putting it in every... [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=569.0s)]
*  You don't think gambling rehabilitation works or any rehabilitation? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=570.52s)]
*  I don't think rehabilitation works as a rule. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=573.16s)]
*  I think when people want to stop, they stop. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=575.1999999999999s)]
*  But you don't think that support from other human beings that have also gone through it [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=578.34s)]
*  could be beneficial in making good decisions in the future? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=581.98s)]
*  I think for people who want to stop, that can be helpful to them. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=585.4200000000001s)]
*  I don't think anybody who goes to rehab unwillingly or even semi-willingly is going to get much [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=592.0600000000001s)]
*  out of it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=598.0600000000001s)]
*  And I know this is a controversial perspective. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=599.0600000000001s)]
*  One of the things that... [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=602.74s)]
*  So before COVID, just before COVID, I was working on a big book about... [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=604.0600000000001s)]
*  Bigger than the cannabis books, growing out of the cannabis book about drug legalization [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=609.7800000000001s)]
*  and addiction in general. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=615.4200000000001s)]
*  And the most disappointing thing that I found when I was doing this research is that when [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=617.7s)]
*  you try to do randomized trials where you say to... [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=622.14s)]
*  You take 100 people and you say 50 of them, you're going to go to AA. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=626.98s)]
*  The other 50 are not. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=631.4000000000001s)]
*  And you look at their outcomes a year or five years later, there's no benefit to even going [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=632.7s)]
*  to AA, which I really thought worked. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=637.5999999999999s)]
*  The reason AA seems to work is that people go to it and stick with it, like you say, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=639.7199999999999s)]
*  get something out of it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=644.5999999999999s)]
*  But there are going to be a bunch of people who don't get anything out of it. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=646.0799999999999s)]
*  We're like, I don't need to give my volition to God. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=648.5999999999999s)]
*  This is a problem I'm going to fix. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=654.2399999999999s)]
*  I don't like the AA model. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=655.5999999999999s)]
*  And by the way, why do I have to sit in this room three hours a week? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=657.0s)]
*  So for every person who gets something out of it, there's somebody who doesn't get anything [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=661.8599999999999s)]
*  out of it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=665.4799999999999s)]
*  The truth is people stop using drugs or stop gambling when they personally realize that [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=666.48s)]
*  it's become a crisis for them. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=672.96s)]
*  Sometimes though, people are motivated by other people's feedback. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=676.2s)]
*  So is there a point of no return? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=679.24s)]
*  Or is it... [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=681.5600000000001s)]
*  It's got to be variable for different people. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=683.0s)]
*  I think for some people, rehab is probably very beneficial, especially because they get [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=685.0s)]
*  a chance to talk to someone who made it out of it. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=688.9200000000001s)]
*  Who was telling us about this rehab guy that came in and cracked out of his mind? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=692.12s)]
*  It was Brian Simpson. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=696.92s)]
*  He was like a counselor or something like that. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=700.48s)]
*  And then one night he just went off the wagon and came back to work in the morning and everyone's [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=702.5600000000001s)]
*  like, hey, are we supposed to pretend that you're not cracked out of your mind right [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=707.36s)]
*  now? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=710.44s)]
*  No, but let me give you... [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=711.44s)]
*  But you laugh, but the most dangerous time for an addict is the first two weeks after [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=712.8s)]
*  they come out of rehab. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=717.98s)]
*  Because they've stopped using their tolerances down and if they start again, that's when [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=719.48s)]
*  people OD and die the most. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=723.0s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=724.6800000000001s)]
*  It's not easy. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=725.6800000000001s)]
*  But then the argument against legalization. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=729.4s)]
*  Here's the problem. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=731.84s)]
*  And I've talked about this ad nauseum, if you heard this, I'm sorry. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=732.84s)]
*  When I was a kid, if someone was on heroin, that was fucking super rare. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=737.16s)]
*  It was super rare. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=741.04s)]
*  You wouldn't know that guy's off the deep end. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=742.58s)]
*  Johnny's out there in the woods doing heroin. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=744.84s)]
*  Whoa, that guy's gone. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=746.72s)]
*  But now to hear, oh, my uncle got hooked on pills is super normal. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=750.4000000000001s)]
*  It's super normal. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=755.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=756.12s)]
*  And now because of these documentaries, we know what was the root cause of that. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=757.12s)]
*  But now once it's kind of been established that this is a recreational thing for people. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=759.5600000000001s)]
*  So what do you do? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=767.7600000000001s)]
*  Do you outlaw it? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=768.7600000000001s)]
*  And then what does that do? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=769.7600000000001s)]
*  That empowers the cartels because there's the demand already. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=771.36s)]
*  So OK, so the roots of the opioid crisis are exactly, you know, Peter Burke. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=775.4s)]
*  I mean, you know, that that that that series is completely correct. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=779.9599999999999s)]
*  It came out of Purdue Pharma. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=783.4399999999999s)]
*  It came out of unfortunately some doctors, some of whom I think thought they were doing [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=785.68s)]
*  the right thing, some of whom are motivated by money. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=789.28s)]
*  They pushed prescriptions of opioids in the U.S. in an absolutely insane way. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=792.22s)]
*  And we've now tried to push back, but we're still dealing with the fruits of that poison [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=797.52s)]
*  tree. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=803.68s)]
*  That's what they've done before in other countries to kind of ruin countries, like introduce [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=804.9599999999999s)]
*  heroin. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=809.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=810.52s)]
*  I mean, the classic example and you know, when people talk about how the Chinese export [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=811.52s)]
*  fentanyl to the United States, I guarantee you there are people in China who have not [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=813.5999999999999s)]
*  forgot the opium wars in the 19th century. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=817.04s)]
*  The U.S. and Britain. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=820.16s)]
*  And this is something we should be ashamed of forever. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=821.16s)]
*  We basically forced opium on the Chinese and we we destroyed that society. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=824.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, you and I weren't alive. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=828.8s)]
*  That's true. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=830.3599999999999s)]
*  So I don't think we should be ashamed. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=831.3599999999999s)]
*  But I think human beings in general have done some really fucking heinous things. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=832.82s)]
*  We just want to pretend that they don't do them anymore. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=837.3000000000001s)]
*  Oh no, they do. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=839.58s)]
*  But isn't it interesting? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=841.24s)]
*  Like it's part of the pushback of all this stuff from people that are that have no stake [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=842.24s)]
*  in the game other than they're a human being, is that you're saying something that shatters [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=847.7600000000001s)]
*  their narrative. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=854.0200000000001s)]
*  They have a narrative they've established about what's good in the world, how the world, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=855.6800000000001s)]
*  what's the right thing to do and the direction we have to go. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=860.42s)]
*  And these people are looking out for us and these people are Nazis. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=863.66s)]
*  And when you have that and something comes along and says, hey, there there might be [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=867.68s)]
*  something afoot here, you should pay attention. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=872.02s)]
*  Like there's some data you should look at. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=875.5999999999999s)]
*  We have a long history of people lying about all kinds of things, whether it's the opium [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=877.9599999999999s)]
*  war or fucking everything throughout human history. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=883.54s)]
*  But for whatever it is, like now we don't, hey, that's not that's oh, this conspiracy [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=885.88s)]
*  theorist. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=891.72s)]
*  Oh, this guy is this wacky guy with his fringe ideas. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=892.72s)]
*  He's an alt-right hero and like, oh, OK, I get it. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=898.26s)]
*  I get it. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=902.72s)]
*  I wish the world was perfect, too. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=903.72s)]
*  I really do. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=904.72s)]
*  I wish there was a guy in the White House that was this amazing human being and a shining [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=905.72s)]
*  example of what's possible from just a person, a loving person wants to take care of a nation. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=908.9399999999999s)]
*  Because they really believe in them. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=916.7199999999999s)]
*  But this is like. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=917.7199999999999s)]
*  You've got me laughing. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=918.7199999999999s)]
*  But it's what we want. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=922.7199999999999s)]
*  And we never get it. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=923.7199999999999s)]
*  We never get it. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=925.4799999999999s)]
*  It's like fucking it's it's Charlie Brown and Lucy. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=926.4799999999999s)]
*  That football just gets yanked away every time. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=930.9799999999999s)]
*  And we're like, shit, shit, I thought this was going to be the adults were in the room. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=933.9599999999999s)]
*  Shit, you know. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=940.8s)]
*  Look, I mean, beware the person who tells you what to do because they know what's best [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=941.8s)]
*  for you. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=946.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's a normal thing of human nature, too. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=947.3599999999999s)]
*  It's a weird thing about human nature. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=950.9599999999999s)]
*  We're always led by someone. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=952.52s)]
*  It's very strange because it seems to be a part of just our programming that we have [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=954.88s)]
*  we've kept since we were primates in the jungles. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=961.0s)]
*  There was always a leader. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=965.92s)]
*  There's like if you ever watch that Chimp Nation show, the amazing show on Netflix, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=966.92s)]
*  these scientists were embedded in this chimpanzee group for 30 years. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=971.56s)]
*  And so the chimpanzees had become totally comfortable with human beings as long as they [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=976.64s)]
*  were 20 yards away. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=982.68s)]
*  So they never moved any closer than 20 yards. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=984.0799999999999s)]
*  The chimps moved close to them. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=985.88s)]
*  They back away. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=987.0799999999999s)]
*  You never have food. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=988.0799999999999s)]
*  It's a bunch of rules about what to do and what not to do. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=989.0799999999999s)]
*  But if you follow those rules, these chimps behave as if they're just chimps in the jungle. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=991.72s)]
*  So it's this incredible opportunity to watch their social hierarchy. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=997.04s)]
*  And it's just like people. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1000.64s)]
*  There's a leader. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1001.64s)]
*  There's always a leader. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1002.64s)]
*  There's always a leader. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1003.64s)]
*  There's always young people that are challenging the leader and the leader has to beat him [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1004.64s)]
*  down and it gets to a certain point in time when the leader can't do that anymore. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1008.04s)]
*  And he has to relinquish. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1011.12s)]
*  And it's all about the relationships they develop while they're leaders. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1013.76s)]
*  And those are the ones that can go on the longest. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1017.36s)]
*  That's the same thing with human beings. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1019.24s)]
*  It's like, God damn it. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1020.52s)]
*  It's literally our programming. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1022.0s)]
*  And we've surpassed it in our ability to communicate and our ability to understand [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1025.24s)]
*  the variables and the amount of variables. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1030.28s)]
*  But we still operate on this chimp hierarchy. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1032.76s)]
*  It's really crazy because if you watch that chimp empire show and you think of us like [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1037.32s)]
*  you can go, oh my God, this is what our problem is. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1043.4s)]
*  We always want to have a leader. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1046.52s)]
*  We always want to run things. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1047.88s)]
*  We always want to tell other people. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1049.32s)]
*  We get power out of telling other people what to do. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1051.16s)]
*  Some people just get their jollies. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1054.6599999999999s)]
*  You know that if you have a bad boss and the boss yells at all the people in the warehouse? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1056.26s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1060.58s)]
*  Just wants to humiliate and be in charge. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1061.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1063.3799999999999s)]
*  They want to beat their chest and run through the fucking trees and shake them. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1064.3799999999999s)]
*  It does sometimes feel like anybody who wants power should not be allowed to have it. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1068.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1072.54s)]
*  Right? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1073.54s)]
*  And the only people who should be president are people who don't want that job. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1074.54s)]
*  It's like John Dutton in Yellowstone. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1077.26s)]
*  He has to become governor. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1078.86s)]
*  It's like, it's really like fucking, it's kind of similar. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1080.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1084.5800000000002s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1085.5800000000002s)]
*  But I mean, meanwhile, the old chimp now will not leave the stage. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1086.5800000000002s)]
*  Bro, not just the old, I mean all of them, all of them. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1091.02s)]
*  These people are hanging in. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1095.0600000000002s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1096.66s)]
*  With like hormone replacement and Adderall and whatever else they have to take. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1097.66s)]
*  These folks can keep going deep into their 80s. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1101.94s)]
*  Except that Mitch McConnell guy. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1105.0600000000002s)]
*  No, no, he's. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1106.22s)]
*  He's having some real ones. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1107.22s)]
*  He's just going to fall over. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1108.5800000000002s)]
*  He's having some real moments like that. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1109.9s)]
*  If that in any other job, like imagine if you're a train conductor and you just freeze [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1112.18s)]
*  up Charlie, Charlie, the crossroads is coming. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1115.8000000000002s)]
*  Charlie and Charlie's just locked up like Windows 98. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1118.74s)]
*  Blue screen of that. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1125.18s)]
*  You got control. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1127.5s)]
*  I'll delete Charlie before this fucking train crashes. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1128.5s)]
*  But you can do it if you know you're a high ranking politician in the greatest country [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1132.5800000000002s)]
*  the world's ever known. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1136.74s)]
*  Very strange. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1138.96s)]
*  You know, like Dianne Feinstein doesn't want to relinquish her throne. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1139.96s)]
*  But what I understand is it's also all the people that work for her too. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1144.88s)]
*  And they all have like a whole system. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1147.8400000000001s)]
*  It's probably not even her that's getting things done. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1149.48s)]
*  It's a giant staff. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1152.1200000000001s)]
*  And if she stays in office and the giant staff keeps doing what they're doing. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1154.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1156.8s)]
*  I don't even know if it's a giant staff, but a competent staff. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1157.8s)]
*  It's not about. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1160.0800000000002s)]
*  No, their jobs depend on her. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1161.0800000000002s)]
*  As much as Hollywood, right? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1163.92s)]
*  Like your job depends on your relationship with the big guy, big woman. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1165.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1168.8s)]
*  Well, you know that lady's not making the big decisions at this point. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1169.8s)]
*  Nope. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1172.6000000000001s)]
*  At this stage. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1173.6000000000001s)]
*  That's when she started. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1174.96s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1175.96s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1176.96s)]
*  She's kind of pretty. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1177.96s)]
*  She was hot. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1178.96s)]
*  So the thing is, man, when you get that job is like any other job. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1179.96s)]
*  If that's what you do, if you play football, you fucking you're used to colliding with [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1183.96s)]
*  people and scrambling for the ball. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1187.92s)]
*  That's what you do. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1190.14s)]
*  What they do is govern. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1191.32s)]
*  Why are you going to tell Mick Jagger he can't tour anymore? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1192.72s)]
*  That's right. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1196.1599999999999s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1197.1599999999999s)]
*  He looks awesome out there. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1198.1599999999999s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1199.1599999999999s)]
*  They're fucking politicians. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1200.36s)]
*  What do we expect? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1201.36s)]
*  It's just that should be like fucking there should be some sort of a cognitive test or [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1202.96s)]
*  something at some point in time. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1210.24s)]
*  It should be like, look, we really need. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1211.84s)]
*  Can we give you another job? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1214.8s)]
*  Like a second job? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1215.8s)]
*  That's right. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1216.8s)]
*  You have to be 35 to be president. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1217.8s)]
*  Why shouldn't there be a top limit? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1219.12s)]
*  Why shouldn't it be 80 or something? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1220.72s)]
*  Some reasonable number. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1222.32s)]
*  Why don't we move like the elder statesmen into a different bracket and like advisors, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1223.32s)]
*  have them be advisors to discuss policy. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1229.08s)]
*  Wouldn't that be great? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1231.72s)]
*  If like the senators could go and meet with the advisors are still around, back in the [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1233.16s)]
*  2000s, there was an issue with 4G. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1238.24s)]
*  You know, I mean, there's got to be a way to do it where you have like more vibrant [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1244.76s)]
*  people representing whatever they're representing. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1249.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1253.8400000000001s)]
*  But it's also they don't want to relinquish power. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1254.96s)]
*  And they've got a really good grip on it now. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1258.5200000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's really if you want to run a country like within the rules and kind of [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1260.2800000000002s)]
*  dominate it, they've done an amazing job because they've done it all within the rules. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1264.24s)]
*  It's like it's pretty clever. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1267.88s)]
*  Yes. It's like when Donald Trump was talking about not paying taxes. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1269.5200000000002s)]
*  Yes. You know, it's like, yeah, you guys set it up like that. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1273.0400000000002s)]
*  So I'm going to take advantage of it. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1275.2800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Yes. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1277.24s)]
*  It's like it makes sense. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1278.24s)]
*  Well, I mean, so this is a good I mean, it's a good segue into a lot of things, but [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1279.28s)]
*  it's also a good segue into sort of covid and pharma and those guys, because because [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1282.68s)]
*  they are masters at going to the edge of the line, going to the gray area. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1287.68s)]
*  Right. They don't they don't necessarily lie, although sometimes I think when they're [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1292.04s)]
*  forced to, they will lie. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1295.6s)]
*  But they shade the truth. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1297.2s)]
*  They they run studies in a way that determines, you know, that gets the out gets them to [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1299.56s)]
*  the outcome they want. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1305.44s)]
*  They use friendly doctors to promote. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1306.8s)]
*  You saw with pharma, with with Purdue Pharma, with the with oxy and with the opioids, you [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1309.08s)]
*  saw this in spades. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1313.04s)]
*  And we're seeing it again right now with the mRNA vaccine. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1314.68s)]
*  So these these companies, they know they're very they're very legally wise and they play [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1317.96s)]
*  games. And they're allowed to and they're allowed to. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1325.8s)]
*  And that's their job. Right. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1329.84s)]
*  That's what's interesting. Well, you would hope it's not their job. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1331.2s)]
*  Well, there's one guy's job and that guy's job is to invent medicine. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1334.48s)]
*  I mean, not one guy. Yeah, but one group of cures. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1338.0800000000002s)]
*  And then the other people, their job is to sell it. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1340.8000000000002s)]
*  Their job is to get it out there in the very different kinds of thought processes, I would [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1343.16s)]
*  imagine. And that's part of the problem with like business and medicine when they're [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1347.8400000000001s)]
*  together. It's like either we're looking out for each other or we're trying to make insane [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1352.16s)]
*  amounts of wealth from each other. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1356.68s)]
*  That's right. Both of those things are like that's two ways of looking at the health care [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1358.0800000000002s)]
*  for a country. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1363.76s)]
*  Either we say the whole reason the system is in place is to make sure that everybody is [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1365.08s)]
*  healthy. And if you get injured, we can help you. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1369.92s)]
*  If you do it that way, that would be wonderful. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1373.4s)]
*  The other way to do it is saying we got to fucking get you on as much shit as possible, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1376.04s)]
*  because the more stuff we sell to you, the more money we make. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1381.72s)]
*  And if there's a reason to recommend it, we're going to recommend it because you want to [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1385.0s)]
*  make our reps happy, want to make the hospital happy. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1389.32s)]
*  And unfortunately, that seems to be real, too. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1392.84s)]
*  It's very real. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1397.72s)]
*  So that's real, too. So that's a real possibility in today's modern age. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1399.3999999999999s)]
*  And I'm sure there are people that fall into the former. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1403.56s)]
*  I'm sure there's I mean, I know doctors that are great human beings and they really enjoy [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1407.52s)]
*  being able to help people. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1411.76s)]
*  Yes. It's not. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1413.04s)]
*  It's just like it's just that's how a system works. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1414.12s)]
*  When when a system has the opportunity to make more money by doing certain things, it's [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1418.84s)]
*  like it's not the scientists that are trying to do it. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1423.84s)]
*  It's like there's a whole system. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1426.4399999999998s)]
*  So what the drug companies and I think this is true of doctors. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1428.6799999999998s)]
*  It's not that they they want people to get better. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1431.12s)]
*  I do believe that. OK. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1433.0s)]
*  But once you've invested a billion or two billion dollars in a drug and you've brought it [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1434.36s)]
*  to market and it's gotten FDA approval, you're going to do whatever you can to protect it. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1438.28s)]
*  And that means generally exaggerating its benefits. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1442.88s)]
*  And if there are problems with it, doing everything you can to hide those problems. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1446.4s)]
*  And that's almost like a fiscal responsibility to your shareholders. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1450.88s)]
*  That's right. That's right. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1454.64s)]
*  It's really crazy. That's what's really crazy. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1455.64s)]
*  What's really crazy about it is that money and medicine are all combined. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1457.72s)]
*  And it's not saying that doctors don't deserve money or the people that develop medicines [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1461.48s)]
*  don't deserve money. They certainly do. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1464.92s)]
*  They work really hard. What I am saying is when you have anything that gets wrapped up [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1466.48s)]
*  in a lot of money, people want to make more. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1472.24s)]
*  Yeah. They want to make more. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1474.84s)]
*  Like, how do we make more? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1476.44s)]
*  Yes. You know, I don't like making, you know, X amount. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1477.68s)]
*  I want to make Y. How do I get to Y? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1480.08s)]
*  What do I have to do? I'm going to sell this. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1482.2s)]
*  I got to do that. I got to make some unnecessary these or those and do a few things to [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1483.6s)]
*  people that maybe they didn't need. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1489.04s)]
*  Yes. And it's OK, because maybe it benefits them. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1490.48s)]
*  It probably doesn't hurt them that much. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1493.76s)]
*  You justify it. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1495.6s)]
*  And then there's real things that people thought were conspiracies, real things like [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1497.6s)]
*  incentives. And that showed up during the pandemic as well. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1501.6s)]
*  But there was they got paid per case for people that had covid and they got paid per [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1506.12s)]
*  covid deaths. And they got the whole thing was weird. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1513.6s)]
*  It's like if you financially incentivize the treatment of a pandemic disease, that [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1516.8799999999999s)]
*  seems like I understand that hospitals have to make money. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1523.9199999999998s)]
*  But isn't there a fear that you label something covid death, you get more money, that [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1528.1200000000001s)]
*  people would use that on things that weren't necessarily covid, especially if there's no [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1536.48s)]
*  oversight. Oh, yeah, of course. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1541.0s)]
*  They're not combing through your fucking books. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1542.28s)]
*  And if the worst thing that happens, if they do comb through your books, is you have to [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1544.64s)]

*  That's right. Exactly. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1549.64s)]
*  Exactly. We just we upcoded a little bit here. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1550.84s)]
*  We cheat a little bit there. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1553.3600000000001s)]
*  We'll give you a check. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1554.64s)]
*  Elon talked about it on the podcast and people said he was making it up. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1555.6399999999999s)]
*  Nope, he was not making it up. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1558.56s)]
*  He was saying if you got bit by a shark and you had covid, they would call it a covid [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1559.8799999999999s)]
*  death. Yes. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1564.1599999999999s)]
*  It's like what? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1565.2s)]
*  And and this is still going on, Joe. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1566.72s)]
*  This is going on until 2025. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1569.0s)]
*  If you're if you're a family member and you're and you can get a family member who [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1570.96s)]
*  died to be classified as a covid death, you get up to nine thousand dollars for their [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1576.8s)]
*  funeral expenses. You submit it to FEMA. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1580.72s)]
*  They cut you a check. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1583.52s)]
*  And so, of course, those families want, you know, they want nine thousand dollars. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1585.04s)]
*  Who wouldn't? I mean, yeah, it's free nine thousand dollars. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1590.44s)]
*  Your loved ones already gone. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1595.0s)]
*  Yes. The whole thing is just so slippery because, yeah, you would if in, you know, if [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1596.1599999999999s)]
*  everything was perfect, you would say maybe it would be good to help these people the [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1601.6799999999998s)]
*  funeral. Maybe it would be good if you. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1605.6799999999998s)]
*  But why is covid different than anything else? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1608.44s)]
*  If good question. Right. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1610.3999999999999s)]
*  Why do you get nine grand for covid and nothing else? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1611.56s)]
*  What do you think would it be like if people started promoting that for obese folks? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1614.72s)]
*  If you're obese and you die, you get not that's bankrupt. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1619.76s)]
*  The federal government. Grandma was obese. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1624.0s)]
*  You know, like you just like people respond to incentives when there's money. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1626.96s)]
*  Companies respond. Unfortunately, right. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1631.8s)]
*  Everybody. Yeah, I mean, I guess. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1633.84s)]
*  Unfortunately. I mean, look, it's why we have this, you know, all these great things in [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1635.24s)]
*  this country, too. But yeah, I will. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1639.12s)]
*  So an ophthalmologist called me a few weeks ago. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1643.5600000000002s)]
*  There's a drug and the drug works. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1647.2s)]
*  OK, it's good. It's good for people. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1649.1200000000001s)]
*  If you if something called wet macular degeneration, OK, it's it's something older [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1651.8s)]
*  people get and it can blind you. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1656.72s)]
*  So there's a drug. There's a couple of drugs that that actually work for it. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1658.28s)]
*  They block the flow of they block blood vessel formation at the back of the eye. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1662.76s)]
*  They help you. So these are administered ophthalmologists administer them in their [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1668.0800000000002s)]
*  offices. So a drug like that, the ophthalmologist actually buys and charges Medicare [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1672.6s)]
*  or the private insurer for. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1678.04s)]
*  OK, what's happening? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1679.8799999999999s)]
*  And and I saw this with a different drug when I worked in The New York Times 15 years [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1681.48s)]
*  ago. So nothing ever changes. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1684.6399999999999s)]
*  These companies all play the same games is that the companies that make this drug are [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1686.1999999999998s)]
*  giving doctors a rebate on the purchase price. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1691.56s)]
*  And and the more you use, the bigger the rebate. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1695.9199999999998s)]
*  And and this is a drug that costs thousands of dollars per per person per year. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1699.1599999999999s)]
*  OK, it's dose multiple times a year for a lot of these people. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1705.2399999999998s)]
*  So what all this adds up to is if you're an ophthalmologist who's using a lot of this, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1707.8799999999999s)]
*  the company is cutting you a check for five or sometimes six figures, sometimes multiple [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1712.36s)]
*  times a year. OK, don't tell me that's not a bribe, OK, because that's a bribe. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1718.9199999999998s)]
*  It may be legal. They may have found a way to do this. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1724.6799999999998s)]
*  And he showed me he showed me that the check that his company or that his ophthalmology [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1727.08s)]
*  practice had received. And it was huge. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1733.36s)]
*  OK. And by the way, these doctors make a lot of money on their own just doing the procedure. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1735.76s)]
*  They don't need this. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1740.96s)]
*  But but it's a way for the drug company to get them to use this more. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1742.4399999999998s)]
*  There is corruption all over our medical system. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1746.36s)]
*  And how how does that get resolved? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1749.64s)]
*  Is there a way at this point or is it the system itself? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1760.0s)]
*  Is it just a function of that's how human beings behave when they have, you know, enough [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1763.8400000000001s)]
*  regulation where they can get away with some stuff and they just want to make more and [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1771.1200000000001s)]
*  more money and it just becomes that's what they're trying to do. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1776.0400000000002s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1779.8s)]
*  I mean, just human beings. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1781.04s)]
*  I mean, if you're that ophthalmologist in Florida, do you need another Ferrari? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1782.28s)]
*  But maybe you don't think that way. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1785.72s)]
*  You don't think that way. You just think I can get it right. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1787.28s)]
*  And I'm in this system and the system is fucked already. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1789.88s)]
*  That's right. And I'm using this drug because I know it works and it's good for patients. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1792.28s)]
*  The problem is you're then you're then having incentives to ignore the problem if there [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1796.04s)]
*  is one later. And so in this case, the guy actually said to me, he's like, this is a [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1802.0s)]
*  good drug. It does work. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1806.4s)]
*  He said, but sometimes if we dose it too many times, we can get there can be sort of a [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1808.36s)]
*  paradoxical effect where it stops working. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1812.3999999999999s)]
*  If you're one of those doctors who's on the tit and getting that check every quarter or [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1815.96s)]
*  every six months or however frequently you get it, you're going to it's going to be harder [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1820.6399999999999s)]
*  for you to see the problem because all of a sudden you have a financial incentive not to [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1825.6399999999999s)]
*  see it. Right. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1830.12s)]
*  I don't know what we do about any of this. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1833.28s)]
*  Except talk about it and make sure people know. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1838.36s)]
*  Talk about it and make sure people know. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1840.6399999999999s)]
*  And, you know, you need senators that call this stuff out. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1842.28s)]
*  And we need, you know, need people that run these companies to be just to have ethical [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1846.72s)]
*  boundaries, you know, because they make great stuff. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1851.76s)]
*  The thing about pharmaceutical drug companies is like, I would never say we don't need them. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1854.72s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1858.96s)]
*  I mean, people they've helped. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1860.48s)]
*  You know, many drugs, the pharmaceutical companies that we currently demonize because of [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1862.0s)]
*  this thing, this this for profit aspect of it. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1866.2s)]
*  But how many of them have brought drugs to the market that have fixed all sorts of problems [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1870.0s)]
*  that people have been suffering for forever? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1874.8400000000001s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1877.16s)]
*  They just they just can't go ham. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1878.52s)]
*  You can't go crazy and force people to take your stuff like that's a bad relationship. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1882.52s)]
*  A good relationship is a consumer and a provider. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1888.3600000000001s)]
*  And the provider develops these drugs that are very beneficial to people. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1891.48s)]
*  And most of them are a lot of them. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1895.48s)]
*  Right. Some of them are. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1897.72s)]
*  But they do have drugs that they've developed that are really beneficial for people. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1899.64s)]
*  They really do. They're real. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1904.48s)]
*  And we can't fucking throw out the baby with the bathwater. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1906.48s)]
*  I just think that it just had the problem is also the process. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1909.92s)]
*  Right. Because to bring a drug to market costs so much fucking money. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1914.4s)]
*  It costs a crazy. It's so prohibitive for most. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1919.56s)]
*  If you were like some pharmacologist or some biologist and you guys were working together [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1923.04s)]
*  and you develop something, you had this idea about a pathway and you figured out something [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1928.6399999999999s)]
*  and maybe this could fix it and you really figured it out. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1932.04s)]
*  Sure. Good fucking luck. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1934.24s)]
*  Right. Good luck getting that thing approved. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1937.32s)]
*  Well, I mean, one of the great disappointments for me in the last 10 years is realizing that [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1940.6399999999999s)]
*  if you had to choose between a sewer system and a medical system, you'd choose a sewer system. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1946.3999999999999s)]
*  Like in other words, what's more efficient? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1951.96s)]
*  What what actually helps human health more? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1954.2s)]
*  The great gains for human longevity in the last 200 years have been really simple things. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1957.3600000000001s)]
*  Clean water. Try to get the air clean. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1964.16s)]
*  Don't bury. You know, don't have like meatpacking plants in the middle of cities. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1966.4s)]
*  Don't don't have giant graveyards in the middle of cities like that. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1970.04s)]
*  So you seemed over. Excuse me. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1973.48s)]
*  Have you read dissolving illusions? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1975.1200000000001s)]
*  I have not. It's a fantastic book about just that. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1976.92s)]
*  And the beginning of it is they talk about the conditions that people lived in, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1980.1599999999999s)]
*  because you never really think about it like, what would it be like to live in a city before there were cars? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1985.6s)]
*  Well, guess what? Horseshoe. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1990.32s)]
*  But nothing gets to you. That's right. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1991.84s)]
*  You're not getting fresh vegetables in the winter. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1993.84s)]
*  You're not getting vitamins. That's right. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1996.6399999999999s)]
*  It is massive malnutrition, starvation, extreme poverty. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=1998.32s)]
*  People live in squalor. Terrible sanitation. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2002.0s)]
*  I mean, open outhouses for entire blocks of people. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2005.4399999999998s)]
*  Yep. And just crazy diseases. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2009.1200000000001s)]
*  Yep. And they all lives on top of each other. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2011.52s)]
*  And again, malnutrition, no vitamin D, no sunlight exposure in the winter, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2014.32s)]
*  And a lot of those people get horrible diseases because of that, just like they did in the olden times. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2019.8400000000001s)]
*  We know about when people dump shit in the streets. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2024.88s)]
*  Yes. So I mean, like the like 18 the first, you know, the first few decades of the Industrial Revolution were terrible for human health. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2027.52s)]
*  Like people got, you know, they got crammed together, they got sick. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2035.76s)]
*  And then about 1850, they started to figure this stuff out for 100 years. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2038.08s)]
*  Like we did great. OK. But it wasn't really medicine. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2042.08s)]
*  It was really more basic than that. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2046.0s)]
*  And so the last 50, 60, 70 years, we've spent more and more and more money on medicine, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2048.24s)]
*  trying to like continue that growth in life expectancy. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2054.92s)]
*  And it turns out like there are limits to it. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2059.28s)]
*  There are just limits and we seem to be reaching them. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2062.24s)]
*  And the and the problem is in the U.S. anyway, we're now spending so much money and having so many unnecessary medical procedures of marginal value. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2064.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm not even talking about the cost. I'm talking about like value to people that we've we seem to have topped out. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2074.92s)]
*  And this is like a really depressing thing to realize that that ultimately, like once people get to be about 80, there's just not that much you can do for them. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2080.2000000000003s)]
*  Unless you're Vince McMahon. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2089.36s)]
*  You ever see what he looks like? He's 78 years old. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2090.8s)]
*  He's jacked. He goes to the gym at three o'clock in the morning, sleeps two hours a night. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2095.1200000000003s)]
*  So there's that canary in the coal mine. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2101.0800000000004s)]
*  That's right. Let's see him at 82. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2103.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's only four years from now. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2105.84s)]
*  But the reality is, you're right. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2108.44s)]
*  It's, you know, but it's also there's a lot of complicated factors in being healthy. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2110.0800000000004s)]
*  And they don't all involve medicine. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2115.8s)]
*  No. And it's not just. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2117.36s)]
*  There is joking. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2119.6800000000003s)]
*  No, no, that's legit. I think he was 76 or the 74. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2120.76s)]
*  That's those four years. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2124.04s)]
*  I still jacked up. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2125.48s)]
*  Ridiculous. Wow. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2126.52s)]
*  Modern science right there, baby. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2127.84s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2130.32s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2132.6400000000003s)]
*  Jacked. 76, 78 year old man. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2133.6400000000003s)]
*  This jacked. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2137.0s)]
*  He keeps it rolling down, down, down, down, down, down. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2138.6400000000003s)]
*  The train kept rolling with him. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2144.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, man, it's there's a lot going on with people's health. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2146.04s)]
*  And the reality is we we rightly should attribute a lot of it to medicine. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2149.28s)]
*  It's great. They did a lot of great stuff. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2156.7200000000003s)]
*  But also there's a lot of other factors. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2158.56s)]
*  And the factor with like plagues is like the sanitation systems that we had in this country [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2160.7200000000003s)]
*  at the beginning of the 19th century. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2165.76s)]
*  They were horrible. Horrible. Horrible. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2168.28s)]
*  Yes. Horrible. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2170.28s)]
*  Cholera. I mean, everything. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2171.6s)]
*  Typhus. Terrible disease. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2173.2s)]
*  It's all gangs in New York. People forget. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2175.64s)]
*  You think in New York, you think of like Fifth Avenue, like what an amazing place to visit. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2178.12s)]
*  In fact, that was horrific. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2182.56s)]
*  Little Johnny came home with a cold and the next day was dead. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2183.7999999999997s)]
*  Horrific. Yeah. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2188.08s)]
*  People were just dying left and right. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2189.92s)]
*  You know, one one thing that I also found out that was fascinating was about the Spanish flu. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2191.72s)]
*  You know, the Spanish flu killed so many people, right? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2196.96s)]
*  It killed a shit ton of people. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2199.64s)]
*  But they said that what it killed people from is not actually the flu itself, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2202.12s)]
*  but the side diseases that come with it and that you could have cured those with antibiotics. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2206.92s)]
*  Bacterial pneumonia. Yep. That's true. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2210.92s)]
*  Bacterial pneumonia. And what was the other one? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2212.92s)]
*  There was another one. I think meningitis. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2214.6s)]
*  That may be. That may be. Was it that? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2216.96s)]
*  But they said they could have cured those with antibiotics. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2219.56s)]
*  Yes, that's true. So if that happened, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2223.04s)]
*  the fear was always that the Spanish flu happened today. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2225.24s)]
*  But because medical science has progressed, if that same flu came around today, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2227.7599999999998s)]
*  they would actually be able to save most of them. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2232.04s)]
*  The mortality rate would probably be much lower. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2233.8s)]
*  No, if there's a bad flu or bad, you know, another coronavirus, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2235.92s)]
*  you I can just about guarantee you that will come out of a lab, just like this one did. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2239.84s)]
*  This is a conspiracy theory and this is getting you kicked off YouTube. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2245.24s)]
*  It's not a conspiracy theory to say it came out of a lab. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2249.88s)]
*  Isn't it funny that it used to be? Yes. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2252.68s)]
*  You used to be racist to say it. That's right. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2254.7599999999998s)]
*  There used to be something wrong with you. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2256.48s)]
*  They did an amazing job of gaslighting people. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2257.52s)]
*  I didn't say it was made in a lab. I said it came out of a lab. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2260.68s)]
*  Yes. And it did. OK. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2263.24s)]
*  So what seems like the people in the lab were patients zero. Right. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2265.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they were they were fucking around with the coronavirus. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2270.52s)]
*  They were trying to make it more dangerous or trying to make vaccine, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2274.0s)]
*  a pan coronavirus vaccine. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2277.52s)]
*  And they didn't they, you know, somebody slipped or somebody accidentally [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2279.44s)]
*  injected a ferret when they were supposed to inject a mouse. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2283.44s)]
*  And it all started there. Most likely. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2286.0s)]
*  Yes, most likely. Yeah. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2290.0s)]
*  It's just that's weird how little outrage there is about that. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2292.2000000000003s)]
*  Yes. By the way, if it came out of a of a cave, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2297.04s)]
*  it came out of a cave when some idiot who shouldn't have been in the cave [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2301.1200000000003s)]
*  was poking around, swabbing a bat's asshole to try to like find a virus. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2304.8s)]
*  So either way, it's the fault of our effort. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2309.8s)]
*  We did this. OK. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2313.32s)]
*  Is there any benefit from that kind of research? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2315.6800000000003s)]
*  No, it should all be stopped. Period. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2317.92s)]
*  Do they just do it because that's what they do? Yes. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2320.28s)]
*  Just like we do research. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2323.2400000000002s)]
*  And I want to do research on coronaviruses and how to make them more infectious. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2324.6400000000003s)]
*  Yes, it should all be stopped. It's useless. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2328.6s)]
*  OK, you want the proof that it's useless. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2330.88s)]
*  Did you hear anybody predict this was going to happen before it happened? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2332.84s)]
*  They spent 10 years trying to figure out what was going to happen. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2335.7200000000003s)]
*  But is there any benefit in understanding those things [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2338.2400000000002s)]
*  so that they can develop drugs to combat them? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2340.84s)]
*  Broadly, no. And also, there's a problem with that. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2344.8s)]
*  Because you literally have a thing where you have a cure for a thing. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2347.76s)]
*  And if that thing gets out, then you can sell that cure. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2352.0400000000004s)]
*  If you're Dr. Evil, you're going to fucking open the hatch. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2354.6000000000004s)]
*  That's right. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2357.48s)]
*  No, you would hope nobody would ever do that. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2358.28s)]
*  But you would hope. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2362.0s)]
*  But there's been people in the world that have done some horrible. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2363.1600000000003s)]
*  We know Hitler was a real guy. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2367.2000000000003s)]
*  We know that was like that never happened again. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2369.48s)]
*  Are you fucking sure? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2372.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. Are you totally sure? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2374.92s)]
*  There's been genocide since then. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2377.16s)]
*  It seems like the only way this boy. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2378.64s)]
*  I mean, we have to figure out a way to catch up to our abilities, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2385.04s)]
*  like catch up as a species. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2390.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't know how. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2392.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, so the last we have the ability to like affect [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2394.8399999999997s)]
*  so many people in negative ways with like with whatever it is, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2398.16s)]
*  drugs and all sorts of things that we do. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2401.7999999999997s)]
*  The you know, so I have you. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2404.7999999999997s)]
*  Did you see Oppenheimer the movie? I haven't seen it yet. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2407.16s)]
*  It's pretty great. OK. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2409.48s)]
*  Amazing. And and and so I read the book it's based on, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2410.7599999999998s)]
*  which also pretty amazing. OK. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2413.3199999999997s)]
*  That was a case. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2415.96s)]
*  You know, those guys, unbelievable, they just like they [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2418.44s)]
*  they looked inside the atom with their minds, right? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2421.52s)]
*  It's unbelievable. They figured out how this works. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2423.7999999999997s)]
*  And then they took metal and they they made the sun. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2426.04s)]
*  OK, they made an explosion like the sun. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2428.48s)]
*  They figured it out in a matter of years. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2430.72s)]
*  It was so scary to people, the threat that nuclear weapons [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2433.48s)]
*  pose that we actually kind of got it under control. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2437.44s)]
*  We never used them again after 1945, which is really astonishing. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2440.4s)]
*  It's pretty amazing. So so so so when when the threat is obvious enough [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2443.84s)]
*  that like you can eliminate a city in seconds, our little lizard brains, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2448.64s)]
*  we figure something out. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2452.52s)]
*  The problem is with with these viruses, it's a little more marginal. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2453.88s)]
*  It's not as obvious. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2457.84s)]
*  And so we have these people just continuing to mess around with them. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2459.04s)]
*  I hate to take you off track, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2462.76s)]
*  but when the nuclear bombs were first detonated [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2464.52s)]
*  in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and I think with some of the tests, too, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2468.92s)]
*  right after that is when people started seeing a lot of UFOs. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2471.76s)]
*  That's like the folklore behind UFOs. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2475.88s)]
*  They all started coming after 47. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2478.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I did not know that. Yeah. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2479.92s)]
*  So I would ask you, what the fuck is going on? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2482.0s)]
*  What the fuck is going on when you see all this UAP stuff [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2485.64s)]
*  and all these people that are whistleblowers [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2488.7200000000003s)]
*  and they're talking about crashed retrieval programs [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2491.52s)]
*  where they could recover crashed UFOs and back engineer them like, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2495.16s)]
*  so what's going on? I'm not a believer in this. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2498.72s)]
*  And let me tell you what, please. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2500.52s)]
*  OK, you are an alien. OK. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2501.56s)]
*  You got super hyper advanced technology. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2504.36s)]
*  You can you can go faster than the speed of light. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2506.7599999999998s)]
*  You can get to Earth. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2508.96s)]
*  You can figure out that this one little planet has other human beings [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2509.96s)]
*  or has other life forms on it that you want to go see. OK. Right. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2513.44s)]
*  You do that. Then you crash your stupid UFO into the desert. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2516.8s)]
*  OK. And I have a problem with that. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2521.52s)]
*  What one one more point on this. OK. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2523.24s)]
*  What happened with the Titan submersible? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2526.0s)]
*  OK, that thing went down and basically they knew. Right. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2528.04s)]
*  Within hours that it was blown up. OK. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2531.68s)]
*  They still were human beings. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2534.2s)]
*  We try to rescue other human beings. OK. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2536.0s)]
*  The aliens aren't going to try to rescue other aliens [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2539.24s)]
*  if there's been a crash. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2541.6s)]
*  They're not going to try to come get them. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2542.88s)]
*  So you tell me you tell me why it's always in the desert in Arizona. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2545.12s)]
*  They never show up at the White House. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2548.7599999999998s)]
*  They never show up in Times Square. Why? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2549.8s)]
*  There have been places where large groups of people seen it. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2551.8s)]
*  And there was a place in Brazil, Virginia, Brazil. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2557.0800000000004s)]
*  And there's a very interesting documentary about it called Moment of Contact. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2561.7200000000003s)]
*  And there was a crash. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2566.48s)]
*  There was a crazy lightning storm and there was a crash. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2567.88s)]
*  And they claim that there was actual live beings. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2571.04s)]
*  And one of these guys took one of these beings to a hospital. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2575.04s)]
*  They refused it, brought to another hospital. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2577.88s)]
*  I think they want to bring it to a third hospital. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2580.08s)]
*  The guy who is carrying this alien, supposedly. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2582.36s)]
*  But this is a fact. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2586.8s)]
*  This guy died of some incurable bacterial disease that they had no hope of fixing. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2588.0s)]
*  Like it just overcame his body and he was dead very quickly. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2593.6000000000004s)]
*  And he was a young guy. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2596.28s)]
*  I think he's dead in less than two weeks. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2597.84s)]
*  And they were attributing that to him carrying this fucking alien. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2600.04s)]
*  So what happened? What happened to the body, the alien body? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2603.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2605.6800000000003s)]
*  They say that the United States Air Force flew a jet. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2606.48s)]
*  And this is in the documentary. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2609.64s)]
*  They said it flew a jet to Virginia, Brazil to recover whatever this thing was. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2610.84s)]
*  Because they have a, you know, a recover retrieval program. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2617.6s)]
*  Who the fuck knows, man? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2620.92s)]
*  Every time I even say it, I sound so dumb. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2622.64s)]
*  I listen to myself like, you believe this? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2625.4s)]
*  Do you believe this? But I do think we just crashed an F-35. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2627.48s)]
*  That's true. There's a guy had a fucking eject out of his jet. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2632.52s)]
*  And they're like, hey, if anybody sees one of our 800 million dollar [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2635.16s)]
*  jets, call this hotline. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2638.2799999999997s)]
*  This is what I'm saying. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2641.12s)]
*  Like, that's us. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2642.7999999999997s)]
*  And that's the pinnacle of like modern technology. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2643.7999999999997s)]
*  Maybe if you just have their saucers over Washington, D.C. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2646.7999999999997s)]
*  What year was that, James? 52. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2650.2799999999997s)]
*  There you go. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2651.92s)]
*  Yeah, it was a newspaper article where they had they apparently they [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2652.96s)]
*  shot photographed. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2657.2s)]
*  Yeah, someone tried to shoot at one. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2658.52s)]
*  But what does that mean? What does that mean? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2660.52s)]
*  And, you know, when when someone tells a story like that, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2662.3199999999997s)]
*  you know, maybe they did see something. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2665.16s)]
*  I mean, how much of it do they remember? [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2666.8799999999997s)]
*  How much have they embellished? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2668.68s)]
*  Oh, so why were they at the time? [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2671.16s)]
*  But there are fighter jets, fighter jets that have encountered them. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2673.72s)]
*  I believe those guys sober, sober, like American heroes. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2677.8799999999997s)]
*  Yes. Like David Fravor. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2681.8399999999997s)]
*  Yes. That story is insane. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2683.24s)]
*  But I tend to think more than ever [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2684.8399999999997s)]
*  that it's a drone and that there's some sort of a drone program [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2688.7599999999998s)]
*  that they've kept secret that is insanely powerful. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2693.2s)]
*  That I'll believe. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2696.64s)]
*  And if I had a drone program that can do wild shit, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2697.48s)]
*  like go hypersonic speeds and hover dead still in midair [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2701.64s)]
*  and operated without any visible method of propulsion, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2705.8799999999997s)]
*  I would start talking about aliens, too. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2709.0s)]
*  I'd be like, dude, they're here. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2711.08s)]
*  We don't even know what they are. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2712.6s)]
*  They're off road vehicles like or excuse me, off world vehicles. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2713.96s)]
*  So and then people would go, oh, yeah, aliens are here. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2718.7599999999998s)]
*  But meanwhile, what it is, is we have super sophisticated tech [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2721.92s)]
*  that your tax dollars have paid for without you having any idea it exists. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2725.44s)]
*  Well, for your own protection. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2728.88s)]
*  So you don't believe in aliens? I do. And I don't. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2730.08s)]
*  Well, I do. And, you know, of course, is the Fermi paradox. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2732.88s)]
*  Like if they're out there, where are they? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2736.16s)]
*  How can we have seen them? [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2737.88s)]
*  But how much can we look? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2738.92s)]
*  That's like a guy poking his head out of a tent going, I don't see any bear. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2740.48s)]
*  How fucking much do you look at? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2744.6s)]
*  How much are you really paying attention? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2746.96s)]
*  There's 100 billion stars in this galaxy alone. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2748.2400000000002s)]
*  Hundreds of billions of galaxies in the known universe. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2751.04s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2753.7200000000003s)]

*  Well, the same way we go to the Congo and film for Chimp Empire. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2765.96s)]
*  It's really not that much different. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2770.7200000000003s)]
*  The same way we go to butterfly habitats and study butterflies. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2772.8s)]
*  Like human beings are fascinated by some of the most primitive of creatures. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2776.4s)]

*  When when people can go and travel to exotic places, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2786.96s)]
*  and especially biologists, and study these animals, you know, like you ever read [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2791.4399999999996s)]
*  Sapolsky's work with the baboons? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2795.56s)]

*  Any Stanford? Just brilliant guy. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2803.6s)]

*  Are you aware of that? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2810.0s)]
*  Toxoplasmosis is nuts. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2811.2000000000003s)]
*  It's one of the reasons why they tell women to not handle kitty litter. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2812.6400000000003s)]
*  Toxoplasmosis is a cat parasite that grows in a cat's gut. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2816.84s)]
*  And when it gets on rats, it rewires the rat's sexual reward system [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2822.92s)]
*  and make the rats sexually attracted to cat urine. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2829.0400000000004s)]
*  And it removes their fear of cats [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2833.0800000000004s)]
*  so that the cats devour the rats, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2836.52s)]
*  because the only way that that that parasite can reproduce is inside a cat's gut. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2839.44s)]
*  So the parasite reproduces inside the cat's gut, comes out and catch it. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2845.08s)]
*  And then people get and people get it from cat shit. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2849.68s)]
*  You might get it from an open wound. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2852.2s)]
*  You might get it from handling it. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2853.56s)]
*  But when people get it, it makes them more reckless. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2855.24s)]
*  He said there's a disproportionate number of motorcycle victims, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2858.6s)]
*  crash victims that are toxoplasmosis infected. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2861.68s)]
*  At one point in time, France was like 50 percent of the people had toxoplasmosis. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2864.96s)]
*  And that wild. That is why it changes behavior. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2871.04s)]
*  It affects behavior. OK. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2873.84s)]
*  I did not know. And it's a fucking parasite that like half a population of a country had. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2875.72s)]
*  Because feral cats, you have feral cats everywhere. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2882.36s)]
*  So point is, we study all kinds of shit. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2887.88s)]
*  Weird parasites and fucking monkeys and giraffes and everything. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2891.6000000000004s)]
*  There it is. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2898.2400000000002s)]
*  Toxoplasmosis is considered to be a leading cause of death [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2899.36s)]
*  attributed to foodborne illness in the United States. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2901.7200000000003s)]
*  More than 40 million men, women and children in the U.S. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2903.96s)]
*  carry the toxoplasm parasite, but very few have symptoms [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2906.2400000000002s)]
*  because the immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2910.28s)]
*  This is like if you have HIV late stage or something, you winds up killing. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2912.88s)]
*  Interesting. Interesting, right? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2916.96s)]
*  It's a very bizarre parasite. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2919.28s)]
*  But we study fucking penguins, man. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2921.04s)]
*  We'll go study. They all look the same. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2924.56s)]
*  The march of the penguins is, you know, when people study them, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2926.48s)]
*  they love to watch organisms. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2929.08s)]

*  Yeah, but ultimately we mess around with those penguins. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2933.24s)]
*  The aliens would mess around with us. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2935.44s)]
*  I think they might be. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2936.96s)]

*  If you think about the there's a weird thing [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=2946.24s)]

*  You know, yes, it's the reality that people would sell things [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3143.6400000000003s)]
*  that don't work just to make money and they could put you at risk. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3146.7200000000003s)]
*  But it's like if they can, they will. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3149.64s)]
*  And if they have it for sale, it's like, we've got to get this stuff off the shelves. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3151.6800000000003s)]
*  Come on. We've been developing this. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3156.6s)]
*  We developed this thing for the variants. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3158.48s)]
*  So this is a number. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3161.76s)]
*  And they just tested on 10 mice. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3163.2000000000003s)]
*  Yes. Pfizer, literally 10 mice. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3164.64s)]
*  Yes. Not a joke. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3166.76s)]
*  There were five billion doses so far of the mRNAs made. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3169.6800000000003s)]
*  OK, about 100 billion dollars sold by Pfizer. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3172.88s)]
*  No, a little bit more. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3177.8s)]
*  One hundred and 110, 120 billion dollars sold by Pfizer and Moderna combined. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3179.2400000000002s)]
*  OK, my best estimate, and I haven't been able to lock it down [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3183.56s)]
*  because the numbers are really hard to find. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3187.4s)]
*  Two billion of those five billion doses were thrown away, unused. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3189.56s)]
*  The companies made somewhere between 40, 50 billion dollars [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3194.36s)]
*  on vaccine that just got tossed. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3198.48s)]
*  It was a pure gift to the companies. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3201.8s)]
*  40 billion dollars. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3204.48s)]
*  Wow. Now that even by even by American pharmaceutical standards, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3205.6800000000003s)]
*  that's a lot of money. It's a lot of money to waste. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3211.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, geez. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3214.1600000000003s)]
*  Because nobody wanted them. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3216.7200000000003s)]
*  They made. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3218.56s)]
*  Pfizer made 75 billion in 2021 and 2022. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3219.96s)]
*  Moderna made close to 40. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3224.1200000000003s)]
*  They made some more this year, not as much. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3225.92s)]
*  But yeah, it's a lot of money. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3227.8s)]
*  Whoa. Yeah, it's hard to turn that big it off. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3229.4s)]
*  That's hard to turn that big it off. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3232.68s)]
*  That's right. And it's hard to tell the truth when there's that much money. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3234.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, can you, though, if you've if you put something out and you like again, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3237.72s)]
*  we're bringing this back to the obligation to your shareholders [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3242.68s)]
*  and how to run a corporation versus like what's the right thing to do. Right. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3245.3599999999997s)]
*  If you have something and you haven't been called out for it [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3249.2799999999997s)]
*  and there seems to be like enough gaslighting going on in the media [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3252.3599999999997s)]
*  that sort of obscures the reality of it. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3255.56s)]
*  You're supposed to keep selling it. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3259.96s)]
*  I mean, if if that's what your company does. Right. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3262.64s)]
*  I'm not saying it's good, but I'm saying like if you if you don't know [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3266.44s)]
*  there's a problem, then you don't know there's a problem. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3271.8799999999997s)]
*  And if you don't look to find the problem, then you don't know. Right. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3274.92s)]
*  So you don't look. So you don't look. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3279.04s)]
*  That's the game. Boy, I wish that wasn't the game. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3281.72s)]
*  I wish the game was we want to make medicine to make you feel better. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3286.12s)]
*  And if that medicine doesn't work, we try to come up with a new one. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3289.3599999999997s)]
*  Sorry. That's right. No, that's not the game. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3291.88s)]
*  It's just isn't it sort of just the amount of money [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3294.04s)]
*  involved in developing one of those things, the incentives to pass it through, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3297.2000000000003s)]
*  regardless of whether or not it's effective, are so strong. Yes. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3301.8s)]
*  Because you're so in the fucking red before you could get out of the gate. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3305.0s)]
*  Yeah. Before you get out of the gate. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3309.4s)]
*  Yeah. You're into this thing. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3311.2000000000003s)]
*  A billion dollars or whatever. That's right. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3312.4s)]
*  And the flip side of that is it's so profitable on a per unit basis [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3314.0s)]
*  because it takes a few cents to make. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3317.88s)]
*  And then you could sell it for five dollars or fifty dollars or five hundred dollars. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3319.8s)]
*  So the so the per unit profit once you get once you earn your nut back. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3324.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Is phenomenal. Phenomenal. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3329.8s)]
*  You know, so, you know, I'm suing the government, right? [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3331.96s)]
*  I'm suing I'm suing. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3334.0400000000004s)]
*  How many people say that to you all casual? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3335.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, I'm suing the government. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3337.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm suing the government. Oh, that's cool. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3338.44s)]
*  But I'm also suing the chief executive of Pfizer [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3340.44s)]
*  and one of the board members of Pfizer, all in the same suit. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3343.6800000000003s)]
*  So they've they've responded. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3346.28s)]
*  And they've you know, it's called a motion to dismiss. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3348.68s)]
*  They want the lawsuit gone. OK. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3350.68s)]
*  One of the things they say in the lawsuit is that I have been fundraising [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3352.3599999999997s)]
*  and I have a substack and I've been merchandising, which I've been merchandising. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3357.3599999999997s)]
*  This shirt is is my own printed [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3360.44s)]
*  Borla is the CEO of Pfizer Fouchy. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3365.08s)]
*  We all know Gottlieb is on the Pfizer board and Slavitt is somebody else. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3367.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm suing you have a t-shirt on like you're a YouTube streamer. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3371.44s)]
*  I do. I do people's names. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3374.2799999999997s)]
*  For clicks. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3377.52s)]
*  But but so so so Pfizer's lawyers have said or or Borla's lawyers, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3379.24s)]
*  Albert Borla, the CEO of of of Pfizer, as I like to call him, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3385.08s)]
*  the world's favorite veterinarian, because he's not a doctor. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3388.6s)]
*  He's he's a doctor of veterinarian medicine, which is fine. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3390.8399999999997s)]
*  We need those. But yeah, absolutely. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3393.4s)]
*  But but you know what? [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3394.96s)]
*  He sort of treated the world like livestock. But but Borla [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3396.3199999999997s)]
*  is trying to get this lawsuit dismissed. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3401.52s)]
*  And he's saying Berenson's making all this money. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3403.08s)]
*  Listen, buddy, your company made 70 billion dollars selling the vaccines. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3406.08s)]
*  And you personally had your salary double from 18 million to 33 million, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3410.48s)]
*  almost double from 2020 to 2022. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3415.76s)]
*  So don't call me the grifter, my friend, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3418.44s)]
*  when you're the one who's made more money than anyone can imagine on these vaccines. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3421.36s)]
*  Well, he's calling you a grifter because you're making money from what? [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3427.36s)]
*  Substance because I have a sub say and because I've raised money to. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3430.08s)]
*  You write about other things in sub stack. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3433.28s)]
*  You write about many things. I do. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3435.2s)]
*  But no, no. I mean, you would say I read a lot about it. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3436.72s)]
*  I would. You know, I write a lot about covid in the vaccine. Sure. Yeah. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3438.3999999999996s)]
*  But, you know, the whole thing is that having that as an argument [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3442.8399999999997s)]
*  seems kind of crazy, like it should be based on whether or not he's right. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3446.72s)]
*  That's right. And also, like, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3449.68s)]
*  why did you guys get him kicked off Twitter? [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3452.2799999999997s)]
*  Like, who did that and why? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3453.92s)]
*  And who who talked to who and how did that go down? [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3455.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, that's a you know, so that's what the lawsuit's about. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3458.68s)]
*  But I know I know that this guy, Scott Gottlieb, who's [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3461.52s)]
*  get this show, Scott Gottlieb between 2017 and 2019 [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3466.0s)]
*  was the commissioner of the FDA. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3470.24s)]
*  He quit the FDA. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3472.2799999999997s)]
*  And three months later, exactly three months, the minimum amount of time later, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3473.68s)]
*  he joined the Pfizer board where he's a senior board member, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3478.24s)]
*  where they pay him about four hundred thousand dollars a year. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3481.3599999999997s)]
*  That sounds like a sweet gig. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3483.96s)]
*  It is a nice gig for a couple of meetings. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3485.3199999999997s)]
*  So it's good move. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3487.52s)]
*  So Scott Gottlieb has earned his paycheck with Pfizer, though, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3488.56s)]
*  because he in August of twenty twenty one [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3491.72s)]
*  made a call to a senior lobbyist at Twitter. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3495.56s)]
*  And within a few hours, I had gotten my fifth strike [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3500.12s)]
*  and I was kicked off Twitter. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3504.12s)]
*  And what were you kicked off for specifically? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3505.6s)]
*  I mean, we can find the tweet, but you just tell me. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3508.12s)]
*  But the exact words were it doesn't stop infection or transmission. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3510.72s)]
*  Think of it at best as a therapeutic [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3516.16s)]
*  that needs to be diagnosed in advance of infection [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3519.68s)]
*  and has bad side effects. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3523.3199999999997s)]
*  And we want to mandate it insanity. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3524.96s)]
*  That was the entire tweet. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3527.4399999999996s)]
*  Every word of that is true. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3529.16s)]
*  Let me tell you what was really happening. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3531.64s)]
*  OK, we can we can talk about the vaccines and the approval process [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3533.3199999999997s)]
*  and the hype around them and the hope around them in early twenty twenty one. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3536.8399999999997s)]
*  And you can make a good case that, hey, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3539.9199999999996s)]
*  there were people just trying to get out of the pandemic. Right. All right. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3542.64s)]
*  By the summer of twenty twenty one, everything changed. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3546.36s)]
*  Everybody who knew where to look, which was really Israel, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3549.84s)]
*  could see that the vaccines were not working for very long. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3552.88s)]
*  That that why was the Israel data was important because first of all, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3555.8s)]
*  they were first, they were first to vaccinate small country. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3559.52s)]
*  They vaccinated almost everybody by the end of January. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3563.4s)]
*  And were they very open about their data? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3565.92s)]
*  They were. And you can read stories from the spring of twenty twenty one [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3568.08s)]
*  talking about the miracle, how covid went to zero in Israel, basically, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3571.68s)]
*  because there is this short period of time after those first two doses [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3576.3199999999997s)]
*  when you do actually prevent infection. OK, I don't think I don't think anybody [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3580.16s)]
*  who looks at the data can dispute that. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3583.9199999999996s)]
*  I know there are some people who do, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3585.12s)]
*  but I don't think there's anybody who can really dispute that. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3586.0s)]
*  OK, then what happens is your antibodies go away and it comes roaring back. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3588.08s)]
*  And you also often provoke a new variant, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3592.3199999999997s)]
*  which is what happened in the summer of twenty twenty one, the Delta variant, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3595.8799999999997s)]
*  you know, sort of came roaring along. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3598.56s)]
*  So by by July of twenty twenty one, explain to people [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3600.7599999999998s)]
*  to don't understand how that could be possible. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3603.7599999999998s)]
*  Sure. How how does a vaccine promote a variant? [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3605.4399999999996s)]
*  So so these vaccines specifically, these MRAs cause a very focused immune response. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3608.3999999999996s)]
*  And what they do is they make your body make a specific version of the spike protein, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3614.3599999999997s)]
*  which is, you know, the part of the coronavirus that attaches to your cells [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3619.4399999999996s)]
*  and gets the virus into your cells. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3623.2s)]
*  So the idea is your body makes a spike. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3625.16s)]
*  Your body recognizes the spike as an invader. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3627.7200000000003s)]
*  It makes antibodies against the spike. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3631.04s)]
*  And then if you actually are hit with the coronavirus, if you're infected with it, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3633.36s)]
*  you've got this great head start where your body's antibodies can [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3636.8s)]
*  can attack the coronavirus and keep it from infecting any of your cells. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3640.6000000000004s)]
*  You don't get infected. You beat it. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3644.44s)]
*  OK, that that that's I mean, that's the basic theory of the vaccine. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3646.6000000000004s)]
*  OK, the problem is the virus, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3650.1200000000003s)]
*  quote unquote, knows what's happening. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3653.6800000000003s)]
*  The virus, the virus is going to mutate. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3655.88s)]
*  There are just going to be errors in its genome over time. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3659.08s)]
*  These are these RNA viruses are notorious for this. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3662.48s)]
*  They when they replicate their they they make mistakes. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3665.4s)]
*  And some of those mistakes in the genome lead the virus to look a little bit [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3669.4s)]
*  differently, the spike to look a little bit different. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3673.28s)]
*  And then the antibodies can attach as well. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3675.6s)]
*  If you're if you're a virus that's mutated and you have these different antibodies, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3678.56s)]
*  you have an advantage. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3682.6s)]
*  The advantage is suddenly you can infect people again. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3683.88s)]
*  Guess what? That version of the virus is going to take off and accelerate. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3687.6800000000003s)]
*  So that's that's a very natural process. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3692.88s)]
*  Here's here's one thing nobody sort of thinks about, which is we really [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3695.92s)]
*  stop mass vaccinating people in late twenty twenty one early twenty two. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3699.4s)]
*  The rate of variants slowed way down last year and into this year. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3703.6s)]
*  Omicron came, but since then, there hasn't been another major variant class. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3708.0s)]
*  Is there any dispute in this? [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3711.64s)]
*  Because there was a conversation that I got in with a friend of mine [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3712.8399999999997s)]
*  at the very beginning of the pandemic, and he was trying to tell me [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3715.56s)]
*  that his doctor was telling him that it was the unvaccinated people [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3718.64s)]
*  that were causing variants. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3722.12s)]
*  No. And I sent him some YouTube videos. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3723.2s)]
*  I'm like, this is what I've read. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3726.24s)]
*  And what is the name? Geert van der Bosch? Yes. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3727.7999999999997s)]
*  He's an expert. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3730.7999999999997s)]
*  And what is he? [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3732.6s)]
*  He's an epidemiologist or forget what he is. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3734.52s)]
*  Something to do with vaccines. Yes. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3737.4s)]
*  But he understands the whole pathway. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3738.8399999999997s)]
*  It's like you never mass vaccinate during a pandemic. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3740.2s)]
*  Yes. Especially with something that doesn't offer. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3742.96s)]
*  That's leaky. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Complete. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3746.24s)]
*  So so I mean, that's why you give people the flu vaccine before flu season. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3748.64s)]
*  Ideally, you do not mass vaccinate during a pandemic. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3752.64s)]
*  So but so in the summer of twenty twenty one, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3755.72s)]
*  everything went to shit from the point of view of of the Biden administration [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3758.48s)]
*  and to a lesser extent, the vaccine companies. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3763.48s)]
*  OK, the vaccine companies were more aware that this was going to happen. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3765.68s)]
*  But remember the Bidenites and you can find I can find you a clip of Fauci [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3768.4s)]
*  in May twenty twenty one saying this is over. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3772.36s)]
*  Like, I think we can eliminate this. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3775.6800000000003s)]
*  He said that on the record. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3777.7200000000003s)]
*  They were caught with their pants down and their response was twofold. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3779.48s)]
*  One, we're going to try to get everyone boosted. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3783.2000000000003s)]
*  We're going to try to scare people into getting boosted or encourage people [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3785.44s)]
*  who to get boosted, which which they knew or should have known [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3788.6400000000003s)]
*  was only going to buy them a matter of months. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3793.1600000000003s)]
*  But they didn't care. They just wanted to do something. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3794.92s)]
*  The other part, though, was even worse. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3797.48s)]
*  And that was the mandates. OK, the mandates were unforgivable, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3799.92s)]
*  unforgivable constitutionally, unforgivable medically. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3803.84s)]
*  And here this is unfortunately what I've concluded about the mandates. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3807.6000000000004s)]
*  You know what else was happening in August twenty twenty one? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3812.1600000000003s)]
*  Afghanistan collapsed. OK. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3814.96s)]
*  And I don't know if you remember, but I'm sure you can find it [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3817.32s)]
*  that there's a picture of Joe Biden sitting alone in the situation room, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3820.6800000000003s)]
*  looking at TVs, and he looks like he looks completely lost. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3824.7999999999997s)]
*  OK, we left Afghanistan in July. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3828.8799999999997s)]
*  By August, there were the Taliban was in Kabul. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3831.72s)]
*  And we were, you know, Marines were getting killed [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3836.56s)]
*  and Afghans were trying to get on airplanes. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3839.3199999999997s)]
*  It was terrible. OK, here's the thing about the mandates. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3841.7599999999998s)]
*  Let's let's just pretend the vaccines actually work for a long period of time. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3847.7599999999998s)]
*  OK, and let's pretend that 90 percent of older people hadn't been vaccinated, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3851.4s)]
*  which they had been. OK, so let's pretend that there was an actual [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3858.2000000000003s)]
*  justification for these mandates. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3861.6s)]
*  What were they, Joe? They were workplace mandates. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3864.1200000000003s)]
*  The government couldn't directly make old people get vaccinated. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3867.2400000000002s)]
*  So they said, we're going to have workplace mandates. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3871.08s)]
*  Who is in the workforce? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3874.1200000000003s)]
*  Healthy adults under 65. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3876.4s)]
*  So there was no possibility that the mandates [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3879.12s)]
*  could actually affect the population most at risk from Covid and get them vaccinated. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3882.7200000000003s)]
*  They were designed not to work, [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3887.92s)]
*  but to be something that the president could say he was doing [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3890.76s)]
*  at a time when he looked completely incompetent [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3894.92s)]
*  because of what had happened in Afghanistan. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3898.0s)]
*  That is my true belief about this. That's it. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3900.16s)]
*  That's it. You need something that is not that picture. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3903.84s)]
*  Geez. That was August. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3907.36s)]
*  Geez. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3910.96s)]
*  I don't know if that's the case, but I do know that. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3913.88s)]
*  I mean, if you have a vaccine [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3918.76s)]
*  that protects the people that take it. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3922.56s)]
*  What is what is the why you mandating it for the people that won't be protected? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3925.92s)]
*  That's right. If it does work, that's right. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3930.12s)]
*  You should probably encourage people to take it if it works. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3932.16s)]
*  But the people that don't take it. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3934.92s)]
*  Hey, let those people get sick if that's what they want to do. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3936.16s)]
*  Like, is that that's right. And they'll figure it out. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3939.16s)]
*  Because who are they going to get sick? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3941.12s)]
*  Just other people that have invested if it really works. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3942.3199999999997s)]
*  That's right. That's right. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3944.68s)]
*  And then people would eventually catch on. Right. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3945.68s)]
*  And then they would figure it out. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3948.12s)]
*  Like, you don't have to mandate it. Right. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3949.3999999999996s)]
*  So there was this theory that there was this young people [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3951.16s)]
*  for whom the vaccine hadn't been approved yet. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3954.64s)]
*  But that was, of course, a complete lie because young people are not at high risk [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3956.48s)]
*  from Covid. The only the only exception to that is there's a small number of people [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3959.3199999999997s)]
*  who are seriously immunocompromised. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3963.24s)]
*  I'm talking about people who have chemotherapy, people who are, you know, [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3964.84s)]
*  really sick. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3967.8s)]
*  And those people don't necessarily have a strong immune response to the vaccine. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3969.44s)]
*  So you say you say, OK, our theory is we're going to make everybody [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3972.76s)]
*  get vaccinated to protect those people. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3977.36s)]
*  Here's the problem with that. That's not how we practice medicine. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3979.1600000000003s)]
*  You don't practice medicine on a group basis. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3981.76s)]
*  I was talking with my friends the other day about it. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3983.96s)]
*  I was like, imagine if for some reason we were actually talking about [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3986.4s)]
*  fluoride in the water. But it's a similar analogy. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3990.4s)]
*  Imagine if some people are more susceptible to skin cancer. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3993.1200000000003s)]
*  So we put sunscreen and apples. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3996.0s)]
*  That's right. Like people go, no, I want to fucking just a regular apple. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=3997.6800000000003s)]
*  No, no, no. You need this. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4001.7200000000003s)]
*  It's for everyone. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4003.36s)]
*  We have to protect the other people that are vulnerable. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4004.4s)]
*  So this is how apples come now, because people love apples. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4006.7200000000003s)]
*  Why does he feel like what kind of craziness is this? [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4010.32s)]
*  You guys put medicine in the apples. That's right. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4012.76s)]
*  I mean, the thing about fluoride in the in the entering water is a very, very, very [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4014.8s)]
*  I don't know that there's any risk to it at all. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4018.4s)]
*  But that's what the standard has to be. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4020.56s)]
*  But do you know that there's there's associated lower IQs [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4022.0s)]
*  at places that have higher fluoride ratios? [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4025.32s)]
*  Yeah, we found it out the other day. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4028.24s)]
*  We're trying to figure it out. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4029.52s)]
*  Like we're like, why is why is fluoride in the water? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4030.44s)]
*  Like I've heard wacky conspiracy theories like the wackiest ones. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4033.16s)]
*  It's like it's to make people dumber and more docile. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4036.6s)]
*  But what I'm telling you is [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4039.36s)]
*  you're mandating this not for the people who are at risk, [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4041.92s)]
*  but for adults in the workplace who are not at risk. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4045.16s)]
*  What is the logic there? Right. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4047.84s)]
*  It is just to make that man look like he's doing something. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4049.92s)]
*  Do you really think that's it? [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4054.1600000000003s)]
*  I do, because I can't imagine. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4055.28s)]
*  I think people were so in the throes of that thing. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4057.12s)]
*  I think people when when Covid was in its just full phase [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4061.1600000000003s)]
*  and there was a heightened it's hard for us to remember [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4066.12s)]
*  because I think it was very traumatic. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4069.6400000000003s)]
*  It's you know, because when when you have a situation like, you know, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4071.6400000000003s)]
*  it's like people after 9-11, their memory is very foggy. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4074.32s)]
*  Right. Covid is very traumatic [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4076.6800000000003s)]
*  in a way that like was a long, slow drip of trauma in a weird way [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4079.12s)]
*  where it gave people horrible anxiety. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4083.7599999999998s)]
*  There's an invisible thing that's going to kill us all. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4085.7599999999998s)]
*  And you got to stay in your house. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4088.8399999999997s)]
*  You got to take the medicine and get boosted. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4089.88s)]
*  I don't think people got off that ride. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4091.8399999999997s)]
*  No, no, they didn't. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4093.52s)]
*  And maybe you're right. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4094.64s)]
*  And maybe I'm giving the White House too much credit. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4095.52s)]
*  Maybe they're just afraid and stupid. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4097.32s)]
*  But you go. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4099.4s)]
*  It was the it was the mindset of the country to do something. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4100.24s)]
*  And if you got vaccinated, you were a good person. Yes. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4104.28s)]
*  If you didn't, you remember, like people saying like you're [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4107.08s)]
*  pointing a loaded gun at someone's head if you're not vaccinated. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4109.4800000000005s)]
*  Joe, I'm not vaccinated. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4112.8s)]
*  I mean, not against this. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4114.32s)]
*  I have no MRA, no covid vaccine. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4115.52s)]
*  I believe me, I remember. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4117.64s)]
*  Find the statement that that Biden made is either September 8th [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4119.52s)]
*  or September 9th, 2021, where he said it was the White House. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4123.12s)]
*  It was when he announced the mandates, he said, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4126.400000000001s)]
*  we have lost patients with the unvaccinated. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4127.96s)]
*  And there's there's one from. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4130.64s)]
*  Do you think that was him taking control? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4132.6s)]
*  I do. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4134.44s)]
*  But it's also what you're saying. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4135.799999999999s)]
*  There was real fear. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4137.24s)]
*  But I mean, imagine that. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4138.48s)]
*  Imagine trying to divide the country like that. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4139.799999999999s)]
*  The wildest one was the White House statement [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4142.639999999999s)]
*  that said the unvaccinated will experience a winter of death. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4145.4s)]
*  Illness, a winter of severe illness and death. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4149.36s)]
*  Yes. Our patients is wearing thin. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4152.16s)]
*  Yeah, I remember that. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4155.16s)]
*  We've been patient, but our patients is wearing thin. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4156.799999999999s)]
*  That's so crazy if it already was proven that it didn't work. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4158.759999999999s)]
*  You know, people didn't one person get covid [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4162.4400000000005s)]
*  while they were in the the the test. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4165.84s)]
*  I mean, more than one. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4170.88s)]
*  But but they're definitely what happened was [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4172.4800000000005s)]
*  during the clinical trials, which only lasted a couple of months, [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4175.76s)]
*  that's that period when the vaccines really worked. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4178.72s)]
*  And there is this short period when you have a tremendous number of antibodies [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4181.72s)]
*  and you don't really get sick. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4185.64s)]
*  And that's what the data showed. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4187.08s)]
*  But it didn't show anything else. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4188.68s)]
*  And that's why they have to have long term studies. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4190.6s)]
*  Long term. Yes. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4193.200000000001s)]
*  But we didn't have the luxury of long term study. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4194.56s)]
*  So they seem to have we chose not to. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4197.360000000001s)]
*  It's just the weird thing was the ignoring of natural immunity. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4202.160000000001s)]
*  That was very that's another weird, not just ignoring, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4207.0s)]
*  but I had intelligent people that I respect [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4210.04s)]
*  trying to convince me that I should get vaccinated [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4214.6s)]
*  right after I recovered from covid. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4217.400000000001s)]
*  And I was like, well, I don't think that's scientific. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4220.64s)]
*  I think if you read the data, it shows you that you have a much higher [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4223.400000000001s)]
*  level of immunity from recovering from it naturally. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4227.76s)]
*  That's the data. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4231.96s)]
*  I'm not encouraging people to go get covid. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4232.6s)]
*  But I'm saying that that was what the data said. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4235.08s)]
*  So, like, and that while you get even more protected, if you get vaccinated, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4237.120000000001s)]
*  I'm like, OK, but is that more risks? [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4240.120000000001s)]
*  Like, what is the risk factor now? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4243.160000000001s)]
*  Like, is it because that's what I've heard. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4245.04s)]
*  There's like an elevated risk factor for adverse side effects. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4247.200000000001s)]
*  If you've just recovered from covid, is that true? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4250.12s)]
*  Yes, that is true. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4252.08s)]
*  There's no reason to be vaccinated. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4253.04s)]
*  But here's what it really was. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4255.0s)]
*  They wanted me to join the club. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4257.08s)]
*  That's right. That's what it was. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4258.64s)]
*  That's right. I'm in the club. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4259.8s)]
*  I took the vaccine. Did you take the vaccine? [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4261.0s)]
*  I got the new iPhone. Do you got the new iPhone? [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4262.76s)]
*  You know, that's right. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4264.92s)]
*  Team Pfizer, Team Maderna, electric car. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4266.2s)]
*  Yeah. No, no, Apple. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4268.32s)]
*  Team Apple. No, man, it's sick. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4269.88s)]
*  It's sick what they did. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4271.92s)]
*  Yeah, they got us. They got us. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4273.32s)]
*  They played us against ourselves and and people. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4275.88s)]
*  They they they literally [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4278.72s)]
*  enjoyed like [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4282.04s)]
*  chastising people for not following the rules. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4284.76s)]
*  Right. And when those rules turned out to not neither be accurate, [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4287.08s)]
*  scientific or even beneficial, when those rules turned out to be [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4291.04s)]
*  bullshit and actually detrimental, nobody apologized. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4294.4800000000005s)]
*  Nobody cared. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4297.76s)]
*  That's yes. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4298.84s)]
*  And and the reason it's worth talking about this now [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4299.64s)]
*  is because of what they did last week. Yeah. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4302.200000000001s)]
*  So they announce more. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4304.04s)]
*  They're trying to get everybody to get boosted. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4305.96s)]
*  Six month olds boosted 12 year olds, 12 years old, 12 year old boys, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4307.84s)]
*  20 year old guys who have a risk for myocarditis boosted. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4313.6s)]
*  It's wrong. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4317.4s)]
*  And it's not what the rest of the world's doing. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4318.52s)]
*  And they should be ashamed of themselves. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4320.28s)]
*  What did you tweet? [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4322.64s)]
*  You tweeted something about the numbers. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4323.56s)]
*  Yes. So what I tweeted and this one, this is this really landed. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4325.4400000000005s)]
*  It's gotten five million views since last week. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4329.6s)]
*  It was showing the CDC's own calculations. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4332.92s)]
*  You'd have to give a million doses to save maybe, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4337.2s)]
*  maybe one 12 to 17 year old. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4341.24s)]
*  But when you give those million doses, you have 100 to 200,000, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4343.76s)]
*  not 100 to 200, 100 to 200,000 [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4348.64s)]
*  severe side effects that are short term following the vaccination. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4351.88s)]
*  Plus, and I didn't put this in the slot in the in the in it. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4355.8s)]
*  You have another 50 to 300 cases of myocarditis. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4359.48s)]
*  So so maybe you save one person with those million doses, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4364.12s)]
*  but your side effects are so much worse. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4367.4s)]
*  And those are going to include some deaths. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4369.4s)]
*  OK, they are because myocarditis can kill young people. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4371.4s)]
*  So what are we doing? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4376.0s)]
*  The rest of the world, practically Germany, Australia, Britain, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4377.84s)]
*  most of the world, it did not, [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4382.04s)]
*  you know, did not follow this path. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4386.0s)]
*  It's only basically the United States and a couple of other countries [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4388.72s)]
*  like Canada that basically follow our recommendations that follow this path. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4391.64s)]
*  So so so this is these are the slides. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4395.52s)]
*  But if you if you if you go back to the main, yes, this is what it says. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4398.52s)]
*  This is what it says. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4404.0s)]
*  So the CDC's own data admits that you get 100 to 200,000 [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4405.56s)]
*  severe side effects per one million doses. Yeah. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4409.64s)]
*  So that I mean, that means that means like [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4412.280000000001s)]
*  are they getting that from theirs? [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4415.68s)]
*  So they're getting that from the clinical trials that the companies ran. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4417.44s)]
*  So that doesn't mean that doesn't mean like you're in the hospital for a month. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4420.96s)]
*  What it means is you might have a week of fever or you might have, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4424.679999999999s)]
*  you know, nausea that keeps you from going to school for three days. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4427.919999999999s)]
*  It's it's a but that's you said severe. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4431.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but those are those are classified as severe because remember, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4434.599999999999s)]
*  Covid isn't going to do that to most 12 to 17 year olds. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4437.96s)]
*  It's more severe than the illness itself. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4441.4s)]
*  So but the myocarditis aspect of it, those cases can kill. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4444.96s)]
*  No question about it. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4450.04s)]
*  Not not that they frequently do, but they can. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4451.48s)]
*  So there is zero putting aside the fact that this is an expensive thing. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4454.32s)]
*  And it's and you know, when we were trying to mandate it, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4458.24s)]
*  remember, a lot of schools, high schools, colleges said you had to have this. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4461.4s)]
*  If you're going to go putting aside the fact that you're taking away [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4465.16s)]
*  people's autonomy on a strictly cost benefit basis, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4467.5599999999995s)]
*  it makes zero sense to try to get kids and young adults [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4472.84s)]
*  and teenagers to take this and the rest of the world knows it. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4477.6s)]
*  Why don't we? [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4480.68s)]
*  Isn't it wild that what you said is controversial? [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4482.52s)]
*  Isn't it wild? It's wild. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4486.280000000001s)]
*  As a sign of the times, what you said was dangerous. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4487.4400000000005s)]
*  Like, oh, my God, what is he saying? That's right. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4489.320000000001s)]
*  I see people listening to that that are branch Covidians [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4491.52s)]
*  that are all in and still supporting the vaccine. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4494.4800000000005s)]
*  I know it works because I took five and I'm still alive. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4497.240000000001s)]
*  Like there's there's people out there like that. I've read comments. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4499.4800000000005s)]
*  I know I look at that every now and then I'll dive into someone's Covid [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4502.04s)]
*  debate and read what especially from like the hardcore lefties [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4505.08s)]
*  that are still all in on it. Yep. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4508.799999999999s)]
*  I'm starting to mask again. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4510.599999999999s)]
*  You know, like, yeah, they're masking. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4511.879999999999s)]
*  They're doing in New York City, I'm telling you. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4513.839999999999s)]
*  But I'll tell you something. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4515.5599999999995s)]
*  So DeSantis, like who's the only real politician [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4516.839999999999s)]
*  who's who really understands the math on this and takes it seriously. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4520.28s)]
*  And Joseph Lodopo, who's his his surgeon general, they came out last week [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4523.32s)]
*  and they said, we don't agree with the CDC recommendations. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4527.5599999999995s)]
*  We think people only people over 65 should get this. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4530.32s)]
*  Now, that's in keeping with the rest of the world. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4533.44s)]
*  So what happened? [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4535.4s)]
*  The New York Times and The Washington Post and NBC, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4536.24s)]
*  all the sort of elite media outlets attacked DeSantis and Lodopo over this. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4538.88s)]
*  And not one of them said, hey, what DeSantis is saying [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4543.36s)]
*  is what the rest of the world is doing. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4546.88s)]
*  We're the ones who are the outliers. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4548.599999999999s)]
*  No, it was Ron DeSantis doesn't agree with the CDC recommendations. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4549.96s)]
*  He's trying to get people in Florida killed. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4554.44s)]
*  No, it's a lie. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4557.0s)]
*  Is that really did they get that hyperbolic? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4559.12s)]
*  He's trying to get people in Florida killed. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4562.0s)]
*  That part I'm exaggerating. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4563.4s)]
*  But if that was a real headline, I'm like, man, that guy really went for it. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4564.6s)]
*  No, but the headlines were like experts say he may be putting people in Florida at risk. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4568.12s)]
*  There was stuff like that. OK. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4572.64s)]
*  All right. Maybe, maybe not. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4575.68s)]
*  Maybe not at all. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4579.12s)]
*  Like, at what point in time do we just look at reality and stop being so fucking tribal? [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4580.24s)]
*  Because I think if the people that had gotten vaccinated, [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4585.759999999999s)]
*  the people that got talked into it, maybe some of them that regretted it, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4589.799999999999s)]
*  if they didn't have a stake in the game and they could just look at this thing [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4593.36s)]
*  for what it is, they would be like, what? Right. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4596.28s)]
*  Like as it is now, they'd be like, what are you talking about? [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4599.679999999999s)]
*  But they're already so invested in being team vaccine. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4601.839999999999s)]
*  Well, isn't it interesting like team vaccine is also team Ukraine? [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4604.799999999999s)]
*  It's like it's weird. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4608.24s)]
*  So I'm one of the few people who actually is like not in favor of the MRAs, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4609.4s)]
*  but I do support our intervention. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4613.92s)]
*  I don't know if intervention is the right word. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4616.12s)]
*  I do support our supporting Ukraine. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4617.24s)]
*  I know that I'm like the only person. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4619.12s)]
*  That's a complicated conversation. Yes. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4621.24s)]
*  It's a very complicated conversation. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4623.36s)]
*  But just to go back to vaccines, you can't get unvaccinated. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4625.0s)]
*  So if you take in two or three of these or worse, if you'd had your 15 year old [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4628.08s)]
*  take one or two, you don't want to think about it anymore. Right. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4631.92s)]
*  And also you don't want to feel responsible. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4636.2s)]
*  So anything that comes, it's confirmation bias [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4637.96s)]
*  that can give you some sort of a feeling of peace that you didn't fuck up [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4640.799999999999s)]
*  and give the wrong thing to your kids and take the wrong thing yourself. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4646.48s)]
*  And anything you could do to like comfort yourself, [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4651.32s)]
*  because imagine if you for your children, you gave it to your children. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4654.16s)]
*  Not now. So your children has like some sort of a heart issue. Yep. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4657.48s)]
*  So people do like to hold on to their beliefs as much as they can, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4663.639999999999s)]
*  especially when those beliefs are integrated into a tribal ideology, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4667.96s)]
*  which it was in some strange reason for some strange reason rather. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4671.92s)]
*  During the pandemic, being vaccinated and believing the science [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4675.4s)]
*  and trusting the experts became part of the left's ideology. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4679.6s)]
*  And anyone else was a moron, a Trump supporter. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4684.28s)]
*  And, you know, get take your horse paced and die. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4687.32s)]
*  This is why this is why they don't like you, because you're clearly, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4690.72s)]
*  you know, not on Team Trump. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4693.52s)]
*  You're not a you're not a MAGA guy. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4695.08s)]
*  So they can't they can't they can't sort of tar you that way. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4696.76s)]
*  So you're too you're they don't like anybody. They can't categorize. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4701.24s)]
*  Well, we should all be uncategorizable. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4705.12s)]
*  We should all there's a lot of great ideas that come from both sides. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4707.400000000001s)]
*  It's like the idea that there's only two sides is crazy [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4710.64s)]
*  because there's so much variability, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4713.0s)]
*  so much variability in the left and variability in the right. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4715.04s)]
*  Like when you look at it, like the craziest fucking [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4717.360000000001s)]
*  militia guys on the right, and then you look at the craziest [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4720.72s)]
*  fucking antifa people on the left, like that's not representative [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4724.04s)]
*  of the right and the left. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4727.28s)]
*  That's representative of the worst aspects, the furthest out on the edges. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4728.16s)]
*  But if you are in agreement with anything that the right has to say, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4732.48s)]
*  whether it's stuff about, you know, regulations, the economy, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4737.28s)]
*  whatever the fuck it is, you are all of a sudden on the side [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4741.04s)]
*  of this goddamn militia. How did that happen? Right. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4743.48s)]
*  You know, you're on Team Michelle Obama's a man. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4747.56s)]
*  You're on Team. You know what I mean? [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4750.36s)]
*  Like you got to you got to go all the way with all this fucking [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4752.16s)]
*  kookiness that's on that side. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4755.5199999999995s)]
*  Like, oh, no, I just think that, you know, maybe we should have free speech. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4757.12s)]
*  Yes. Maybe freedom of speech is actually really important. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4762.32s)]
*  And freedom isn't something that should just be dismissed. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4765.04s)]
*  It sounds corny and cliche, but freedom is really critical. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4767.76s)]
*  The older I get, the better I understand the Constitution [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4771.16s)]
*  and why we have it and why we need it. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4773.8s)]
*  Those guys were wizards. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4775.599999999999s)]
*  Unbelievable. They were so good. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4776.96s)]
*  The people that wrote the Constitution were so good. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4778.68s)]
*  They understood human nature so well. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4781.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes. It's really crazy how they set it up [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4784.4s)]
*  because they like there's got to be a way to stop dictators. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4787.16s)]
*  There's got to be a way. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4790.0s)]
*  And they were kind of they were kind of on it for a while [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4792.2s)]
*  up until like World War Two. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4795.36s)]
*  It did a great job. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4798.08s)]
*  They did a great job. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4799.44s)]
*  So people amassed power and then they had the media and newspapers. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4800.44s)]
*  They controlled newspapers and all that. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4803.5599999999995s)]
*  And then it was like, oh, boy, boys getting slippery. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4805.16s)]
*  But they did a great job of setting it up, though, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4809.2s)]
*  that at least we have things that they don't have in other countries, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4813.04s)]
*  like freedom of speech, like that. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4816.24s)]
*  The First Amendment is it's so fucking polarizing [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4817.88s)]
*  for some strange reason. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4822.4400000000005s)]
*  And there's people that have like smart people that have openly said, [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4823.88s)]
*  maybe we should amend the First Amendment. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4827.68s)]
*  Yes. So so this is so I wrote this in a substack about a month ago. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4829.28s)]
*  This is very upsetting to me. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4833.6s)]
*  There was a poll that Gallup, I think, was Gallup did of just a few weeks [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4835.2s)]
*  before that, I think was June. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4840.76s)]
*  70 percent of Democrats now essentially think the government should be able [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4843.4s)]
*  to ban, quote unquote, false speech on social media. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4848.08s)]
*  So first of all, who is deciding what's true and what's false? [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4851.76s)]
*  OK. And second of all, you want the government to do that? [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4855.48s)]
*  Democrats used to believe in free speech that you say, you know, liberals. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4858.76s)]
*  The famous instance is when the ACLU in the late 70s, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4862.92s)]
*  there are these Nazis, Nazis marching in Skokie, Illinois. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4867.2s)]
*  And the ACLU said, we're going to defend them. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4870.68s)]
*  We hate them. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4873.5599999999995s)]
*  But we're going to defend their right to speak, because that's the First Amendment. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4874.76s)]
*  That's America. The left has just totally forgotten this. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4878.68s)]
*  They don't want to hear anything that they don't want to hear. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4881.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. It's unfortunate that we just have this thing in our head, [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4885.24s)]
*  that this is what my team believes. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4890.0s)]
*  It's so unfortunate because it really allows these things to take place. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4892.28s)]
*  Whereas if we're rational and objective and agnostic, we would look at it [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4896.5199999999995s)]
*  and go, these are problems. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4900.08s)]
*  Like, this is a problem for all of us. This is a problem for everybody. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4901.5599999999995s)]
*  But if, you know, that's your fucking problem, I want to, you know, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4904.5599999999995s)]
*  internal combustion engine, bitch, you know, you can't fucking [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4907.64s)]
*  make me drive electric car. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4910.48s)]
*  Like everyone is so we're so we have an identity, you know, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4912.36s)]
*  we identify with being a progressive. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4918.24s)]
*  We identify with being, you know, so yeah, whatever it is, whatever it is. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4920.839999999999s)]
*  And when we do that, we want everyone, we want to signal to everyone else [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4925.679999999999s)]
*  that we're on the team. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4930.04s)]
*  So frustrating. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4933.839999999999s)]
*  So crazy. It's just it's so crazy. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4936.16s)]
*  Yes. And you see it with every, you know, I don't know if you paid attention [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4938.799999999999s)]
*  to this this woman in Virginia is running for the [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4942.4s)]
*  she's a Democrat running for the House of Delegates. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4947.0s)]
*  You know, like like Virginia State Office. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4949.76s)]
*  And and she was caught, I think it was about a week ago. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4952.8s)]
*  She had like essentially a porn site with her husband. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4956.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Like filthy, just absolutely filthy. OK. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4959.4400000000005s)]
*  OK. So so there's filthy, filthy. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4964.64s)]
*  You can feel that's a good advertisement for it. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4966.96s)]
*  Alex Berenson says filthy, absolutely filthy. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4969.4800000000005s)]
*  So so meanwhile, you got Lauren Bober, right? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4972.96s)]
*  Who's like doing what she's doing in that, [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4975.240000000001s)]
*  you know, in that theater in Denver, right? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4978.16s)]
*  I heard about that. Yeah, right. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4980.879999999999s)]
*  So here's my thing. OK, they're both they've both disqualified themselves [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4982.2s)]
*  from political office, not because I have any problem with sex or anything like that, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4986.879999999999s)]
*  but because your judgment is so bad. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4990.759999999999s)]
*  OK, you have two little kids. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4992.5199999999995s)]
*  Don't start talking about how you're going to take money [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4994.16s)]
*  so people can watch your husband fuck you up the ass, [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4996.5199999999995s)]
*  which is literally what that woman in Virginia, when I say filthy, I mean filthy. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=4998.879999999999s)]
*  And don't and don't start jerking off your like buddy, [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5003.28s)]
*  your first date buddy in the theater, the Beetlejuice Theater, [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5006.6s)]
*  with with with a pregnant woman directly behind you and kids around you. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5009.84s)]
*  Just don't do it. OK. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5013.360000000001s)]
*  Neither of those women should be holding political office. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5014.96s)]
*  I don't think that should be a controversial position. OK. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5018.6s)]
*  But if you're on the left, you know, you know, this is this is the right [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5021.320000000001s)]
*  of a of a married woman to have sex on camera with her husband. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5025.6s)]
*  And God forbid we should we you know, we we say anything about it. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5029.6s)]
*  And if you're on the right, you know, Lauren Bober was just having a tough day [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5032.4800000000005s)]
*  or something. No. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5036.12s)]
*  Why can't we just judge these things sort of apolitically [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5037.2s)]
*  as the crummy behavior that they are? [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5040.68s)]
*  And why can't we say to these two like apologize and leave us alone? [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5043.8s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it's certainly an inappropriate place to be grabbing dicks and titties. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5048.36s)]
*  But I like the enthusiasm. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5053.4s)]
*  I like the fact that they're getting after it. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5055.92s)]
*  And they probably didn't think anybody could see because it was a dark. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5058.64s)]
*  There was a woman directly behind them, a pregnant woman who told them to stop. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5060.88s)]
*  Oh, really? Because they were doing it all the time. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5064.2s)]
*  Wow. She's a lot of fun. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5067.04s)]
*  Yeah. Probably a reckless human. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5069.92s)]
*  Note to self, this did not go the direction I hoped it would. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5072.76s)]
*  Come on, Alex. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5076.6s)]
*  We have to have some fun with this. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5078.16s)]

*  I mean, listen, you know, adults are going to do it. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5084.48s)]
*  Adults are the Hunter Biden things. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5086.4s)]
*  The greatest example is almost no pushback on the left. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5088.16s)]
*  No outrage, no chaos here. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5092.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, you know, here's the most disgusting part of that, [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5095.36s)]
*  that he and the and the and and the president wouldn't recognize his daughter. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5098.32s)]
*  OK, that is disgusting, especially if you believe that, you know, like [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5104.88s)]
*  there's all this evidence, you know, getting raised by a single mother is [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5110.72s)]
*  is not, you know, it's not a good thing for your outcomes in life. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5113.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes, plenty of people overcome it. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5116.96s)]
*  Yes, we don't want to stigmatize. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5118.36s)]
*  But in general, it's better to have two parents involved. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5119.96s)]
*  OK, you have the son of the president of the United States [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5124.2s)]
*  refusing to acknowledge his daughter. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5127.24s)]
*  OK, that is disgusting. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5130.2s)]
*  And it shouldn't end. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5132.32s)]
*  Is that because he didn't think it was his? [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5134.0s)]
*  It was a DNA proof. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5136.32s)]
*  He's paying child support. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5138.5599999999995s)]
*  So even after the DNA. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5140.0s)]
*  Yeah, he still refuses. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5141.32s)]
*  And the Biden said we have six grandchildren. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5142.44s)]
*  They have seven grandchildren. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5144.84s)]
*  OK, that is a national shame. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5146.96s)]
*  And I don't care if you're on the left or the right. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5149.12s)]
*  It is not right. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5151.96s)]
*  The thing about him is just that he's such a hot wire. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5153.84s)]
*  It's like you can't touch it. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5158.92s)]
*  It's just he's too much there. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5160.4400000000005s)]
*  You don't want to bring any attention. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5162.12s)]
*  If you were on the left, you wouldn't want to bring any attention to him [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5163.76s)]
*  and that laptop and those business dealings and all that stuff. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5166.76s)]
*  Because like if that was the Trump family, oh, my God. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5170.68s)]
*  It'd be like, we told you, we told you. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5174.360000000001s)]

*  People love people on the left love to do that, though. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5199.12s)]
*  As soon as you point out anything on the left, they'll go, what about Trump? [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5201.64s)]

*  That's what they would call them. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5526.04s)]
*  So they would just take over an intersection and start spinning around in circles. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5527.400000000001s)]
*  How long did that generally last? [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5530.88s)]

*  What a wild thing to do, though, to make everybody stop. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5543.8s)]
*  So you drive in a circle in your car and everybody does. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5546.84s)]
*  They know what's going on. So they all just deal with it. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5549.639999999999s)]

*  If it's a motorcycle, you better serve it. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5566.679999999999s)]
*  And if you get a ticket, you better deserve it. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5569.0s)]

*  You know, it's like back in the day when we were free. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5711.64s)]
*  Ten years ago. Ridiculous. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5714.76s)]
*  Yeah. So quick. It happened so quick. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5716.4800000000005s)]
*  Social media. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5719.120000000001s)]
*  People gathered together in echo chambers and decided [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5720.4400000000005s)]
*  what was acceptable and what wasn't and enforced it on everybody else. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5722.6s)]
*  Don't you feel maybe we hit the peak of that about two years ago [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5725.56s)]
*  when they went after you? [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5728.84s)]
*  I think there's a enough understanding now [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5730.6s)]
*  that the vast majority of people don't like that. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5734.8s)]
*  The vast majority. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5738.08s)]
*  And also the vast majority of people think that context is important [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5739.400000000001s)]
*  and that humor is important and that fun is important. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5744.04s)]
*  And that I don't like when other people are telling me [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5747.36s)]
*  how I have to think and talk like you should be willing to let people. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5750.68s)]
*  You want to call yourself a zur. That's great. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5755.48s)]
*  But you get mad at me that I won't use that made up word. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5757.6s)]
*  Like this is bonkers. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5760.08s)]
*  This is just bonkers. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5761.84s)]
*  You know, if you have makeup on long hair and you're a girl [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5763.12s)]
*  and you tell me you're non-binary and you I have to call you a zur. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5765.36s)]
*  I'm like, I don't want to participate. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5767.92s)]
*  You know, this is not my my dance. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5770.6s)]
*  Like you can go go fucking cosplay. Do whatever you want. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5772.24s)]
*  I don't know, you know, dress up like an angel. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5775.84s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5777.88s)]
*  But I don't like it when people start reinforcing their ideology on other people. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5778.96s)]
*  And that's part of what goes on whenever people have the ability to do it. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5784.52s)]
*  When people have the ability to tell other people what to say, how to think, [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5789.08s)]
*  they just do it, whether their right way is right or not. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5793.12s)]
*  They don't want to debate it. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5796.12s)]
*  They just want you to comply. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5797.04s)]
*  And they'll say things to you like you should just be quiet and listen. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5798.76s)]
*  You know, they'll say things like that, which is a that's an amazing thing to say. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5803.0s)]
*  Just be quiet and listen when woke people are educating you. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5806.64s)]
*  Oh, just be quiet and listen. OK. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5810.64s)]
*  Well, that would make it easier, because as soon as I start talking, [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5812.64s)]
*  your argument is going to fall apart. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5814.84s)]
*  You know that there's now been some research done into like some of the DEI [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5818.72s)]
*  stuff, you know, that shows that it actually causes a backlash. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5823.24s)]
*  Yes. Right. Like that. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5826.92s)]
*  You know, when you tell people they're not allowed to talk and they come out [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5828.16s)]
*  angrier than they went when they. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5832.04s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5834.5199999999995s)]
*  And it's also the wasn't the person who created [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5836.4s)]
*  DEI just came out and said it didn't really work that well. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5840.72s)]
*  Is that true? That would not surprise me. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5843.88s)]
*  Isn't that something that just happened, Jamie? [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5846.04s)]
*  I guess I'm pretty sure I saved it because it was so bonkers. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5848.92s)]
*  I was like, this can't be real. I have to look into this. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5852.48s)]
*  Let me look at it real quick, because it was so kooky that I was like, [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5854.8s)]
*  I need to read this. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5858.16s)]
*  Because a lot of times and guilty as charged, if you ever thought I did this, [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5859.56s)]
*  if you see me come on this podcast and just start talking about shit, [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5863.68s)]
*  I probably just read the headline. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5867.280000000001s)]
*  All right. What am I looking up again? [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5870.400000000001s)]
*  DEI, right, right, right, right. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5872.4400000000005s)]
*  I got it in here. I know I do. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5875.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah, here it is. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5879.88s)]
*  Jordan Peterson tweeted it and it was tweeting it. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5881.320000000001s)]
*  He was, quote, tweeting Michael Sherman. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5884.080000000001s)]
*  I'll text you, Jamie. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5886.04s)]
*  So all that stuff became explained that to people, [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5889.16s)]
*  what DEI is and how it came to be and what it does and what its impact is. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5892.24s)]
*  Well, I mean, I'm not I'm not an expert in it, but, you know, [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5897.92s)]
*  DEI is diversity, equity and inclusion. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5900.04s)]
*  Right. It is basically this idea that, you know, [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5902.2s)]
*  white people need to shut up. Right. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5904.96s)]
*  And and it's not just that. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5906.639999999999s)]
*  So they want equal representation in, you know, here it is. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5908.96s)]
*  Even Harvard psychology professor who I say his name. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5913.44s)]
*  Maz Mazarin Banaji has come around. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5918.24s)]
*  She literally pioneered the research upon which all the DEI nonsense [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5922.24s)]
*  was hypothetically predicted, predicated rather not alone. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5925.599999999999s)]
*  No second Greenberg to for her to write this in the Wall Street Journal. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5929.16s)]
*  It's astounding. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5932.76s)]
*  This is Freud abjured psychoanalysis. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5933.5199999999995s)]
*  But here's the Shermer thing. That's interesting. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5937.28s)]
*  Right. So sure. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5939.96s)]
*  Michael Shermer says astonishing admission from the pioneer of research [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5941.12s)]
*  on implicit bias, bigotry, racism, same person, Maz, Mazarian, Mazarian, Banaji. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5945.32s)]
*  My apologies that DEI training programs don't work and even hurt. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5952.44s)]
*  Racist attitudes still exist, but much improved since 1960s. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5956.5199999999995s)]
*  And most don't act on them anyway. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5960.2s)]
*  And DEI now. And that's what Shermer wrote. Yeah. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5962.24s)]
*  So so, yeah, because when, you know, look, everybody has straight thoughts [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5965.92s)]
*  that, you know, may not be the best in the world. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5970.84s)]
*  But if people aren't going to act on them and you you make them sit [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5972.76s)]
*  at a conference room and tell them how terrible they are for three hours, [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5976.76s)]
*  they're going to wind up feeling [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5980.320000000001s)]
*  probably more aggravated than they were when they came in. Yeah. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5982.96s)]
*  That nobody likes to be told they're awful all the time. Right. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5987.56s)]
*  And it's also a subproductive. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5992.400000000001s)]
*  That's not it. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5995.16s)]
*  The usually be Bill Burt, Bill Maher, rather, talked about this, that, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=5996.88s)]
*  you know, we should start we were supposed to be striving for a colorblind society. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6000.84s)]
*  But somewhere along the line, we were told that that's that's not possible. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6005.4800000000005s)]
*  You shouldn't do that because color is important. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6008.72s)]
*  Race is important. All these things are important. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6010.84s)]
*  You should why DEI training doesn't work and how to fix it. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6012.68s)]
*  This article written by her and there's no question that bias exists. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6016.360000000001s)]
*  There's no question that the way organizations deal with it [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6019.72s)]
*  is more likely to hurt than help. OK. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6022.400000000001s)]
*  But maybe that she's saying how to fix it. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6025.76s)]
*  Maybe she thinks it just needs to be tweaked. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6028.24s)]
*  We would have to read the article, which is too much trouble. Yeah. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6031.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, the real problem is everybody wants a meritocracy. Right. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6034.24s)]
*  But in this long race of self-improvement, [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6039.12s)]
*  not everybody starts at the same starting line. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6042.72s)]
*  Well, that is true. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6044.56s)]
*  And the reality is we put very little effort into [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6045.400000000001s)]
*  making a better starting line for a lot of people in this country. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6049.56s)]
*  That's that's a that's an unfortunate reality of this country that is undeniable. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6053.56s)]
*  And that needs to be addressed. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6058.68s)]
*  That's the root of the whole thing. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6060.6s)]
*  You can't just like decide to just do something about the fruit. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6062.04s)]
*  You got to do something about like, where's the what is the fertilizer [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6065.76s)]
*  for the civilization? [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6070.120000000001s)]
*  What is what is the root structure of the civilization? [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6071.160000000001s)]
*  Yes. But that needs to be improved. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6074.4800000000005s)]
*  But to to go back to where we started today, [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6076.4400000000005s)]
*  there's nothing that's worse for parenting than kids. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6080.52s)]
*  There's nothing that's worse for parenting than parents of young children [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6084.52s)]
*  being using drugs, whether the drug is alcohol, [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6087.88s)]
*  cannabis or, you know, or meth or heroin. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6091.32s)]
*  It is terrible for parenting. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6094.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, it leads to abuse, neglect. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6096.64s)]
*  It leads to poverty. It leads to terrible outcomes. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6099.28s)]
*  And I don't know how you stop that. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6102.24s)]
*  But one of the things when you consider whether you're going to set up a world [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6103.92s)]

*  is the effect on young kids. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6112.4400000000005s)]
*  It's a really good question. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6114.16s)]
*  And I, you know, as a person who believes [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6115.48s)]
*  that freedom is one of the most important things, [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6119.4s)]
*  I also come from a perspective where, you know, I'm in a different place [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6121.36s)]
*  in life than I was when I was 20. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6124.719999999999s)]
*  And what would I be like when I was 20 if heroin was legal? [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6127.2s)]
*  What would I be like if cocaine was legal? [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6131.08s)]
*  What would I have done? [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6133.719999999999s)]
*  And that there's a there's a reality that if you open the gates now [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6134.719999999999s)]
*  and you say now all of these drugs are legal, [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6138.759999999999s)]
*  we're going to regulate them. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6142.48s)]
*  And the way to stop fentanyl coming in in these tainted cocaine [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6143.6s)]
*  is to sell pure cocaine and it actually be better for everybody. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6147.08s)]
*  I don't I don't believe that. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6150.84s)]
*  I truly don't believe it. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6152.48s)]
*  I don't think the problem is the tainted drugs. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6153.64s)]
*  I think the problem is that drugs just eat people. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6155.64s)]
*  I think there's both of those things. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6157.96s)]
*  But what I was about to say is if you did do that, [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6159.48s)]
*  you would undeniably have a certain amount of people [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6162.92s)]
*  that are going to get addicted that never would. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6166.84s)]
*  Certain amount of people that were going to lose their lives, [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6169.44s)]
*  that never would. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6171.76s)]
*  Certain amount of violent actions, car accidents, [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6172.76s)]
*  people on meth and heroin and drugs and coke. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6176.4800000000005s)]
*  And they're going to do wild shit. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6179.68s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, people are super unpredictable [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6181.280000000001s)]
*  when they're fucked up on drugs. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6184.68s)]
*  And you're going to have real problems. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6187.16s)]
*  And that that's also true. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6188.4800000000005s)]
*  But, you know, would more people do it if it was legal? [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6191.4800000000005s)]
*  I think you're right. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6195.2s)]
*  I think more people would try it. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6196.24s)]
*  But eventually not. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6198.280000000001s)]
*  So we just have to sacrifice the whole generation to learn. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6201.24s)]
*  You have to go to Europe and see, like, [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6204.24s)]
*  kids are allowed to drink wine in Italy. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6207.32s)]
*  And so they don't like their instances of alcoholism. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6209.36s)]
*  And it's not a big deal to them. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6211.719999999999s)]
*  For us, it's a big deal. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6213.679999999999s)]
*  Like, I remember the first time I got drunk with my friends [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6215.4s)]
*  who were listening to Led Zeppelin, [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6217.759999999999s)]
*  my friend Jimmy. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6220.04s)]
*  And it was like it was like we were like 15 years old, [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6221.08s)]
*  14, 15 years old. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6224.919999999999s)]
*  And I got sick in a cab like the whole thing. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6226.48s)]
*  Yeah. But it was getting alcohol was crazy. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6230.16s)]
*  If you live in Europe, it's normal. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6234.08s)]
*  Like they they they cussed. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6235.88s)]
*  They get their kids acclimated to it. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6237.92s)]
*  Like you don't let them drink, but they're allowed to have a sip of alcohol. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6240.280000000001s)]
*  Have a little. It's not that big a deal. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6243.56s)]
*  Don't think of it as like some forbidden fruit [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6245.8s)]
*  that you can't wait to get to to get fucked up. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6247.8s)]
*  Yes. But even with, you know, adults, [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6250.4400000000005s)]
*  we know that even with adults that have, you know, [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6254.200000000001s)]
*  reasonable ways of approaching every other aspect of life, [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6258.16s)]
*  some of them can't have a drink. That's right. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6261.8s)]
*  They can't. They can't do it. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6264.08s)]
*  They get fucking verbalized and they're gone. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6265.68s)]
*  You know, you know, those guys, of course, those are real people, too. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6268.32s)]
*  And what do we do about that? [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6271.32s)]
*  And it's a good question. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6272.68s)]
*  But it's a question that unfortunately, [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6274.12s)]
*  there's so many pros and cons of both sides. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6277.28s)]
*  And the con of both side is crazy because you're empowering [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6280.48s)]
*  a gigantic criminal enterprise. That is. Yes. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6284.2s)]
*  That's crazy. And that was the prohibition. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6287.28s)]
*  That was the thing that was going on in America. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6289.5599999999995s)]
*  They didn't stop people from drinking whiskey, [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6291.28s)]
*  but they stopped them from drinking good whiskey. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6293.64s)]
*  They were making moonshine. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6296.2s)]
*  And, you know, that was what NASCAR was created. Yes. Yeah. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6297.6s)]
*  They were trying to run away. Those boys, those boys. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6300.96s)]
*  They developed hot rod cars to run away from cops. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6303.88s)]
*  And they said, you know, we should race these motherfuckers. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6307.24s)]
*  They just kind of fucking race tracks in a circle. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6309.88s)]
*  Yes. I mean, that's literally how NASCAR started. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6313.04s)]
*  It's it's kind of amazing. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6316.68s)]
*  But it's just there's no real there's no one perfect answer. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6318.88s)]
*  There's no one thing we say, you know what? [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6323.080000000001s)]
*  If we do this, we'll have zero deaths and everyone's going to be peaceful [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6325.360000000001s)]
*  and the world's going to be a utopia. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6328.88s)]
*  There's no answer like that. No. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6330.320000000001s)]
*  But I'm not suggesting this. OK. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6332.68s)]
*  But you if you have a regime that is really strict on drug use, [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6335.240000000001s)]
*  you don't have much drug use. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6339.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, I'm talking about very much like, you know, like Saudi Arabia. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6340.96s)]
*  You know, if you're cutting people's hands off and that would never fly here. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6345.16s)]
*  And I don't think it's a good idea. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6349.56s)]
*  It's definitely not. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6351.24s)]
*  But this idea that like you can't culturally and societally [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6351.76s)]
*  lower the levels of drug use is not true. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6355.04s)]
*  You can't. It's just the question of the price you pay. Right. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6357.84s)]
*  But isn't that the thing about like peace as well? [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6360.8s)]
*  Like as long as you're willing to have like like who is the was it? [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6363.4s)]
*  The was the who's the was it the president of the Philippines? [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6367.92s)]
*  That was oh, yeah. Yes, yes, yes. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6372.08s)]
*  I mean, yes, I bet that had an impact. Yes. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6374.32s)]
*  I mean, I wouldn't recommend it, but I bet it worked to a certain extent. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6378.36s)]
*  That's right. No, it's but so there's just [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6381.96s)]
*  this idea of the drug legalization lobby has very successfully argued [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6386.32s)]
*  that basically you can't manage the amount of drug use in a society. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6390.719999999999s)]
*  You just have to manage the consequences. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6394.639999999999s)]
*  And that is demonstrably untrue. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6396.2s)]
*  Here's another like drinking and driving used to be pretty society acceptable. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6398.599999999999s)]
*  And now it's not acceptable. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6403.56s)]
*  I mean, people still still sometimes do it, but levels are way down. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6405.280000000001s)]
*  Have you ever seen that video from when they first started [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6408.64s)]
*  telling people you can't have an open beer in your car? No. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6411.240000000001s)]
*  See if you can find that video, Jamie. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6414.04s)]
*  I think it's from the 1970s. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6415.4800000000005s)]

*  And this guy's like, you work all day. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6422.6s)]
*  It'd be nice if you could have a beer on your way home. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6425.080000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. These people are advocating for openly drinking in their cars. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6429.320000000001s)]
*  You can change that behavior. Yeah. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6433.44s)]
*  Attitudes. Well, that's a wild one. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6435.28s)]
*  That's a wild one that people want to be able to just fucking booze it up [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6437.639999999999s)]
*  while they're driving. Listen to this. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6440.68s)]
*  But driving here is viewed by some as downright undemocratic. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6442.08s)]
*  It's kind of getting common this one. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6445.96s)]
*  A fellow can't put in the hard day's work, put in 11, 12 hours a day [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6447.2s)]
*  and then get in your truck and the lease rank one or two beers. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6451.12s)]
*  We can't drink when you want to. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6455.4s)]
*  Maybe. Yeah. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6457.2s)]
*  You have to wear a seatbelt when you're driving. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6458.32s)]

*  I didn't even I under did it. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6478.68s)]
*  Yes. He was over the top. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6480.400000000001s)]
*  But the baby next to the baby right there. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6482.6s)]
*  That's how you carry babies around. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6485.08s)]
*  Put him in there. No airbags. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6487.2s)]
*  No, stay on the front seat. Those cars, they fall apart. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6488.84s)]
*  They get accidents. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6490.96s)]
*  When I was a kid, we just sat in the back seat. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6493.32s)]
*  You didn't wear a fucking seatbelt. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6494.84s)]
*  Everybody's bouncing around back there. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6496.28s)]
*  You know what? [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6497.96s)]
*  It's not the end of the world. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6499.92s)]
*  It's most of the time people survive. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6501.32s)]
*  And there's a there's an amazing there's some I've been meaning to write [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6504.12s)]
*  for the stack. It's been like I started to write and I've [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6507.0s)]
*  I haven't had time, but this is a non covid thing. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6509.8s)]
*  This is the kind of stuff I need to write more of. So. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6512.28s)]
*  There have been there's been a lot of research done recently [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6516.28s)]
*  on like the unhappiness of adolescents and, you know, teenage girls especially. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6518.76s)]
*  And what's one of the things that's really interesting is if you look by [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6523.4800000000005s)]
*  by political party, liberal kids are much, much more unhappy [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6527.64s)]
*  than conservative kids right now. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6532.4400000000005s)]
*  And if you look at the outcomes, that's not necessarily the case. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6534.56s)]
*  You know, like when did this become a was this always the case? [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6538.08s)]
*  Was it the case more recently? [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6543.16s)]
*  Much worse in the last few years and the last few years. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6545.0s)]
*  I got to go back and again, I don't want to misquote it, but, you know, [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6548.4s)]
*  they're they're kind of lockdowns and covid as well. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6551.44s)]
*  Lockdowns and covid and their parents scaring them to death with climate change. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6553.48s)]
*  And they're just like a bunch of neurotic like kids who, you know, [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6557.12s)]
*  who don't have any like they don't have any fun. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6560.799999999999s)]
*  The climate change one is wild because the thing about the climate change one, [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6564.2s)]
*  it's it's both sides kind of undeniable. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6568.24s)]
*  Like it is undeniable we're having an effect. Yeah, it's undeniable. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6570.879999999999s)]
*  Agreed. But I watched this guy discuss. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6574.639999999999s)]
*  I forget what [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6577.52s)]
*  legislators, what politicians he was talking to. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6579.72s)]
*  But he was asking them because they were trying to figure out [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6582.64s)]
*  what to do about carbon emissions. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6585.080000000001s)]
*  And he said, what do you think the level of CO2, [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6587.040000000001s)]
*  like what percentage of the air is CO2? [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6590.6s)]
*  And everybody had a guess, like five percent, seven percent, whatever it was. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6593.68s)]
*  And he said, it's actually zero point three or zero point four, zero point three. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6596.64s)]
*  And at zero point two, plants die. Right. Right. Right. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6602.320000000001s)]
*  Is that true? Find out if that's true. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6608.52s)]
*  When that guy was saying that, I was like, they don't know because they're just guessing. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6610.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. So they know it is zero point three because it's three hundred per million. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6613.4400000000005s)]
*  Zero point three. Right. Yeah. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6617.280000000001s)]
*  And there's an effect that we're having. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6619.160000000001s)]
*  And that effect is causing the earth to be the greenest it's ever been. Right. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6622.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah. No, look, we know this is real. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6626.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I agree. Point zero three. But yeah. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6628.76s)]
*  But but you can't scare the crap out of your kids all the time. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6630.8s)]
*  Don't scare them. Here's the other thing. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6634.6s)]
*  And this is, again, not denying that human beings have an effect on the climate. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6637.84s)]
*  We clearly do. It's never been stable. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6641.52s)]
*  No, the climate's never been stable. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6644.320000000001s)]
*  It's never like a flat line. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6645.76s)]
*  Like, look, if we go back to the dinosaurs before people started fucking around, [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6647.080000000001s)]
*  it was a nice flat line. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6650.8s)]
*  You always knew what temperature is going to be on September 19th, 2020. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6651.92s)]
*  September. Yeah. Well, come on. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6656.320000000001s)]
*  No, you didn't. It's like it was all kooky. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6658.080000000001s)]
*  The whole thing is like this. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6660.4400000000005s)]
*  If you watch that, like I had Steve Coon in on who's a physicist to explain all this. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6661.64s)]
*  I think you asked me to look up. Is this it? [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6665.92s)]
*  I'm out. I think so. Yeah. Here it is. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6667.68s)]
*  In the atmosphere, CO2, carbon dioxide. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6669.64s)]
*  Well, yes, it's a. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6673.92s)]
*  A five percent. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6676.52s)]
*  Right. I'll just follow you. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6677.92s)]
*  See there five and suggests that we know that transportation causes [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6679.88s)]
*  49 percent of CO2, so that's why we're all working on energy transition. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6684.4400000000005s)]
*  All right. What number do you think it is? [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6690.04s)]
*  Five. Right. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6693.4s)]
*  I didn't hear you. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6695.0s)]
*  Straight seven. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6697.16s)]
*  Seven. You have one, Mr. Boyd. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6698.4400000000005s)]
*  So we've got a five, seven. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6701.08s)]
*  Price is right. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6702.8s)]
*  Eight. I'm going to get the high end. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6704.4800000000005s)]
*  All right. Well, I appreciate that. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6706.6s)]
*  And I don't mean I put you on ice. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6709.28s)]
*  I ask a lot of people that because all we hear is climate change, climate change. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6710.92s)]
*  So to see what you heard a couple on the panel saying, [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6714.12s)]
*  you're looking to change your vehicles to electric, even though we don't have [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6717.4400000000005s)]
*  the electric grid. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6720.08s)]
*  And me as a farmer, I wouldn't be real happy about running out. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6721.52s)]
*  Placing three hundred thousand dollar, five hundred thousand dollar, [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6724.08s)]
*  million dollar pieces of equipment because someone wants someone [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6727.08s)]
*  wants to be electric. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6729.4400000000005s)]
*  The answer is point zero four percent. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6730.88s)]
*  Not one percent, not half of a percent point zero four percent. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6734.2s)]
*  It's gone up from point zero three in the last couple of decades. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6738.4400000000005s)]
*  This is what we're being all contorted into doing this tiny change in CO2. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6741.72s)]
*  If we go, if we get below point zero two plant life starts dying. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6746.68s)]
*  So let me ask, Mr. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6751.320000000001s)]
*  Boyd, what are a lot of your vehicles here for already? [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6754.360000000001s)]
*  Or the vehicles that you know about in the industry? [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6759.240000000001s)]
*  Yes. All right. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6761.72s)]
*  So that's the cleanest burning diesel equipment you can get. Right. Yes. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6762.88s)]
*  All right. But Mr. Dreher, what do you think? [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6766.0s)]
*  Yes. OK. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6768.4800000000005s)]
*  So why would anybody be anxious to go out and change out all those vehicles [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6769.88s)]
*  that you've been operating? [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6773.56s)]
*  My home state of California, carb has eliminated lots of equipment. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6774.84s)]
*  Trucks, you know, we're going to be we're down at least 70,000 truckers [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6778.92s)]
*  and all because they don't make a mandate for 2011, a newer vehicle. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6783.36s)]
*  So it's going to be harder to get things from the ports. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6788.88s)]
*  All this, all that. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6791.4800000000005s)]
*  So anyway, I just wanted to underline that as we all get all giddy [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6792.28s)]
*  about trying to make everything electric, especially in my home state, [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6796.2s)]
*  when they're shutting down the power grid and taking out hydroelectric dams. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6799.2s)]
*  And they barely kept in place the nuclear power plant for an additional five years, [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6802.56s)]
*  which is nine percent of our grid. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6806.4s)]
*  I don't know how we're going to do this. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6808.24s)]
*  I don't know how you guys are going to do construction out remote areas [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6809.5199999999995s)]
*  where there isn't power lines yet nearby or what have you. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6813.36s)]
*  Or charges stuff. Maybe you'll bring generators. So anyway. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6816.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's a mess. So interesting, right? [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6822.08s)]
*  You see these people that that's why we're working so hard to remove carbon [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6824.679999999999s)]
*  from the air and she doesn't even know it. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6828.2s)]
*  She doesn't know what he just said. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6830.44s)]
*  Yes. But she's she'll tell you that 49 percent of that zero point four [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6832.719999999999s)]
*  or point zero four comes from trucks. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6838.24s)]
*  Yes, comes from transportation. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6842.28s)]
*  Look, I think there's an even more basic problem. OK. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6845.2s)]
*  The promise the Chinese and the Indians, we can we can [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6849.639999999999s)]
*  we can go to a post industrial society and all live, you know, [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6853.92s)]
*  growing beets in the United States and Europe. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6857.96s)]
*  They're not going to stop building [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6861.5199999999995s)]
*  car, you know, coal fired plants. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6865.04s)]
*  They haven't stopped building them. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6866.72s)]
*  Maybe they will promise to stop building them. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6868.08s)]
*  The Europe basically, if you look at a graph, Europe is like [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6870.8s)]
*  a tiny fraction of the world's CO2 right now. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6876.2s)]
*  OK, you ask. We still admit a lot, but the Chinese admit a lot more. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6879.360000000001s)]
*  And I think the Indians are on track to pass this if they haven't passed this [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6883.68s)]
*  already. So we can destroy our own economies [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6886.8s)]
*  and it won't make that much difference, unfortunately. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6890.12s)]
*  So that's a real problem. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6893.76s)]
*  We are really concentrating on climate and we're really concentrating [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6895.64s)]
*  on our impact, but we also have to be concentrating on [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6899.84s)]
*  what other countries are doing and our ability to economically [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6904.4800000000005s)]
*  compete with them and be sustainable. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6908.160000000001s)]
*  That's one of the really important things that we should have probably learned [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6910.72s)]
*  from the pandemic when we couldn't get stuff like. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6913.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you couldn't get anything from overseas because they couldn't. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6916.6s)]
*  This COVID lockdown. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6919.360000000001s)]
*  We do not want to be in the pockets of the Chinese. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6920.56s)]
*  They're not necessarily our friends. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6923.759999999999s)]
*  I mean, are we ready though? [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6926.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, we are. We are. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6927.759999999999s)]
*  Listen, we can have a decent relationship with them. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6929.4s)]
*  What they've done is so clever. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6931.44s)]
*  But that's yeah, we depend on them for everything. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6932.679999999999s)]
*  It's amazing. It's not it's not a good position to be in. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6935.12s)]
*  But that's what makes people really cynical about these relationships [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6938.04s)]
*  these countries have. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6940.5199999999995s)]
*  They're kind of enemies, but kind of not. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6942.12s)]
*  You know, they're competing, but they're also, you know, selling each other stuff [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6944.4s)]
*  and their economies rely on each other. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6948.32s)]
*  Economic sanctions is the most devastating. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6950.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think we'd be mistaken to depend too much on the Chinese right now. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6952.84s)]
*  So but but but just to go all the way back, like, don't scare your kids. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6957.84s)]
*  No, don't scare the fuck out of people. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6962.6s)]
*  But but how do you not scare the fuck out of them [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6964.24s)]
*  while making them aware at the same time? [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6966.6s)]
*  The two kind of different things. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6969.4800000000005s)]
*  But but don't tell your kids the world's going to end in 50 years. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6970.72s)]
*  No, that's all nonsense. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6974.320000000001s)]
*  Well, that was that was wasn't that what Greta Thornburg was saying in 2015. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6975.84s)]
*  Yeah, the idea that you can predict how this is going to go down seems nutty. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6980.16s)]
*  But really, we need to concentrate on some stuff that we absolutely can control. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6985.04s)]
*  And one of them is plastics in the ocean. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6989.320000000001s)]
*  Like, there's these people that are doing a great job of trying to figure out [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6992.68s)]
*  methods to sift that stuff out. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6996.72s)]
*  Just the sheer knowledge of how much is out there. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=6998.8s)]
*  Yes. Do you know a lot of our stuff? [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7003.360000000001s)]
*  Apparently, we think that when you recycled that everything gets recycled. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7005.12s)]
*  But apparently, they don't do such a good job recycling plastic. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7009.96s)]
*  They just use it, put it in landfills, and sometimes they ship it to other places. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7013.92s)]
*  You guys, we know nothing about, but I believe you. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7019.04s)]
*  Yeah, there's horrific, horrific imagery and videos of [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7022.52s)]
*  other countries where they're just dumping their waste into a river. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7027.6s)]
*  And you see these river systems that are just completely clogged [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7031.24s)]
*  by plastic bottles and garbage and. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7034.88s)]
*  Who? Humans are so fucking weird. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7038.2s)]
*  We're so weird. We need the aliens to save us, Joe. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7042.4s)]
*  No, we need to get it together. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7045.0s)]
*  But I do think if I was an alien, I would be watching. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7046.92s)]
*  I think if I had a guess, if I had to put my, you know, my chips on [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7049.679999999999s)]
*  whether or not it's real or not real, I would think, yes, it's real. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7055.88s)]
*  I think there I think there are most likely we've been observed, [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7059.28s)]
*  most likely we've been visited multiple times. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7063.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't they? If they have the capability, we'd be fascinating. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7066.04s)]
*  Also, I think some of the stuff we're seeing is ours. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7069.8s)]
*  I think both of those things could be true at the same time. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7073.24s)]
*  And I think one of the ways that, again, I would obscure [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7075.84s)]
*  whether or not we have stuff like that is to start talking about aliens. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7078.76s)]
*  That just seems like common chess moves. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7083.76s)]
*  I like, oh, I see where you're going. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7085.88s)]
*  You know, if you just all of a sudden you got whistleblowers [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7087.56s)]
*  and all of a sudden you're telling me that all this stuff is real. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7090.36s)]
*  Like, OK, now I'm suspicious. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7092.76s)]
*  I was less suspicious when you were lying about it. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7095.84s)]
*  You know, when you're lying about it, I was like, oh, they're hiding the aliens. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7099.4400000000005s)]
*  They're hiding it. But now they're talking about it. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7103.080000000001s)]
*  I'm like, oh, you guys probably are still hiding the aliens. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7104.8s)]
*  But you probably back engineered some shit or develop some stuff on some [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7107.96s)]
*  completely independent government funded black ops branch of physics [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7112.4800000000005s)]
*  where they knew something about magnetic propulsion or something. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7117.92s)]
*  And they've developed some unmanned drone that can go hypersonic speeds. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7122.12s)]
*  What do you think they look like? [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7125.76s)]
*  Aliens? [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7127.24s)]
*  Well, if you want to go back to the old CIA documents, [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7128.96s)]
*  because there are documents that George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7132.52s)]
*  have uncovered from the Freedom of Information Act, where they said [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7136.6s)]
*  there was four different races that were visiting us. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7139.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. And some of them are the classic grays. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7142.72s)]
*  And some of them are what they call the tall whites. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7145.76s)]
*  They look like Nordic people, like really pale skin and long hair. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7148.24s)]
*  And they have their ears are like flat to their head. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7152.08s)]
*  And they have larger eyes than we do. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7154.639999999999s)]
*  But they look almost like humanoid. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7157.08s)]
*  Yeah. But I mean, who fucking knows? [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7160.08s)]
*  You know, this is all just nonsense talk. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7163.48s)]
*  It's like, like, what kind of elves do you believe in? [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7165.36s)]
*  Well, I don't believe in leprechauns, but the regular wood elves are real. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7168.72s)]
*  You know, I don't know, man. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7174.04s)]
*  I don't know. I haven't seen one. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7175.679999999999s)]
*  I can't. I would die to see one. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7177.56s)]
*  I mean, it'd be fascinating. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7179.240000000001s)]
*  I'd be I'd be willing to not tell people. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7181.200000000001s)]
*  Take me showing. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7185.400000000001s)]
*  I want to know. But everybody thinks that way. Right. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7187.400000000001s)]
*  Everybody wants to know. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7189.52s)]
*  But until you see something and if you do see something, [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7191.080000000001s)]
*  you're going to go, what did I fucking see? Is that real? [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7194.0s)]
*  Like, how reliable is my goddamn memory? [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7196.68s)]
*  You know, like, did I just have like some internal burst of psychedelic chemicals [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7199.320000000001s)]
*  and it tricked me into thinking that I had been abducted? [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7203.88s)]
*  That's a good all good question. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7207.28s)]
*  Well, that's a real question, too, because a lot of these alien [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7208.96s)]
*  abduction stories, they happen at night. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7211.679999999999s)]
*  And when people are sleeping and dreaming, they're occasionally [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7214.2s)]
*  people get sleep paralysis. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7217.4s)]
*  That's a real factor. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7219.08s)]
*  And then dreams themselves. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7220.5199999999995s)]
*  People have lucid dreams. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7222.4s)]
*  They have dreams that appear that they're real. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7223.799999999999s)]
*  They have like different levels of dreams, like some medications [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7226.08s)]
*  you take give you wild, vivid dreams. Yes. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7229.879999999999s)]
*  We know that. Right. So what is happening there? [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7232.919999999999s)]
*  Well, there's obviously some sort of neuro chemicals [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7235.36s)]
*  that get released during sleep that appear to be, if not hallucinogenic, maybe [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7238.92s)]
*  they're definitely psychedelic. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7244.88s)]
*  What are they doing? [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7246.719999999999s)]
*  Are they connecting your consciousness with some other realm? [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7247.92s)]
*  Like, what is going on? [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7250.679999999999s)]
*  And I could imagine if you were, you know, you had one of these endogenous [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7252.0s)]
*  dumps of these naturally produced psychoactive substances [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7255.799999999999s)]
*  and you're lying in bed, you would see fucking aliens over you. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7259.48s)]
*  But does that mean that the aliens aren't real? [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7262.96s)]
*  I don't know that either, because it might that might be how they get to you. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7265.16s)]
*  Look at the bottom paragraph. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7269.44s)]
*  The ICIG office did nothing to look into the information [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7271.04s)]
*  they receive from David Grush on UAP crash retrieval programs. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7275.32s)]
*  They have no information they can give to Congress. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7278.96s)]
*  Cover up. This is Representative Tim Burchett. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7281.4s)]
*  He calls cover up. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7285.12s)]
*  It's posted the two page letter that the. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7287.44s)]
*  ICIG Thomas. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7291.28s)]
*  Monheim Monheim is who is working with David Grush, I think. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7294.4400000000005s)]
*  Interesting. Oh, and their claim is that they haven't done anything. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7298.72s)]
*  They're not looking into the claims at all. Interesting. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7301.56s)]
*  Well, maybe they're not allowed to. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7304.56s)]
*  If there was a crash retrieval program, I would imagine I would say, [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7306.64s)]
*  shut the fuck up. No, you can't look at it. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7310.08s)]
*  If there's some UFO that we have and if we find out, look, how do you know? [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7312.8s)]
*  How do those people working for you, whether or not someone's been [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7318.52s)]
*  taking money from Russia or taking money from China or taking money from Iran? [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7320.88s)]
*  You know, how do you know? [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7324.68s)]
*  How do you know there might be some guy that works for you that's a spy? [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7326.64s)]
*  You can't let everybody come in and see the UFO. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7329.6s)]
*  It's on a need to know basis. So you deny him. No. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7332.04s)]
*  I think everyone needs to know if it's a UFO. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7335.24s)]
*  I don't know. When they cover it up now, I'm starting to think they're real. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7338.08s)]
*  What would it matter if they were a spy? [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7342.4800000000005s)]
*  So they have something. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7344.08s)]
*  Yeah, maybe they could take pictures and send it to them [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7346.28s)]
*  and they could start reverse engineering. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7348.320000000001s)]
*  They could explain it if someone explained. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7349.64s)]
*  Maybe they don't know how to get it to work. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7352.0s)]
*  And then one person figured out how to get it to work. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7354.280000000001s)]
*  OK, that's the whole Bob Lazar lore. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7356.56s)]
*  The whole Bob Lazar lore was that they hired him to be a propulsion expert [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7358.72s)]
*  to go and back engineer this thing, because they didn't know how it worked. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7363.4800000000005s)]
*  And then initially he was like, oh, that makes sense. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7366.68s)]
*  The reason why people keep seeing those, they're ours. OK. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7369.84s)]
*  And then very quickly, as he examined the thing, he's like, [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7372.88s)]
*  what the fuck is this? [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7376.160000000001s)]
*  This thing designed to carry three foot tall people [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7378.72s)]
*  that operates on some sort of gravity generator from an element [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7382.92s)]
*  that we haven't even stabilized yet. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7386.76s)]
*  And it's only theoretical at that point. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7389.16s)]
*  So that's what he says. Oh, this is. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7391.360000000001s)]
*  But I had to take you down this road because I know you're like one of those guys [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7394.4400000000005s)]
*  that calls bullshit on things. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7397.64s)]
*  I know you're paying attention to it because it's everywhere. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7399.04s)]
*  I'm very covid focused. Really? [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7402.8s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I'm vaguely aware. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7405.2s)]
*  Just vaguely? I would say just vaguely. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7408.08s)]
*  I mean, I'm suing I'm busy suing the government. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7410.360000000001s)]
*  I understand. I understand. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7412.56s)]
*  Are you worried when you do stuff like that? [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7414.320000000001s)]
*  No, I mean, we're all in the NSA database. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7417.4400000000005s)]
*  I haven't done anything that interesting. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7421.4400000000005s)]
*  You're definitely in the NSA database. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7423.360000000001s)]
*  No, but we all are. So, yeah. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7424.96s)]
*  You know, what does that mean? [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7427.76s)]
*  What does it mean? Exactly. Right. I mean, so [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7429.84s)]
*  I'm not that worried. I mean, [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7433.76s)]
*  I'm I'm honestly [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7437.28s)]
*  it'd be more likely that that Pfizer would be interested in me. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7440.84s)]
*  But but but they're not going to do anything anyway either way. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7444.84s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's like these are court cases. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7448.719999999999s)]
*  You know, you make your best case. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7451.28s)]
*  They hire really expensive lawyers. They make their best case. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7453.759999999999s)]
*  And it doesn't seem like they ever really face criminal charges. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7456.88s)]
*  That's right. Nobody nobody. They face fines. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7460.28s)]
*  That's right. Nobody really goes to jail. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7462.5199999999995s)]
*  If you're a senior corporate executive, you don't go to jail. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7464.04s)]
*  So it's so so why do anything that could actually get you in trouble? [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7466.32s)]
*  Like what's yeah. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7470.4s)]
*  What's really fascinating is that, you know, they they're criminal charges. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7471.28s)]
*  They get hit with are often less than the profits they made. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7474.92s)]
*  That's right. That's right. That's true of both. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7477.8s)]
*  You know, Eli Lilly, which is a company that I covered [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7480.0s)]
*  when I was at the New York Times. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7483.44s)]
*  I mean, this is a funny thing. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7485.0s)]
*  Like these people on the left, they want to they want to pretend [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7485.96s)]
*  that I'm some kind of conspiracy theorist. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7489.44s)]
*  I'm the same reporter I was when I worked at the New York Times. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7491.0s)]
*  And covered the drug industry and wrote these stories. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7493.92s)]
*  This is why I'm so aware of the games the companies play, [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7496.28s)]
*  because I've been writing about it for so long. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7499.04s)]
*  When you worked at the New York Times, what year was this? [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7501.56s)]
*  This was 99 through 2010. I worked there. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7504.28s)]
*  Could you ever imagine that journalism would be where it's at now? No. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7507.12s)]
*  No. As a person who was there on the inside of the great lady, [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7511.92s)]
*  like what was it? Did you notice a shift while you were there? [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7515.4s)]
*  There was a there was a slight shift, not a look. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7518.52s)]
*  I was a business reporter. OK. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7521.16s)]
*  I was an investigative business reporter. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7522.4800000000005s)]
*  They never told me don't write about this or do right about this. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7523.84s)]
*  I mean, sometimes they told me do write about this, but they never told me, [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7527.0s)]
*  you know, don't do this. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7529.68s)]
*  It might offend, you know, the Democratic Party or whatever. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7531.04s)]
*  You know, that's not that's not how it worked. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7533.84s)]
*  And I remember going to Iraq for the paper and coming back. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7535.64s)]
*  And some guys send me I was in Las Vegas, actually, in 2003. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7539.360000000001s)]
*  And some guy, I think I was getting my shoes shine. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7543.04s)]
*  The guy next to me getting his shoes shine said, [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7545.96s)]
*  oh, it must be hard to work for the New York Times when they tell you [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7548.2s)]
*  to make things up. And I said, I was in Iraq. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7551.04s)]
*  And like, I put my life on the line for that place and for to get to the truth. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7554.32s)]
*  Like, you don't know what you're talking about. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7558.56s)]
*  And so so that was really like a responsibility [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7560.4s)]
*  and a trust that I felt to try to get to the truth. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7563.76s)]
*  What happened, people were always cynical even back then. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7566.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah, they were cynical, but they were. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7568.52s)]
*  But they were more wrong than what happened was that Trump got elected. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7570.08s)]
*  OK, Trump got elected and it broke the American media [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7573.36s)]
*  because they couldn't believe that the United States elected this guy [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7576.56s)]
*  instead of Hillary Clinton. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7580.44s)]
*  They all wanted Hillary Clinton, certainly. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7581.5199999999995s)]
*  And, you know, and especially younger female reporters at the paper. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7583.679999999999s)]
*  She was also projected to win. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7588.16s)]
*  That's right. So it was like there's I think I don't know if I said this to you [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7590.4s)]
*  some previous time I was here, but there's this famous onion headline. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7594.4s)]
*  I'll never forget from 2015. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7597.4s)]
*  Hillary Clinton tells nation not to fuck it up for her. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7599.48s)]
*  And that's how it felt. Right. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7602.32s)]
*  Like, like, I'm going to be elected whether you want me to be or not. Right. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7603.799999999999s)]
*  Do you think we would have been better off as a culture if she got elected? [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7607.56s)]
*  Oh, that's an interesting question. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7611.8s)]
*  But do you think that the the separation, the polarization [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7613.080000000001s)]
*  of the right and the left wouldn't have been so bad if she won? [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7616.72s)]
*  She was projected to win. This stuff was happening anyway. Right. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7620.0s)]
*  But I wonder if that was because Trump is such a polarizing figure [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7622.8s)]
*  that I think that was the tipping point. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7626.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. Maybe we would. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7628.0s)]
*  I don't know. But she didn't win. He won. Right. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7629.88s)]
*  And and he and the media. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7632.360000000001s)]
*  If you listen to some interviews. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7634.4800000000005s)]
*  That's right. That's right. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7636.5599999999995s)]
*  They all said he was illegitimate. That's right. That's right. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7638.28s)]
*  But when yes, Russia hacked our election, that's right. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7640.679999999999s)]
*  Remember that? I do remember that. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7643.36s)]
*  That used to be OK to say. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7644.84s)]
*  But he but he the media hated him. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7646.12s)]
*  Yeah. And and he used their hate and their hate got worse and worse. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7650.36s)]
*  And they became openly partisan in a way they hadn't been. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7655.36s)]
*  I don't know. In 100 years. Yeah. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7659.719999999999s)]
*  So it was weird. It's weird. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7661.5599999999995s)]
*  It's weird. And it just it doesn't seem like it's ever going to bounce back. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7663.84s)]
*  And if he wins again, Jesus, Louisa's was going to happen. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7666.8s)]
*  I don't know what's going to happen next year. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7669.68s)]
*  I mean, he could be in prison. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7671.08s)]
*  There's a real chance he could be in prison and win. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7672.360000000001s)]
*  I don't know what that looks like. Bananas. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7675.320000000001s)]
*  If he goes to jail for the crimes that they're accusing him of, [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7677.92s)]
*  how long are we talking about for this? [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7681.56s)]
*  Well, the Georgia stuff, he could do 20 years. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7683.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. I mean, he's got he's covered in the country from his cell. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7685.400000000001s)]
*  Would they allow him to have like access to phones? [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7690.28s)]
*  Oh, I think I mean, I think he'd have to be the president. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7692.52s)]
*  I mean, I think I think there'd be enormous pressure to to let him out [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7694.68s)]
*  under those circumstances and then put him back in once he gets out. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7698.240000000001s)]
*  That's a great question. I mean, it's it's unthinkable. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7700.8s)]
*  Now, the federal stuff he could pardon himself for, it seems pretty clear. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7703.88s)]
*  He can pardon himself. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7707.280000000001s)]
*  There's a debate about this, but he could also direct [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7708.84s)]
*  the Justice Department to drop the prosecutions. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7711.8s)]
*  But the state stuff, he can't state stuff he doesn't control. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7714.88s)]
*  So it's crazy. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7717.92s)]
*  And and I've increasingly concluded that it was a huge mistake to indict him. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7719.64s)]
*  They should have presented the information and because he this is a political issue, [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7724.64s)]
*  not a legal issue. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7729.56s)]
*  The political issue is, does the country want him as president? [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7730.88s)]
*  If it wants him as president, it'd be different. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7733.6s)]
*  OK, if you said he murdered somebody or he committed espionage, this is all. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7735.6s)]
*  No, nobody really is accusing him of crimes like that. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7742.56s)]
*  So so the idea that he might be in jail [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7746.44s)]
*  and the country might have to vote in an election [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7749.28s)]
*  where one of the candidates is in is in prison is crazy. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7751.76s)]
*  It was I was listening to a conversation that Dennis Prager had. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7755.2s)]
*  And I forget he was talking to David Packman. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7759.12s)]
*  And they're having a conversation about the election. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7761.88s)]
*  And one of the things that Prager said that I thought was really interesting, [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7764.44s)]
*  like if you knew that Hitler was an incredibly evil person [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7767.12s)]
*  and you knew that you could stop this person from getting into power [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7773.679999999999s)]
*  by manipulating the election, it would be your moral imperative to do so. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7778.599999999999s)]
*  And that a lot of people viewed Trump like that. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7783.08s)]
*  That's right. And that's that's a real thing. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7785.679999999999s)]
*  And that's and I think they do right now. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7788.599999999999s)]
*  Like if the will of the people is that he becomes president, [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7791.5599999999995s)]
*  the rest of the people that don't agree with that will go into a fucking fury, [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7794.04s)]
*  a fury. Yes. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7799.12s)]
*  If he becomes president again, like, God, what is going to happen? [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7801.04s)]
*  No, it'll be terrible. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7804.56s)]
*  But if he is if he's in jail and can't campaign, [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7805.48s)]
*  his supporters are going to think it's terrible. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7809.6s)]
*  Yeah, they're going to think it's unfair that way. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7812.64s)]
*  So the whole thing from top to bottom is just fucking bonkers. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7814.28s)]
*  It's bonkers. All the scenarios are bonkers. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7817.96s)]
*  I get Kamala. I can't stand him. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7820.08s)]
*  And people, you know, I lose subsec report of views whenever I say it. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7822.52s)]
*  But I don't like Donald Trump. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7825.84s)]
*  But I do think that he like the way the left is behaving towards him [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7827.24s)]
*  is not wise. Yeah, it's it's like telling somebody to shut the fuck up. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7833.84s)]
*  You ever tell someone to shut the fuck up. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7838.639999999999s)]
*  They don't want to shut the fuck up. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7839.8s)]
*  The only reason why they shut the fuck up or you don't shut the fuck up [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7841.44s)]
*  is like a threat of violence. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7843.8s)]
*  Or if they realize they really fucked up and they just like take a moment [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7845.36s)]
*  of reflection. But most of the time you tell people to shut the fuck up. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7848.16s)]
*  Like, you know, you shut the fuck up. That's right. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7850.76s)]
*  They get mad. They don't. It's not. It doesn't work. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7852.88s)]
*  You know, it's like when you think you just hit somebody [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7855.76s)]
*  because you saw it in a movie. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7857.5199999999995s)]
*  No, they're going to hit you back. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7858.4s)]
*  They might beat the fuck out of you. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7859.68s)]
*  They might wait for you after school one day and kick your ass. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7860.64s)]
*  They're not going to just take it like people don't just. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7863.32s)]
*  And when you do something like that, [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7865.5199999999995s)]
*  where you just try to silence your opponent and try to jail your opponent [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7868.0s)]
*  on what some people think are trumped up charges, no pun intended. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7873.12s)]
*  That's that makes people furious. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7877.5599999999995s)]
*  It emboldens and empowers the other side. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7880.12s)]
*  Unfortunately, that's just how it goes. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7882.84s)]
*  You know, it's like what we're talking about, the DEI stuff. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7885.88s)]
*  It's like you force stuff down people's throats and they get angry at it. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7889.04s)]
*  Like, this is the fuck out of here with this. Yep. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7891.84s)]
*  And when you make people take vaccines. Yeah, they get angry. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7894.64s)]
*  They go and it emboldens them and it enforces their idea [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7897.5599999999995s)]
*  that other people are out to get them. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7902.5199999999995s)]
*  And that's real dangerous. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7905.76s)]
*  It's real dangerous when we think like that. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7907.32s)]
*  It's real dangerous. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7909.2s)]
*  And we got to be very careful. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7910.2s)]
*  Got to be very careful about it, because we don't want a fucking civil war. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7911.92s)]
*  And I just think we're almost like at this point [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7914.96s)]
*  where there's parts of one side that hate parts of the other side so much. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7919.16s)]
*  Both sides. Yeah. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7924.84s)]
*  Mm hmm. Mm hmm. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7926.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I didn't pick a left or right. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7927.16s)]
*  It's like it's both sides. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7928.72s)]
*  It's it's like there's evil on the right. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7929.92s)]
*  There's evil on the left. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7931.76s)]
*  It's just humans. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7932.88s)]
*  It's humans in groups. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7934.8s)]
*  You get enough of us together in a group. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7936.12s)]
*  Certain percentage are just going to be fucking assholes. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7938.12s)]
*  So what do you think is going to happen? [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7941.32s)]
*  You know, a year from now, [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7942.72s)]
*  one year from now, we'll be right up to the election. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7944.68s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7947.64s)]
*  I don't know. And I'm not happy. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7949.72s)]
*  So I'm also it's like fascinating watching RFK Junior not get [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7952.400000000001s)]
*  Secret Service protection. Yeah, that's weird. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7958.400000000001s)]
*  That's it's weird. It's gross. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7960.84s)]
*  Like, how is that even a thing that Hunter Biden gets it? [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7962.88s)]
*  And he does. How could they deny him that? Yeah. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7965.56s)]
*  I mean, and then there was some guy who showed up heavily armed [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7967.96s)]
*  to pretend that he was on a security detail. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7970.56s)]
*  Just another. Yeah. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7972.4s)]
*  No. Yeah, not good. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7974.24s)]
*  None of it's good. It's not good. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7976.32s)]
*  It's like, but you see these power struggles [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7978.5599999999995s)]
*  and you see these power dynamics and it just doesn't take into account. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7982.16s)]
*  It's like concentrating on short term victory, right? [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7987.0s)]
*  Short term victory is when the election at all costs. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7990.2s)]
*  But it's constant. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7992.719999999999s)]
*  It's not looking at the big picture of the future of the nation. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7993.679999999999s)]
*  If you choose to bend the rules, [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=7998.96s)]
*  because it's like the rules are the reason why we're great. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8001.08s)]
*  It's a big part of why this is such an amazing place is the freedom speech. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8003.96s)]
*  And if you're going to social media companies and you're the government [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8009.16s)]
*  and you're having them release or delete things that are accurate, [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8013.48s)]
*  that's not good for the nation. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8017.84s)]
*  That's not good for all of us. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8019.32s)]
*  It's not good for human beings as a whole. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8020.64s)]
*  It's not good for the country that you live in as a person doing that, [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8022.92s)]
*  making that decision. It's not good for all of us. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8026.36s)]
*  Well, you're not going to convince me of this, right? [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8028.84s)]
*  I mean, obviously. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8031.24s)]
*  So but I mean, look, my case, you know, it's an earlier. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8031.88s)]
*  There's two. There's two big cases. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8035.68s)]
*  There's my case and there's Missouri v. Biden, which is so Missouri, [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8037.280000000001s)]
*  the state of Missouri and the state of Louisiana sued, [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8040.76s)]
*  you know, over social media censorship. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8044.56s)]
*  And they did that in the Western District of Louisiana. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8046.64s)]
*  And they got a favorable ruling in July. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8049.56s)]
*  And then the Fifth Circuit, which is just one level below the Supreme Court, [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8052.320000000001s)]
*  you know, it's several states in the south [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8056.2s)]
*  basically upheld that ruling in it was about 10 days ago. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8060.0s)]
*  And now the Biden administration has appealed to the Supreme Court. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8064.04s)]
*  And what the Fifth Circuit has said is we don't want [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8067.36s)]
*  senior officials in the Biden administration, including including [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8072.2s)]
*  the same people who I've sued [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8075.2s)]
*  talking to social media companies and trying to pressure them. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8078.12s)]
*  When they've gone too far. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8081.24s)]
*  And here's what's really interesting about this, Joe, because [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8083.24s)]
*  so what the Biden administration says is we're not forcing anything. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8086.4800000000005s)]
*  We're not making explicit threats against anybody. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8091.96s)]
*  We're just saying this is what we think should be on your platforms. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8095.24s)]
*  And this is dangerous to let people talk about the problems with the vaccines [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8099.400000000001s)]
*  because it discourages people from getting vaccinated. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8102.92s)]
*  That's dangerous to them. We don't like that. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8104.96s)]
*  And, you know, famously, Biden said in July 2021, you're killing people. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8108.28s)]
*  Those were his words. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8112.4800000000005s)]
*  The platforms are killing people by allowing people like me [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8113.36s)]
*  to talk about problems or potential problems with the vaccines. OK. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8116.84s)]
*  Now, from my point of view, I've basically been proven right [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8120.24s)]
*  in terms of most of the concerns that I raised. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8123.799999999999s)]
*  Now, we could argue about that. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8126.04s)]
*  But the truth is, it doesn't matter whether I was right or wrong. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8127.24s)]
*  I'm an American. I have the right to express myself. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8130.719999999999s)]
*  And Twitter was my platform to do that. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8134.92s)]
*  It was my biggest journalistic outlet. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8137.32s)]
*  So try and get Twitter to ban me. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8139.16s)]
*  It's one thing, maybe if you if you, you know, [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8142.32s)]
*  if you just talk generally about what you want to see. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8147.639999999999s)]
*  But what's clear is that the Biden administration went way past that. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8150.719999999999s)]
*  This is what the what really comes out when you read. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8155.759999999999s)]
*  And of course, I've read the rulings in the Missouri v. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8159.36s)]
*  Biden case and of course, my own stuff [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8161.599999999999s)]
*  is that is that they pushed for months and months and really years [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8164.2s)]
*  until really 2021, 2022. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8170.36s)]
*  They they put a lot of pressure on these companies and they're [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8173.12s)]
*  and the White House is powerful and the companies have a lot of interests [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8177.08s)]
*  beyond, you know, me or other users. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8180.599999999999s)]
*  And what we're allowed to say, they have interests in Europe. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8184.28s)]
*  They have interests with Section 230, which is this provision [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8186.759999999999s)]
*  that enables them not to get sued for the content that they carry. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8190.719999999999s)]
*  And so at some point, even if you're not making an explicit threat [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8194.4s)]
*  of you better take this guy off or you're going to pay, [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8199.720000000001s)]
*  the companies hear that they hear what you're saying without you saying it. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8203.4s)]
*  And that's what the Fifth Circuit ruling basically says. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8208.28s)]
*  And that's my argument. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8211.64s)]
*  I mean, my argument goes past that, actually, because I have, you know, [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8213.64s)]
*  I have evidence that the White House explicitly, [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8216.720000000001s)]
*  quote unquote, asked why I was allowed to be on Twitter. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8220.12s)]
*  I mean, that's in black and white. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8223.12s)]
*  But the point is it's and this is the analogy, [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8224.68s)]
*  because I think everybody gets this when you get pulled over [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8228.0s)]
*  and the and the cop says, can you get out of your car for me? [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8231.4s)]
*  I really need you to get out. Can you get out for me, please? [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8235.12s)]
*  That's not really a question at some point. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8238.08s)]
*  That's a demand. And so and so. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8241.0s)]
*  It is not right for the government to try to stifle me [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8245.96s)]
*  or anyone else that way. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8250.44s)]
*  And that, you know, that's at the core of Berenson v. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8252.24s)]
*  Biden. And and it's broadly, you know, at the core of Missouri v. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8254.64s)]
*  Biden. And in a perfect world, [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8258.84s)]
*  what they would do is ask you how you came to this conclusion [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8261.64s)]
*  and what's the data show us? [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8264.16s)]
*  Well, we're in a perfect. I mean, the way you did. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8266.32s)]
*  You did base it on data. Yeah, absolutely. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8268.76s)]
*  No, you know, look, the White House, they're the most powerful organization [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8271.48s)]
*  in the world. They can say whatever they want. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8274.56s)]
*  They have a, you know, a billion dollar advertising budget. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8276.32s)]
*  They can the president or anybody on the covid team [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8279.279999999999s)]
*  can call the New York Times at any time and express their point of view. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8282.6s)]
*  They don't need to shut me up. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8286.0s)]
*  Whether what I'm saying is right or wrong, true or false. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8287.640000000001s)]
*  They don't need to shut me up. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8290.720000000001s)]
*  And it's against my constitutional rights for them to do so. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8292.960000000001s)]
*  And that is wrong. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8296.560000000001s)]
*  And by the way, I was right and they were wrong. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8298.04s)]
*  And the vaccines have basically failed. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8300.36s)]
*  And that's why nobody wants to take them anymore. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8302.560000000001s)]
*  But that actually is almost irrelevant. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8304.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's just it's a strange time [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8308.12s)]
*  when it comes to this, because really [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8312.08s)]
*  there was never social media before, like the Obama administration. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8315.76s)]
*  That's right. Right. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8320.52s)]
*  It's this is really a new thing. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8321.32s)]
*  And it became what it really became during the Trump administration. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8323.119999999999s)]
*  It became this like boiling pot. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8326.76s)]
*  Yes. And during covid, because pre covid, [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8329.72s)]
*  I would have just been an ex New York Times reporter [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8332.279999999999s)]
*  and I wouldn't have had any audience at all. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8334.4s)]
*  That's what they don't like. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8336.52s)]
*  They don't like you because you have an audience they can't control. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8338.0s)]
*  They don't like me because I have a half million people on Twitter [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8342.08s)]
*  and more, you know, back then who would retweet me [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8345.04s)]
*  and really wanted to hear what I had to say because [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8347.720000000001s)]
*  and they couldn't control it. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8350.560000000001s)]
*  And it was free to me. Right. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8351.92s)]
*  I didn't have to pay Twitter. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8353.480000000001s)]
*  It was just an audience and a voice. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8354.720000000001s)]
*  And they don't like that. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8356.92s)]
*  And that's a real problem. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8359.0s)]
*  If you're telling the truth, that's what's crazy. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8360.400000000001s)]
*  It's like we're not talking about someone who's advocating for violence. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8363.28s)]
*  We're not talking about someone who's trying to take down the government. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8366.6s)]
*  No, we're just talking about someone who's advocating for truth. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8370.16s)]
*  You're just talking about truth. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8373.52s)]
*  And if you've got a government that's trying to stop truth, like that's [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8374.6s)]
*  they shouldn't be doing that. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8379.2s)]
*  They just shouldn't be doing that. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8380.96s)]
*  Everyone should know they shouldn't be doing that. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8382.2s)]
*  They they they and you know, these are documents that have come out. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8384.6s)]
*  They knew that that people like me were the biggest problem [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8389.68s)]
*  because they what they didn't you know, if you're out there saying, [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8394.64s)]
*  oh, the vaccine is going to make your foot fall off or whatever. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8398.400000000001s)]
*  Stuff that's obviously untrue. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8401.2s)]
*  People know, you know, they're going to disregard that. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8403.16s)]
*  But if you have me saying, look at the CDC's own statistics [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8406.28s)]
*  and make a judgment for yourself, whether this makes sense. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8410.04s)]
*  Did they make those conclusions or are you just doing math? [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8412.800000000001s)]
*  I'm just doing math based on their data. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8416.12s)]
*  So it's not their conclusions, but it's their data. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8418.52s)]
*  That is what they know is the biggest problem for them [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8421.720000000001s)]
*  because because they can't say I'm lying. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8425.2s)]
*  They can't say it's false. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8428.0s)]
*  All they can say is it's misinformation. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8429.96s)]
*  Misinformation just means information that we don't like. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8433.16s)]
*  Isn't that malinformation, like true information that's bad? [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8436.88s)]
*  So so there's misdisc and mal. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8439.759999999998s)]
*  Yeah, what is mal? Exactly. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8442.119999999999s)]
*  So my joke about this was mal is [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8443.199999999999s)]
*  mal is just the third thing because they need three things. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8448.039999999999s)]
*  But the difference between miss and mal can be kind of hard to distinguish. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8451.0s)]
*  Miss technically, I think. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8455.16s)]
*  Can be false, whereas mal is not ever false, but it is taken out of context. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8458.279999999999s)]
*  It's stupid. It's all stupid or dangerous or or dangerous. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8464.08s)]
*  Somehow in a dangerous country as a whole or something like that. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8467.919999999998s)]
*  That's mal. Yes. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8470.599999999999s)]
*  Let's hear what it says. Mal's purposeful, I think. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8471.56s)]
*  The difference malinformation is truth used to inflict harm [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8473.32s)]
*  on a person, organization or country. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8476.48s)]
*  See, but that's like, what does that mean? [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8478.279999999999s)]
*  If you if like you could say, OK, but they're saying examples of malinformation [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8480.119999999999s)]
*  include phishing, catfishing and doxxing. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8484.039999999999s)]
*  Hmm. OK. OK. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8487.359999999999s)]
*  Well, if that's it. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8488.76s)]
*  Well, if you but but but if you broadly define it as it could do harm [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8489.88s)]
*  to an organization like information that could do harm to an organization. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8494.44s)]
*  So so where so how do they define misinformation? [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8499.32s)]
*  If malinformation is truth, misinformation. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8502.68s)]
*  So misinformation incorrect or misleading. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8507.72s)]
*  I mean, yeah, so that can be true, too. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8511.76s)]
*  Certainly misleading can be true. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8513.6s)]
*  It could be misleading, but you could take something out of context [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8515.64s)]
*  or it could be someone could be saying you could be using a part of something. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8519.359999999999s)]
*  Like you'd say this does this. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8523.24s)]
*  But the reason why it cancels itself out is because there's also this, [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8525.039999999999s)]
*  that and that happening. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8528.4s)]
*  So you might say the one thing only. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8529.199999999999s)]
*  OK, that's called making a case. Right. Yeah. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8531.119999999999s)]
*  Well, [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8536.64s)]
*  disinformation refers to false information [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8538.88s)]
*  is intended to manipulate, cause damage or guide people. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8541.24s)]
*  Organizations and countries in the wrong direction. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8546.32s)]
*  I love that wrong direction. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8548.8s)]
*  That's pretty Orwellian. Yeah. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8550.439999999999s)]
*  Malinformation reversed to information that stems from the truth, [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8553.0s)]
*  but is often exaggerated in a way that misleads and causes potential harm. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8556.32s)]
*  Oh, you mean like climate change? [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8559.76s)]
*  Well, I guess that kind of malinformation, then, [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8561.16s)]
*  like a lot of the discourse on climate change. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8565.119999999999s)]
*  Like if you go back to an inconvenient truth, [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8567.119999999999s)]
*  would that be considered malinformation? [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8570.0s)]
*  So there so there. OK. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8571.92s)]
*  So this is actually something I did. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8573.4s)]
*  I know malinformation is defined as intent as meant to cause harm. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8574.48s)]
*  OK. Harm to who? [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8579.76s)]
*  Like like the information I shared was intent to cause harm to Pfizer's profits. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8581.96s)]
*  Right. OK. You could decide that that's malinformation. Right. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8587.039999999999s)]
*  That's you're trying to cause harm, which is just bonkers. Right. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8591.039999999999s)]
*  So so this is why, you know, so we so so next. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8594.84s)]
*  So I filed Berenson v. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8598.359999999999s)]
*  Biden in April, the Pfizer and the Justice Department and Andy Slavitt, [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8600.64s)]
*  his lawyer, that there are three separate motions dismissed that came back about [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8606.32s)]
*  three weeks ago. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8610.88s)]
*  We now have to file our responses, which we do in October. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8612.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is going to hear the Missouri v. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8615.92s)]
*  Biden appeal, which is, of course, of great importance to my case, too, [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8619.4s)]
*  because if the Supreme Court says that some of the people in my case [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8623.119999999999s)]
*  violated the First Amendment, obviously, [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8628.0s)]
*  we're going to say to the judge in my case, look, look what the Supreme Court [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8630.04s)]
*  just ruled. You know, this is, you know, very powerful ruling from our point of view. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8633.560000000001s)]
*  So we'll see what happens. Interesting. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8638.560000000001s)]
*  It's a very important case, you know, as is the case. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8642.6s)]
*  Was it Missouri that the case? Yes. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8646.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Where they said that the federal government is no longer allowed. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8649.76s)]
*  To explain that. So OK, so so this is yes, there's another case [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8654.560000000001s)]
*  came out of Texas. So Texas said Texas passed a law saying that [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8657.720000000001s)]
*  Twitter and the really big social media companies can't [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8662.2s)]
*  censor content. They have to allow all content. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8666.720000000001s)]
*  And the company sued and said that violates our First Amendment rights. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8669.32s)]
*  We have to be allowed to choose what we're going to carry or not. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8673.2s)]
*  Now, now, in their defense, though, isn't part of that because of advertiser revenue. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8677.44s)]
*  Yeah. Like, that's the big thing. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8681.84s)]
*  That's the wasn't that the discussion that was going on recently about the Facebook [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8683.4s)]
*  ad fallout. Yes. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8687.44s)]
*  That these companies come to them and they say, unless you police your website, [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8689.16s)]
*  you can no longer have our advertising. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8693.24s)]
*  So I honestly this is a very complicated question legally. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8695.359999999999s)]
*  OK, because the companies do want to be able to curate content. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8698.6s)]
*  They want, you know, if you're face business, it's a business. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8702.0s)]
*  That's right. And they want engagement. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8704.32s)]
*  So they want to show you stuff that you want to see, especially Facebook. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8705.6s)]
*  That's their model. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8709.119999999999s)]
*  So if you're going to regulate these guys like telephone companies, [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8710.52s)]
*  basically what you're going to say is everything that everybody posts [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8713.72s)]
*  has to be allowed. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8717.24s)]
*  And and I can see the arguments on both sides of that. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8719.04s)]
*  My case and the Missouri v. Biden case are to me, they're very different. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8723.2s)]
*  And the reason is we're not saying, hey, Facebook or Twitter, [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8727.92s)]
*  you have to carry everything. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8732.24s)]
*  We're saying the government can't tell you what to carry and not to carry. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8733.6s)]
*  The Texas case, the separate case, this third case [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8738.32s)]
*  that says you guys have to carry everything. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8742.08s)]
*  That's where it gets weird. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8745.96s)]
*  That's where it gets weird. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8746.92s)]
*  Yes, because then you have to decide, OK, are these social media platforms? [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8747.72s)]
*  Are they a town hall that everyone should be able to participate in? [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8752.4s)]
*  Or are they a private company that can dictate what's on their platform, [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8755.24s)]
*  especially if not doing so hurts their financial bottom line? [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8759.199999999999s)]
*  That's right. And I think that's a hard question. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8763.0s)]
*  Again, are they you know, the AT&T, if you if you make a phone call, [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8765.96s)]
*  they don't get to, you know, you can say racist, anti-Semite, [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8770.279999999999s)]
*  whatever you want to say, like they carry your phone call. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8773.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's what's interesting is like, would if there was no stepping in, [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8775.8s)]
*  would the market figure it out like would sites like Rumble [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8781.28s)]
*  or these other like social media platforms that choose not to moderate that heavily? [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8786.039999999999s)]
*  Right. Would they rise now? [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8791.6s)]
*  You know, a lot of people thought that was going to happen with threads, right? [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8793.64s)]
*  Like people were tired of all the hate speech that was on Twitter and now X. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8797.2s)]
*  And they said, you know what, we're going to go over to threads. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8801.4s)]
*  Yeah, but it didn't work. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8803.44s)]
*  People seem to want a more open platform. They want Twitter. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8805.64s)]
*  They don't want they don't want that. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8808.76s)]
*  They had established followers and all this stuff over there. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8810.359999999999s)]
*  And it's just it was convenient to bitch over there. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8814.48s)]
*  So many people like, I'm out of here. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8817.64s)]
*  And then two weeks later, I go to their account, bitch, you post every day. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8818.92s)]
*  That's right. That's right. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8821.92s)]
*  No, Twitter, for whatever reason, we don't seem to be able to quit Twitter. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8823.68s)]
*  It's it's very powerful. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8827.84s)]
*  It's also people that don't like the fact that Elon Musk bought it [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8829.52s)]
*  because it seems so outrageous. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8833.08s)]
*  This guy just spent 44 billion dollars to own Twitter. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8834.640000000001s)]
*  Like, what a nut. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8837.44s)]
*  But you got to get them back on. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8839.880000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I'd love to. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8841.68s)]
*  Paying for it might be not a fun idea. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8842.960000000001s)]
*  No, I don't know if that's going to work. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8845.08s)]
*  It seems odd for everybody. I mean, yeah, everybody has to pay. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8847.12s)]
*  That's what he's saying now. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8850.48s)]
*  I wonder how much that would cost. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8851.52s)]
*  I mean, I presume he'd charge a dollar or two a month. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8853.4s)]
*  Who knows if he's going to if he's going to do it. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8855.68s)]
*  If you could just watch ads to pay for your monthly thing. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8857.28s)]
*  That's a way to pay for it back. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8859.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Wild. What a time. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8861.24s)]
*  I'm happy to pay my eight bucks a month. It's fine. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8864.24s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I pay. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8867.320000000002s)]
*  I just feel like I'm using it. Yeah. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8869.880000000001s)]
*  So it's a resource. I learned so much on it. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8871.6s)]
*  There's so many articles that I find that I never would have found so many [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8874.16s)]
*  really fascinating things about everything, about space, ancient history, [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8877.52s)]
*  like so many things that I find down Twitter or X now. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8881.400000000001s)]
*  It's can we can we can we not call it X? [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8885.32s)]
*  It's Twitter. It's I'm never going to forget. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8888.439999999999s)]
*  It's always going to be Twitter. But I guess eventually. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8890.759999999998s)]
*  But just to go all right without Twitter, like I wouldn't have had [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8893.359999999999s)]
*  the voice that I had. Right. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8897.88s)]
*  And so and and I think that's a good I mean, I think it's good that that it exists. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8899.64s)]
*  Well, the crazy thing is you got back on Twitter before you even bought it. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8905.8s)]
*  Yeah, I did. I sued my wife back on. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8908.839999999998s)]
*  Which is bananas. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8911.04s)]
*  The one court against Twitter. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8912.960000000001s)]
*  I did Twitter. Well, now now. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8915.04s)]
*  But now I'm going up against Pfizer and the government. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8916.560000000001s)]
*  I just decided to took it up another level. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8918.6s)]
*  You're a maniac. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8920.160000000002s)]
*  Just blunting for punishment. Stress. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8922.160000000002s)]
*  Geez. I got a good lawyer. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8925.0s)]
*  I believe you. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8927.36s)]
*  That's why I don't want to interview any more presidential candidates. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8928.6s)]
*  Like, I don't even want to be a part of this kookiness. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8930.800000000001s)]
*  I wanted to talk to Robert Kennedy Jr. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8934.480000000001s)]
*  because I read his book and I was fascinated. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8936.400000000001s)]
*  Did you interview if you interviewed DeSantis or Vivek or any of those guys? [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8938.4s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8941.92s)]
*  I interviewed Bernie back in the day and Tulsi and Andrew Yang. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8943.0s)]
*  I'd like to all of them. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8947.32s)]
*  I like people with ideas that are, you know, non-corporate ideas. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8948.8s)]
*  Yeah, I just don't know if it would ever work. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8952.92s)]
*  This is the thing that if I was ever going to talk to Trump, [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8955.24s)]
*  the one question I really want to know is like, what is it like when you get in there? [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8957.6s)]
*  Like, what is that like? What is that day like? [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8961.88s)]
*  What does it feel like when you're just running the show? [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8964.4s)]
*  Like, what the fuck happens? [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8966.84s)]
*  Who talks to you? [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8968.8s)]
*  I guess you couldn't even tell me, right? [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8970.359999999999s)]
*  Because he wants to be president again. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8971.92s)]
*  But like, what do they say? [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8973.24s)]
*  How do you fucking how do you pay attention to everything? [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8975.84s)]
*  The idea that one person is in charge of the whole thing is just so nuts. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8979.0s)]
*  I don't know how you can do that. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8984.32s)]
*  I he didn't. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8986.599999999999s)]
*  That's funny, because I don't see him as having a problem with that part of it. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8988.759999999998s)]
*  But I would, you know, like we have this illusion of what it's like, you know, [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8993.44s)]
*  you know, the old Bill Hicks joke. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=8998.76s)]
*  They bring you into a room full of guys smoking cigars, [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9001.0s)]
*  and they show you a video of the angle of presidential Kennedy assassination [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9004.64s)]
*  that you've never seen before. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9009.32s)]
*  And then they go, any questions? [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9011.32s)]
*  And you're like, yeah, what's my agenda? [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9012.92s)]
*  That's what it's like. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9015.24s)]
*  What happens when you get in there? Right. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9017.12s)]
*  Like, this is how much power do you really have? [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9018.84s)]
*  Like, what is what is that? [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9021.08s)]
*  What what is reality like versus perception? [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9023.039999999999s)]
*  I'd be interested in hearing that. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9026.64s)]
*  But you'd have to listen to a lot of other stuff. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9029.72s)]
*  I'd listen to a lot of stuff. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9031.68s)]
*  I'm willing to listen to stuff. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9033.039999999999s)]
*  I'm curious. But yeah, I'll tell you who you'll never have on. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9034.8s)]
*  It's Biden. They wouldn't let him near you. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9039.0s)]
*  That would be fascinating. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9042.2s)]
*  I would feel bad. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9044.48s)]
*  I would feel bad just because, you know, he's a human being. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9046.4s)]
*  He's a human being, regardless of his past. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9050.44s)]
*  He's in a declining state. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9053.08s)]
*  It's obvious. Yes. Yes. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9054.44s)]
*  And that's just, you know, just what it is. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9056.36s)]
*  He's too old to be the president of the United States. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9058.56s)]
*  So who do they run? [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9060.44s)]
*  Do you think if he doesn't make it, do they run Gavin Newsom? [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9061.4s)]
*  Because he said no, Kamala Harris would take the spot. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9063.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, Newsom certainly fits the role. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9067.24s)]
*  Newsom or Gretchen Whitmer. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9069.2s)]
*  You know, like, I don't like either of them, but they certainly are viable candidates. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9071.32s)]
*  But you'd have to get someone who's popular enough to defeat Trump [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9076.16s)]
*  and who's strong enough of a politician. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9079.16s)]
*  And that's where I think Newsom steps in. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9081.48s)]
*  I mean, he looks like a president. He's tall, handsome. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9083.84s)]
*  Yeah. A strong personality. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9086.52s)]
*  He's very articulate, like the way he lays things out. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9089.08s)]
*  He knows how to steamroll you with facts and statistics that even if they're true. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9091.76s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't matter. No, no, he's a politician. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9096.56s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's a really good one. Yeah. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9099.44s)]
*  So that's that's probably who I would imagine they would run, [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9101.28s)]
*  even though California is a mess. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9104.28s)]
*  But California, I think, would have been a mess with anybody running it during Covid. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9106.04s)]
*  I think it was a fucking disaster. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9109.32s)]
*  Soon as you start the lockdowns, you let people camp in the streets [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9111.2s)]
*  and you fucking the crime shit and the being lenient on bail. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9113.88s)]
*  Yes. Oh, boy. Yes. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9117.8s)]
*  And the defund the police. Oh, boy. Yeah, it's a mess. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9119.4s)]
*  Like cleaning that up. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9122.6s)]
*  Boy, I do not envy anybody there. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9124.0s)]
*  There are there are viable Democratic candidates. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9126.28s)]
*  I guess I knew some Whitmer. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9129.08s)]
*  I mean, not Cuomo anymore. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9131.48s)]
*  I mean, I guess you have to start from right now. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9134.52s)]
*  Yeah. They don't have to already be out there on the campaign trail [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9137.32s)]
*  because people have to really get to know them. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9140.24s)]
*  And like we're we're in September of 2023. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9142.84s)]
*  We only got a year left. Yeah. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9145.52s)]
*  No, it's and it is funny with with DeSantis. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9147.0s)]
*  You know, I really like the way he handled Florida during Covid. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9149.52s)]
*  I think he's smart. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9152.279999999999s)]
*  But he is not connected with the voters at all. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9153.4s)]
*  People just don't seem to like him. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9155.8s)]
*  Also, as soon as he's running against Trump, [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9157.32s)]
*  the Trump or or bust people are not on board [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9159.960000000001s)]
*  because then he becomes the enemy. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9164.92s)]
*  That's just a sizable chunk of the opposition. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9166.32s)]
*  Yeah. The people that are in opposition to the current party, [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9169.52s)]
*  there's a sizable trunk Trump chunk rather are Trump loyalists. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9172.64s)]
*  Yeah. And if you go against that, like, that's just not a good strategy. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9177.52s)]
*  It's just like I understand you want to be president, but like, [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9182.64s)]
*  do you see the landscape? [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9185.04s)]
*  If Mike Tyson is the champ and, you know, [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9187.08s)]
*  you're just coming out of the Olympics, wait a few years, bro. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9189.04s)]
*  Get some fights under your belts. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9192.04s)]
*  You know, like that guy is just kind of unstoppable. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9193.960000000001s)]
*  Trump has there's some magnetism he has for all these people. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9198.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's I don't I don't understand it, but it's real. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9202.720000000001s)]
*  You know, you're not supposed to say it [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9208.400000000001s)]
*  because you're supposed to be in opposition. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9210.880000000001s)]
*  You hate him and all this stuff. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9212.44s)]
*  But it's clearly obvious he's got like this cult of personality that they don't have. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9213.320000000002s)]
*  He's a giant figure. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9218.24s)]
*  Yeah. When you see when he showed up at the UFC in Miami, it was bananas. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9219.92s)]
*  Oh, so you've that's what you've seen him up close. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9225.4s)]
*  Yeah. So first of all, I've shook his hand on multiple two two occasions. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9227.36s)]
*  Now he has regular size hands. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9231.68s)]
*  So all that is crazy. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9234.2s)]
*  All that's crazy because I have pretty big hands. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9236.32s)]
*  He has regular size hands. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9238.24s)]
*  And I was like, this is crazy. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9240.4s)]
*  All these years, they mocked him for having little hands. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9241.76s)]
*  He doesn't have little hands at all. That's why it's so strange. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9243.76s)]
*  That's great. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9246.48s)]
*  And by the way, how gross to mock someone for something they were born with. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9247.6s)]
*  That's so anti liberal and anti progressive. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9252.0s)]
*  Like, why are you doing that? [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9255.359999999999s)]
*  Why are you doing that? [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9257.32s)]
*  That's funny. That's such a crazy thing to do. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9258.359999999999s)]
*  Like the one thing that he can't control. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9260.279999999999s)]
*  What about his personality? [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9261.8s)]
*  What about all the things he says? [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9262.8s)]
*  If you want to get mad at him, get mad at him for the things that you're really changeable. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9264.08s)]
*  But so, OK, he's got the normal size hands. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9268.32s)]
*  But so so does he does he have this magnetism? [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9270.08s)]
*  Well, he's very, very, very famous. [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9273.64s)]
*  And part of people's dissatisfaction with the current regime, right, [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9275.6s)]
*  especially people's dissatisfaction, if you see, you know, Biden's state of decline, [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9280.68s)]
*  regardless of how you feel about the policies, and most people aren't even engaged. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9285.12s)]
*  They don't even understand what's going on and whether or not it's beneficial to people [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9288.2s)]
*  and whether or not there are more jobs and whether or not the economy is moving. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9291.4s)]
*  Because there's arguments that it is moving in a good direction. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9294.44s)]
*  Right. Yeah. There's arguments that some of the policies work. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9296.52s)]
*  But they look at him as a figurehead and they say this is bad. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9299.4s)]
*  And then they really believe because he said it so many times, the election was rigged. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9303.12s)]
*  They really believe it. So a lot of them really believe it. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9306.96s)]
*  It's like I was in Aspen and this lady, she's like, I'm a big fan of yours. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9309.64s)]
*  Like this grandma lady. I said, thank you. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9315.24s)]
*  And you know that Trump's our president. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9317.48s)]
*  I go, well, actually, he's not because President is Biden. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9319.72s)]
*  If you Google it, you can find out. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9322.88s)]
*  It's like, oh, they got to you. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9324.6s)]
*  I go, oh, no, they didn't get to me. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9326.52s)]
*  I just like he's actually in the White House. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9328.08s)]
*  He won. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9331.56s)]
*  I don't know if you won. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9332.76s)]
*  You don't know if you won. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9334.12s)]
*  No, no, no, I'm not saying that. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9335.0s)]
*  I'm just saying he's definitely in the White House. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9336.44s)]
*  Yes. Now, whether or not there's any election manipulation, [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9338.84s)]
*  I am not the one to fucking come to for any of that. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9341.960000000001s)]
*  But I would guarantee you that it's not zero. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9344.4s)]
*  I would guarantee you that in the course of human history, [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9347.44s)]
*  there's probably never been an election where there's zero election fraud. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9349.44s)]
*  There's always some monkey business going on. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9353.4s)]
*  But I've seen no evidence. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9356.4s)]
*  I mean, maybe they'll show it if this trial comes about that shows that [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9357.960000000001s)]
*  he maybe I should go seek it out. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9362.439999999999s)]
*  Maybe. No, he my line about this, and I'm going to stick with this, [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9364.839999999998s)]
*  is that he lost unfair and square. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9368.32s)]
*  In other words, the media was against him when people [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9370.24s)]
*  would put people responding to is this idea that, you know, [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9373.359999999999s)]
*  corporate America was against him, that everybody in power, [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9376.48s)]
*  including a lot of Republicans, I think, wanted him out. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9380.8s)]
*  They couldn't stand that sort of they couldn't know really. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9383.16s)]
*  They couldn't stand him anymore. Sure. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9385.48s)]
*  So but that is different [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9387.16s)]
*  than the election was manipulated and votes were taken. Right. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9389.76s)]
*  And then the Dominion stuff. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9393.32s)]
*  It's all horseshit. It's horseshit. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9395.52s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9397.68s)]
*  it seems like it's really hard to sort out, too, [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9401.28s)]
*  because there's so many different cases and so many different states. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9404.0s)]
*  And all these different people. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9406.76s)]
*  No, but I don't mean about that. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9408.16s)]
*  I don't mean that. What I'm saying is like. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9409.92s)]
*  It's when you are tallying [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9412.72s)]
*  mail in votes, digital votes, all these different things, [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9416.0s)]
*  and they have projections for these places. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9419.08s)]
*  One of the things that Kyle Kingsbury showed me or excuse me, [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9421.4s)]
*  Kyle Kulinski, Jesus. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9425.6s)]
*  Hi, Kyle Kinsbury. Long time, buddy. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9427.24s)]
*  Kyle Kulinski showed me is that when we we had him on during the election [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9429.84s)]
*  and he accurately predicted, he said, yes, Trump is winning [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9435.28s)]
*  because these are the people that show up first. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9438.2s)]
*  But you're going to see the Democratic surge for the mail ins [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9440.48s)]
*  when they count those. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9443.68s)]
*  And that's exactly what happened because he's very politically aware. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9444.96s)]
*  He understands how it works. Yep. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9447.88s)]
*  I don't I don't dispute any of that. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9449.92s)]
*  What I'm saying is it would be wonderful [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9452.32s)]
*  if we had a system where it was bulletproof. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9456.16s)]
*  It would be wonderful if we had a system where it was impossible [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9459.8s)]
*  to have anything other than zero percent election fraud. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9462.64s)]
*  I don't know if that's even realistic. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9465.839999999998s)]
*  But if we did, but we can bank on our phones. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9469.439999999999s)]
*  That's right. On the Internet. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9471.88s)]
*  You know, there's there's like federal IDs that are connected to you. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9473.48s)]
*  And this idea that IDs for voting is somehow racist is so bananas. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9477.52s)]
*  I agree with that. This is that's what I mean. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9481.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, like there was a documentary that HBO had on in a fucking [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9484.04s)]
*  like the early 90s called Hacking Democracy. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9489.0s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9491.640000000001s)]
*  Mm hmm. It was during the Bush administration. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9492.6s)]
*  And they were making this argument that Bush didn't really win. [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9495.960000000001s)]
*  And they were making this argument that you could manipulate the voting machine. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9499.12s)]
*  So they actually this was a diebold machine, I believe. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9502.32s)]
*  And they actually showed that it was somehow or another. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9505.16s)]
*  There was it was available for a third party input. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9508.56s)]
*  And they did it on the show and changed a vote on the show. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9512.04s)]
*  It's like, oh, my God. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9514.84s)]
*  But it was about the Republicans. Right. So it was OK. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9516.44s)]
*  Yeah. All right. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9519.24s)]
*  So now I'm going to play the other side here. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9520.76s)]
*  Some of these sentences that have been handed out in the January six cases [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9522.84s)]
*  are insane. It's wild. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9525.92s)]
*  It's 20 years. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9528.16s)]
*  Why? 17 years. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9529.76s)]
*  The 22 years the guy wasn't even in. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9531.36s)]
*  He wasn't at the Capitol at the time. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9534.48s)]
*  He's getting he's getting a terrorism enhancement. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9536.16s)]
*  I mean, come on. Yeah, it's pretty wild. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9538.32s)]
*  It's pretty wild. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9541.4s)]
*  I'm not saying that, like, I'm not defending what happened. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9542.359999999999s)]
*  I know what you're saying. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9545.439999999999s)]
*  But but, you know, a year, two years, three years, maybe five years. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9546.0s)]
*  Like, that's a pretty long prison sentence. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9550.08s)]
*  Yeah. For nonviolent. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9552.56s)]
*  They want to make sure that people never do it again. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9554.16s)]
*  Yes. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9556.0s)]
*  Well, which is probably a good thing. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9556.92s)]
*  But also, how did it happen? [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9558.72s)]
*  Like, why wasn't there more security there? [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9561.68s)]
*  What was up with cops opening up the gates? [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9564.0s)]
*  Did you ever see some of that? [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9566.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, my my my understanding, and I've not paid super close attention. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9567.24s)]
*  My understanding is they basically just got overrun and decided to back off. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9570.92s)]
*  Which is which is a legitimate like military sort of police response. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9575.24s)]
*  Sure. And I don't think those people were in opposition to the police. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9579.4s)]
*  And they're probably worried about the police's safety [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9583.48s)]
*  since they were vastly outnumbered. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9585.48s)]
*  I think there were some of that, right? [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9587.36s)]
*  But also, it's super illegal to get into the Capitol. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9588.56s)]
*  That too. Don't do that. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9591.119999999999s)]
*  Like when you got Alex Jones out there with a bullhorn saying, don't go in. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9592.72s)]
*  And you know, that Alex Jones is the voice of reason. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9596.4s)]
*  That's not a good sign. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9599.0s)]
*  But he was right. He was saying it's a trap. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9600.279999999999s)]
*  And it is ultimately it is, you know, and ultimately also, they did break the windows. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9601.96s)]
*  They did come in. They did. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9607.4s)]
*  No, I guess they should be in jail. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9608.24s)]
*  But 20 years, the long time. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9609.76s)]
*  But the weird one is that guy with the buffalo hat, [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9611.84s)]
*  where they like leading him around a tour. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9614.72s)]
*  Just like, how come you didn't show that part? [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9617.599999999999s)]
*  That part's crazy. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9620.48s)]
*  You guys were leading him around a tour. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9621.4s)]
*  Yes. Yes. It's all what a mess. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9623.16s)]
*  What a mess. Yeah. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9625.72s)]
*  Also, don't do that. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9627.279999999999s)]
*  Also, don't don't do that. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9628.56s)]
*  Don't do that. Don't ever do that. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9629.92s)]
*  Don't ever do that. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9631.6s)]
*  But these guys, they were going in there with zip ties looking for Nancy Pelosi. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9632.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that was bad, too. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9635.359999999999s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9636.72s)]
*  The guy that had his foot on the desk, he took a photo of himself. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9637.8s)]
*  Hey, bro, how do you think that's going to turn out? [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9640.8s)]
*  He's fucking. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9643.68s)]
*  But that's the thing. They're not thinking. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9644.84s)]
*  These people aren't thinking. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9646.199999999999s)]
*  And they really do. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9647.16s)]
*  That's also the problem. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9648.44s)]
*  If you if you've been told and this is the this is the argument against what Trump did. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9649.84s)]
*  Was that if you've been told the election is rigged [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9654.16s)]
*  and you're not showing clear evidence of it, you're just putting that narrative out there. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9656.48s)]
*  Now, people, they operate as if their country has been taken over [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9660.0s)]
*  and they think they're patriots. That's right. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9664.119999999999s)]
*  And they think they think there's almost like a God given, [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9666.24s)]
*  like not a right, but an imperative to do something. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9670.88s)]
*  Yeah. No, then Trump, Trump, what Trump behaved in a disgusting way. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9674.72s)]
*  Look, when your own vice president says it, you know, Mike Pence [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9679.519999999999s)]
*  basically did everything Trump asked of him for four years. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9683.439999999999s)]
*  OK, and he's come out and said Trump behaved in the wrong way. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9686.84s)]
*  I think you got to acknowledge that. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9690.119999999999s)]
*  But when you go back to your point, the there's a large group of people [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9691.76s)]
*  in the Republican Party for whom Trump is basically a god, [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9695.72s)]
*  and they will not acknowledge it. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9699.32s)]
*  Yeah, they won't. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9700.92s)]
*  Just they're scared of him. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9702.16s)]
*  You know, he's the big booming figure that's at the head of the fucking pack. [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9703.76s)]
*  You know, and it's just, man, it's so polarizing for the country. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9708.16s)]
*  It's it's just I wish there was two people that we respected, [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9711.599999999999s)]
*  you know, or even one or one. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9715.56s)]
*  Just two people that, you know, like, hey, I don't agree with his policies [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9718.32s)]
*  about this and that, but I think he's a good person. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9721.8s)]
*  And I think he's really got the best interest of the country in mind. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9723.88s)]
*  And who knows? [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9726.96s)]
*  Maybe their policies are correct. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9728.56s)]
*  Who knows? Maybe his policies are correct. Let's find out. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9730.599999999999s)]
*  But instead, it's like hell in a hand basket, no matter which way it goes. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9733.36s)]
*  And then, my God, what if Biden wins again and beats Trump? [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9739.28s)]
*  And then is 86 in four years? [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9744.28s)]
*  And what if people just like don't believe it's real again? [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9746.68s)]
*  And it gets worse than January 6th. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9750.6s)]
*  Yeah. Right. What if that happens? [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9752.800000000001s)]
*  What if people would have Trump wins and people decide [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9755.400000000001s)]
*  the government has been overcome by fascists [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9758.32s)]
*  and we have to wage war on the infrastructure and blow up fucking generators [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9760.92s)]
*  and kill the grid? And I mean, people are now you're depressing me. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9765.08s)]
*  You're playing the role of the liberal parent with the climate change. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9769.52s)]
*  Well, I'm just I'm just looking at this precarious position in which we stand. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9772.16s)]
*  Why? We're also involved in a proxy war with Russia. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9776.36s)]
*  It's bananas. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9779.960000000001s)]
*  It scares the shit out of me. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9781.6s)]
*  You know, and and we were so scared of it [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9784.0s)]
*  that we'd rather concentrate on things like climate change. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9786.84s)]
*  Like it's almost like we'd rather concentrate on things that are like [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9789.64s)]
*  not as terrifying, like immediately, like in the distance. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9793.119999999999s)]
*  It's going to be a real problem. We can focus on it now. It's like. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9797.16s)]
*  Got our choices. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9800.64s)]
*  Just don't get your kids vaccinated with the mRNAs. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9802.56s)]
*  The other vaccines. Fine. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9805.08s)]
*  Don't get your kids vaccinated with the covid vaccines. [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9806.76s)]
*  It's not good for them. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9809.16s)]
*  Yeah. And take some vitamins. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9810.08s)]
*  Take some. Please exercise a little bit. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9811.32s)]
*  Not going to kill you. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9813.68s)]
*  That's a good place to end. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9815.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9817.4s)]
*  Thank you. And thank you for having the courage to talk about this stuff. [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9819.0s)]
*  I mean, it's it's amazing that a lot of the things that you got in trouble with [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9823.48s)]
*  early in the pandemic are now absolutely [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9827.4s)]
*  regarded as fact and discussed openly in mainstream circles. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9832.0s)]
*  Like Dr. [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9836.0s)]
*  Lena Wen was on CNN, which is the most mainstream thing out there. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9837.2s)]
*  And she was saying that the estimates of covid deaths [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9840.68s)]
*  was probably actually 30 percent of what was reported, [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9843.52s)]
*  which is a crazy thing. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9847.720000000001s)]
*  When she said it, you could see the look on the people's face like, [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9849.480000000001s)]
*  what the fuck is she saying? Yeah. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9851.400000000001s)]
*  Because there's a lot of discussion now about the lab leak. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9854.16s)]
*  It's like it's commonplace to discuss it. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9858.44s)]
*  It's commonplace to discuss the pros and cons of gain of function research. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9860.92s)]
*  You know, the the most people are currently aware that cloth masks don't work at all. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9864.68s)]
*  Yep. Most people are currently aware. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9870.400000000001s)]
*  When was the last time you heard the phrase test and trace? [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9873.16s)]
*  Right. I don't remember that social distancing drove me. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9876.880000000001s)]
*  No, yeah, that one drove me. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9880.2s)]
*  And everybody agrees that school closures. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9881.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, that one, we all agree disaster should never happen again. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9884.0s)]
*  Shouldn't happen. I mean, I was talking about that. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9887.56s)]
*  If there's one thing I'm proud of, I was talking about that in April of 2020. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9890.4s)]
*  Yeah. The schools need to be reopened. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9894.2s)]
*  So, yeah. And they were in some places. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9896.12s)]
*  Yeah, we're down here. That's what's crazy. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9899.12s)]
*  You know, what's crazy is we have examples of Florida and Texas [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9901.12s)]
*  and a lot of other places where they just opened up and they didn't have worse. [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9904.68s)]
*  I mean, even though like, look, we're in a bad state [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9909.359999999999s)]
*  in terms of like the health of this country, like the people are not that healthy. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9912.8s)]
*  And wasn't that one of the arguments in one of your substacks recently? [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9916.279999999999s)]
*  Yes. Oh, so. So. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9920.24s)]
*  So the the argument was just today, these this epidemiologist wrote, [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9922.16s)]
*  well, we have a different rules about the new covid boosters in other countries [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9926.88s)]
*  because we are sicker than other countries. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9931.0s)]
*  So we have to give people more mRNA. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9932.439999999999s)]
*  And it's like, so what your argument is, you our public health [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9934.8s)]
*  establishment and medical care is so bad that we have to give people [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9938.56s)]
*  we are giving people advice that other countries aren't giving them [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9942.84s)]
*  that have better outcomes. And you want us to take our advice? [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9946.359999999999s)]
*  Maybe maybe we should listen to the other countries [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9949.199999999999s)]
*  where things are going better for a change. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9951.76s)]
*  Maybe maybe instead of trying to medicate our way out of every problem, [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9953.96s)]
*  we should just tell people go for a walk. [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9958.16s)]
*  I mean, this was one of the things about lockdowns way back in 2020. Right. [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9961.24s)]
*  This is a disease that is it hurts people who are obese [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9964.320000000002s)]
*  or morbidly obese the most. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9968.800000000001s)]
*  So maybe the solution is not to have them sit on their asses [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9971.12s)]
*  for another six months. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9975.560000000001s)]
*  There's also been some real data about vitamin D. Yep. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9976.92s)]
*  And real data about how many people could have helped. Yep. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9980.0s)]
*  So it's it's been a long three years. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9983.44s)]
*  But what's so depressing, just sort of this last thing, [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9986.400000000001s)]
*  they don't seem to have learned anything. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9990.12s)]
*  That's what the last week taught me. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9992.28s)]
*  That's why that's why I feel like I can't stop talking about it. [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9993.88s)]
*  They're doubling down, even as the rest of the world is realizing, [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=9996.359999999999s)]
*  you know what, COVID is not a big deal. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=10000.599999999999s)]
*  We need to, you know, reserve these vaccines [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=10002.92s)]
*  for people who are really high risk. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=10006.519999999999s)]
*  The U.S. will not let it go. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=10008.72s)]
*  At least the U.S. public health establishment will not let it go. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=10011.24s)]
*  And the truth is, 98 percent of the country isn't going to listen to them. [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=10013.96s)]
*  But it's still important to point out that they're full of it. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=10017.4s)]
*  We have to keep doing that. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=10020.839999999998s)]
*  Well, thank you for doing that. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=10023.28s)]
*  Thanks, Joe. Appreciate you. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=10024.72s)]
*  You're you're you're out there telling the truth. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=10026.24s)]
*  And, you know, in the beginning, you took a lot of shit for it. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=10028.84s)]
*  You really did. And a lot of people owe you an apology. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=10032.44s)]
*  Well, they're not giving it to me. Well, they don't have to. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=10035.24s)]
*  You got it. I mean, you you know, you deserve it. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=10037.4s)]
*  You know you do. Thanks, Joe. Thank you. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=10040.24s)]
*  All right. All right. So everybody. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznvMq2v5lU&t=10042.44s)]
