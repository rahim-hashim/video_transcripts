# Joe Rogan Experience #1534 - Ron White
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [September 09, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mgN8r1mwvM)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan Podcast by night, all day.
*  You look good.
*  Oh, thank you.
*  You did.
*  You look like you're well rested, like the COVID lockdown has done you well.
*  Thank you.
*  You know, during this thing, I came up with a program called the Dial It Back a Little
*  Bit.
*  Program and it's like AA, except there's only six steps, but you don't get completely sober.
*  So it's going to be very popular, I think.
*  And the first step was, Ron, why don't you quit drinking so fucking much?
*  And what is so fucking much?
*  What's the numbers?
*  You know, it's a half a bottle of tequila a night or something like that.
*  Maybe a little more.
*  Wound back to a third.
*  By the way, these little cigars are the shit.
*  These are really good.
*  Romeo and Julieta, tiny cigars.
*  Yeah, that's the mini cigarillo.
*  So there's one that's a little bit bigger than that.
*  It's called a cigarillo.
*  And these are the minis.
*  And I started, like I was saying, when I was playing golf, you know, it's a little bit
*  bigger than that.
*  And these are the minis.
*  And I started, like I was saying, when I was playing golf, you know, whenever it's time
*  for me to hit, I just throw it away and light another one.
*  You know, there's 20 of them for 15 bucks.
*  So, you know, as opposed to a $15 cigar, which is what I usually smoke, something like that.
*  But it's good tobacco.
*  Yeah, it's really good.
*  It's the same thing.
*  It's in their big old premium cigars just rolled by the junior rollers.
*  That's how they learn.
*  And you look like you're smoking a blunt.
*  But we're clearly not clearly.
*  And in Austin, what were you saying about the rules?
*  It's like a cool what you could have as much as a quarter of a pound before they arrest you.
*  Yeah, a quarter of a pound.
*  Is that right?
*  Yeah.
*  And if you just say it's CBD, CDB, whatever nugs, then they would have to test it and they don't want to test it.
*  They got other things to do.
*  So they have CBD stores out here, folks.
*  It's very strange.
*  They have stores that sell CBD joints, but marijuana is illegal.
*  Right.
*  So I don't know.
*  You know, my son is in that business and it is confusing.
*  And I think that's what helps.
*  You know, is they got dizzy trying to figure it out.
*  But I was going through LAX on the way out here a week early.
*  And because we set this up for we were talking on Friday and you said next Tuesday, the eighth.
*  Well, I don't even know what month it is, much less what day of the month it is.
*  And so I just thought it's the next Tuesday coming up, which was only three days away.
*  And I was a little mad at you.
*  And I was like, wow, it seems like you to give me more than three days notice.
*  And I got to find a way to get to LA.
*  And I'm looking at flights.
*  There's nothing good.
*  I'm thinking about bringing my plane down, which it turns out has a problem.
*  So we couldn't bring it down.
*  And and then I get down here and he's like, the eighth is a week from today.
*  And I was like, I'm so stupid, man.
*  We made it work.
*  Yeah, we made it work.
*  So they just plugged in the stuff a few days early.
*  And here I am.
*  So you're not from here, but you've been here for how long now?
*  Two years.
*  How long?
*  You know, I started coming to Austin when I was 15 years old.
*  My my buddy, his brother taught economics at UT and had a house on Fourth Street,
*  which at that time was just little bitty, low end cracker box houses,
*  but that mostly teachers lived in and he would let us stay in his yard.
*  And so we would tell my parents that we were going camping at Lake Sutherland.
*  And my buddy, Ricky Bellows, when he turned 16, had the littlest new Honda,
*  but he had one that was wrecked and he rebuilt it.
*  And we put all our camping gear in it, come straight to Austin and set up in my
*  brother's, my buddy, Mickey McMillan, his brother, Scott McMillan,
*  we'd set up in his yard, his backyard.
*  And then we'd walk two blocks of Sixth Street.
*  And it was probably 71 or 72.
*  And Austin was tripping balls.
*  I mean, it was people on unicycles in clown suits, juggling backwards,
*  music pumping out of every window.
*  Stevie Ray Vaughan coming out of this with Stevie Ray Vaughan on one end of the guitar.
*  And we're Vaughan playing live, live, right.
*  Just out the window.
*  Now we didn't have any money and we couldn't get in any club.
*  So we had we were completely broke.
*  And but we're standing there listening to this music, watching this scene of Sixth Street in 71.
*  I guess it was about 71 or two when I've been 15, 71.
*  And and even then there were people going, it's over.
*  You should have seen it in 67.
*  I'm like, still, still, still looks pretty good to me, man.
*  That's what people always do, though.
*  Oh, yeah. That's it, man.
*  Just the other day, somebody was like, oh, yeah, it's just not what it used to be.
*  And I'm like, when did you get here? Like Thursday.
*  I'm like, fuck, dude, really? It's taking a dive since Thursday.
*  All these fucking Californians moving in. Yeah, they really hate that shit.
*  Yeah. I talked to this guy's doing I.T. work.
*  He's like, we're being invaded. Right.
*  Relax. Well, you know, it's a it's a great state.
*  And but it's it's just a liberal stronghold in the middle of a very Republican state.
*  And, you know, I was born and raised here.
*  And, you know, if people ask me if I'm a Texan, I tell them I'm a Texan.
*  You know, this is where I'm from.
*  And the state is slowly changing and becoming more palatable for everybody.
*  And but there's still a pretty hard right wing, you know, faction that runs it all out of out of Dallas, where all the money is in Houston.
*  And that's what keeps it from going haywire. Right.
*  That's what keeps it from going straight Portland. Right.
*  That's it. You fucking need that, man.
*  Those people are ridiculous. You need that. You need you need law and order.
*  You do. I don't know. I don't give a fuck what anybody says.
*  That's a my old joke was if you come to Texas and kill somebody, we will kill you back.
*  And they go somewhere else and kill people.
*  You'll be better off, you know, Gallup. Go to California.
*  You know, it's just I just feel like, you know, people want to throw away everything that's there.
*  They would just want to break it all down and deconstruct society.
*  But they don't really mean their plan.
*  Once they do that, you saw what happened with that six block chunk of Seattle that they took over.
*  Chaz. Yeah, it deteriorated almost instantly and became a terribly run country.
*  Right. They had borders.
*  They had people beating people up for filming things.
*  I mean, they had murders that thinking about wall.
*  Yes, they took over to not only that, they appropriated all the buildings.
*  They didn't build those buildings. They just took it over.
*  The problem with that kind of thinking is even if you think you're right, what you're doing now, someone can do that to you because you've already shown that it can be done.
*  You've already shown that you could just by force, you can light the fucking mayor of Portland's apartment building on fire and stand out and chant.
*  Well, they could do that to your house, too. Right.
*  You got to understand, like what you're doing is not nice.
*  It's not civilized. It's not polite.
*  This is a civilized society. And if you decide you're going to do things that are not civilized and you're going to justify it,
*  people can do things that are not civilized to you.
*  Like the founding fathers, as crazy as it is in the seventeen hundreds, figured this shit out in advance.
*  They had a whole series of checks and balances to keep things from going sideways.
*  They really had some good ideas.
*  It's really amazing when you stop and think about their great insight into human nature and how it could apply and where it might go.
*  They were right. They were right.
*  Right. Yeah. Now, you know, when we were having protests and in vandalism and whatever in Beverly Hills and they were saying that the next
*  you know, they're coming to tear your part town apart.
*  You know, I really didn't think they would.
*  But I still had a retired Navy SEAL standing in front of my house with a gun.
*  And his message was, why don't you go fuck up the house next door, Ron?
*  And leave Ron's place alone.
*  It's just these young people with these idealistic ideas about people that are successful that somehow know that you've stolen it from other people and that you need to give it back to everyone else.
*  We need to have a communist society.
*  And it's like, where's the money coming from?
*  Where who's going to work?
*  What are you going to do?
*  Have you thought this through?
*  Right. You know, I had always chosen the path of least resistance in my life.
*  And it just ended up here, you know, in Joe Rogan's studio at 63 years old.
*  This is the path of least resistance.
*  This is where I ended up.
*  It is, but it isn't, you know, you say that, but you were a grinder.
*  You were out there on the road doing the hard gigs.
*  That's not least least resistance.
*  No, it was.
*  Yeah, it was so much fun.
*  I couldn't stand it.
*  You know, I would tap my foot when I was at home.
*  I wanted to get back out to the path of least resistance, you know, because, you know, me, I love stand up kind of.
*  I love being on stage like you do.
*  And and and touring never bothered me.
*  You know, it got softer and softer.
*  It started out.
*  It was 800 miles in a in a Nissan truck with a bench vinyl seat that would bend you over the steering wheel after 50 miles.
*  And you had 800 miles to go to Atlanta that who shows.
*  And I didn't care.
*  You know, I felt like I found it.
*  Yeah. And and I didn't even know what it was till I found it.
*  The first time I was on stage, I was like, oh, I'm a comedian.
*  That's what I am.
*  If you just look at most of society, at least I did when I looked at most of society, most of what people were doing so unappealing to me, it just didn't resonate with my mind and the way I grew up.
*  It just didn't work.
*  But as soon as I started doing comedy and going on the road, I was like, oh, my God, I found this thing.
*  Yeah, I found a thing that just works.
*  It just fits into my DNA.
*  It just it just makes sense.
*  That's the same with me.
*  And I never, ever thought that my career would get as big as it did ever.
*  And we're talking about divorce.
*  I was talking about how you've been fucked over.
*  And I said, if I could just go back in time when you were broken, I said, Ron, in the year 2020, you will have been fucked out of millions of dollars in divorce.
*  Yeah.
*  And you'd be like, well, fuck, man, how much did I make?
*  How did I get all that money?
*  Where did it come from?
*  Do I have any left after this?
*  How am I doing?
*  So, yeah, and it was it was two women and and all together with lawyers and all in for 10, probably 10 million bucks and.
*  And after tax money, you know, that's 20 million in real world dollars.
*  It's something like that.
*  Well, you know, if you're if you're making dollars at the box office, you know, you're you're really only making a little bit of money.
*  You're really only putting about 28 cents out of every dollar in a bank account that you could spend.
*  And you got a big chunk going to taxes and managers and agents and travel and all that stuff.
*  And you're trying to have fun and trying to have a good time.
*  Hey, you're not squirreling money away for divorce.
*  Well, it turns out it was.
*  I thought it was retirement.
*  But now it turns out, you know, I really I really believe that I'm retired.
*  I believe I'm done.
*  Really?
*  You done with stand up?
*  I think so.
*  Listen, man, we're going to open up a club here in Austin.
*  Oh, I'll do that.
*  I'm going to drag you in.
*  You're going to crush.
*  You're going to get that feeling down to your toes.
*  That tingle.
*  I haven't even thought about a set in a half a year.
*  You know, they they tapped on my bus and the parking lot of a venue in Springfield, Illinois.
*  And the parking lot was half full.
*  You know, I'd flown out from L.A., got on my tour bus in St.
*  Louis.
*  My crew's with me.
*  The crowd showing up.
*  They knock on the door and said it's over.
*  The government just the governor just pulled the plug on this date and they plugged it on the next date.
*  And I'm like, fuck, there's not going to be any shows till May, I bet.
*  And boy, was I wrong.
*  It's right now.
*  We're in September.
*  Yes, it is September.
*  And there's no shows in sight.
*  Well, you can go some places.
*  Houston's doing shows.
*  San Antonio's doing shows.
*  Nashville's doing shows.
*  Kansas City's doing shows.
*  A lot of places like, fuck it, let's roll.
*  Let's just do it.
*  Yeah.
*  But, you know, the Zanies in Nashville, Hughley fucking collapsed on stage there and he had covid.
*  And the guy that ran the club got covid from him.
*  He got it from Hughley.
*  Yeah, from Hughley.
*  Well, he got it.
*  So we're assuming it's from maybe maybe he gave it to him.
*  Yeah, what could have gone the other way except for Hughley collapsed and then he came up positive three days later.
*  Whoever Hughley's road manager is, props to that guy because he saw it coming and caught him.
*  Yeah, right.
*  So that guy's on the floor.
*  Because if he hits the floor, man, he's got brain damage, right?
*  You fall from that.
*  You fall from a sitting position.
*  And that's a kind of a high stage too.
*  And you've been there, right?
*  Yeah.
*  And my manager would find out about it on the Internet the next day.
*  He wouldn't not only would he not catch me, he wouldn't even know where I was.
*  You know, but it was a weird one, right?
*  Did you watch the video of him deal like his words got all jumbled together like they didn't make sense.
*  Yeah, no, I didn't see it.
*  And then it was it was very strange.
*  Like in the crowd was like, what?
*  What the fuck did he just say?
*  Oh, is that it?
*  What are you doing, Jim?
*  So we got a lot of fucking technical glitches.
*  We're working out the gremlins here at the new studio.
*  Jamie's going to show it to us.
*  He'll show it to us.
*  We'll get it.
*  We'll figure it out.
*  But it was a weird moment where he he just paused and then it just started collapsing.
*  His manager caught him right in time and then just dragged him off the stage.
*  I'd like to see the footage of that.
*  Yeah, we would we would, you know, I play golf when I'm there at the same course.
*  Here it is.
*  We'll see.
*  I can't hear it.
*  I can't.
*  I got to work on.
*  I'm sorry.
*  See, he catches him.
*  Look at this.
*  Right.
*  Oh, it still bounced his head, though.
*  It wasn't a great catch.
*  No, it wasn't the best catch.
*  I like that little gray goatee thing going on.
*  Yeah, if I like it so much, I grew one.
*  I play golf with him, him and Cedric and George Lopez a few months ago.
*  That must have been a fun outing.
*  I was standing at this Baccar Resort up in Santa Barbara and I just looked across the bar and it was Hugley and Cedric sitting there.
*  And I'm like, who is that?
*  I recognize these guys.
*  And I went over and started I just heard him order tequila.
*  And I was like, oh, this is kindred spirits over here.
*  I'm going to upgrade their order because they sold my tequila at that place.
*  And so I sent him over some tequila and I'm like.
*  And they threw a fit over me.
*  You're Ron White.
*  I'd worked with Cedric.
*  He'd middle for me on the road and I knew he was going to be a star then.
*  I was like, they're stopping this guy.
*  He's got so much talent and energy.
*  And so it turns out Lopez was coming up to play golf with him the next day.
*  So we hooked up, made it a foursome, killed a bottle of a number one extra in Yeho on the course.
*  We passed it around on the 18th to polish it off.
*  And what a hoot.
*  What a glorious day that was.
*  Just laughter and fun.
*  I'm sure golf is awesome.
*  It's just that's a lot of time.
*  That's a time.
*  You don't have time for it, buddy.
*  I don't have time for it.
*  You ain't got time for it.
*  I don't know how you do what you do.
*  Three shows a day or two, three of these a day.
*  And then I don't do three a day anymore.
*  Well, the last time I did your show, I was the third one that day.
*  And you're like, yeah, I'm going to go do my abs.
*  And then I got five sets tonight.
*  I'm like, Jesus Christ, I'm going to go to bed.
*  I was drunk, stoned.
*  I'm like, you're going to do what?
*  I'm going to do my abs and I'm going to head on over.
*  Last podcast we did, we got a little lit.
*  Yeah.
*  We got crazy.
*  Yeah, early.
*  So I'm fucking tequila.
*  You come bringing your own tequila.
*  What's a man supposed to do?
*  Right.
*  You got to drink it.
*  You got to drink it.
*  So you were saying you're just in the tequila business now.
*  You're basically not even in the comedy business anymore.
*  You know, I actually told somebody in a conversation that I used to be a comedian.
*  I say, so they said, what do you do?
*  I used to be a comic.
*  And then I kind of caught myself.
*  I'm like, well, because I believe if you want to be a comedian, all you have to do is go be a comedian.
*  But you have to do that.
*  Right.
*  You have to go to it.
*  You have to go do shows and all those things.
*  And that I just don't do anymore.
*  When you call someone a comic, like how long do they have to have done it?
*  Oh, you know, before I recognize it, a while, you know, you know, I think you start that.
*  I'd say five, five years.
*  Yeah. Before you start to even start to understand the relationship between you and all those people out there, it's a it's a long process.
*  I think I caught it.
*  I caught on to doing stand up really quickly.
*  So when I had four minutes, I could kill for four minutes and then I could kill for five minutes.
*  So I always kind of understood how to generate the power, you know, even from pretty early on.
*  But I still only had five minutes.
*  I think the worst thing that can happen to a young comic now is they come out and win some contest and all of a sudden they're headlining.
*  But, you know, they won with 10 minutes of material.
*  And then what do you do?
*  That's a tough spot to be in.
*  Yeah, it's horrible.
*  Charlie Murphy was famous and then he started doing stand up.
*  So he was doing stand up as a famous person, famous for being funny on The Chappelle Show.
*  Right.
*  That took balls.
*  Yeah, it did.
*  And I was around Charlie during those days and it was crazy.
*  I mean, he just was learning stand up in front of sold out crowds.
*  Yeah, that's scary.
*  But I never thought any of this, even though I was standing right next to Foxworthy when he exploded into one of the biggest comics that ever lived.
*  I never thought it would happen to me.
*  You know, I just didn't.
*  And I was OK with it.
*  You know, I like to be in a club headliner.
*  And I was I was still making, you know, as much money as my friends or more as a club headliner.
*  And I wasn't paying my taxes, which made it seem like I made even more money.
*  Right.
*  So I'm picking up tabs and shit.
*  Right.
*  But I never saw a big, you know, big, big success ever come in my way.
*  And it just did.
*  I think the most the most fun you have is when you're just making enough money to not worry about money.
*  Everything else gets it gets complicated.
*  Yeah.
*  Things get complicated when they can take 10 million from you in a divorce.
*  Right.
*  That is well, you know what?
*  That's the thing.
*  I remember when after Blue Collar came out and all of a sudden when the DVD came out, all of a sudden I could sell out any venue in the country.
*  In two minutes, literally, and the money was coming in and I was so joyous because I didn't see what else was coming behind it.
*  Right.
*  I just saw all this.
*  I'm making money hand over fist over hand over fist.
*  And I'd wake up in the morning, glad to be me.
*  You know, having to wake up going, yeah, this is great.
*  I could go online and look, I'm a millionaire.
*  I'm a book.
*  I'm a millionaire.
*  This is the most fantastic thing ever.
*  But I didn't see what was coming, you know, just as far as all the, you know, I'm basically an idiot and and I'm a fool in his money and you don't want to walk away from that without a big pile of it.
*  And, you know, it it and I'm kind of getting to a place in my life where now I'm like, all right, I'm OK.
*  I'm OK.
*  I still I still got it.
*  I mean, I still have the finances to retire comfortably.
*  I mean, not actually I was my girlfriend lives on a main channel over on Oxnard to Marina and we were talking about getting a boat.
*  So I called my friend who's an offshore boat racer, a billionaire.
*  And and I said, I just want you know, he knows a lot about boats.
*  He'd give maybe give us some direction on what kind of boat would be great.
*  And so he started asking me right away on the phone call.
*  He said, how's the career going?
*  What's going on in your life?
*  I said, it's over, man.
*  I don't have any dates.
*  I have nothing on the books.
*  I don't know when it's coming back.
*  And I talked to my financial people and said, let's figure that I'm never going to make another dime.
*  What can I keep?
*  What can I what do I sell?
*  And I said, I got to get rid of the plane and probably the bus.
*  And he goes, well, at least you don't have a boat.
*  I was like, that was my next question, man.
*  I was going to sell the boat to get a bus.
*  I sold the bus to get a boat.
*  Do you but if everything comes back, like if if they develop a vaccine, if we reach herd immunity, if people start touring again, you'll be out there.
*  Come on, man.
*  I don't know.
*  Come on, man.
*  I don't know what's left.
*  I'll bring you out there.
*  I'll just bring you out for a guest set.
*  Bring you out for a little guest.
*  I'll give you a little taste.
*  You know, I feel the roar of the crowd.
*  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Ron White.
*  Yeah, that'd be nice.
*  I you know, I could tell because I always worked really hard.
*  Right.
*  And I've not worked really hard, but I always did a lot of shows.
*  Right.
*  Toured all the time.
*  And if I took 10 days off, I could feel it in my big set.
*  You know, just that information is not floating as close to the top as I'd like for it to be.
*  And then by the next set, it was a little better.
*  But third set, I'm fine.
*  And I haven't done a set, thought about a set, looked at a set list, watched a tape in a half a year.
*  And I don't know what I've I don't know how long it would even take to get it back.
*  Or if it or if I could just walk back into it.
*  I walk right back into it.
*  I did Houston Improv Cub, I guess, about a month and a half, two months ago now.
*  And I listened to a bunch of sets and I did the whole weekend and the first I listened to like three or four recordings,
*  made notes, wrote down all my stuff.
*  I forgot a couple of things, forgot the way the order a few taglines.
*  But I walked out just having a great time.
*  I had a great time.
*  First show was a little odd, like, wow, can't believe I'm doing stand up again.
*  By the second show was a show.
*  By the third show, I was back.
*  OK, but it was just because I listened to all the recordings.
*  I took a lot of time.
*  I really went over it.
*  What venue? What size venue were you?
*  Small place, the improv.
*  OK.
*  You know, I mean, I think it seats 500.
*  And I think they were at 75 percent capacity.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Not really.
*  Why are there no empty chairs?
*  It's pretty packed.
*  Oh, we took the chairs we didn't need outside.
*  But it was a good time.
*  It was it was fun.
*  But then I started thinking, man, what if I got it and gave it to somebody?
*  That's my worry.
*  I give it to some person that has a compromised immune system.
*  Right.
*  Well, that's what you know, I was telling you that my girlfriend and I was going to move.
*  This I bought a new car for out in L.A.
*  and I wanted to move the car that was out there out here.
*  So we decided to just drive it.
*  So we stopped in Vegas and stayed at the Bellagio when I've always worked at the Mirage.
*  And I found out that outside the Mirage, I'm nobody, even with the MGM Grand folks.
*  And so it was kind of just, you know, a week before we got there, people were going,
*  who's got the keys to this thing?
*  How do you turn those lights on?
*  We fired those people.
*  We had to get them back because we don't know how to do this.
*  Yeah. Those casinos had basically shut down for months at a time and they were load everybody.
*  And those are monster complicated properties.
*  And then we went to we did some gambling.
*  We ate some decent food and no shows or anything.
*  And we were there for three days and it was great play golf.
*  And but we just stayed to ourselves and we won some money playing blackjack
*  and went and spent it immediately on caviar and champagne.
*  And I'm like, look what we want.
*  This is great.
*  And we went to Sedona and Sedona as you've been to Sedona, Arizona, just like hippie land.
*  Yeah, it's all crystal. It's great.
*  It's just beautiful. It is beautiful.
*  Oh, it's like stunning.
*  I mean, every direction you look, why is it attracts so many flaky people?
*  They say it's because of some kind of a vibe that it has energy or whatever.
*  And we're staying in this, you know, it's kind of a five star resort.
*  And it was down on this river with these little cabins and this beautiful river wolf, whatever,
*  Oak Creek or whatever it is, and cuts through these huge canyons.
*  And and you could take these Adirondack chairs and put them in the river
*  and just sit in this beautiful, clear running river with it and just sit out there and relax.
*  And let the world go by and breathe.
*  And it was really, really nice.
*  And I told Jeannie, I said, you know what we could do?
*  Because we had our we were made kind of last minute reservations.
*  So we had the littlest cabin furthest from the river.
*  But there was a little house right on the river.
*  I don't know what they charged for it, but it was cool as shit.
*  And I said, you know what we could do?
*  We would pool our money and just rent this place.
*  And we'll just live here until we're broke, until it's all over.
*  The money is gone. We've run up a tab.
*  We can't pay it. We just I'll tell them there's money coming.
*  We've already spent millions here.
*  And then when the cops are wading into the river to drag us out and throw us off the property,
*  we'll shoot ourselves and just float dead.
*  And she was like, what? I'm not saying we have to.
*  I'm just saying. And then I kind of OK, we'll see.
*  OK, we'll surrender heroin and whatever.
*  You know, she next it.
*  Yeah, she takes don't like those romantic ideas.
*  Yeah. So then we went to Santa Fe and then Austin.
*  And then I had my tour bus pick us up in Austin and took us up to Nashville.
*  And then to see my mother in Cocoa Beach, Florida.
*  And so we had covid tests before we got to Mother's House to make sure even though we'd been being very,
*  very safe that I couldn't bear the thought of.
*  Yeah. Often my mom and.
*  Yeah. That's the big fear.
*  That's the big fear. The big fear is giving it to somebody who can't handle it.
*  Right. Right. It's it's a weird one, man.
*  I mean, this society has changed in such a radical way over the last six months.
*  It's almost like if you.
*  Well, I know someone who actually did get hit by a car right right before George Floyd died.
*  And had brain damage and came out of a coma like while the riots were going on,
*  like literally didn't know what was going on and has brain damage.
*  And he's trying to put it all together like you ever see the movie 28 Days Later.
*  Yeah. Awesome zombie movie.
*  But the guy wakes up in the middle of a coma from a coma and the world's changed.
*  He woke up and there a virus that swept through the land.
*  Some virus that they created for chimpanzees called rage.
*  And it escaped from a lab and started infecting people and turned them into these wild zombie creatures.
*  Right. But, you know, it's almost like that.
*  This person that I know woke up from this from getting hit by a car, flown through the air, landed on their head, got all fucked up in a coma for 10 days,
*  hospitalized and then coming out of it, watching the news going, what the fuck is happening?
*  Right. Cops cars on fire.
*  Streets are burning.
*  People wearing masks.
*  Everyone's wearing a mask.
*  And not wearing masks.
*  I was so protective of my mom, but she wants to get out.
*  She wants to go to the grocery store.
*  She wants to go, you know, but she's just been locked up.
*  So she she she also cooks for me.
*  You know, she my mother loves to cook for me.
*  And and it was almost like Breaking Bad when they chained that guy to the meth lab.
*  That's what my mother looked like in the kitchen.
*  You know, fried chicken and fried shrimp and gumbo and all the things I love.
*  But we went to the store and, you know, she likes to, you know, she doesn't walk that stable.
*  But so she likes to walk with a, you know, with his cart.
*  And so we went and there were people not wearing masks.
*  And I just wanted to fucking cuss them out, you know, and, you know, so that that.
*  So they get to walk around with no mask.
*  I got to keep my mother in a storage facility, you know, so she doesn't catch this disease.
*  And so I'd like for everybody to catch on with the mask thing, you know, and just let's let's get through this.
*  Yeah, I think most people have caught on with it now.
*  Don't you think most people are wearing masks?
*  It's pretty rare that people aren't wearing masks, especially around old folks.
*  It's become, I think, a little bit better.
*  And we're, you know, we're getting some better numbers right now.
*  So that's good. Yeah.
*  That's I hope you taking your vitamin D. No.
*  OK, you got to take vitamin D. It's very important.
*  There's an article that was just published recently that I put on my Twitter page that I don't read your Twitter page.
*  But you don't have to. But I'll send you the things directly that are important.
*  All right. But this was talking about vitamin C and people that get covid and wind up in the ICU and vitamin vitamin D rather.
*  Vitamin D seems to be the biggest factor that people.
*  One of the things Dr. Rhonda Patrick talked about on the podcast, too, is that more than 80 percent of the people in the ICU are deficient in vitamin D.
*  And only 4 percent had sufficient levels of vitamin D.
*  The vitamin D has a significant impact on your immune system.
*  And most people don't get it.
*  You probably get a good amount because you're out in the sun golfing a lot, but probably not quite enough.
*  You should almost always supplement.
*  Yeah, my you know, my doctor said something.
*  I just had all my tests done the other day and and he said that you need to boost your vitamin D.
*  That's what he said. Everybody does.
*  Humans aren't supposed to live in this little fucking red spaceship.
*  We're supposed to be outside in the world.
*  Yeah. I mean, this is how we evolved.
*  We evolved to be outside all the time.
*  We didn't evolve to be indoor creatures.
*  So our bodies are designed to absorb vitamin D from the sun.
*  I mean, that's that's how we create vitamin D in our body.
*  Right. And I think you're right.
*  I do. I do spend an awful lot of time outside.
*  So that but you know, I need to get on a program.
*  That's for sure. You know, are you willing?
*  I'll put you on a program. I'm willing.
*  I'm willing to be on a program. Yeah.
*  Now, do you take a dump ton of vitamins?
*  I take a lot of shit.
*  Even though the end you believe it's all good.
*  Yeah, I feel great. You have more energy than anybody I know.
*  Do you sleep at all? I do.
*  That's one of the reasons why I have energy. I sleep a lot.
*  A little amount of sleep for me is six hours.
*  That's a little amount.
*  Like that's like, oh, I got to catch up a good night.
*  I'm sleeping eight, maybe even nine.
*  Yeah, I sleep. I sleep good.
*  It's important. Yeah, I think man, it's everything.
*  That's you know, that's that's what I want from you.
*  You know, I'd love to have Joe Rogan energy instead of Ron White energy,
*  which is, man, let's take a nap.
*  That's that's tequila, son.
*  Oh, now that's that's salvation.
*  That's poor some of that salvation.
*  All right. I can open.
*  I was going to I was going to make this deal that for sure I didn't drink for the first hour.
*  I think we're about 40 minutes. OK, that's close.
*  Yeah. Close.
*  Close. 30 minutes because 28.
*  You made yourself a deal that's hilarious.
*  Yeah. See, if you drink this every day, you're not going to have a lot of energy,
*  but you will have an interesting energy while you're drinking it.
*  You know, it's a trade off.
*  It's a stimulant. And I know I've told you that before.
*  Instead of a depressant. Cheers, Joe Rogan. Cheers, my brother.
*  Congratulations to both of us. Thank you. For everything. For everything.
*  Whoo. God damn, Ron White.
*  Well, you got to actually smell it. Yeah.
*  I'm stalking your bar at your house, so I brought a bottle of tequila.
*  So some good ideas with this stuff.
*  This stuff will bring me to strange places.
*  It will. For sure.
*  I was also going to bring some shrooms, but I decided not to.
*  Are you still micro dosing?
*  You know, it did it stop working?
*  No, it didn't stop working.
*  The guy was getting it from went to prison and so for mushrooms.
*  I don't know. What are the odds?
*  Yeah, right. I don't know.
*  I think that's exactly what happened.
*  Who the fuck is putting someone in jail for mushrooms?
*  That guy should go to jail. Yeah, it's you know,
*  he was a door guy in a club and.
*  But he was really doing it because, you know,
*  he knew a lot of vets that had PTSD and they were feeling like hallucinogens
*  were, you know, making a connection for some of these guys and.
*  Particularly micro dosing. Yeah, micro dosing.
*  That's what and that's what I was doing, unless there was a connection.
*  That's what I was doing, unless there was a concert to go to.
*  And then I was maxo dosing.
*  Well, I ran into you at the green room at the comedy store and you're like,
*  I found this thing that's fucking amazing.
*  I'm just micro dosing. Yeah, I guess I'm on medication.
*  But it's a little sparkle in your day.
*  And so, you know, I still described it as wonderful.
*  I go, how are you feeling? It's wonderful. It's wonderful.
*  Take the drugs and go to the concert.
*  I'm just having fun, you know, get my lazy ass.
*  But the micro dosing is like it's just enough to feel it.
*  Right. It's just like you just just enough to feel it.
*  You just just enough to take the edge off of life.
*  Yes. But you're very there. Very coherent.
*  Yeah. Even more probably.
*  Yeah. Well, they say you see things better.
*  There was studies done on visual acuity.
*  One of these psychedelic researchers, they did these things with people.
*  And they were able to detect movement quicker than people without it.
*  Like, so they have two lines, two parallel lines.
*  And when one of the lines would diverge off of parallel,
*  the people that are mushrooms could recognize it much quicker
*  than the people not on mushrooms.
*  Yeah. Yeah. One of my earliest mushroom experiences, maybe the first,
*  we had we had heard about it.
*  Of course, I was in Houston.
*  So mushrooms were at the end of every street because it's all developed
*  ranch land the further you go.
*  And at the end of it, there's a pasture and that's full of mushrooms.
*  Right. I had no idea.
*  They had value anywhere because they were just so readily available.
*  And when we I boiled some up and me and Joe Payne and and we drank them.
*  But we didn't know how long it took for it to hit.
*  And then Joe had to leave and I'm sitting there and my dad comes home.
*  I was standing with him and and I feel these mushrooms coming on a little bit.
*  And then there was this horrible wreck in Houston where this big truck
*  with some kind of gas flipped on one of those big overpasses.
*  And they had cameras out there.
*  And I started laughing so hard.
*  It was the funniest thing I ever seen.
*  And and I couldn't stop myself from laughing at it.
*  And it wasn't funny at all.
*  And but it just the laughter was in my dad.
*  I remember him just looking at me going, what's wrong with him?
*  And so I left and I was driving my car and I noticed that I could see an eye
*  of a bird that was 50 yards away while I was running into the back of another car.
*  So I can't really I can't really verify that everything but the bird's eye was
*  looking at and then all of a sudden cut tank and not very hard.
*  But it was definitely a wreck.
*  Yeah, it makes you see things makes you hear things makes you hear.
*  Yeah, speaking of here.
*  Hmm. Comes and goes.
*  Well, some gremlins spaceship noises.
*  We're working out a spaceship.
*  They look in place here.
*  Yeah, we're working this place out.
*  I'm trying to figure it out.
*  I like it, though.
*  I think it's you know, whenever you're in a new spot, you got to get accustomed to it.
*  Still feels weird.
*  Like we did one with Adam Curry.
*  It just felt weird.
*  It feels weird to be here.
*  Yeah, I'm already used to it.
*  Yeah, I'm used to I'm used to Austin.
*  Tell you that I got used to it quick.
*  I'm settled in.
*  I love it.
*  Like it a lot.
*  I love the less people.
*  I love how friendly everybody is.
*  There's a lot of good things about this place.
*  I love the barbecue.
*  I had diarrhea for four days in a row.
*  Couldn't stop.
*  Really? I was eating his fucking barbecue.
*  I had like a piece of lettuce in four days.
*  It's all ribs, ribs and sauce like Jesus.
*  Where are they coming from?
*  Where you got to go to place or you?
*  Oh, man, I was going everywhere.
*  I found this hole in the wall.
*  A bee cave barbecue.
*  Holy shit.
*  It's like a trailer like this little trailer that you pull up to fucking phenomenal.
*  You know, they're all born out of this nominal.
*  This you know, these are all sorts, you know, early German settlements through New Bromwells.
*  And they just understood smokehouses.
*  That's where it all came from.
*  Wow.
*  It all came from Germany.
*  Yeah.
*  No kidding.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Well, I know there's a lot of German folks that live in Fredericksburg, right?
*  Like out there.
*  Oh, and New Bromwells and what's south in New Bromwells?
*  Where does your aunt live?
*  They live in New Bromwells.
*  What's?
*  But anyway, that's where that was all German settlements.
*  We used to go camping.
*  We'd go to the Guadalupe River, which is a fun, fun thing to do.
*  And we stayed at a campground called the lazy L and L and it that which used to be a farm for this German family.
*  And the guy that owned it figured out he could turn it into a campground and make easy easier money.
*  So he did.
*  He was about 90 years old and he smelled horrible.
*  Just really stunk.
*  Always always wearing the same clothes.
*  Oh, those guys.
*  No more pussy.
*  Fuck it.
*  Fuck showers.
*  Right.
*  Fuck showers.
*  But he told me he wanted to show me something.
*  So their old barns were there and stuff.
*  And he took me over and he showed me a plow that had a seed on it.
*  And he said that when he saw that he said that he thought everything that could be invented had been invented.
*  Now you're sitting on a plow.
*  Are you fucking kidding me?
*  Living the good life.
*  Living the goddamn the horses dragging you and the plow.
*  You're all good.
*  And you're not doing anything.
*  Your boots aren't getting muddy.
*  No, you're above it.
*  You're good.
*  You're above it.
*  Granted through life.
*  Living that silver star life.
*  That's a it's a weird thing that the immigrants came out here learning how to smoke meat like German smoked meat and smoked sausages.
*  And they somehow or another morphed that into barbecue.
*  It was everybody that worked for that one of those people.
*  They went and started their own place because they learned how to do it and just kind of spread from that.
*  And you can't have bad barbecue here.
*  You will not survive.
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  You will not survive.
*  I found that out.
*  You cannot make any money selling shitty barbecue in the Texas Hill country.
*  You cannot.
*  No, it's not happening.
*  Everything's good.
*  Yeah.
*  The real worry, like I was saying, is that people like me will come here and fuck it up.
*  How could you fuck?
*  I'm not going to fuck it up.
*  I'm going to find nice Texas people and say, tell me how to vote.
*  I'll vote for your way.
*  I want to keep your thing going.
*  Whatever you did to get this, I want to keep this going.
*  Yeah, nothing to do with politics.
*  It didn't.
*  But politics could fuck it up, though.
*  Not the barbecue.
*  No, not the barbecue.
*  But they could fuck up some of the aspects of this place, like the freedom parts.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  The thing about having a place like this is you got to kind of let people do.
*  Like one of the things that I love about Texas is the fact that it's so wild that you could do a lot of shit here.
*  You could do crazy.
*  Like I looked at a ranch and I said, what if I wanted to put a comedy club on this ranch?
*  Is there any rules?
*  They go, no, no, go ahead.
*  They were like, God, I go, what about a shooting range?
*  Oh, yeah, of course.
*  Fine.
*  Yeah, bring it.
*  Like do whatever the fuck you want.
*  Put a fence around, shoot every animal you have.
*  Yeah.
*  Like they don't care.
*  It's freedom.
*  It is.
*  It is.
*  It's freedom.
*  Yeah.
*  I enjoy, you know, I'm socially pretty liberal, but physically pretty conservative.
*  Yeah, me too.
*  And so I, you know, I just lean that way.
*  And so I hope that Texas, you know, leans that way, too.
*  I don't know that it ever will, but, you know, I love the freedom of Texas and I love calling myself a Texan.
*  You know, it was a sovereign nation at one time.
*  We could fly our flag as high as the U.S. flag.
*  No other state can because they weren't a sovereign nation.
*  That's true.
*  You could fly the Texas flag.
*  It's the only flag.
*  Yep.
*  Yep.
*  Do you know why this place is so crazy?
*  Do you know the whole history?
*  Why it's so different than anywhere else?
*  Why Austin or Texas?
*  It's just Texas in general.
*  Because it was its own country.
*  Because the Comanches.
*  The Comanches.
*  It's really what it is.
*  OK.
*  All right.
*  Let's hear it, Joe.
*  They had a fight off the Comanches.
*  The Comanches.
*  They were mean.
*  Were the baddest motherfuckers in the plains.
*  And they literally ran the western part of this country.
*  They were the most savage.
*  They all they ate was meat.
*  They lived off of like buffalo meat, basically.
*  They learned how to ride horseback better than any other Indians.
*  They learned how and they call themselves Indians.
*  This is a thing like Native American versus Indian.
*  I've talked to them.
*  They prefer the term Indian.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know if that applies to all of them.
*  But the ones that I've talked to when I've been trying to educate myself about this shit.
*  They said we we prefer the term Indians.
*  But didn't the American people or the settlers called them Indians?
*  Yeah.
*  They thought we were in.
*  They were in India.
*  The original people in the 1400s thought they were in India.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if I have a reason it's stuck.
*  But the Comanches, they were when the the Texas Rangers were the first guys to figure out how to beat the Comanches.
*  So Mexico was allowing people to move in to Texas and Oklahoma back in the day when the settlers are like, go ahead, my friend, go ahead.
*  It's free.
*  And they were basically using settlers as a buffer for the Comanches because everybody who moved into these places and built houses just got slaughtered.
*  Right.
*  When the Texas Rangers figured out Mexico until when?
*  Yes. Until what year?
*  I don't remember what year.
*  But they figured out the Texas Rangers were the first guys who figured out how to fight the Comanche.
*  And what they did is they basically fought like them.
*  The early settlers used to get off of their horses to shoot.
*  So they'd get off their horses with a fucking musket and the Comanches would run on them and they could shoot five, six arrows in six seconds from horseback.
*  So they would just boom, boom, boom, filling them up with arrows.
*  And these poor bastards had the musket with the stick and the powder and they got fucked.
*  So Colt figured out how to make a revolver.
*  And the first revolver was made like somewhere in like the 1840s.
*  And one of the very first people that used the revolver was the Texas Rangers was Jack Hayes.
*  Jack Hayes was the original Texas Ranger.
*  And this bad motherfucker figured out how to live like a Comanche, fight off a horseback.
*  Ninety nine percent sure that's his name.
*  Jack Hayes. Google that record.
*  But we have we actually made a large photo of this dude that's going to hang in the front lobby.
*  Oh, cool. Yeah, there he is.
*  John Hayes. Well, they call him Jack, too, right?
*  Isn't that weird that Jack is a nickname for John F. Kennedy is Jack Kennedy.
*  That doesn't make any sense. How the fuck did that happen?
*  Jack Hayes. Yeah.
*  John Covign, Jack Hayes, was an American military officer.
*  So that dude, he's there's a large metal photo that's being made of him.
*  He's the reason why Texas exists, because these motherfuckers figured out how to fight the Comanches.
*  They figured out how to do it and partly because of Colt and because of the revolver.
*  And the revolver was basically this all comes from a book that's an amazing book that I read called Empire, the Summer Moon by this this guy, Sam Gwynn, S.G. Gwynn.
*  And it's all about the Comanches and how difficult it was for the settlers to make it across Texas.
*  So Texas became this fiercely independent place, partially in part because of their battles with the Comanches who ran through Austin is there.
*  You can find Comanche arrowheads in Austin still to this day. I have friends who've found them here.
*  Right. I have friends that look for them all the time.
*  They go.
*  In fact, Foxworth is one of them.
*  He goes on these arrowhead searches all over the place and where they find them for the most is those buffalo jumps.
*  You know, those places where the Comanche would force Buffalo off cliffs.
*  I didn't even know that.
*  This is how wild it is.
*  They would force so many of them off of cliffs that they would rot in a pile because they couldn't eat all of them.
*  They would rot in a pile and there would be so much bacteria and rot that they would spontaneously combust.
*  So most of these Buffalo jumps, like when you would find at the bottom of it, they'd be charred like charred cliffside because the piles of Buffalo would would literally burst and burst into flames.
*  How do you know all this stuff, Joe?
*  I smoke a lot of weed.
*  I smoke weed and I get into things. That's why I can't play golf.
*  I know. You don't have time for golf.
*  Well, I can't play golf because I'd get obsessed.
*  Yeah, you would.
*  That's the problem.
*  That's the problem.
*  And you get really good at it like jujitsu or whatever it is, you know, and I would get obsessed.
*  Yeah, I know I would.
*  Tony Hinchcliffe is obsessed now.
*  That poor bastard.
*  He's hooked.
*  He plays golf every day.
*  He sends me pictures.
*  I know he's telling me I just played golf with or just had a conversation with a guy named Pete that we all know.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And he had just played golf that morning with Hinchcliffe and he said he's he's horrible, but he's so into it that it doesn't even matter.
*  That's how he is with pool.
*  Hinchcliffe is horrible at a lot of things that he's really into.
*  Yeah, I think he's really funny, though.
*  He's a ballsy comic.
*  Oh, he's one of the best up and coming comics in America.
*  I think so, too.
*  He came with me to Houston when we did that gig.
*  Oh, did he?
*  Yeah. Yeah. He's fucking hilarious.
*  He's talking about moving to Austin.
*  He's gonna. I'm dragging him on here on white.
*  He said there's going to be no place to do stand up.
*  And I'm like, no, there is.
*  There is Joe's going to open a club, man.
*  I'm going to open up a club 100 percent.
*  That's the plan.
*  There's a long term plan.
*  There's a ranch and a club in those long term plans.
*  And the club's going to be on the ranch.
*  I don't know yet.
*  I haven't decided yet.
*  Oh, no.
*  You got to have a club where people can go to it.
*  Yeah, yeah, they get in a car and go to the ranch.
*  No, no.
*  I don't know if you're wrong.
*  You might be wrong.
*  I could not be wrong about this.
*  You might be wrong.
*  Location, location, location.
*  I don't know about that.
*  Not barbecue and comedy.
*  Yeah, not just barbecue and comedy.
*  I mean, like outdoor festivals.
*  I want to put in an amphitheater and do charity concerts.
*  Oh, wow. Like legitimately.
*  Yeah, I think it all can be done.
*  Promoted on the podcast.
*  But you just have it for good for goodwill.
*  All the money goes to charity.
*  I forget about your platform and how many people it reaches.
*  I know the first time I did your podcast, I had no idea how big it was.
*  You just asked me to come do it.
*  And I was driving down there going, I can't believe I said I would do this.
*  I had no idea.
*  And then I fucking hit a curb while I was pulling in and busted a tire.
*  I'm like, God damn it.
*  And then it turns out it was the biggest thing I've ever done in my career was your podcast.
*  More people saw that than anything.
*  And I got more people coming up to me.
*  I saw you on Rogue. I saw you on Rogue. I'm sorry on Rogue.
*  And I'm like, God damn, how many people are watching this fucking thing?
*  I remember you grab it at the comic store afterward.
*  I had no fucking idea.
*  No idea. No idea.
*  Nobody told me.
*  You know, you didn't tell me.
*  You just, I just knew you had a podcast.
*  And it turned out, you know, it turned out to be a hell of a gig.
*  Well, the thing is it seems like it's not, right?
*  Because it's just you and me here hanging out.
*  You know, it seems like it's, it seems, seems like it's just us.
*  Yeah, right.
*  This is how we would do if we were the back bar of the comic store.
*  Exactly the same thing.
*  And that's why when I watch it, you know, I watched one the other day with you and Whitney Cummings and...
*  Annie Letterman.
*  Yeah, and that was really good.
*  Those girls were awesome.
*  Those girls were awesome.
*  Oh, they were so funny.
*  Those girls are so funny.
*  Did I tell you about, about Whitney's pig?
*  Yes.
*  She drove it all the way to Texas to a fucking pig sanctuary.
*  And I met it.
*  Did you meet it?
*  Yeah.
*  You got pictures?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  To the pig sanctuary.
*  So what happened was we were going to do, I was talking to Jay McRobb and we were thinking about doing...
*  Jay's moving down here.
*  Jay's moving down here.
*  I know, you know, I don't believe it.
*  You already bought a house.
*  Oh, he didn't tell me that.
*  Yeah, he got a house on Travis.
*  Oh, no, he did tell me that.
*  On Travis, right.
*  Oh, shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Ron White, we're bringing them all out here.
*  Right.
*  Come on out.
*  Come on.
*  Bang the drums.
*  Put up the bad signal.
*  Yeah.
*  I told somebody the other day that, they said, why is, why is Rogan moving out here?
*  And I said, well, because I moved out here and he started crying.
*  What am I going to do without Ron White?
*  And I'm like, just come on out here, Joe, and it'll be great.
*  Well, you did say that.
*  You did say that.
*  And I wiped a tear from your eye with a little tissue and then you just...
*  You use that bandana, you have wrapped around your neck.
*  Right.
*  Just to dry your tears and tell you there's hope for your future, Joe.
*  But you were talking about it in glowing terms and that's not a small part of why I'm here.
*  There's several people that talked about it in such glowing terms.
*  And when the looting hit, that was the big wake up call for me.
*  I was like, OK, I see what's going on here.
*  You know, I either can have, you know, armed guards everywhere, which I already had, you know, at the studio.
*  Or, you know, but it felt weird.
*  It felt un... LA feels unmanageable.
*  It feels like it's out of control and that Garcetti guy's not handling it well.
*  No, I don't think so.
*  No, it's a fucking disaster.
*  And there's more tents now than I've ever seen in any REI convention.
*  Everywhere you go, everyone's camping.
*  You know, it's like the streets are filled with people that got evicted from their houses or lost their jobs or don't have any money for anything.
*  And it's just it's just way too many folks, way too many folks and not enough people work.
*  And it just seems dangerous.
*  Right. Well, it's the climate so good that if I was going to be, you know, if I had no home, I would want to live in Southern California and be homeless there.
*  The guys who haven't made it is those mobile home dudes that drive around those shitty mobile houses.
*  Right. Because I mean, basically you park it and there's your house.
*  I mean, you got a roof, you got until they make you move, then you move and park it there.
*  Yeah. But I mean, they're not even making people move that much anymore.
*  After covid everything.
*  After this whole George Floyd thing and the attacks on the police officers like this very few things they're enforcing that they used to enforce.
*  They used to kick the where our old studio was.
*  They used to kick them off the streets.
*  They used to not let them park in the street.
*  Now they're all over the streets.
*  You'll go down one of the side streets in the valley and you'll see 15 on the Van Nuys area.
*  You'll see like 15 of them in a row, 20 in a row.
*  There's basically villages of people that are living out of their mobile homes.
*  And most of them, they barely can drive.
*  You know, there's a lot of them.
*  Right. All fucked up.
*  We thought someone was shooting in front of our house.
*  We thought guns were going out in front of the studio rather.
*  And the security guys go out there and it's just one of those guys trying to start up his truck.
*  It was backfiring.
*  Bang, bang, bang.
*  I mean, really loud.
*  Like we were like, oh shit, it's going down right out front.
*  No, just a dude trying to move.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. I figure when I needed to felt like I needed to hire an armed guard to protect my home there, which turned out, you know, wouldn't probably didn't.
*  Yeah, probably didn't matter.
*  But I was that worried about it, you know, just that I'm going to go ahead and put somebody up there, you know, and I felt kind of, you know, odd about doing that.
*  But because I figure if somebody paid me to guard their house, once people started coming at me, I would just find another job.
*  Right. I would move on down the road and do something else for a living.
*  You need more than one guy.
*  Right.
*  Well, there were actually two because my manager lives on that street, too.
*  So he had one and I had one and but they never got it.
*  You know, it's pretty high up there.
*  So they just never got that high.
*  You know, it was down in the flats.
*  There were some problems.
*  The thing is, once things start happening and you didn't start it, but you're doing it like you're like looting, like it takes a lot to get people to smash, get someone to smash a window, run into a store and steal things.
*  It takes a lot.
*  But once someone smashed the window and there's three people in there stealing things, it's not that hard to run in there.
*  Right.
*  That's what the problem with my mentality is.
*  Once things start happening, it seems normal.
*  They get this butt head momentum going and you can't fucking stop it.
*  It's very hard to stop.
*  And once the genies out of the bottle, like it is in L.A., when they when they lit those cop cars on fire and smash all those streets on Melrose and all the way down to Hollywood Boulevard and just robbed all those stores.
*  I was like, oh, you're not doing anything about this.
*  There's no no cops are stopping us.
*  You're going to let them.
*  The strategy was to let them burn themselves out.
*  Right.
*  Well, you've just set a precedent.
*  Right.
*  And it's going to take years to turn this fucking battleship around immunity.
*  Yeah.
*  Kind of what they were going for there.
*  Eventually, it'll all be OK.
*  Yeah.
*  I wish you know, I was shocked.
*  I've been I've been in a state of shock, you know, and somewhat depressed about the state of the nation, you know, and in the world that we live in.
*  And how what's the answer to all this?
*  You know, is there an answer to all this?
*  And and it has affected me emotionally and and and not just certainly not because of what's happened to me.
*  It's just my fear of what's happening to everybody else, because I know I'm OK.
*  Right.
*  And and I'm in a in a in a in a great a great position to weather the storm.
*  But that's one of the reasons why you're OK.
*  The people the real danger is when the economic situation deteriorates into a place where it's unmanageable.
*  And that's how it is for a lot of people.
*  A lot of those people that are looting and robbing stores like AOC said something ridiculous, like maybe those people just stealing some bread to feed their families.
*  Like, probably not.
*  But the reason why they're doing it is because they're broke.
*  That's there's no rich people out there looting.
*  No, you know, they're looting because they're desperate and because covid and the law.
*  Covid in the lockdown has put people into this unmanageable situation where they really don't have any light at the end of the tunnel.
*  They don't know what to do. That's dangerous.
*  And so that's where you realize how much economic prosperity is attached to a civilized society.
*  If everybody's doing well, everybody's fine.
*  But as soon as people aren't doing well, right, more is more danger.
*  There's more crime. There's more, you know, and I don't know how that turns around when all these businesses go under.
*  And then people have what are they going to start new businesses?
*  No, like how much?
*  Go out. I mean, just a number of restaurants that we lost in Austin that will never come back in small, but not just restaurants.
*  That's the one I feel because I go out to eat every meal.
*  But but I know that these mom and pop shops were not prepared for this in any way, shape or form.
*  And they hung on for a minute and they're gone.
*  Yeah. And and will they ever come back?
*  You know, but God, you know, you hope so.
*  Yeah. But you wonder how, you know, you wonder how.
*  Well, Austin, at least they're letting these people stay open with limited capacity and, you know, make people wear masks in L.A.
*  You can't do anything.
*  I mean, L.A. is the one place in the whole country where you can't open a beauty salon.
*  You can't. All these hairdressers and barbershops are fucked.
*  Right. They've been closed for six months.
*  You see that Nancy Pelosi shit? Did you see that?
*  That did.
*  How fucking crazy is that lady?
*  She she without a man without wearing a mask.
*  I mean, you want to talk about a hypocrite.
*  The fucking all the beauty salons are locked down.
*  She went into the beauty salon with no mask wandering around.
*  Got a blowout when no one else can even go to the beauty salon.
*  They caught her on security camera.
*  They uploaded it. And you know what she said?
*  It's a setup. She said it was a setup.
*  Right. Like they set her up like, you know, the fucker.
*  I don't even have any hair.
*  And I know you can't go to a beauty salon.
*  I mean, it doesn't apply to you, Joe.
*  Literally, literally doesn't apply to me at all.
*  And I know the fucking rules. She's a speaker of the house.
*  You're telling me you don't know the rules in your district in San Francisco.
*  You don't know the rules. Of course, you know the rules.
*  Of course you do. It's so slippery.
*  That lady handed Trump a giant gift. Oh, yeah.
*  It was almost like when when Hillary called the supporters a black basket of deplorables.
*  I'm like, you just handed a man that had a baton, a bat to hit you with.
*  And not a regular one.
*  When the ones with the barbed wire wrapped around it like a big old bloody weapon dead.
*  Yeah. The minute I heard that, I was like, oh, yeah, I thought you're supposed to be smart.
*  She's not smart. She's just a politician. She's just greasy.
*  They've just been doing it long enough so they know the moves to do in the right steps.
*  It's like, yeah, they're all gross.
*  There's no getting around it.
*  You can't you can't survive in that business if you're if you're not gross. Right.
*  You just that's how you get there. That's how you stay there.
*  And they they they they feed off of the fact that they have control.
*  They feed off of the fact they have power over other people.
*  They have more power than anyone else.
*  And that's one of the reasons why she would do something like that.
*  You tell me she can't get someone to come to her house and wear a mask and give her a blowout.
*  She's worth one hundred million dollars. Of course she can do that. Right.
*  But she's like, I'm going to walk right in there and they're going to do it for me.
*  I'm not going to wear a mask. Right.
*  I've never washed my own hair. She's going to stroll right in there like she owns the joint.
*  It's just like when you see politicians being hypocritical, like that lady in Chicago, the mayor of Chicago,
*  she's like, you know, talking up these people in these peaceful protests and everything's fine.
*  But then they tried protesting on her block.
*  She set up fucking armed guards. She said made a mandate.
*  You can't mandate. She just said you can't protest on her street. Right.
*  I have a right to protect my own safety.
*  Like, bitch, that's what everybody's trying to do. Right.
*  That's what we're in here. That's what we're doing.
*  But that's what people feel when they get into a position of power.
*  That's the problem with power.
*  That's the problem with whether it's Garcetti or Newsom or anybody dictating any of these rules.
*  When someone gets into a position of power, it's fucking intoxicating.
*  The ability to tell people you can't work. Right. Shut it down.
*  You know, start it up. Shut it down. It's intoxicating.
*  And once you have some power, boy, it's very difficult to give that power up.
*  I anticipate that even if they figure out a real cure for coronavirus, I anticipate lockdowns now for flu.
*  I think there's going to be lockdowns for all sorts of diseases that kill a certain amount of people.
*  You could you could you might be my might be wrong, but you could see it happening.
*  You could see it happening because they've set a precedent for them having the ability to dictate
*  whether or not people work and whether or not people are allowed to move freely and do whatever they want,
*  because that's what happens when people have power.
*  It's a fucking dangerous and toxic.
*  Yeah. Well, I believe you're right about that.
*  That it's a it's a it's dizzying how sexy power is and how sexy you feel when you have it.
*  But I don't think you know, I think we find a I think we find a vaccine and we move on or the aliens land.
*  I've been thinking the aliens are coming.
*  You know, I was talking to a buddy of mine the other day, another billionaire.
*  I got a few billionaire buddies and you move.
*  I don't really think I'm sucking up to them for a reason.
*  They'll tell you in advance what's about to happen.
*  Well, and well, well, this one, this guy, a particular guy is really, really, really smart.
*  And he has no doubt in his mind whatsoever that aliens are dancing among us.
*  And I think he's right. Pass me the little baby cigars.
*  Ron White. I love those things.
*  The white one or the dark one? Are there different colors?
*  Well, there's this one. Oh, that's not a cigar.
*  I know what the fuck that is. That's a CDB.
*  Oh, yeah, we were talking about earlier. Give me some of that light.
*  Yeah, sir. Yeah, I'm convinced.
*  I'm 100 percent convinced.
*  I used to be 60 percent.
*  And you're up to 100. Yeah, I talked to Commander Fravor, David Fravor.
*  At one time in my life, I could do 75 push ups and I'm down to three.
*  You can get back up to 75. I'll show you how.
*  All right. You got nothing else to do.
*  I've talked to people that have seen them.
*  I talked to this one guy who is a pilot in the Air Force and Navy, Navy pilot, I believe.
*  Commander Fravor is in the Navy.
*  And he encountered this thing that they call the Tic Tac UFO.
*  This is an object that they tracked on radar that went from 60,000 feet to one foot above sea level in less than a second.
*  They don't know how fast it did it because it was literally a blip in the radar. It went from 60,000 feet down to one.
*  They have no idea how fast it moved. They have no idea how it did it.
*  It shows no signs of propulsion. There's no heat, no exhaust signature.
*  There's nothing that has any indication that it's acting in any way like in any propulsion system that we've ever observed before.
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah.
*  John was telling me to watch a show called Close Encounters.
*  That's it, Jamie. Just nailed it. Whatever it was. You just found it.
*  You just did it.
*  Oh, it's back again.
*  There's a little folks, if you hear this little hum, there's a little strange audio hum that Jamie's trying to track down.
*  I think it's aliens.
*  We'll get this worked out.
*  Yeah.
*  We'll get it worked out.
*  I don't think anybody's going to care.
*  They might.
*  I don't think so.
*  So you, if I had to give you a percentage of whether or not aliens are real, what's the percentage for you?
*  81.3.
*  That's a good number.
*  Yeah, 81.3.
*  That's likely.
*  Yeah, likely. I mean, how could it not be?
*  Right.
*  How could it not be?
*  I really don't even, it was kind of odd that he and I were talking about it, but he has a really nice plane and he lives in Malibu in Austin.
*  And so every time he moves from one city to the other, it happens to fit my schedule exactly right.
*  So I'm like, that's weird.
*  I was going to Beverly Hills today.
*  How about I hop on the plane? Run.
*  I'm on it by myself.
*  Come on, let's go.
*  Nice.
*  So when he pops back down to Austin, he would just for a couple of days, you know, hop on.
*  And I really enjoy this guy's mind.
*  And I consider him a mentor in business and life.
*  I know who you're talking about.
*  John Paul DeGiorgio.
*  But he just started talking about it.
*  I hear nothing but good things about that guy.
*  God, he's the best.
*  I hear he's a fascinating dude.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You know, if he would do your podcast.
*  You think he'd do it?
*  I think he would.
*  I would love to have him on.
*  He you know, he's a guy that started selling shampoo out of the trunk of his car, you know, and and sold Patron I think last year for five point one billion dollars and still owns 60 60 other companies, including Paul Mitchell, which he started.
*  Here's the thing.
*  At what point do you stop working when you that never never he never wants to stop.
*  He never considers stopping.
*  I was so shocked when he sold Patron because I just didn't think he ever would, you know, because he doesn't need to sell it.
*  And but for whatever reason he did.
*  And and in fact, I said something that made him laugh really hard because he told me about it.
*  He called me and told me he saw I sold it to Bacardi for five point one billion.
*  And I said, well, that sounds like a lot of money, but it sounds like more money when you realize the point one is one hundred million dollars.
*  That's like the biggest point one there is.
*  Right. There is no point one trillion.
*  There doesn't even exist.
*  It's a point one billion is under a billion.
*  But he said that to watch him watch a show, which I never watched because I think he got an advanced copy of it, which was close encounters of the fifth kind is what it's called.
*  And I looked it up and it was coming on something, but it hadn't been on yet.
*  So I think he just got an advanced copy of it.
*  And he said that it'll it'll take every single doubt out of your mind that's ever been there.
*  Wait a minute. Isn't that the Stephen Greer movie?
*  I know that's Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
*  No, no, no. That's Steven Spielberg.
*  Oh, yeah. OK. Steven. Steven Greer is a guy we had on the podcast before.
*  Oh, that wrote the yeah, he's a no, he's a ufologist.
*  Air quotes. OK.
*  Sideways face, right. Skeptical hippo face. Right. Blink monocle.
*  Yeah. Hmm. There's a lot of fuckery in that UFO world.
*  There's a lot of people that are making documentaries and a lot of people that are there's a real good one, though, about Bob Lazar called Bob Lazar UFOs in Area 51.
*  I think that's exactly the title of it.
*  But it's by my friend Jeremy Corbell.
*  And it's about this guy was a physicist who worked at Area S4 in the Nevada desert.
*  Right.
*  Back engineering this craft that the government had recovered and immediately upon working there, realized like, what in the fuck is this?
*  Like right away knew that this was no technology that we had currently available.
*  I mean, this guy was a physical. He was a physicist, a nuclear physicist at Los Alamos Labs. Right.
*  Worked on weapon systems. Right. Yeah. And and got there and was like, what are you guys doing?
*  Like, what is this? And they were basically explaining like these are recovered UFOs.
*  And one of them, apparently, according to him, was very old and that it was from some sort of an archaeological dig they found.
*  And the propulsion system that these things used was that they use this element called element 115 that wasn't even proven to actually exist until I think it was 2013.
*  They proved that it exists in a particle collider.
*  But this guy was talking about in 1989 and he said that they had a stable supply.
*  Is that your phone that keeps doing that? I'm sorry.
*  Sorry. It's weird. Maybe that's the whole problem.
*  That's UFOs. The but this documentary is fascinating because the propulsion system that he's describing is exactly the same that Commander Fravor.
*  Had described in the Tick Tock UFO that they found off of.
*  You just got to shut it so it doesn't make noise. I just turned it off. Did you?
*  The. They do. I need. I'm irrelevant, dude. I'm not irrelevant.
*  No, no, no, no, no. Stop saying that.
*  Anyway, the the propulsion system that he described in 1989 is exactly the same propulsion system that they witnessed this Tick Tock UFO using in 2007 or whatever it was.
*  David Fravor had seen this thing off the coast of San Diego.
*  So what those people that saw these crafts that were monitoring them in the military, they were saying they see these like every few months.
*  They see these things. They don't know what the fuck they are.
*  They don't know what to do. They scramble jets to go watch them.
*  They actively block their tracking systems and then they disappear faster than you can look at it.
*  Just just take off. They have no idea what they are.
*  They don't know where they're from. They don't know what they're doing.
*  And then the Pentagon recently has come forth and released these statements and one of them being that they've recovered crafts that are not of this world.
*  86.6. I'm up to 86.6.
*  Pass that letter. My little cigarillo went out.
*  Oh, no, I dropped some dirty tobacco juice in this fucking thing.
*  I'm going to scoop that bad boy out of there. I'm going to keep drinking.
*  I'm in dude. I'm like 95%.
*  You're down from 100 and I'm up to 86.
*  That's I listen to my own bullshit.
*  I'm right. Stop. Stop.
*  You're about I'm going to drink this with the ashes.
*  I don't give a fuck. I got to turn my phone back on because I got to show you.
*  We got to show me the UFOs.
*  No, the pig, the pig.
*  Whitney Cummings Pig.
*  Whitney Cummings Pig.
*  I mean, I'm not there's no way you could possibly.
*  There it is right there.
*  Kapow. There it is.
*  Yeah, that's it. That's Whitney Cummings Pig.
*  So she was the first person explained to me that those miniature pigs are not real.
*  No, right. Yeah, that's proof right there. Right.
*  Yeah. How little is that pig?
*  Well, they think they're miniature pigs because they starve them.
*  So people buy this little tiny pig.
*  Oh, this is a miniature is a teacup pig.
*  Oh, great. Who wouldn't want that?
*  You know, yeah, you feed it right.
*  And it grows to be, you know, Alex Ramundo bought three of them.
*  And they they did.
*  And he lived up in Palmdale and he eventually they just got out.
*  And then every once in a while you'd see him.
*  Now they have tusks and they weigh 450 pounds and the other room.
*  So this place, do they recognize him?
*  Let's finish the story we were on.
*  Which story? The UFO part?
*  Yeah. Oh, well, go back into the pigs.
*  The Bob Lazar documentaries in Massey.
*  I'm directing. You should see it.
*  But no, direct away. I love you. Do whatever you want.
*  But the Bob Lazar documentaries in Massey.
*  If you're if you're curious and on the fence about UFOs.
*  And I had that guy in here. I talked to him.
*  He gave one of the first interviews that he's given in a long fucking time.
*  And I picked his brain for hours.
*  I'll go back and listen to it.
*  He didn't seem like a bullshit artist to me.
*  He there's there's some weird parts of it, but there's always going to be weird parts.
*  You're talking about literally back engineering something that someone from another planet invented
*  and using some technology that we don't understand.
*  And one of the analogies that he had was imagine if you brought a nuclear reactor to the 1400s
*  and introduced it to them, which 1400s is nothing 600 years ago.
*  Right. In terms of the age of the universe, it's a fucking not even a blink of an eye.
*  I think we could just go back to 1800s.
*  1800s show them a nuclear reactor.
*  Surprised about a nuclear.
*  Let's go to 1936. Yeah. Show them a nuclear reactor.
*  That was his his analogy. Yeah, I get it.
*  Like this technology is it is technology.
*  It's clear that they figured out how to manipulate this element and use it to to bend gravity.
*  And that's the propulsion system.
*  Instead of using something that pushes like a fire that pushes against the wind and pushes you in a certain direction
*  or propeller that pulls you into a certain direction.
*  Instead of that, it bends gravity.
*  And the way he described it's like if you put a massively heavy bowling ball in the center of a bed, right.
*  It just sunk everything into the bed.
*  That's basically like a very crude description of what this element does.
*  And with their this reactor that they have on these spaceships that it literally bends gravity around
*  and allows you to just instantaneously jettison that that ship into another position.
*  I'd say stop, Joe. I'm getting a bloodletting.
*  They're draining my blood into a bowl to cure something that I think I've got.
*  What did you say again?
*  Yeah, I think they've been here forever.
*  I think they've been coming down here and observing us and waiting.
*  And it also coincides with there's a giant jump in sightings right after the Manhattan Project.
*  Right. So right after we started blowing up bombs, they they're like, hey, hey, hey, these fucking monkeys.
*  They figured out some shit. Let's go visit them again.
*  They probably got a you know, probably got a newswire.
*  They probably got a Google News alert on their phones.
*  They're like, oh, Christ, look at these things.
*  Look at these crazy monkeys. What have they done?
*  What have they done? What have they done? OK, 91. I'm up to 91. What are you down to?
*  I'm down to 50 percent.
*  We're I'm worried about trying to pull you out of it.
*  I'm always worried about things that I want to believe.
*  If I want to believe it, I'm always skeptical. Right. Me too.
*  I don't want to fuck up your delicious tequila with ashes.
*  Let me refresh you there. Thank you.
*  Are you going to rent? I'm over here doing a little rinse.
*  I mean, this is the job I've been looking for.
*  Made service at the only reason why I don't believe 100 percent all the time is because I know I want to believe 100 percent.
*  So I think that I'm full of shit. Thank you, sir.
*  I'm worried about my own desire to believe. Right.
*  Because when you want to believe something, you can't. It's easier.
*  Yeah. You can convince yourself of shit that's not accurate.
*  It's tricky. Right. Like, you know, many things.
*  You know, I was wondering how Trump got evangelicals to support him.
*  And then I read the stories about Falwell Jr. and I'm like, it all makes sense now.
*  I don't see anything wrong with any of it.
*  And then he told that to the rest of the guys.
*  And then, oh, was I laughing so hard?
*  You know, my parents used to take me to see.
*  God, what's his name? Jimmy Swagger. Swagger.
*  Yes. Swagger. Remember when he got busted? Oh, yeah.
*  And I'm like, I am the straightest human being sexually in the world compared to these guys.
*  And I just but but but when this happened, I laughed so hard because I just started thinking about him.
*  Patent drop on his shoulder going, hey, you know what?
*  It's I get it. I get it. It's Liberty University. Right.
*  And one freedom. And I was I was just searching for all that information.
*  And then it got to the point where he admitted that his wife had to fare with the pool boy.
*  That's right. Out of a magazine.
*  That's not even true. You know, so but but it is true.
*  And he goes, but I wasn't there watching.
*  And I'm like, I already don't believe you.
*  I already don't believe you.
*  I already don't believe you.
*  If someone says my wife had an affair, but I wasn't there watching, I'm like, wait, what was that?
*  What the fuck just happened? What did you say?
*  You weren't there watching. OK.
*  I whatever I did not fuck that guy's pig.
*  I didn't do it. Why? Why? Why did you even bring it up?
*  What are you talking about, man? Where's that? Where's that from?
*  I already don't believe.
*  I think they're all freaks. Yeah.
*  I mean, all the evangelicals that make all that money, there's no way they just power.
*  Yeah. Power. Right.
*  They just stop at the money.
*  I used to do stand up comedy in the in the Sheraton Sankey Hotel in Clearwater, Florida, which is the same hotel where Jessica Hahn,
*  Jim Baker, in the presidential suite up there.
*  Oh, man. And, you know, and he was it's the same story.
*  Right. It's always the same story. And then Kinnison ended up fucking her.
*  Right. I remember it was around comes around.
*  But she was on.
*  Can is Kinnison and her were on Stern together.
*  I think she called in when Kinnison was there and she was calling them fucking loser.
*  He's like, you're a whore. Right. Yeah, I remember.
*  I remember it was so terrible.
*  But the fact that she went from being this lady who fucked this famous preacher to being like this quasi celebrity.
*  And this is before reality TV.
*  We've got to remember back in those days, there was only a few of those weird pseudo celebrities.
*  Right. So maybe the beginning of reality TV.
*  Yeah.
*  In a way. Yeah.
*  In a way that was the beginning.
*  Well, you know, Tammy Faye wouldn't blow on him.
*  Right. Probably not.
*  Not anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  She probably had to get to the dance.
*  Yes.
*  But but she lost.
*  Once she was in and she had the eyelashes.
*  Yeah. It kind of stunk one day and she got afraid of it.
*  Didn't she die from diet coke?
*  I think she's one of the people that they go, maybe she I think she drank a hundred diet cokes a day.
*  You're talking like a week ago.
*  I was into what is this?
*  It's like I hooked up with this girl.
*  What does it say?
*  Jerry Fowler Jr. allegedly caught on tape warning pool boy not to make wife jealous.
*  Why?
*  This is the one I thought you guys were talking about.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah. That that handsome fellow.
*  Yeah. Young boy.
*  Apparently he would watch the young fellow.
*  The young fellow would say that Jerry Jerry Jr.
*  Sit in the corner.
*  Yeah. And watch.
*  But imagine if you're the point in my life.
*  Well, I would have watched her fucking him if I was bored.
*  Yeah. You have to be real bored.
*  But well for that one.
*  Yeah. I mean, you have to be real bored.
*  Unless I mean, unless you're like, unless you are trying to really corrupt your wife, you're like, I know what I'm going to do.
*  I'm going to get some guy to fuck her in front of me.
*  And that bitch can't say shit.
*  Right now. And I could do all kinds of wild stuff like I watched the pool guy fuck you.
*  I was in the right. I was arms crossed.
*  I got pictures on my cell phone.
*  I was watching you suck his dick like this.
*  Hmm.
*  If you want.
*  I mean, if you really want to corrupt someone to the point where they got to leave you alone with all your deviance.
*  That would be one way to do it.
*  That's probably the best way.
*  If you're a woman, because like a woman cheating on a man for whatever reason seems more scandalous than a man cheating on a woman in general.
*  And then on top of that, I don't know why it seems more scandalous, but it does.
*  Easy Joe.
*  Because it seems like men cheating.
*  It's all dependent upon the person.
*  It's all on the individual.
*  But it's scandalous because it's more scandalous because the man's letting her.
*  Like there's more threesomes and I'm just pulling this number out of my hat.
*  But I think there's more threesomes that involved the wife or the girlfriend bringing in another woman.
*  Right.
*  Ever than a guy bringing in another guy.
*  Right. Right.
*  Like, hey, you know, I love my wife, but she wants she wants.
*  Hey, Bob, she wants you to fuck her.
*  So I'm going to watch.
*  That's probably way more rare.
*  Probably way, way, way, way more.
*  Because I have multiple friends that have had their their girlfriend or their wives bring home other gals.
*  It seems normal.
*  Now, I had a friend that I wouldn't be a friend, whatever.
*  But the first time I met him, I was playing golf with him and he showed me a video fucking tape of his wife getting banged by a really attractive, huge black guy.
*  And he didn't even know me.
*  And he goes, look at this.
*  He handed me the camera.
*  That's my wife.
*  My wife.
*  That's my wife.
*  And I'm like, that's my.
*  All right.
*  Well, can I get a check, please?
*  I'm going to have to go.
*  Yeah, that's a guy who's he's establishing some very loose boundaries.
*  Right. Very, very loose.
*  Very loose for himself, too.
*  But for your friendship.
*  Yeah. I think you go real weird with that guy.
*  He's already showing you video of his wife getting fucked.
*  I was thinking that he was trying to rope me into this.
*  But probably.
*  And and if I would have done it, then he would have gotten footage of that.
*  And then boom, he had liberties with me, too.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't know what I would have done.
*  Right. That's what I'm saying.
*  That's probably how they do it.
*  There's a lot of like sex is such a weird thing in terms of like what's acceptable to some folks is deviant to others.
*  And I think there's a lot of these people that are evangelical types in particular, especially that probably they can't hold that standard.
*  There's no way.
*  Right. Right.
*  That standard of piousness.
*  They're out there speaking God's word.
*  Right. Do it to thousands and thousands of people.
*  And it's a powerful position, which makes women horny.
*  You know, and then you start getting these little opportunities pop up.
*  They would have never popped up if you were down at the First Baptist Church of Oaxaca.
*  Right.
*  But then but now you're the first Baptist of the world.
*  Right. And it's probably kind of hot.
*  Right. A woman comes up, a real deeply Christian woman, Jerry Falwell Jr.
*  I just tell you, I am a woman of God, but there's something about you that brings a fire to my loins.
*  Next thing you know, next thing you know, you're doing coke.
*  Right. In a penthouse.
*  Yeah.
*  With a big old glass of red wine.
*  Pouring everywhere.
*  Oh baby.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh baby.
*  You're crushing up pills.
*  Yeah.
*  Come on.
*  Donald, listen.
*  Don't sweat that.
*  Donald Trump's my friend.
*  I'll call him right now.
*  And they were like, what?
*  No, Donald Trump?
*  Really?
*  Mar-a-Lago.
*  I got a gold card.
*  Look at that gold card.
*  Why else would you be a billionaire?
*  Why else?
*  Come on, man.
*  Don't you want to party?
*  Yeah, right.
*  You go at it.
*  The fuck are you doing?
*  You just want to be a billionaire?
*  Your bank account's full.
*  Your balls are empty.
*  What are you going to?
*  Exactly.
*  What is the point?
*  Am I in the way, Jamie?
*  Am I fucking up his camera?
*  We're, uh.
*  Turning real blue for a second.
*  Oh, it's the aliens.
*  I don't like this conversation.
*  What happens when you talk about aliens?
*  Or the televangelists.
*  Yeah.
*  It's, uh, it's as soon as someone is telling you, you know, like how to live your life
*  and people are listening, boy, that gets fucking crazy.
*  Right.
*  What you can and can't do what God wants.
*  Right.
*  Remember that, uh, Hicks bit about Jesse Helms and these, uh, how they go.
*  Maybe do something about, uh, that, uh, they were interviewing his wife after he died.
*  And she was talking about it.
*  Jesse's collection of little shoes and.
*  Oh, well, that's what's so fucked up.
*  You remember when you used to think that pedophile cults were just some ridiculous conspiracy
*  theory, you know, like, oh, hey, man, there's an island and they fly people out to the
*  down.
*  They fuck underage girls.
*  Like, yeah, that isn't really going on.
*  Jeff, I'm not going to do that.
*  I'm not going to do that.
*  I'm not going to do that.
*  I'm not going to do that.
*  I'm not going to do that.
*  I'm not going to do that.
*  I'm not going to do that.
*  I'm not going to do that.
*  It's really going on Jeff.
*  Get out of here with this nonsense.
*  Meanwhile, Clinton's like, well, he was my friend.
*  We flew a lot.
*  Let's get together.
*  It's not a big deal.
*  He's a good guy.
*  I played golf with him once and, uh, and he told me a joke.
*  It was, uh, or he set it up as a story.
*  So it was pretty good, you know, and he goes, it was a rapper friend that he knows.
*  And, uh, he was in a Maserati dealership and all thugged out and the guy goes, are you
*  thinking about buying one of these cars and he goes, no, I'm
*  going to buy one of those cars. I'm thinking about pussy. Yeah,
*  that's an old joke. Is it? Well, then it's an old joke.
*  Clinton's a hack. Yeah, I hadn't heard it. So, to me, it
*  was just Clinton telling me a pussy story with the word pussy
*  in it. So, I'm thinking about pussy. Alright. Yeah. It's
*  did you ever do impressions or did you just do that one? I
*  got a I got a few impressions. Yeah. Yeah, but he's one of my
*  favorite. I did. I had this bit that I was doing for a while.
*  I don't know if you ever saw it about I had a new Netflix show
*  called Ex Presidents High on Mushrooms and the the whole goal
*  of the show was just to get Clinton and that you don't want
*  to get Bush because he would just start crying. Alright. You
*  know, but but and Obama probably he knows how to do
*  mushrooms like he'll probably be cool with you like that
*  probably wouldn't even be that big a deal. Right. But but if
*  you can get Clinton high on mushrooms like just just get
*  that guy to trip balls. Right. He should have been a comic.
*  That's what I think. Should have been a sax player. You
*  know who should have been a comic that wiener guy. Oh yeah,
*  Anthony Wiener. Yes. That guy was a full blown dumb enough
*  right to become a comedian. This just said it is out to
*  everybody. He went to jail for sending his dick to underage
*  people though, right? Right. That's what he did but how do
*  you know how old that person is? You're sending that dick to
*  be careful. You can only hope. Be careful. He didn't know but
*  he's fucking perverts and deviants. You know, I see
*  perverts and deviants that are good speakers. I'm like, man,
*  you missed the open mic night. You sure did. You're fucked up.
*  You could have brought this to a bigger audience. You're in
*  the wrong business. You're in a business where you get
*  chastised and you you lose everything for being who you
*  are instead of like selling out stadiums, right? Instead of
*  people laughing, you fucked up, bro. So, you're an arena
*  comedian, right? I used to be for the great plague. No, but I
*  mean, that's the you know, the size of numbers you draw when
*  you decide to do stand up is their coliseums and shit like
*  that. Did you ever think that would happen in your life? I
*  don't think it's happening when it's happening. Oh, right. Like
*  when I'm you're able to ignore it when I'm getting
*  interested. Well, most of the time, I'm high, right? So, when
*  I'm getting introduced, there's a moment where I do not believe
*  it's real and that that that moment is always that's at
*  comedy clubs. That's at theaters and it's most certainly at
*  arenas. There's a moment where they're like, ladies and
*  gentlemen, please welcome Joe Rogan and you walk into a
*  theater in the round and there's 15000 people there.
*  Right. It just does not feel real. It does not feel real.
*  It never feels real but I know how to do it. Yeah, right. Go
*  out and do it like it feels real. What's up? I've earned
*  it. What's up? What's up? This makes sense. This is normal.
*  This is where I live. It doesn't make sense. I think when
*  it makes sense, I'm in trouble. When it doesn't when it doesn't
*  freak me out, you know, that's that's when I'm in trouble.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It it may be, you know, when we were doing Blue
*  Collar, I think the biggest one we did was a little over
*  20,000 at the place where they play hockey and in Nashville
*  and we'll always have the record or attendance there
*  because we had the smallest stage. Elton John used to hold
*  it but we had a smaller stage in the middle, right? So, we
*  could fill it up all the way around it and it was packed to
*  the rafters with these huge TVs. Right? Right. Wow. And and
*  then afterwards, we go back to the Lowe's Hotel and and
*  there's a guy there from a magazine doing interviews and
*  I was like, you know, I said some stupid **** and Foxworthy
*  was just regular humble, sweet Foxworthy, right? Who never
*  makes a mistake in those kind of ways because that's his
*  nature, right? He doesn't get drunk enough, right? Yeah, I do.
*  Right? I get plenty drunk to say the wrong **** thing and of
*  course, so there were just some really arrogant sounding
*  quotes out of that but but how what's my head supposed to feel
*  like after that? You know, after I just walk off stage of
*  with 20,000 people screaming like a like I'm a beetle or
*  whatever. It's crazy and how do I calm down from that? I don't
*  know how you do. I don't know. I've never figured it out. I
*  just I just shake my head and go, wow, is that real? That's
*  why those rock stars died at 27. You know, they didn't they
*  couldn't figure that out and it happened to them young. It
*  didn't happen to me till I was in my late 40s. Not only that,
*  it happened to them before it happened to anybody else before
*  them, right? There was no rock stars before the rock stars.
*  So, before the 50s and the 60s, there's nobody selling out
*  25,000 seats like of course Elvis died in the toilet,
*  right? Exactly. Filled with pills. Oh, the **** is he
*  supposed to manage this thing that no one's ever had to
*  manage before? No idea. There's no blueprint. There is none.
*  For us, we could look at, you know, Chris Rock and Richard
*  Pryor and Steve Martin and all these other big acts that came
*  before us and go, okay, how these guys handle it? Can I talk
*  to them? Could I could I sit down with Louis CK? Can I sit
*  down with Dave Chappelle? Will he tell me what it is like?
*  Yeah, what mistakes do you know? Yeah. What is it like when
*  you walk out there? It's it's set with booby traps and I
*  stepped in every one of them. I mean, it was like I was trying
*  to hit them all. I was like, clunk, clunk, clunk. Really?
*  Are they everywhere? I put a foot. It's fun when you do it
*  with other people. Chappelle and I did a bunch of gigs and
*  we were supposed to do a bunch more until the COVID hit but
*  um we we broke the record of the Tacoma Dome. It was 25,000
*  people. You just said that to be my number of 20,000. I just
*  had it in my pocket. Right. And he had like, oh, I got this.
*  I'm going to throw it on him. A DJ and you know, right. He's
*  like, the whole thing is so crazy. The lights are spinning
*  around and everything and there's there's a thing that
*  you feel like. First of all, you like and Dave said to me
*  right right before he went on stage like we're hanging out in
*  the back and he's like, not a lot of motherfuckers get to do
*  this, right? He was right, too. It was the way he said it.
*  Right. Like, man. Like, yeah. And Dave like me gets fucked up
*  before shows. Right. He's like uh I like hanging out with
*  other dudes to get really high before shows because there's
*  something about that wild ride. I akin it to I liken it to
*  skiing downhill when you're going too fast. Right. You know
*  you're in trouble but you can still do it. Yeah. You make it.
*  You land at the end. You're like, woo, that was dangerous
*  because I really didn't have control of that. At one point
*  in my comedy career, my goal was to be smoking a joint
*  outside that door, take a big hit, ladies and gentlemen,
*  Rod White, blow the hit out in their face. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.
*  At one point in time and then you did it so many times. It's
*  like, alright. Yeah, it's a fun way to do comedy. There's just
*  uh the the most fun thing about comedy is not just doing
*  comedy but doing comedy with other people that are also
*  enjoying doing comedy. That's right. That's why the fucking
*  store is so great. Right. I know. I know. That's why we have
*  to recreate that here, my friend. Well, you know, but
*  you're moving it out to a fucking ranch, dude. Do we all
*  get to live on the ranch? You want to? I'll set that up.
*  That'd be great. I will absolutely be interested in
*  that. Uh we we all move out to the ranch and I'll set up a
*  barbecue chunks of property on the ranch just for comics. How
*  about every comic every comic that's like a legit headliner
*  gets like a two acre plot of land on the ranch. You you got
*  a nice yard. You do whatever you want. Build a house for you.
*  Do we gotta come on? Do we gotta do? You don't have to fuck
*  anybody. But you gotta fuck my wife and I'm gonna film it.
*  Whoo. I gotta tell you, I just met her and I'm in.
*  Oh god, I had no idea. I mean, I figured she was but I'd never
*  seen a picture of her or anything. She's my favorite
*  person. She's so beautiful and what a nice lady. Got a cool
*  personality and yeah but yeah, you could watch. Sure.
*  I wouldn't I wouldn't care who saw that. Whoo. Bring in the
*  pool boy. Who's got the camera? Yeah II don't really wanna have
*  a cult on a ranch but um but I do think it would be fun to
*  have a comedy club out there. You know, there's this really
*  cool building. It's not too far from your house and it's uh you
*  know, you ever I wish I wish I knew the titles or some of the
*  stuff but it it was a cult and they built a theater right over
*  here right next to uh right next to Travis. You know what
*  they were? We went to see Monty Montgomery that night.
*  Didn't you go with us over there to play that theater? The
*  little 350. I should just explain to people that are just
*  listening. Sometimes he asks questions to his son Marshall
*  who's in the room. Right. So, it's like, what do you what
*  who your uncle like what are you saying? Right now, he's my
*  memory. There it is. Jamie's got it. One World Theater.
*  Yeah. Oh **** It's uh this guy was a cult figure and he built
*  this for him to dance. Oh, look at him. Look at the dude.
*  Right. Oh, look at him with no shirt on. Look at those abs.
*  Right. Oh my god. Of course, you had abs. So, this is over by
*  your house and it seats about 350 people. I did a show there
*  the other night. How many people? Look at there. It is
*  right there. 350. I think so. It doesn't look like 350 there
*  right there. That's perfect. Uh that's a perfect size for a
*  comedy club. Yeah, it is. Was that guy dead? Uh well, the
*  cult dissolved and now they do occasional shows in it and uh
*  is the guy still alive? Click on him, Jamie. I don't know.
*  Click on him down there though. The lower right hand corner,
*  the bottom picture. That's him. No, the one below it, below
*  it, below that, the one below that, below that right there.
*  That one. That's him. That's a cult guy. Yeah. Guarantee.
*  Yeah, there he is. Yeah, there's something on Netflix
*  that I watched. He just looks full of **** Yeah, doesn't he?
*  Doesn't he? There's like, there's a certain fake
*  spiritual look that's like one of my favorite looks. He looks
*  like he would **** anybody. Anybody. I always feel like with
*  fake spiritual women, they're just trying to find themselves.
*  I give them a free pass. Right. But fake spiritual dudes, I'm
*  like, you're just trying to **** I see what you're doing.
*  You're looking for an angle. You're just trying to get an
*  angle on some lost women. I know what you're doing, bro.
*  Yeah. Nice abs though, huh? Crazy abs. Guy must be watching
*  his diet. Yeah. Yeah. But anyway, that building is right
*  over by your house. Oh. And uh. Well, I don't want a cult
*  building. That seems like a terrible idea. I thought you
*  did. That's why you gave me this idea. You're the one bringing
*  up the kilt ship. I'm gonna do it the right way. This guy's an
*  **** Out on a ranch. Out on a ranch. The key to a successful cult is you have no
*  membership. Do whatever you want. You don't have to. You
*  leave whenever you want. You don't **** everybody's wife and
*  you don't take 10% of their money. That's the key. What's
*  the point? That's the thing. They're doing it all wrong.
*  Yeah. What's the point? There's no point. Alright, the point
*  is just stay slightly drunk and keep moving, right? That's
*  that's the point I would like to say.
*  You're doing it already. Yeah. Yeah. Micro dosing and
*  slightly drunk. Yeah, that should be the title of your
*  book. Have you ever written a book? Hmm. New York Times
*  bestseller. Oh **** wrong. Why? I have the right to remind
*  you. I was silent but I didn't have the ability was number
*  one. It tied for 15th place which makes you the number one
*  bestseller and for the rest of your life. That's amazing. You
*  can put it on your **** tombstone. That's pretty
*  amazing and basically it was just a they had asked me to do
*  it and I said no and and then they asked me again and said
*  for this much money. I said no, I don't have time. I'm not
*  gonna write a book. It's not what I do. I'm doing stand up
*  and I'm doing well because it was after everything was
*  clicking, right? And then they said, how about we just copy
*  a transcript of your show and put that in there and then you
*  just add a couple stories. I'm like, for how much and they
*  said this much and I said, yeah, alright, let's do that.
*  So, and it turned I had to go on a book tour which was a pain
*  in the **** and signed books but still it was a New York Times
*  bestseller. So, that's good. Congratulations. Yeah. I'm also
*  an honorary member of of a Harvard Lampound. Are you really?
*  Yeah. Alright. What else? Which was very cool. You're really
*  good at badminton or something like that? Uh I'm okay at
*  ping pong. I used to be good at ping pong but now it's tricky
*  man. Yeah, tricky. That's a that's a touch thing. You gotta
*  be you gotta have a ping pong table and you're ping pong all
*  the time but I was good at 160 pounds. I doubt it at two uh
*  two fifteen. I don't think I'm that good. I think I've lost
*  some of my twitch. I get it. It's hard on the knees too.
*  There's a lot like tennis. When I see people playing tennis,
*  I'm like, man, you only have so much meniscus. I know I did.
*  You know, that's Doctor Phil. You know, I play golf with
*  Doctor Phil but he plays tennis. That's his game and it
*  keeps his knees so **** It's a great game. I love playing it.
*  That's I'm out there. It's amazing how much he sounds like
*  Clinton but it's no, it's a little different. It's a
*  different. I know it's different but uh but he but that
*  tennis keeps his knees **** up and you know, he's six foot
*  four big guy and well, he tore his shoulder apart too.
*  What is this? Oh yeah, I've heard of that. It's it's they
*  have it in Venice Beach but like it's a thing that's pop.
*  It's tennis for old people but it's popular here in Austin.
*  So, you don't have to move as much. Yeah. Yeah. Look how
*  fast look at that fat guy. Yeah. Oh. Oh. He just hurt his
*  knee too. Look. Yeah. But see, once you play virtual reality
*  games, this is seems like a stupid waste of time. Wow. Out
*  there playing pickleball. You know, you you play like one of
*  them sandbox games. You ever go into a sandbox? You know what
*  that is? Yeah. It's a virtual reality studio where you go to
*  like a warehouse. They strap you up with a haptic suit so
*  you feel when you get hit and you put a helmet on. So, you're
*  in virtual reality. You wear gloves and you you play these
*  **** crazy games like all kinds of wild games like uh like
*  you're you're you're on a pirate ship and the the pirate ship
*  gets taken over by demons and skeletons are chasing after you.
*  You shoot muskets at the skeletons. They have one here
*  apparently. Yeah, they do. I've seen it. Okay. I think the
*  original one might have been in Austin. I believe so but I
*  played it in Woodland Hills out near the old the old studio.
*  It's a blast. Oh my god. It's **** awesome. It's so much fun.
*  It's so much fun and it makes you realize like you were
*  around when Pong came out. Remember when you had the
*  little turn? Yeah. Yeah. We thought everything that could
*  be invented had been invented. Yeah. So, this is uh this is
*  fast forward a little bit. I don't care about these people
*  signing up. I can't. Oh, you can't. Oh, okay. So, we don't
*  have all the glitches figured out. They go through this
*  thing. You put on this this thing on your foot and on your
*  hands and the suit and the head gear and then you go into
*  these rooms and you're transformed into this avatar and
*  you play these wild **** games and that was an awesome one.
*  The zombie one is awesome. You're in a house and the house
*  is overcome by zombies and they come falling out of the
*  ceiling and running towards you and you're gunning them down
*  but your weapon's good. Yeah. You can take them out. Yes.
*  Their heads explode. It's **** awesome. It's amazing. Yeah,
*  you're gunning them down and you watch their little zombie
*  bodies get riddled with bullets. It's amazing but it's
*  like when you were when we're talking about playing pong,
*  do do do do like when we were kids and we were first playing
*  that like this is incredible. I'm playing something that's
*  on the TV. That is what I look at when I look at these games
*  and I say, what is it going to be like in 50 years? What is
*  it going to be like 25 years? Five years. It's going to be
*  **** amazing. It's not going to be pickleball. Five months
*  right? I didn't get pickleball. Pickleball's on the way out the
*  **** door. Yeah. It's going to be awesome. It's going to be
*  spaceships and now you're going to be hanging out with Bob
*  Ozar because we played paintball. You know which
*  stings right? That's that actually hurts. Yeah, but but
*  it's also fun as **** but but this looks like this is another
*  version of that in air conditioning and that you you
*  don't have to feel the pain of that paintball hitting you in
*  the rib. They have one on one like sword fights. You fight
*  with each other with like modern like crazy weapons type
*  situations and like me, my my daughter killed me. She killed
*  me in a one on one combat with you. Didn't you? A little bit
*  right, but it was fun. They're fun games, man. You just
*  imagine what it's going to be like, you know, doing something
*  where you really can't distinguish like you're it's
*  fun. You're seeing it all. It's wild. The video is wild. You
*  feel it like your chest vibrates when you get hit. It's
*  pretty cool, but imagine what it's going to be like when you
*  can't distinguish it between this and reality and reality and
*  you get to **** the thing you're fighting. That's going
*  to happen for sure. That's next. Oh, that's coming the
*  moment they could figure out how to do that like with this
*  Elon Musk Neuralink where they're doing that the moment
*  they could figure out how to tap into your senses to make
*  you really feel like you're having sex with like, you know
*  Tara Patrick in her prime and I'm talking all right. Whoa
*  That's some super hot. What's up? You gotta watch that one
*  black mirror episode. We were going to watch it that one day
*  and I was like you should watch this at another time, but like
*  oh yeah, they set up this scenario where it is. It's two
*  guys playing virtual reality. One's a guy. One's a girl and
*  they **** each other and they end up realizing they can ****
*  each other and then like causes this whole **** chaos of
*  problems. They both have girlfriend or wives, whatever
*  the **** and they want to bang each other and they're like
*  who's going to be the girl though? Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy.
*  That would be the the real question, right? If you that's
*  the reason I want to go on living.
*  I want Bridget Bardot and me and uh Sophia Loren back in the
*  day in sixty-six. Yeah. Oh my god. Yeah. Back when Ferraris
*  had skinny tires. The old days, the old days, people didn't
*  know anything. What are you? What are you driving now? I got
*  a lot of cars. A lot of different stuff. How many? I
*  like that. You know, I got the I got the 56 Corvette. I should.
*  Oh yeah. If it would have been raining, I was going to drive
*  it up here so you can see it. Yeah. I have that one. That's
*  sixty-five. That's sixty-five is prettier than mine. Oh,
*  that's a crazy car, man. That that's the car that I drive
*  around where I can't believe it's mine. Yeah. I can't
*  believe that's really my car. Yeah. Yeah. When you bring that
*  up because because you know the the parking lot at the at the
*  comedy store is a **** show but it's a **** show between
*  ultra successful comedians who have great cars and guys that
*  haven't had a Netflix special yet but as soon as they do get
*  one, they get a car and right and then you got you know, it
*  was never like that. You know, like that place is filled with
*  like millions of dollars in cars now. At least it was before
*  the lockdown. Yeah, right. Well, the old days, it was half
*  the parking lot. You know, it was the the because you had
*  some really successful comics up there and there's some great
*  comics that hadn't hit it yet. Yeah. All doing shows but we
*  were there the other day. There was a Ferrari, three
*  Porsches, a Lamborghini. I was like, this is the craziest
*  parking lot I've ever seen. Like Russell Peters, Lamborghini
*  truck was there and I was like, this is madness. This this I
*  mean, it's when it was rocking, you know, I mean when I say
*  this like the old days but it was really only seven months
*  ago. Right. Seven months ago rocking every night. Fun as ****
*  It was we were in the golden years. I mean, it really was as
*  far as comedy goes. I've been there since 94. Never been
*  anything like it is now. Right. Because the internet. That's
*  because of your podcast and Marin's podcast and all the
*  people that feed it. Yeah. Are also working there every single
*  night of the week that they weren't touring and you know it
*  it bred a place to go have fun and and I think it all stems
*  from them. Their intrinsic nature was always to embrace
*  stand-up comedy and it didn't matter about your insanity. So
*  if you wanted to be crazy, come be crazy here at the at the
*  comedy store and smoke pot right here. You have our own bar
*  right here. Yeah. And you can snort cocaine off of this
*  piano shaped **** thing in the dressing room with the main
*  room. It's a mirror. A mirror. A little piano made out of
*  mirrors that was built for prior to do blow off of and
*  then many people followed in his footsteps and but they've
*  embraced that and it made it fun and it made the comics feel
*  important. You're right. Yeah. If you want to smoke pot at the
*  Improv, you have to go stand on Melrose Avenue and smoke it in
*  traffic because they don't give that. Yeah, they didn't care
*  like they did it. They didn't understand it the same way they
*  did at the comedy. The improv changed a little bit over the
*  years. Well, I got that new they have a new club up there
*  now, but I haven't been in it since it was finished. Yeah,
*  it's there's something about the store where they realize
*  that the comedians are why the people are there, right?
*  Whereas other clubs, that's why the the comics park right next
*  to the door and you park where the **** you can and because
*  you're going to get something that you didn't even pay for
*  when you walk in here. Yeah, you know you're going to you're
*  going to see Rogan and Cummings and and all the best comics in
*  the world. Joey Diaz just rocking the **** place. Diaz
*  moved to New Jersey. I talked to him about it, man. You know
*  he's one of the guys that that checks up on me. Yeah, you know
*  just to I get a call once a month or every month and a half
*  or whatever from Diaz. Just I tell you. How are you? Right?
*  Yeah, you got to just checking in on you and and you feel
*  like he's doing it because he gives a **** He does. You know,
*  he does and yeah, we were talking about it because I was
*  like come to Austin with us. You know, we're we're we gotta
*  this is what's happening. You know, if I had known about the
*  ranch and the two acres, I could have had a mule. Can we
*  get do we get a mule? I'll give you a mule. This is what's
*  going to happen. Joey Diaz is going to go through one New
*  Jersey winter. You gotta realize Joey's been out there
*  with us since 96. He doesn't know what winter is anymore.
*  He's going to go through one of those **** New Jersey winters
*  and then I'm going to call him up in April. I'm going to buy
*  Joe Diaz. A mule? Really? Joe Diaz is a Spotify money. He's
*  burning a hole in my pocket. Come on, man. Come on out here.
*  I'll sponsor you. Let's make something happen. I got a club
*  going on. I want you to do a residency. Let's get rolling.
*  Come out here. And he'll do it. Yeah, I hope so. I hope so.
*  Call him. I might have to fly out there. On a really bad day.
*  I might have to fly out there and bend the knee. I'll I'll
*  fly up there with you. We'll get them together. Okay, let's
*  do it. I'll do whatever I can do. I'm I'm accepting the fact
*  because there's no comedy right now. I'm accepting the fact
*  that he went to New Jersey but I'm only accepting it
*  temporarily. That's it's like a big like if you looked at my
*  brain like if my brain was a circle like a pie, there'd be
*  like a 15% sliver. Get Joey Diaz out of New Jersey. That's
*  like 15% of my 15%. It's in there, man. He's the listen. He
*  is. He's a big factor in all this and in the store and in my
*  career and in comedy and podcasting in general. He's a
*  big factor because he's the party like when when Joey Diaz
*  like and especially me and him together because he knows what
*  a fan I am of his right. So when I'm in the room with him,
*  he knows how much I love him and he can just be free. He can
*  be wild and he knows that I think he's the funniest guy
*  that's ever lived. So when he's rocking and rolling and I'm in
*  the room and I'm dying laughing, I'm the best audience
*  ever. Right. I love him. Yeah. I just he's just he's a such a
*  unique person. He's so he's so unique. I don't know anybody
*  like him. He's so wild and crazy and his stories are so
*  ridiculous. He's just such a crazy person but a good person
*  too. He's a really he's genuinely sweet. I mean, he
*  calls to check on me. Who would call to check on me? You
*  know, he does that to everybody. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I
*  assume he does. I mean, I assume he wouldn't just be
*  checking on me. He's amazing. He's amazing. I love him to
*  death. I just I he's got this thing. He came from Jersey. He
*  wants to go back to Jersey. That's good. Let me get that
*  out of your system. Do one winter there. I'm gonna I'm
*  gonna be I'm gonna fucking be I'm gonna take a picture on a
*  canoe like on Lady Bird Lake kicking back like a margarita
*  going Joey. What are you doing? You digging yourself out of
*  your fucking driveway? Come to Texas. Come to Texas, Joey. We
*  got a club. The most I can't do anything until I open up the
*  club and once I open up the club, then I'm gonna start
*  then I'm gonna start calling people but Tim Dillon, he's
*  gonna come out here. Hinchcliffe wants to move out
*  here. Red Ben wants to move out here. Yeah. We're gonna get a
*  bunch of them out here and once we have a club, then I mean,
*  it's we'll put up the bat signal and I'm just gonna my my
*  goal for a club is not to make any money. My goal is to
*  break even and have everybody paid well and just just just
*  just like let's establish community and let's do a thing
*  in in Austin like we were doing in LA where we're basically
*  just working on the art and and having an awesome place where
*  people can come to see great comics fuck around and work on
*  material and because of the podcasts and because of us
*  talking about on the podcast, I think they understood what the
*  store was for. They understood that it was our hub, right? It
*  was our our our home and that we all we come like with a guy
*  like you and a guy like me and you like we don't necessarily
*  work together. You know what you work at your places and
*  then I work at my places and the only time we get together is
*  at a club where we're working on material because you're
*  headlining in these big fucking places and I'm going off of
*  these other places and we need a place or that's like a hub
*  like a home base and that's what the store was for us but I
*  think this that's created because of comics, you know
*  that's the reason when I played the store or or the factory or
*  the improv when I played all of them or the or Pasadena
*  Ice House, I would never ever let anybody come with me not
*  whatever woman I was with not any friends that I had. I would
*  not let anybody go with me to those shows because I didn't
*  want to worry about him. I wanted to go there and be a part
*  of the comedy community and not to be bothered by anything
*  else. Let this be my time to recharge relax talk to people
*  who have chosen the same exact path I've chosen in life and
*  those are rare, but they're gathered right and we have
*  access to them and that's why I live so close to there. You know
*  I lived a mile and a half, I guess from if I didn't have
*  kids, I live right next door to that place right. Well, you
*  could have had another room, you know, you know, so the so
*  that and that's what was so precious and drawing, you know
*  to me about it is that I got to go talk stand-up comedy tell
*  jokes laugh so hard. I couldn't breathe and be around comics.
*  Yeah, just didn't and you know, I always kept it to myself.
*  You know, that was always my thing. Yeah, you know, not me
*  bringing people to see me or my manager. Fuck you dude. Don't
*  come see me at a big show when I'm not trying new shit, you
*  know. Yeah. Yeah, I know because if I'm eating it on
*  stage and and I have a friend in the audience, you know, they
*  feel horrible. I don't you know, it's not me that feels
*  bad. It's them and I feel bad for them feeling bad. I'm like
*  sorry, you know, fuck. I knew it. I knew it wasn't going to
*  work. I've had the same manager since I was an open mic. Wow.
*  Yeah, my manager found me in Boston in 1990.
*  I want to say in 91. Yeah, I was basically just just
*  scratching out a living like I would get a few paid gigs, but
*  I was basically a beginner, you know, I'd get paid gigs every
*  now and again, but I wasn't. Were you still shooting pool
*  for money? No, I started doing that after I tore my ACL. I
*  hurt my knee and I had to rehab my knee and I had to get knee
*  surgery and I was hanging out with my friend John and we
*  would go to this executive billiards in White Plains, New
*  York because I'd moved to New York to do stand-up because I
*  met my manager in Boston. He flew me out to New York and or
*  or brought me out to New York and I lived there for from
*  then on and I would go to this pool hall and I started seeing
*  there was a I got just stumbled into it just blind luck. It was
*  a pool hall where there's a lot of gambling like high stakes
*  game. I saw $10,000 pool games. Wow. How fun wild wild shit
*  people gambling and betting money and yelling and all the
*  everyone it was back in the day when you could smoke so like
*  the whole place is filled with smoke and it was like a
*  different kind of deviance that was real similar to the
*  deviance that I've experienced with comics and also the
*  deviance that I experienced with fighters because I had you
*  know, I grew up in in martial arts. I grew up around fighters
*  and they were a different kind of deviant.
*  And then then I'm around these pool hall deviance.
*  I mean, I realized there's there's there's a bunch of
*  different clusters of people that didn't accept the society
*  standards. They do like I don't want to live like that. I don't
*  want to do what these people are asking me to do. I want to
*  want to live in a in a free way. You know, I want to be
*  vagamons. I met a lot of homeless people that I became
*  friends with. You know, like I had homeless guys would sleep
*  on my couch in my apartment like guys who would just pool
*  hustlers. They would come. Oh, they didn't have anywhere to
*  stay. They would sleep underneath the tables at
*  Chelsea Billiards in New York because it was a 24 hour. So
*  when your manager found you, what were you doing? I was
*  driving limos. I had I had quit fighting by then and I had
*  quit even teaching because I was teaching at Boston
*  University. I had a taught a accredited class in Taekwondo
*  at Boston University and I that was that was that was when I
*  won the US Open. I had won a bunch of different like like
*  national and regional Taekwondo tournaments and I was basically
*  a Taekwondo instructor and fighting and I was trying to
*  make the Olympic team but along the way, I started kickboxing
*  and I realized that Taekwondo had all these **** holes in it
*  and then I realized that kickboxing was giving me brain
*  damage. So, sparring a lot and I was getting a lot of headaches
*  and I was like, I think I might be wrecking my brain and then I
*  quit doing stand up or I quit fighting rather and I started
*  doing stand up and I took on all these other jobs because I
*  didn't want to short. I didn't want to shortchange my students
*  so I stopped teaching because I wasn't in. I just wasn't into
*  it like I was before I was obsessed with stand up so I
*  quit my school. I quit teaching at BU II and I was
*  driving limos and I was working for a private investigator. I
*  was driving him around. He lost his license in the DUI to this
*  to this day, one of the funniest people I ever met Dynamite
*  Dickless Dave Dolan was one of the funniest **** dudes I ever
*  met in my life. That's what he called himself. He would call
*  me up. He'd go, Smoke and Joe. It's Dynamite Dickless Dave
*  Dolan. I mean, he remained my friend to the day he died. He
*  died a few years back of cancer, unfortunately, but he
*  remained my friend to the day. Well, actually, he had he had
*  a bunch of medical issues. He had a stroke. A lot of ****
*  went bad but great dude but remained friends with him to the
*  day he died but he was literally one of the funniest
*  people I ever met that never never did stand up and what's
*  funny is his cousin was Bill Downs who was one of the owners
*  of the comedy connection and so just randomly II **** took I
*  answered an ad. You know, we're talking about 1988. I answered
*  an ad in the newspaper. Someone's looking for an
*  assistant for a private investigator and I was like,
*  woo, that's a good job. I'm being assistant to a private
*  investigator. That sounds exciting but really he needed a
*  driver because he lost his license on a DUI. So, I was
*  driving Dynamite Dickless Dave Dolan around and we would catch
*  people mostly it's mostly insurance scams. Mostly people
*  that were you know like they were getting disability
*  insurance and they were still working on the side. We catch
*  him doing that but occasionally it was like some guy
*  wanting there was one one guy that day was falling around one
*  guy who's his he had this wife that just kept **** this
*  bodybuilder and he would David get pictures of this guy plowing
*  this girl and the guy was like, okay, we'll keep following her.
*  He's like, hey, you **** He goes, I gave you the pictures.
*  He goes, I'm I'm not **** He goes, this guy wants pictures.
*  He wants the pictures. He's asking me to keep following. I
*  got pictures of this guy **** your wife. We're done. We're
*  done buddy. You had to meet the guy. I mean, he was such a
*  Boston like an Irish Boston character and he was and he's a
*  private investigator. Never wanted to do anything else. He
*  loved it. Loved it. Loved catching people. Yeah. Yeah.
*  There was a guy at my golf club in Atlanta that was a private
*  investigator and and our our assistant pro ended up going to
*  work for him. This we had these two two two really big guys both
*  named was a Jason. They were the two Jasons and one of them
*  ended up being Colt Ford. Uh you know who that is? Colt Ford.
*  Yeah. Sounds like a character in a Tom Selleck movie. I know
*  it's uh he was a country rapper and uh and when he I'm I'm I'm
*  he's teaching me how to hit there is Colt Ford, right? Look
*  at him and he he looks like Ali Joe Prater. Yeah, he told me
*  that he was a great guy. We're hitting balls and uh he he had
*  a PGA Tour card for 8 years. He he's an amazing guy. Really?
*  Yeah. Damn. And uh he uh he and his show is fantastic and
*  people love it. He's got an affliction shirt on. Uh right.
*  There's a few pictures of me out there with those. Yeah. You
*  it's very unfortunate. Back of the day. But uh but I'm hitting
*  balls. He's working on my game and he goes, I'm really a rapper
*  and I'm like, check please. One of those other, I have a lot
*  of, can I get a check please in my life? And never really
*  spoke to him again on a serious level. But he, I was
*  gonna do the Tonight Show and uh and I knew that uh oh uh god
*  damn, I can't believe it. I can't think of his name. My my
*  brain's been just skipping so bad today. Um but anyway, the
*  guy who's on that show with uh one of the biggest rappers uh
*  Kid Rock. No, no, no, no. Black guy. Been around forever.
*  Run DMC. Cornrows. Old Dirty Bastard. No, fuck. Cornrows.
*  Been around. Jamie. I'm uh I'm looking. You follow Black
*  Twitter. Well, I'm trying to find it. I could uh I can. No,
*  more famous than you can even imagine. I can't remember.
*  Something like that. No, even more famous. I could uh find
*  the day you're on. I don't know. More famous than Lil Wayne?
*  Jesus. Yeah. Uh Kendrick Lamar? Snoop Dogg. Snoop Dogg. Oh,
*  right. Jesus Christ. You couldn't remember Snoop Dogg?
*  Fuck, I know. Holy fuck. You know what? I thought it was
*  like someone obscure. No, no, no. I told you it wasn't. I
*  said famous. More famous than you can imagine. Snoop Dogg.
*  Well, that's about as famous as you can imagine. So uh he he
*  gave me a CD and he said, could you just give this to
*  Snoop Dogg? And I was like, no. As I put it in my pocket and
*  I said, no, I didn't, of course. And uh but my wife at
*  the time, uh it was, she was uh 4.7 million uh wife.
*  Said, it's really good. She listened to it. I never did.
*  And I'm like, and the next time I see him, he's on the cover
*  of Pole Star Magazine. Whoa. And I'm like, really? And uh so
*  he would tour with these big country acts because he could
*  teach him how to play golf and the crowds loved his fucking
*  music. And then a lot of these guys started implementing
*  that in their songs and it was all because of him. Uh and uh
*  and then he wrote some huge hits for other artists that had
*  a rap country background to him. Well, he he created it and
*  I ended up making a lot of money and uh but he was the the
*  uh pro. Why was I telling you the story to begin with? Um
*  I'm not sure. Um golf? No, no, we had passed golf. There's
*  no way you could figure it out if I can't figure it out
*  because I was the one going there. Dynamite Dickless Dave
*  Dolan. No. Yeah, right. Uh private investigator. Private
*  investigator. Right. So, but it was the other Jason. Oh, it
*  was the private investigator. There were just two. So, okay.
*  But one of them ended up being a really, you know, really good
*  size country act that made a lot of money in publishing and
*  that was him and he was my assistant pro. He still plays
*  in the big leagues and all the uh Pebble Beach AT&T stuff
*  with uh with Larry the Caveman. That's pretty wild.
*  Someone would be that good. Yeah, no, he he was apparently.
*  I didn't give it a chance, you know, and even to this day,
*  I've never really. Golf is one of those games where you can
*  be like ranked number 20th and be a multi multi millionaire.
*  Oh yeah, ridiculous. Yeah. Just balling out of control and
*  most people don't even know who you are. Yeah, the Eastlake's
*  uh the guy that won today. So, the big uh the the guy that
*  wins this week that the the prize purse is 15 million.
*  Where's that at Eastlake in uh Atlanta, Georgia. Oh, okay.
*  I don't know. You're saying it like I know. Well, I'm saying
*  it like I'm just telling you, you know, I'm like, yeah,
*  Eastlake. Well, you know, okay. Well, I okay. I'll give you
*  that. You don't know. You don't know. I don't know anything.
*  I'm a professional sports commentator. That's one of my
*  side gigs and I don't even know the rules to most sports.
*  Yeah, that you know, that's the weird thing is that uh people
*  don't people just think of you as famous. I mean, my son was a
*  huge Fear Factor fan the first and you came back and did
*  Fear Factor. We were just talking about it and and uh but
*  a lot of people don't know you do the other thing, right?
*  The you know, the guy from the man, you know, the guy but
*  most people I would venture to say don't know you do stand up
*  more than they know you do other things. I just do so. Of
*  course, you're more famous. Yeah, right. It's hard. The
*  podcast is probably the most famous thing I'm for now. Of
*  course. Of course. Now, cuz it's gotten to this weird
*  place but yeah, it's uh I do a lot of **** but I tell people
*  they're like, is he is he good and like Rogan and as a comic
*  cuz I only see you as a comic. I don't see you as the voice of
*  him. Hey, I don't see you as anything but a comedian uh you
*  know because that's what I watch you do. You know, I'll
*  watch a fight, you know, and I love it if you're comedy. If
*  you're not, it's not that interesting and we were talking
*  about that earlier. You know, if if Rogan doesn't say it, it's
*  not worth saying, you know, didn't you get heard in MAA,
*  you know, MAA, mixed martial MMA. I don't know. It's I I
*  know what you're saying. I'm telling you, I just don't know
*  that much about it like you don't know much about golf. I
*  don't know anything about golf but all I know about Joe, the
*  comic I watch go on stage at the at the store and just ripped
*  a good out of these crowds and it's so much fun to watch that
*  I don't really think about the rest of it. Like I said when the
*  first time I did your podcast, I had no idea. Well, I I like
*  doing a lot of different things. I don't think I'd be the same
*  person if I I think I have a unique mental illness that I I
*  need to be constantly stimulated with different
*  challenging things and if I'm not, then I make problems for
*  myself. You know, then addictions and weirdness and
*  I'm the person that needs to I need to have challenges all the
*  time. I need to have puzzles and you have things to solve. I
*  need to have stuff to do. Yeah, that's my unique mental
*  illness like so when someone says like why do you do so
*  many things like because I like being happy. I like being
*  insane like if I if I don't I just figured it out over time
*  in my life that if I don't have things that challenge me like
*  if I don't get up early and work out if I don't do something
*  that's hard to do, I'm not the guy. I can't sit around and
*  see none of that **** bothers me. I can I can wake up with
*  nothing to do every day. That's why I've settled into this
*  retirement. I gotta tell you, I've not hated the last 6
*  months of my life when I had nothing to do at all. Not even
*  thinking. This is the first thing I had scheduled to do in
*  a half a year and I and I was a little resentful of it this
*  morning. It was raining and I'm like, I gotta go do something.
*  You know, I gotta go do something. That's the first
*  time I made a commitment. So, if I tell you, I'll do it. Of
*  course, I'll do it, right? I'll get there early. Uh days
*  ago. We're here. Yeah. Days early and uh. Oh, week. But uh
*  but but outside of that, I've enjoyed this time off but I'm
*  also older. You know, I'm I'm older and I've you know, uh uh
*  you know, I'm I'm at a retiring age, you know, that
*  that I've kind of settled into it going. This is not that
*  bad. My wife taught me how to go on vacations. I wasn't good
*  at it. Yeah. I need how I needed to learn how to just
*  accept the fact that I was just not gonna do anything and
*  just have fun and be on the beach and just drink and just
*  relax and just swim and do whatever the **** you do uh on
*  beaches. I I've gotten good at it now. Apparently, I'm better
*  at it than you. You know, let's go. I'm better at it now. I'm
*  a beginner. Yeah. I used to think of it as like I see some
*  pictures of you and the gra out and uh out in a Cabo with no
*  shirts on going, what the **** going on here? Yeah. You know,
*  having fun. Yeah. Well, you know, I learned I learned how
*  to relax. You get sometimes you you think you I used to think
*  that if I took time off, I was losing progress. This is how
*  psycho I am. Yeah. I'm like I'm losing. I'm losing. I'm gonna
*  get I'm gonna get out of shape. My my martial arts is gonna
*  slip. My comedy is gonna slip. I'm I'm all the I'm not gonna
*  be doing podcast. That's gonna slip. I had this sickness that
*  way. Then I realized that as a healthy person, the happier and
*  the healthier I am as a person, the better I am and all those
*  other things. So, the more time I'm hanging out and just
*  having fun, if I can do that and just recharge, then when I
*  come back, I'm better. So, every time I've come back from a
*  vacation, I've been more enthusiastic. When I'm more
*  enthusiastic, I'm always better at at everything I do because
*  there's more there's more positive energy, more
*  appreciation, you know, right? That's that's how I look at it.
*  So, I haven't I haven't hated this time off. I don't like
*  what's going on in the country. I hate what's going on with the
*  country. I I wish I missed the days and people could just
*  disagree. Yeah. I missed those days. Isn't that the truth?
*  I missed those days. We can all go privately into a voting
*  booth, vote for who we vote for and the next day, we wake up
*  and see who's president. Yeah. Exactly. And no fight was
*  necessary. We all did what we were put here to do which was
*  to to to go vote and and after that, you just accept it and
*  and go on. Change what you can if you can. If you can't, just
*  **** go on with it. I haven't hated it either. But also like
*  you, I'm probably a little further along in life that I'm
*  like, you know, I don't really feel like I did so much of it.
*  Maybe that was enough. Maybe it was. Well, you but if you're
*  gonna build the **** ranch and I get two acres and a mule and a
*  mule. I'm gonna give you four acres. Four acres and a mule
*  because I was on the mules. Alright, two mules, four acres.
*  You heard it. Write it down. Everybody write it down. Four
*  acres, two mules. Whatever you want. Whatever you want. We'll
*  make it happen. I want to plow with a seat on it. That's what
*  I want. I want to plow with a seat. That's what I want. The
*  idea is just to do something crazy and have fun and I've
*  already done that by moving out here and they're just packing
*  up. That was a bizarre move, dude. That was a bizarre move.
*  I like bizarre moves, right? Don't don't let don't let Joe
*  think you can't still surprise you, you know, I like doing
*  things you're not supposed to do. I like doing like I like
*  doing things like this like just **** pack up the whole
*  thing and doing it right when we're moving to Spotify, right?
*  So, it's a big crazy deal and then there's all this
*  controversy behind that. Looks like a tax dodge and uh it's a
*  little bit of that for sure. I don't I definitely don't like
*  paying that much in taxes. I can't uh I can't tell you how
*  surprised and thrilled I was to hear you were gonna move to
*  Austin and and uh and be my neighbor cuz I'm I'm out of uh
*  I'm out of LA. I'm selling the house and uh and uh Beverly
*  Hills and and I'm like, oh good. This is gonna work out
*  fine. We're gonna have fun out here, man. We can have a lot of
*  fun out here. I really think so. I like I like your vision of
*  the of the Austin comedy scene to come and you know what?
*  Also, a lot of really good stand up comics in Austin for
*  sure always have been uh they're they flourish and these
*  open mic nights and uh I know that they're listening to this
*  conversation right now going. I wanna help them. I wanna I wanna
*  get my five years in and get my acres and yeah. I just I
*  really do. I wanna help them. I wanna help them in the way I've
*  I've tried to help uh a lot of up and coming comics in LA and
*  get them on the podcast, promote them and the the idea is
*  if we open up a club when we open up a club, I should say is
*  to have these local guys come in, pump them up, let let
*  people know, let people know there's a real scene here.
*  They're there, you know. Yeah and and and help them and help
*  them help them flourish and help comic not just Austin
*  comics but everywhere, you know, bring them into this
*  place and have this be a hub. The only reason why LA is a
*  hub is because of A, the Comedy Store and B, Hollywood and I
*  came to Hollywood because I had a TV deal but really what I
*  wanted was to be at the store. That was Mecca to me. It is. I
*  had heard about it when I was in Boston but when I came to
*  the Comedy Store in 94 was a **** hole. I mean, the comics
*  are terrible. So, every now and then, Martin Lawrence would
*  show up or Damon Wayans or Dom Marrera or Dice Clay but for
*  the most part, it was a lot of boat acts. It was a disaster.
*  There's a lot of people that would just have old terrible
*  jokes and it was just. Right. I was like, this is the store.
*  It was very disappointing but the the place itself drew
*  people. It drew people there. You knew that that was the
*  place where the real comics went and they they made a career
*  out of it but the the this world is different now like for
*  a comic. If you get a television show, it's actually
*  like, oh, you poor bastard like you could have had a podcast
*  like you could have been okay. You could have been your own
*  boss, right? You could have. I mean, and now, a lot of comics
*  are realizing they don't even want ads anymore. They just
*  want to do Patreon. They want to just have have podcasts and
*  and put them out either for free and have you know, get
*  YouTube ads or there's a lot of people trying to figure out
*  what's the best way to be free but for sure, the best way to
*  be free is not to be connected to the Hollywood machine
*  because the Hollywood machine is all woke now and it's
*  completely ridiculous and everyone's full of **** and you
*  we're not actors, man. We're different things. Alright, you
*  know, it's cats and dogs living together. We're ****
*  different things. You know, we can act. We can do it. We both
*  have. Yeah. But the reality is you're a comic. I'm a stand-up
*  comedian. Yes. And and I am as well and there's a lot of us.
*  There's a lot of us and we don't need that machine. What
*  we need is a machine that we create ourselves and we did
*  that a lot. One of the reasons why the store works so well
*  over the last few years because it was fueled by podcasts.
*  Yeah. Fuelled by podcasts. And fueled by everybody like I
*  would tell people, hey, you gotta see this kid, Frank
*  Castillo. He's hilarious. Tony Hinchcliffe, this guy's coming
*  up. Joey Diaz, the funniest guy ever. Ron White's the baddest
*  motherfucker that ever lived. All these people and we would
*  all talk about these people and tell these crazy stories and
*  then everybody would remember and then they would come. Yeah.
*  We were they were they had international tourism to the
*  comedy store. People were flying in from Ireland and
*  Australia. And they should have been. And they should have
*  been. Right? Because that's how good those shows were. They
*  would come in on a Tuesday and see one of the craziest
*  lineups you've ever seen in your **** life. Yeah. When I
*  was in one, I mean, and you've got a million of these stories
*  and it was it was you and Louis CK and Bill Burr and. Madness.
*  Yeah. And and and me and it was just crazy. Joey Diaz.
*  Madness. Just **** crazy. Madness. In one show. From
*  fourteen **** dollars. That's madness. Do you know how much
*  it would cost to put on that show out at the ranch? Nothing.
*  Zero. Yeah. We're doing it for charity at the ranch. Charity.
*  Yeah. I I that's the the idea is to do something at the
*  ranch. We build a theater. We do the concerts for charity and
*  then have a club in town. Yeah. Oh. A satellite club. A lot
*  of these places on Sixth Street are gonna go under
*  unfortunately. Unfortunately, there's a lot of places that
*  are gonna go under because no one can work, you know, and I
*  would love it if they all stayed open but some of them
*  are not gonna be able to and so we'll scoop one of those up.
*  There's yeah, there's gonna be opportunities for you to put
*  something in this town that'll matter. Yeah. And let me make a
*  promise to you, my brother, I'll be there to support it,
*  you know. Even if I don't tour anymore, I'll I'll I'll come do
*  the club. Isn't this exciting talking about it? Really? You
*  know, **** it is. **** it is. Exciting, right? Yes. That's
*  why I'm here. I I like exciting things. All the things
*  I'm interested in are exciting. I like bow hunting. I
*  like stand up comedy. I like fighting. All these things are
*  exciting things. Right? I like exciting things and I think I
*  can do something here that's exciting. I like smoking pot and
*  watching cartoons and doing stand up. I like smoking pot
*  freaking out. That's what I like. I like getting nervous. I
*  do. My one of my favorite things about smoking pot is
*  being paranoid. Yeah. People the thing that people get
*  terrified of and they run away from. It's one of my favorite
*  parts of being high. I was I was nervous about coming and
*  doing this uh show today. Really? Yeah. Why? I've told
*  my son. I said, I don't know. I haven't felt nervous. I can
*  walk on stage at the Radio City Music Hall. You know, it
*  doesn't flutter my butt is what I do and I'm ready to do it
*  and I'm prepared to do it and I haven't even thought about
*  interacting with anybody for you half a **** year, you know
*  and uh so you know, it's your new place and you're in town
*  and but uh he goes, daddy's your friend. He'll pull you
*  right on through to the other side which of course, you know,
*  we did. We already we're already through the other side.
*  It's already 315. We're beautiful. It's beautiful.
*  Perfect. It's wonderful. We're COVID tested. You're clean as
*  **** Yeah, you know what? The the funny thing is that I
*  took the antibody test and then the nose swab and uh so the
*  antibody test said you've never had it but you might have it.
*  So, I had to do the nose swab. So, I'm going over two days.
*  But the nose swab, the thing about the antibody test is two
*  indicators. One of them is whether or not your body is
*  currently fighting the virus. Right. So, there's one is
*  whether or not you beat the virus and one whether you're
*  currently fighting the virus. So, you know, you're not
*  currently fighting the virus. Got it. I feel good. So,
*  according to the doctor, there's a very low possibility
*  that you have it and then we we eliminate that with the swab.
*  Right. But not before you and I hug. I don't give a ****
*  right. I take vitamin D. I'll give you a hug. Right. You're
*  gonna be coughing. I'll give you a hug. Right. I'm not
*  scared. I've been coughing a little bit but uh I'll just
*  quarantine myself for a couple weeks and eat vitamin D
*  gummies. Right. Alright. Just tell me which vitamin D you
*  want me to take. I just want you to take 5000 IUs a day
*  minimum. That's what you should be taking. It's not that much
*  and when when you eat the I have these vitamin D gummies
*  that I chew all the time. There's like I think you take
*  three of them. It's 5000 IUs. It's not a big deal. They're
*  small gummies. They taste good. It's easy to do. Is there any
*  carbs in them? Cuz I'm watching my car. There's probably like
*  one gram of carbs. No, they're probably gelatin. No,
*  thinking about it. That's horse hoof, right? Yeah. It's
*  yeah, it's it's basically fingernails. Right. And hair.
*  Yeah. It's good for you. Protein. Collagen. Yeah. Not
*  bad for you. So, I mean a good relationship. I really like
*  you. I know. You tell me. Yeah. We'll go out to eat one day.
*  That's exciting. Yeah. It is. That's exciting. Cuz you're
*  always in these train wrecks. Right. And you know, you
*  know, she's really really really pretty. She's my age and
*  and I think that's important. Yeah, I've I've never chased
*  young women, right? It's too much. You know that. It's too
*  much for the but she's she she came down. We started hanging
*  out in the COVID thing but we'd seen each other before and and
*  and one night we go out to Eddie V's and we have this
*  really nice table. Eddie V's is great. Oh, I love it. Yeah, I
*  love it. That's a great old school place. Right. So, we
*  have this really cool table in the bars. These two people.
*  It's really cool. I'll I'll show you the seat. You'll take
*  your wife there on her. I don't know. It's a big night. So,
*  and she's got a long black dress. I'm wearing a jacket
*  and you know, we go back to the my condo which is a really
*  nice penthouse with these gorgeous views and she her son
*  and was a grappler and her and his her grandson is a
*  grappler and she was a gymnast and she said for whatever
*  reason, she wanted to fight. I think I can take you down. Oh
*  no. And of course, that's how you break a hip. I I laughed so
*  hard that I couldn't. She probably could have taken me
*  down because she's five foot one and she's a gymnast, right?
*  She's little bitty and I said, no, I could pick. I would
*  never ever hurt you for any reason. So, if you wanna come
*  beat me up, come beat me up but if I didn't care about hurting
*  you, I could throw you into that table because you're
*  little and I'm big, right? Right. Then, she attacked me and
*  she did. She came at me, shoved me back and and I mean, she a
*  gymnast that does uneven parallel bars. Strong. Like a
*  champ. Like a champ. Like a champ. She was on me in my
*  center. Leg spread. **** pushing me back. Whoa. And I and I
*  was like, from now on, I'm only gonna **** women I could kill.
*  That's all I'm gonna do. I'm I'm gonna say, let's let's
*  determine whether or not I could. I'm never gonna do it,
*  right? I would never hurt a woman. But I would like to. I
*  understand. Have the option if they went nuts and just jump
*  my **** to be able to **** and beat it off and you know, live
*  you know, and provide and all those things that a man needs
*  to do. I got a buddy of mine who got obsessed with Jujitsu
*  when he dated a girl who was a black belt and they they
*  sparred and she tapped him easily and he was like, what the
*  **** So, he became obsessed with it because his girlfriend
*  **** him up. Right? Right. Defending himself, right?
*  Well, Jujitsu is one of the rare martial arts where a woman
*  really can kill you like 100% legit. Like if you you know
*  what? It's the same reason I don't have a pet lion. That's I
*  just don't need it in my house. I understand, right? I don't
*  need it in my house. Yeah, I get it. Don't take it the wrong
*  way, ladies. I'm just saying. Yeah. All those killer ladies
*  out there are like **** Right. What's wrong with me? I
*  don't know. I'm just saying. No, no. Plan on cornering them.
*  Right. But I mean, I know that you can still share and Bob it
*  my **** Right? You can still wait till I fall asleep and I'm
*  Lorraine. Right. Lorraine Bob. Was it Lorraine? Lorraine Bob.
*  Yeah. John Bob and Lorraine Bob. She cut off his **** Yeah.
*  Cut his **** off while he was sleeping and then he stitched
*  it back on and did porn. Right. How good was that sewing job?
*  Not good. It wasn't. Like about how good I would sew it up.
*  Yeah. Oh really? It didn't look good. I didn't see it. You
*  guys go down the rabbit hole. Oh. You look at the video. I
*  don't do any of that stuff. I I watch porn on my **** iPad.
*  That's all I do. I don't go any deeper than that. Pre viagra
*  porn too. So, you know, because it didn't look that good to
*  begin with. No and it never really got hard. It was a mess.
*  Right. She sliced it off and threw it on the side of the
*  road and they had to wait a while before they found it. And
*  then they had to dust the dirt off of it. Darkness. Darkness.
*  Right. Yeah. I just don't need that in my life. I don't need
*  it in my life either. Right. But I've had it in my life. I've
*  seen a lot of things. I shouldn't have seen but I if
*  someone sends me a link, I'm like, alright. You're going in.
*  Let's see. Let's see what's up. Oh, sorry. Somebody was over
*  the house. No, it wasn't. I was at the radio station in New
*  York and the guy's showing me a, he got a video of a guy
*  fucking a snake and I'm like, okay. Oh my god. Alright. Can I
*  get a check? Please? Fucking a snake's mouth? That's gonna be
*  the name of my next album. Like the mouth? No. Or the asshole.
*  No, the snake pussy. He's got a big anaconda. Wow. Okay, I'm
*  sorry I even said it. I'm sorry I said it. He's he's fucking
*  a snake. Can you can you pull that up? I can. I'm sure I
*  could. He's not the first. Let's not show it but let me just
*  just show you. I guarantee you there's many people before him
*  that have done the same thing. People just go down the queue
*  hole, rat hole, you know, and uh. Yeah, they definitely do.
*  Yeah, and if you can name it, there's a guy who's fucked it.
*  Oh yeah. Blenders. Guys that fuck blenders. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Tables, chairs. Right. That's why I hate those. Bowling balls.
*  Anyway, that doesn't matter. I'm not gonna go there. I get it.
*  But that's the problem with the internet is you find out that
*  you mean everybody knows someone who's a fucking moron
*  but you don't realize how many of them there are until you
*  really go online and start searching. You know, I was
*  sitting in, I was having this place worked on or I would, for
*  let me I'm staying down to Van Zandt has a people come up
*  comics that I've known for years and one of them starts
*  telling me a story about Hillary Clinton and her
*  pedophile ring and I'm like what and this is probably three
*  years ago and uh and how the pedophiles the far left uh right
*  left wing and they there's a pedophile thing and I'm like
*  what are you talking about and it was early QAnon stuff. It
*  was those same conspiracy theories that are coming out
*  now. I was hearing those three years ago and I thought it was
*  just one person's. I mean, where'd you go to learn this
*  behavior? You know, we all behaviors learn, right? For
*  sure. We're all a product of our environment. Like what
*  environment did you put yourself in that made you think
*  that this is true when you know the other day there were four
*  of us playing golf and all four phones hit an amber alert at
*  the same second. Yeah and and everybody knew exactly what it
*  does. We picked it up and I went there's a missing kid
*  somewhere and that's a beautiful **** thing, right?
*  And uh but but now there's these pedophile rings and Tom
*  Hanks is a what the **** I don't think the Tom Hanks thing
*  is true. I think there's a lot of people that are just really
*  dumb and they get involved in conspiracy theories and they
*  believe everything and there's a lot of people out there that
*  are sowing misinformation and there's a bunch of Russian
*  trolls and body counts and a lot of chaos and sowing seeds
*  of doubt in our democracy and life in general and trying to
*  tell you that all the elites are **** lizard people that are
*  running things behind closed doors with Satan but for sure
*  there's guys out there that have **** a lot of young girls.
*  That's for sure. Yeah. And that's what that Epstein ****
*  is all about and that's what's so spooky about it was that
*  it's prominent politicians and scientists and celebrities and
*  they all flew out to **** Island and it's real and then
*  when the guy's in custody with **** security cameras and the
*  whole deal, he he hangs himself in a way that's physically
*  impossible. Yeah. Yeah and everybody's like, well, no more
*  need for further investigation. It's unnecessary. If there was
*  anybody else involved in any other thing and they died in
*  that way, we would look deeply into it but they've basically
*  just tried to let it go pass in the news cycle. Yeah. The
*  point when no one's thinking about it anymore. Well, you
*  know the the the interview that Prince Andrew Wright was yeah,
*  it was there. You see that interview when they're
*  interviewing him and the reason he thought he could pull
*  that off is because for years, he's been royalty, right? So
*  everybody around him were just yes, man. So he's got
*  footmen and whatever and they're all going. Oh exactly.
*  Right. So, oh, I know I can't believe someone would make
*  these kind of accusations against you. That seems like
*  perfectly normal behavior. Exactly. How are you? But turns
*  out the news people weren't those people at all. Right. And
*  how do you not see that coming? You idiot motherfucker
*  because he's an idiot motherfucker. Right. The only
*  reason why he's in that position at all is because one
*  of his uncles fucked one of his aunts and then yeah right.
*  Blah blah blah blah blah and then there you are. He means a
*  bloodline thing. It's not like an earned position because
*  you've really worked really hard to get there. You don't
*  become a prince because you've kicked ass. You're right. You
*  kicked prince ass and for years. You didn't even get a
*  PhD in princedom. No, you just became a prince for your whole
*  life, man. No, it's absolutely. How about that Prince Harry and
*  Meghan Markle? Isn't that crazy? It's crazy that it's on
*  the newsfeed every fucking day. It's important. Everything
*  they do. It's important. It's important to everyone. They left
*  the castle. Oh, we have to go. Why did they do it? Are they
*  crazy? I can tell you why they did it. They left the kingdom
*  because there's no way you can bring an outsider into that
*  world and have them do anything. Oh, they signed a
*  megawatt Netflix deal. I bet they did. What are you doing?
*  What are you doing? Have you learned Netflix? You've made
*  some big boo boo's. Stop it. Netflix. If you think about
*  making decisions like this, call me up first. Me? No, I'm
*  talking to Netflix. Oh, I'm going to I'll get them high and
*  I'll pull them aside and go. Listen, this is not going to
*  work. You're going to spend a lot of money, right? No one
*  gives a fuck. Buy another Ron White special. That's what I'm
*  talking about. Yeah. What what these people are is like this.
*  They're good for snippets in the news. They're good for you.
*  Looking at Google News Feed like what are they doing? Oh,
*  they're they're extradited from the kingdom. No one cares about
*  them anymore. I think you're 100% wrong. I think that they
*  people will watch this crap no matter how bad it is. If it's
*  connected to this guy and this woman, people will watch it and
*  they will continue to fucking go home. I look at the
*  Kardashians, you know, they're not a talent one in any of
*  those people. Wait a minute. Did you watch her sex tape? You're
*  talking all this shit. Did you watch her sex tape? No. Well,
*  you should have. Then you wouldn't be saying she doesn't
*  have any talent. Really was it good? It's very good. How was
*  it? Yeah. Enthusiastic. I watched that Paris Hilton lame
*  little I think what's I think that family all bullshit aside
*  no jokes is the mother is very skillful in the way she's
*  managed them. That's what it is. Well, something's genius
*  about it because nothing works better than this. You know, I
*  was doing a show at the Emperor or at the uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
*  Mirage and they had that little Kardashian t-shirt shop. Yeah.
*  Right there. Do you remember that? Mm hmm. One of the ones
*  you haven't even heard of was gonna be there and there was a
*  300 yards long to get into this what's now a soap shop and I
*  I walk by that. That's where I work. I'm there 10 weekends a
*  year more than anybody and that's my place and I stay in a
*  villa right back there and I and one day I walk in there. I'm
*  just looking around the Kardashian. I want to see what
*  they got. They got towels with Kim's likeness and stuff on it
*  and they they said, sir, you can't come in here with the
*  beverage. I'm like, who do you think I'm gonna spill a coke on
*  your towel? Okay, I think you can probably but anyway, they
*  made me leave and uh they **** made me leave. They made me
*  leave and quite frankly, well, it's they've figured out a way
*  to keep people interested and keep people talking about them
*  and yeah, it's I just got through doing it. That's how
*  good they are. I just got through doing it. Yeah, we're
*  helping them and then the mother but but here's the thing
*  about Kim. She's done some legitimate amazing work in
*  getting people out of jail that were wrongly accused and
*  that's why I don't make fun of her anymore except that thing
*  I said about her sex tape but other than that, I thought you
*  were saying something really nice about her sex tape. You
*  weren't dissonant. Thank you. You were saying that I felt
*  like that too but go at it. Thank you very much but she's
*  really done a lot of like legitimate good to help people
*  get released from prison that were wrongly accused. Well,
*  you know what the problem that I have is sometimes I talk
*  about things and I don't know jack **** about him. I just
*  make up a funny thing to say to my head and then later I end
*  up going, well **** really? I didn't know she did that. Me
*  too but I did. I saw the woman that she helped get out of
*  uh uh prison and I thought that was a yeah. Um we've had a
*  couple of guys from the Innocence Project on here. I
*  love the Innocence. I love that series. No, it's uh it's
*  amazing and she's a douchebag. That guy that was doing the
*  tooth my **** uh was that guy? It's it was on that. He was
*  convicting people from tooth. Oh, tooth bites. Yeah, it
*  doesn't work but there wasn't a bottom imprint and there he was
*  sending him to prison and let the other guy that was killing
*  kids go free. Yeah, you see that? It's uh it was a good
*  well, Josh Dubin who's one of the guys who's been on this
*  podcast before he has a uh podcast called Junk Science.
*  Um it's uh about the Innocence Project about wrongly convicted
*  people because of junk science about like bite marks. There it
*  is. Wrongful conviction, junk science, bite mark evidence.
*  This is uh this is Josh Dubin who's been on the podcast
*  before. That guy made me cry like a baby telling me some
*  stories about people getting out of jail that were wrong. I
*  wasn't trying to make you cry but I could have. You know but
*  I just chose not to. Okay, I got I took I'm taking it in a
*  different direction. Why are you threatening me? I'm not
*  threatening you, Joe. I'm just saying that if I wanted to make
*  you cry right here in public like you were crying that night
*  at the improv and I was wiping your tears on my do rag. Tell
*  me about Austin. Where am I gonna go? I'm gonna come with me.
*  I don't know if I could live in Texas but I have to move
*  everything. Yeah. I'd have to move but it's too hard. I'll be
*  there. I was all in dude. I was all in. I was so fucking
*  thrilled. I'm like, how was it? You heard the news coming out
*  of my fucking voice the day I found out that uh Joe was coming
*  to town and I'm like and and then I write, you know what? I
*  knew Jay was coming but I didn't know he, I don't know if
*  he's really coming cuz nobody. I talked him into it.
*  Somebody, nobody's selling their property over there.
*  They're just getting a place over here. He sells property
*  there eventually. I'm like, come on, man. What about you?
*  Are you gonna sell the place? I'll sell my place. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah, I think I'm staying here. I like it a lot. I felt, I
*  felt real comfortable real quick. Real quick. I've only
*  been here a little over a week. Right. I fucking love it.
*  Right, right. You're brand new. You're new. And look, I already
*  got a studio. I'm all set up. You got a badass studio. Yeah.
*  I got jet skis. I think you could have built it in an
*  air stream. You know, it saved the money. Could have, right?
*  Right. But it's. It moved it around. You know. I feel like
*  this is a better spot for me. And again, it's like
*  practicing what I preach. I don't think we need to be
*  connected to that machine out there. That Hollywood machine.
*  It's. Well, we know you don't. Nobody does. Right? They don't.
*  It's a bandwidth, right? Yeah. It's same thing. You could do
*  it from anywhere. It's that. And you could do it from
*  anywhere but it's also what really serves the comics. What
*  really serves the comics is the podcast industry. The podcast
*  industry goes where the podcasters go, right? So let's
*  bring them all here. Yeah, you always have the ability to move
*  my number, you know, by saying something on the internet,
*  which you are always willing to do and and you can see it and
*  you have people coming up. Yeah, I heard it on the road. Yeah,
*  I'm like, good. Yeah, good. Sometimes you're just lucky,
*  right? I'm lucky you're my friend. A lot of guys that were
*  friends of Letterman got to do Letterman all the time because
*  they were his friends, right? Whether they were that good or
*  not. They they got to do it over and over and over and over
*  again. A lot of guys that were friends of Letterman got to do
*  it over and over and over and over again. You know, I've
*  watched a few of your podcasts. Everybody was more interesting
*  than me. You know, I used to be a comic. You keep saying that.
*  II used to be a comic, too. That's horse **** You're a
*  comic. You're Ron **** white, man. Don't ever say that. You
*  need to stop saying that. Once I get you up at the club. Come
*  on, man. You're you're gonna crush. You're gonna tell that
*  story about those. That's what I'm waiting for. I'm waiting
*  for the I'm waiting for the club. Once the club. So so
*  Just kidding as soon as we figure it out a way to open up these clover. We have a meeting under the bridge
*  Yeah, we know we got a bunker
*  We don't need to go under the bridge
*  We just need to get good clubs open test as soon as they come up with rapid testing and some more
*  Tenable therapeutics, right? Yeah, you're right. We'll be alright
*  People want to go out man. They miss it. They miss it bad. I miss it
*  I miss sitting in a club watching other comics almost as much as I miss doing stand-up
*  I miss it everybody but the people that are just fans
*  They just have regular jobs that used to love date night go out to a comedy club
*  Have a great fucking time have a few drinks laugh their ass off. They miss it
*  But we're gonna add badass barbecue to that
*  Yeah, we just gotta make weed legal here god damn it people I know it's kind of legal
*  All we have to do is continue to work in that direction. Well, this is the process of evolution, right?
*  I thought I thought that
*  Texas would probably sell
*  Medical marijuana before Oklahoma because there's so much more conservative it seems. Yeah, but now it's flour
*  like crazy, yeah, and
*  did the money they get out of it right in Texas doesn't need the money because of oil, but
*  And just other things but but eventually it's gonna make sense to Texas, you know
*  It'll be laughed upon in 15 years or 10 years or five years as a prohibition that was so fucking stupid
*  Like it is in California like it is in California, you know, you can't even imagine
*  I remember the day that I lived in I moved to Montecito. I'm down at this head shop
*  I'm gonna buy a piece. I just bought this house with a big view of the world and
*  There's a guy there with a skateboard. He was waiting
*  It was gonna open in 15 minutes and he goes there you you got your license
*  Pick up some my urban I'm like what and then I spent 20 minutes going what?
*  What has he explained to me that marijuana was legal in California? I didn't even know it and he goes
*  Yeah, what you do is you go down he goes. Where's your license? It's
*  Atlanta he goes. Yes. Okay, just go down there apply for a license
*  They'll give you a paper license take that to this doctor in one hour. You'll be back here open that door
*  There's 15 kind of what?
*  What are you fucking what are you kidding me and I walked in there and he wasn't kidding it was fucking
*  15 kinds of gorgeous bud ice cream
*  That made you want potato chips, right? I'm getting fatter for sure and
*  All the hash hash well all this stuff and I buy all of it. I spent two grand
*  I spent two thousand dollars and I go back up to the house. I'm there by myself and I got my new bong
*  I'm pouring this in this taking this hit that hit
*  This eat some of this fucking ice cream, which they didn't put a real dosage on, you know, but I'm
*  I'm so fucking this and then I start feeling weird
*  Right and I go wash my face and I lay in my bed and I started going Montesito the trap
*  It's a trap the drugs here. It's gonna ruin my life. I should take all that
*  We know it's to flush it down the toilet. I'm going to bug it. This is the horse
*  Like an hour later, I mean they're going so what else we got in here
*  Don't do it all cuz that doesn't work
*  But get past the rough spots, right?
*  Yeah, but I always like to get too fucked up and come down a little bit right to kind of wander into a buzz that way
*  Well when you come down a little bit you feel real thankful. You're not as fucked up as you were an hour, right?
*  Yeah, I hope an hour from now. Yeah, you know, I have those feelings. Yes
*  Good feelings good feelings of survival
*  I think you have to feel like you're gonna die to really appreciate being alive, right? You know, I've
*  had some really fucking low spots in my life and
*  in the touring career when
*  Literally, I had joint custody of my son when he was two and a half years old and
*  They were like, okay. Here you go. And I'm like, oh
*  Nobody's going with me or nothing and I just have a baby and
*  I'm like, okay, I have a van and I plop Marshall down in the
*  In a car seat next to me in the van and go
*  Okay, here we go and and we took off across the fucking country and going to comedy club literally I
*  Would walk up to waitresses before I went on stage and went could you just hold him for about 45 minutes?
*  Really and as he'd be out there being held by
*  a
*  Waitress and while I'm up on stage doing stand-up comedy, that's crazy
*  and I'll tell you the funniest thing is he's a brilliant young man and but
*  here's how smart is we're at the South County funny ball and
*  And he goes dad cuz every once in a while I'd bring him on stage right and here's my baby get that boat
*  right, it's an easy boat to get and
*  And he goes to Adam I don't want to come to the club tonight, but I don't I don't want to go on stage
*  I just want to hang out in the green room and I said this club doesn't have a green room
*  He goes, oh, it's a funny bone
*  How amazing it is to put that together that funny bones are shitholes don't have fucking green rooms, right?
*  He's the one Columbus doesn't right?
*  Do
*  And he realized that at two and a half years old two and a half years old
*  But that's how he you know, that's how he's raised and I took him down to Mexico when I started making pottery and
*  His mom who lives in you lived in Mexico for a while, right?
*  But this is before you collar comedy
*  Before right before what brought you to Mexico?
*  I'm impetuous, dude
*  I would the funny bone cut my pay by a third
*  because they realized they could and
*  and
*  And really they took away a lot of the airfare
*  so it was really almost half and and I told him to go eat a steaming bowl of fuck and and
*  My girlfriend at the time was an artist sort of person and she was doing this mosaic tile application to pottery
*  And then she would take it to these
*  Fairs or whatever and sell it and she'd sell it all in two hours
*  But the fair's three days it took her six months to make it
*  And so I thought why wouldn't you just go to Mexico and hire a bunch of women to sit around and she orchestrates it and they
*  sit around and make this pottery and then you have a bunch of sell and that was the whole concept and
*  So I went down there
*  and I had I was living on the lake LBJ right up from you and
*  Sold that house and and
*  Had the biggest truck rider makes pulled in the biggest trailer rider makes and I had my van that marshall
*  I toured in and the biggest trailer that they make behind that that was everything I owned and we went straight down to McAllen,
*  Texas and moved into a trailer and then we moved then I found a place in Mexico in rey nosa Mexico where Abraham
*  answer is who's a great golfer who I love to follow and
*  We moved into Mexico
*  Met a woman named Irma Munoz and Irma
*  Knew everybody she was like the matriarch of the entire
*  subdivision there and
*  There was a tortilla factory that had been abandoned and I rented it for $100 a month
*  And it was a wreck and had eight inches of cat shit in it
*  they went in there and cleaned it all up and we started fucking make a pottery and
*  pottery pottery and
*  I remember that two of the
*  It may have been the two sons of not wouldn't hear him of one of the employees were
*  little kids and they were Marshall was five or six and and they were four and three or whatever and they were fighting and
*  Marshall went out on the front porch and went all toe
*  and because that was a word he knew and
*  But they didn't stop but he
*  He still knew how to command them to stop and so we had a glorious life
*  I spent my evenings fucking sawing tables and building shit and they were making pottery and I was sweating how old were you back then?
*  42 or three maybe
*  That crazy so you had toured and you kind of like settled into this idea that I'm just gonna be here in Mexico making pottery. Yeah
*  Yeah, but you know, but but Foxworthy and I were had been friends for already even I met Foxworthy first day
*  I did stand-up. So so he goes
*  Why don't you come with me on the weekends and and open for me in the big shows, right?
*  so he'd gotten big enough to take somebody with him and he picked me to take with him and
*  So I would go out and make more money
*  Than ever really made before my life open it for Foxworthy on the weekends and then I'd fly back
*  From it would be on a private jet and then we'd fly back to Atlanta and then I get on a plane to Houston
*  then my cow in Texas and then drive across and
*  To Mexico have I ever told you the tomato story? No
*  So my mother grows these amazing tomatoes
*  That were so good the property she lived on which was in Buda which is just south of here
*  Was a peach tree orchard at one time and a cattle farm at one time
*  But the soil produced a tomato that you could just eat over the sink like an apple. They were so good and
*  clearly the best I'd ever eaten and
*  Foxworthy
*  Was so in love with these tomatoes that he would call because mother would send him a box of tomatoes every year
*  He's when does the tomatoes come?
*  Rippening on the vine. Okay, you'll get your tomatoes when you get your tomatoes and
*  I'd been out on a run. I picked up a comedy club. That wasn't a funny bone and then a couple of Foxworthy days
*  I was gone for two weeks and mother sent me the box of tomatoes
*  and
*  All the money that I'd made I already owed to the people that worked for me, right and
*  They didn't know it to him, but it was coming up right? It was gone. I didn't have any money and
*  so I stopped in
*  McAllen to post office and they bring out a big old soggy fucking box and I know what it is
*  I know my mother sent me the tomatoes and they went rotting in the fucking post office while I was out doing stand-up, right?
*  so I said ask tomatoes, you know throw it away and
*  And so I get in line I'm exhausted I've been traveling all day long literally all night and all day
*  We had done a show in Seattle flow back on a private plane to Atlanta to Houston hadn't woke, you know, just beat up
*  And I get over to my house and the phone rings and it's my mom and she goes did you get the tomatoes?
*  And I said mother I've been gone for two weeks and the tomatoes were rotten. She goes at least you got the hundred dollars. Oh
*  I
*  Get back in my car drive back to America drive to the fucking post office
*  Go back to the dumpster fucking open the lid crawl in it and start rubbing through the fucking rubbish till I found that box
*  Ripped it open and got that hundred dollars put it in my pocket and went back fucking home
*  that's how much I needed a hundred dollars Wow dig through a dumpster to get it and
*  If I forget where we're at right before that
*  You were in Mexico and that's you were doing pottery yeah opening for Jeff Fox
*  Yeah, and then well basically then you know the
*  Blue-collar comedy tour came up, you know because the Kings of Comedy were doing such huge numbers and
*  Fox worthy was like, you know, why don't you why don't we do another version of that? You know for a different, you know
*  marketplace and and
*  He told me he was going to do a show
*  He told me the concept of the four of us going out, but I didn't really know what the Kings of Comedy were doing
*  you know, I wasn't playing golf with them back then and
*  You're making pottery in Mexico pottery in Mexico
*  This is pre-internet turned out it was heavy and fragile, which is a horrible combination
*  That way I really hadn't thought of that I didn't really think the whole thing through I was like, what about this?
*  It is crazy though little pop for you at 42
*  Well, probably 40, you know 44 45 and before that came out, right we did it
*  And but that was all Jeff's money, right? Yeah, they'd be paid me great to do it
*  But it was his thing, right? It would have been nothing without him ever
*  We couldn't have sold ticket one without Fox worthy and that and even it was just being ball
*  It would didn't work at all. We tried
*  and it went but we just cut the guy making all the money out of it and
*  Give the money. Okay. Nobody shows up
*  so
*  Yes, so he's I think Fox was he is one of the most underrated comics ever
*  I really do that you might be a redneck series genius brilliant
*  Yeah, if your family tree does not fork
*  And it was all so long
*  I mean those jokes were so long ago, but it was such a great hook
*  It's something that you just do it over and over and over and over but but there was so much to him besides that
*  Right into this day, you know, he's just somebody that when I talked to him
*  we were both doing little clubs in Atlanta warming up for something else and so we had dinner together and
*  you know, I don't know eight months ago or whatever it was and and
*  It was just glorious to sit down and talk to somebody that was so generous that the first day I ever did stand-up
*  He told me I needed to put the punchline at the end of the joke and then I said how you do that?
*  or whatever stupid fucking voice I was using that day and
*  And he sits down with me brand new comic with a piece of paper and a fucking pen and he goes
*  All right. How's the first joke go? He writes it out himself in longhand and he underlines this part and this part in this part
*  He goes you're what you're doing is instead of saying this here. You need to say it here
*  Right because if you say it here, you're stepping on the lap by doing the end of it
*  Now I can't imagine now how you would do that wrong or not how to do it not know how to do it
*  But I didn't know how to do it then and he was so generous
*  He just sat down and showed me I've been doing stand-up for four minutes and he and I had a guy that good going
*  Okay, look at this. Just think amazing. Just think about this if you do it here instead of here what happens stare at them
*  They'll laugh and then you can move on to the next fucking job
*  So that's how that's how much he's in. I've never heard anything but good things about that, man
*  There's nothing there's nothing but good
*  You know
*  Great human being
*  Dear dear friend count on him for anything. He's a big-time bow hunter, too, you know
*  He's big-time hunter. Yeah
*  Hey
*  He and everybody respects him as a hunter, you know, he doesn't take out a lot of deer
*  During the year, you know, he looks for trophies and if he doesn't see him, he doesn't shoot at him
*  You know, he doesn't old mature deer that have passed their breed inside. Yeah
*  that's what he looks for that's how you're supposed to do it and
*  You know and I've never been into that he's always tried to get me to go and I would probably go with him
*  I mean, I have no reason not to you know, except that I have to learn how to shoot a bow
*  You should come out here and we should shoot some pigs
*  They have to get rid of them these wild crazy pigs. So the pigs yeah the pigs don't think about Whitney's pig
*  That in the back of your head. So Jay and I were gonna do
*  Who was the hanging Jeff?
*  Yeah, there he is
*  What's he doing in this video Jamie?
*  That's a nice deer
*  Yeah, he's out there whacking deer
*  So anyway, Jay and I were gonna talk we're talking about doing who was the judge west of the Pecos here?
*  Roy Bean Roy Bean and
*  So we were talking to this director I feel stupid for not know his name famous director lives right here in Bastrop
*  who did
*  Shit my brain is just not working today. I can't catch up with all of it and
*  but he owned the he actually had also some pigs that he put into this and he wanted to do a reality show about the the
*  pig ranch and
*  Bastrop and
*  So Jay
*  Because he can produce anything right he's got a great production company and
*  So he sells it because this guy's the director fuck who's his name? Oh, I can't believe it. Sorry. Give me a movie
*  the first movie that
*  McConaughey was ever guesting on this
*  Last Richard
*  Jamie
*  He's a mentalist
*  So
*  We pitch him the
*  Judge Roy Bean story, but Jay's there to wrap up the deal on the pig
*  Ranch the pig rescue, right?
*  so
*  We they want to go over there. Well now I'm part of the fucking team, right?
*  I'm like fuck yeah, cuz I want this guy to strike this right because if he does it it's a hit and it's so
*  For sure. He's an amazing director
*  And
*  We go over there and it's huge and it's nice too the pigs are 800 pounds
*  Some of them can't hardly move have arthritis take some 30 minutes to lay down
*  This is a thing no
*  Something different. Well now that's the last pig. Good luck with that. There's a lot of pigs
*  But anyway, we make our way around the whole thing and and they have footage because you know
*  They have all these cameras out of of pigs that are in the wild walking up to the fence going
*  How do you get in here? They're fucking eating sandwiches and shit laying around in the mud
*  Then there's the people pigs outside the gates going what the fuck is this?
*  I want in now
*  You can't get in there if you let wild pigs in if they'll revert to being like domestic pigs because if you take
*  Domestic pigs and they go wild like you were talking about your friends pigs. They didn't find tusks. Yeah, and they were fine
*  Yeah, I don't know. But anyway, we make our way into the house with it, which
*  The guy that runs it is a runs a big construction company. He's got a lot of money, but his wife
*  Looks like the chick from Pulp Fiction that that goes nuts that has all the piercings and stuff and oh, yeah
*  And when I walked into that environment I saw her and I'm like she's set to pop
*  She's a
*  So, yeah, she's about to pop her fucking weasel, right?
*  Yeah, I think that's my feeling about the whole situation
*  And we get in the house and they're gonna sit out and talk about this deal
*  We sit out for about three seconds. He goes
*  She walks out the door slams the fucking door and I was like I saw that fucking coming
*  I didn't tell anybody right, but I did see it fucking coming. I'm like this girl's about to pop. I've seen it
*  I've seen it, you know crazy, right? You've been around crazy and then and he goes
*  She's not coming back
*  And I'm like, yeah
*  She was coming back she was anyway, I said I'm gonna
*  They said something about they need to talk about the deal and I got a joint my pocket
*  I've been dying smoke for fucking hours and and we go. Yeah, I'll just
*  Be right outside here and the smoke but but before they did that
*  There were four pigs that lived in the house and one of them was Whitney Cummings pig
*  And they brought Whitney Cummings pig out to me and gay and I held it and it squealed like I was fucking it
