# Joe Rogan Experience #2338 - Beth Shapiro
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0)
*  Hello Beth. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=0.0s)]
*  Hello. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4.16s)]
*  It's very great to see you again. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5.16s)]
*  I am pleased to be here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6.16s)]
*  It's been really interesting getting to talk to you and communicating with you and all [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7.16s)]
*  the stuff that you guys have done that colossal has been insane. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=22.04s)]
*  So why don't you just tell everybody what your background is and what you do. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=25.28s)]
*  I'm a scientist. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=29.44s)]
*  I work in a crazy field called ancient DNA, sometimes called paleogenomics. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=30.44s)]
*  It means we go out into the world, we dig shit up and we extract DNA from it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  And what is fantastic about that is it's being a modern day explorer. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=39.8s)]
*  I get to go somewhere. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=44.24s)]
*  I get to find out something new that completely rewrites what we thought we knew. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  And it's brilliant. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=49.6s)]
*  And I get to fight with people a lot. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=50.6s)]
*  And because I love to fight, I recently quit my academic job and moved to become the chief [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  science officer at Colossal, the company that has just made those dire wolves. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=58.24s)]
*  Why do you like to fight with people? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=62.92s)]
*  I don't really like to fight with people. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=63.92s)]
*  I just felt like it was the right thing to say at this minute. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=66.04s)]
*  I end up fighting with people though, not because I want to, but because I feel like [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=68.52s)]
*  I have to defend what I think is the way that we should be doing science. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=73.04s)]
*  Well, it's certainly a controversial subject and you guys are certainly groundbreakers. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=77.2s)]
*  there's a controversial subject and people are groundbreakers, you're without doubt going [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=83.82s)]
*  to get a lot of pushback and a lot of people that just want attention, a lot of people [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=89.3s)]
*  that are angry that you're getting attention. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=93.22s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff going on. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=96.05999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there's a big, I think in academia in particular, there's this big scarcity mindset [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=97.82s)]
*  and this leads people to be kind of negative about everything. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=101.97999999999999s)]
*  That's going to be too hard. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=106.61999999999999s)]
*  If I say that that's good, then that means that the thing that I want to do probably [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=107.66s)]
*  isn't going to get that money or if you get attention, that means I can't get attention [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=111.26s)]
*  and it leads to this negativity that I think stifles innovation. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=115.26s)]
*  There's a lot of gatekeeping too. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=119.82000000000001s)]
*  We talked about that recently. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=121.58000000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of people that want to be the only people that are allowed to either discuss [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=123.94s)]
*  or work on things. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=129.5s)]
*  Yeah, I've spent my whole life working on this, therefore I am the only expert and if [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=130.82s)]
*  anybody says something that disagrees with what I believe to be true, they're just wrong. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=134.94s)]
*  I'm not even going to think about it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=138.82s)]
*  They're just wrong. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=140.34s)]
*  It's unfortunate, but fortunately we live in a very unique time where you can do podcasts [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=141.34s)]
*  and podcasts get extraordinary amounts of attention. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=148.86s)]
*  I think that's also one of the reasons why people push back so much as well. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=153.3s)]
*  It's because they don't like that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=157.02s)]
*  They don't like that there's this unique distribution network. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=159.02s)]
*  There are going to be people, there are going to be colleagues of mine that are angry with [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=163.22000000000003s)]
*  I have come here to talk to you and that is part of the problem. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=167.66s)]
*  Yeah, it just seems kind of silly. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=170.7s)]
*  But the subject, without all that stuff, the subject is absolutely fascinating. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=174.17999999999998s)]
*  So how did you get started in this? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=179.26s)]
*  What did you initially want to do when you first started your career? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=181.66s)]
*  I actually started in broadcast journalism. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=185.26s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=187.66s)]
*  I was in high school. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=188.66s)]
*  I was convinced that I wanted to work in broadcast journalism. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=190.38s)]
*  I got a job working at the local TV station. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=192.85999999999999s)]
*  I grew up in Rome, Georgia, northwest corner of Georgia. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=195.98s)]
*  And I got a job at the TV station where I was first operating the camera and helping [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=199.17999999999998s)]
*  people write copy. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=203.54s)]
*  And then I got to be on air. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=205.29999999999998s)]
*  I auditioned for a spot in the morning where I would do local cut-ins on headline news [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=206.7s)]
*  in the like 24 and 54 after the hour. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=211.29999999999998s)]
*  But I had to wake up really early in the morning and go to work. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=214.06s)]
*  I was in high school. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=216.85999999999999s)]
*  Go to work, write the script, go on TV, learn to read the teleprompter. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=217.85999999999999s)]
*  It was pretty fun. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=221.38s)]
*  And eventually got... [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=223.14s)]
*  And I was convinced that this is what I wanted to do with my career. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=224.38s)]
*  I went to the University of Georgia. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=227.14s)]
*  They have a fantastic broadcast journalism school. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=228.38s)]
*  I started off as the news director at one of the local radio stations. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=231.66s)]
*  And this job, let's just say, wasn't particularly compatible with being a freshman in college. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=235.26s)]
*  There were mornings when I was locked out of the bathroom, but I had only been asleep [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=243.14s)]
*  for one and a half hours after being out for too late at night doing things that I shouldn't [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=247.42s)]
*  have been doing because I was underaged, right? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=251.38s)]
*  And had to go to work to write the news and then be on this broadcast radio station. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=253.66s)]
*  It was terrible. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=259.86s)]
*  Anyway, how did I move from there to science? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=260.86s)]
*  I took this amazing class. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=262.94s)]
*  It's similar to a class that I ended up teaching at UC Santa Cruz recently where it was a field [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=266.46s)]
*  geology and archaeology program. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=272.02s)]
*  And we started off on the East Coast. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=275.18s)]
*  We learned about rocks and how to identify minerals. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=277.74s)]
*  And then we drove across the country and slept outside in national parks and learned [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=280.52s)]
*  about the history of North America, the geological history, the human history, everything while [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=285.82s)]
*  being there in person. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=292.32s)]
*  Drove up the West Coast, drove back around the country. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=294.06s)]
*  It was nine weeks. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  And I thought to myself while I was there, this is the story that I want to tell. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  I want to show how people have changed this landscape over and over and over again and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=301.47999999999996s)]
*  about the opportunities that we have to be able to become more creative controllers of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=306.8s)]
*  this landscape. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=312.8s)]
*  So I thought I'll get a degree in science because I know how to do broadcast journalism. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=313.8s)]
*  You know, the ignorance of somebody who thinks they're an expert and something. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=318.8s)]
*  I know how to do that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=322.48s)]
*  So I'll just do this other thing. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=323.48s)]
*  And that's the history of it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=325.52s)]
*  I just kind of got sucked into being the scientist. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=326.64s)]
*  I've written a couple of popular books, which is still me trying to reach back out. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=329.56s)]
*  I want to be a communicator, but I also want to be a scientist because it's so much fun [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=332.36s)]
*  So you just followed your fascination, which is the best advice anyone could ever get. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=342.12s)]
*  How did I pick a field working in ancient DNA? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=343.12s)]
*  This is something I had no idea about. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  I ended up not getting the scholarship that I wanted to get and not getting into the university [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=348.12s)]
*  that I wanted to get into, but wandering around the halls of the university that I did get [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=352.56s)]
*  into. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=357.52s)]
*  And I met this guy called Alan Cooper, who was one of the few people in the world at [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=358.52s)]
*  the time. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=362.36s)]
*  This was the late 1990s who'd set up the special kind of lab that you need to be able [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=363.36s)]
*  to extract DNA from bones. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=367.48s)]
*  So this DNA is in terrible condition. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=369.44s)]
*  So we have to have a purpose-built clean room to make sure that we don't spit in something [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  or drop an eyelash in something because then your DNA, which is in great condition, will [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=376.04s)]
*  be the thing that we amplify. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=380.48s)]
*  So we had one of these labs and I thought, well, that's kind of cool because I was interested [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=382.56s)]
*  in geology. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  I was interested in human history. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  Maybe I can use this as a way of telling stories that haven't been told before or rewriting [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=388.96s)]
*  the stories that we keep telling. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  This was a time where we were learning a lot about human history and human ancestry and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=395.14s)]
*  there was a lot more to be learned. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=398.52s)]
*  And so I thought this would be cool, but I wasn't sure. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=401.0s)]
*  And Alan said, well, you know, it'd be cool. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=402.84s)]
*  This would be fun. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=405.0s)]
*  Plus, if you join my lab, you can go to Siberia. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=406.0s)]
*  And I was in. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  I was like, yeah, sure. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=409.71999999999997s)]
*  That's the deal for me. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  I'll go to Siberia. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=411.71999999999997s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  So you got sent to Siberia? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  That's usually what they do to you in the Soviet Union when you're bad. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=416.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, I mean, I have had several not amazing experiences in Siberia, but overall, it's [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=420.28000000000003s)]
*  been fun. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=426.08000000000004s)]
*  I've been a couple of times. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=427.08000000000004s)]
*  What time of year did you go? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=428.08000000000004s)]
*  Summer. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=430.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=431.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=432.92s)]
*  So the first time I went, it was for a meeting. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=433.92s)]
*  And I spent some time in Moscow first as a guest of one of my Russian collaborators. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=434.92s)]
*  And then we went out to this meeting in Yakutsk and we got on a boat. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=439.76s)]
*  What I learned about Siberia is that everything goes wrong. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=443.8s)]
*  There's no bit of infrastructure that functions the way it's supposed to function. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=446.72s)]
*  And I learned that initially. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=451.12s)]
*  We ended up on this boat that was two hours late. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=452.12s)]
*  It was warm and hot. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  And there are so many mosquitoes. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=456.16s)]
*  I was going to ask you about that. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=457.16s)]
*  I've heard the mosquitoes are insane. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=458.16s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=460.16s)]
*  Like, one of the times I was out in Timor, the north central Timor Peninsula, and we [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=461.16s)]
*  had brought with us this weird tent that we'd set up so that we could go inside and take [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  the masks off of our face because you always have to wear a hood. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=473.15999999999997s)]
*  Otherwise you'll be breathing mosquitoes. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=475.68s)]
*  And we were going outside and playing this game where we would just clap our hands in [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=477.92s)]
*  front of our face and then count how many you killed. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=481.36s)]
*  And one time I killed something like 35 mosquitoes in one clap. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=484.2s)]
*  And it's just awful. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=488.48s)]
*  It's miserable. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=491.03999999999996s)]
*  So they're trying to sting you through your clothes. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=492.36s)]
*  They're just big too, right? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=494.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, it depends on time of year. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=496.12s)]
*  And early in the season, they're really big and you can catch them fast. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=497.44s)]
*  And then they get different species come out that are smaller and smaller. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=500.68s)]
*  And toward the end of the season, they're really tiny. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=503.6s)]
*  Once I was up in the north of Alaska on the Iqpikpuk River, we were floating down the [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=505.84000000000003s)]
*  river looking for mammoth bones and tusks and things like that. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=509.52s)]
*  And it had been windy for the first few days, so it was fine. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=513.12s)]
*  And this was my first time out in the field, actually. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=516.16s)]
*  It was northern Alaska. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=518.36s)]
*  And I was like, these mosquitoes, people keep telling me there's mosquitoes. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=519.36s)]
*  They're full of shit. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=522.44s)]
*  There's no mosquitoes out here. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=523.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=524.44s)]
*  The wind is blowing. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=525.44s)]
*  Then the wind dies down. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=526.44s)]
*  And then it's like, oh, fuck. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=527.44s)]
*  This is awful. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=529.64s)]
*  There was a moose that was ahead of us for a while. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=530.64s)]
*  And this poor animal, we were following the river and he would every few steps, he would [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=533.0400000000001s)]
*  just totally submerge his body in this frozen water and then come back up. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  The mosquitoes are just, yeah, something else. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=542.08s)]
*  I've only been to Anchorage. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=545.32s)]
*  Well, I've been to a couple of spots of Alaska, but I was in Anchorage. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=546.32s)]
*  And when I was there, it was the summertime we were salmon fishing, my friend Ari and [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=551.36s)]
*  I. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=555.12s)]
*  We got bug repellent because we heard you got to spray mosquito spray. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=556.16s)]
*  We stepped out of the car. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=560.24s)]
*  The moment we opened up the car door, there was a cloud of mosquitoes. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=562.32s)]
*  We're shrieking like little girls. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=567.04s)]
*  We're like, ah! [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=569.24s)]
*  Like what the hell? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=570.64s)]
*  I'd never experienced anything like it in my life. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=572.36s)]
*  Like where'd they come from? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=574.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=575.64s)]
*  You don't expect it. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=576.64s)]
*  There was nothing there. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=577.64s)]
*  It wasn't like we saw a cloud of mosquitoes, but we opened up. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=578.64s)]
*  It was an impossible amount of mosquitoes that got into the car. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=581.76s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=584.72s)]
*  In time here, I remember we would walk along the grass, this sort of tall grass with little [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=586.12s)]
*  flowers in it, exactly the kind of place you can imagine mammoths roaming and being like [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=590.5200000000001s)]
*  the kings of the universe there. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=595.0s)]
*  But as you were walking, you would kick up the grass and they would just emerge off of [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=596.5600000000001s)]
*  the needles of grass. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=601.36s)]
*  It was just really awful. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=602.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, they're so aggressive because they only have like three months to live. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=604.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=607.84s)]
*  And I learned actually, because I was curious about this, how do they survive if there are [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=608.84s)]
*  so few red blood, because mosquitoes mostly, they only take, it's only the females that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=612.48s)]
*  take a blood meal and they only take a blood meal when they're making eggs or making a [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=618.16s)]
*  brew. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=621.76s)]
*  They take it to reproduce. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=622.76s)]
*  Otherwise, they feed on nectar. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=623.76s)]
*  So how do these, how do so many mosquitoes survive in the Arctic if there's so few animals [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=624.76s)]
*  there? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=629.48s)]
*  And it turns out those mosquitoes are adapted to this climate and they don't need a blood [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=630.48s)]
*  meal to reproduce, but they do better if they get one. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=635.0799999999999s)]
*  So they're after you, but they don't need you. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=637.84s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=640.12s)]
*  It makes it worse. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=641.12s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=642.12s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=643.12s)]
*  It really is fascinating how aggressive they are. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=644.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=645.84s)]
*  Because, you know, Texas has mosquitoes, but they can live all year round. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=646.84s)]
*  So they kind of chill. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=650.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=651.12s)]
*  They're not that worried about you. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=652.12s)]
*  And my boss was so funny too. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=653.12s)]
*  Alan Cooper, the guy I went to work with, he was all, oh, I'm going to just wear this natural [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=654.6s)]
*  mosquito repellent and you don't need any of the stuff that actually has poisons in it. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=658.8s)]
*  Look at me at my natural. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=662.48s)]
*  And we're out there and the wind dries down, the mosquitoes come and I'm with my Deet. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=663.48s)]
*  I'm like, you know, your natural repellent. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=666.96s)]
*  And he's going, did you bring the Deet? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=669.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, yeah. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=671.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=673.0799999999999s)]
*  You give up on that natural stuff real quick. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=674.0799999999999s)]
*  I was watching a documentary where they're using pine pitch. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=675.68s)]
*  There's a, have you ever seen Werner Herzog's film, Happy People, Life and the Taiga? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=679.04s)]
*  It's really good. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=684.52s)]
*  It's really fascinating. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=685.56s)]
*  He follows these people that live on the Taiga River in Siberia. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=686.6s)]
*  Cool. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=690.48s)]
*  And it's all these subsistence people that are like fishing and trapping and they're [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=691.48s)]
*  living in these little cabins and they bring dogs with them everywhere. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=695.52s)]
*  They travel around on snowmobiles. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=698.88s)]
*  Really. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=700.76s)]
*  Well, what's amazing about it is the title is Happy People. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=701.76s)]
*  They're all happy. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=706.08s)]
*  That's what's so weird. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=707.32s)]
*  It's like these people have a very hard life, but yet they're always smiling and they're [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=708.32s)]
*  having a good time and, you know, living this subsistence lifestyle somehow or another is [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=713.36s)]
*  like very fulfilling at like a, I don't want to say a genetic level, but like an internal [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=719.12s)]
*  level. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=724.24s)]
*  There's something about it that like this makes sense. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=725.24s)]
*  Whereas society like today, I don't think it makes sense because I think we, you know, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=728.04s)]
*  you're a geneticist. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=733.92s)]
*  You understand genes. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=734.92s)]
*  We essentially have the same genes that people have 10,000 years ago had. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=736.12s)]
*  Very different world. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=739.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=740.96s)]
*  And we're not really designed for this world. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=741.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=744.56s)]
*  Well, you can see that in the increased rates of obesity, increased rates of diabetes. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=745.56s)]
*  We're not. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=749.12s)]
*  Also depression, anxiety, all that stuff. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=750.12s)]
*  And this is what Happy People is kind of all about. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=752.32s)]
*  I mean, Werner Herzog is this, you know, he's brilliant. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=754.8399999999999s)]
*  And so he's narrating this whole thing, too. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=757.8399999999999s)]
*  You kind of get this understanding of his appreciation for these people that are living [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=759.92s)]
*  this very basic life, but are very happy. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=764.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's impressive. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=769.5999999999999s)]
*  When we were up there in time, we'd flown for a couple of days in this really awful [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=770.9599999999999s)]
*  Russian helicopter that took off the third time it tried to because, you know, infrastructure [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=775.16s)]
*  doesn't work in Siberia is a repeated theme from. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=780.4s)]
*  You got a Siberian helicopter. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=783.2s)]
*  It was an MI8 and it was in a place called Khatanga, which is where we were based while [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=785.48s)]
*  we were trying to get out into. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=791.32s)]
*  And they kept loading all of our gear into this. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=793.5600000000001s)]
*  And it's mostly these massive gas tanks. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=796.4000000000001s)]
*  And you load all the gear into the gas tanks and then all of the people. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=798.6800000000001s)]
*  We had a dog Pasha who was with us who did not want to get in that helicopter. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=801.44s)]
*  I think the dog was the smartest person in our expedition team. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=804.6400000000001s)]
*  But they would load us up and they would try to start the helicopter and it wouldn't [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=810.12s)]
*  start and they would unload us. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=813.04s)]
*  We would go back to the places we were staying and then they would tinker with it and fix [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=814.1999999999999s)]
*  it anyway. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=817.28s)]
*  We flew out. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=818.28s)]
*  We got in the helicopter finally. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=819.28s)]
*  We got up into the air and then the Russian and French leaders of our expedition team [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=821.0s)]
*  decided that they were going to celebrate finally having taken off in this helicopter [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=827.02s)]
*  by smoking. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=830.8s)]
*  We're sitting on the gas tanks in this helicopter that we already think. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=832.7199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=838.12s)]
*  Fortunately, the helicopter had some missing windows. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=839.12s)]
*  So, you know, there was air flow. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=842.12s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=844.76s)]
*  No, this was insane. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=845.76s)]
*  This particular expedition was particularly insane compared to other things. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=847.32s)]
*  So also, I'm going to get to the story and eventually, but also in part of this, we were [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=852.4000000000001s)]
*  traveling forever out into this part of the time where they had predicted that we would [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=856.9200000000001s)]
*  be able to find mammoth bones and woolly rhino bones and all the bones of the animals we're [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=862.44s)]
*  interested in. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=866.3000000000001s)]
*  So we're flying out there and we start to land and I'm thinking, great, we're there. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=867.3000000000001s)]
*  I get out of this crazy fire bomb in the air that I'm in. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=871.08s)]
*  We're going to we let no. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=873.84s)]
*  No, we did not get off. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=875.24s)]
*  Instead, we picked up a random family that had been out there on their own. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=876.64s)]
*  Parents, a child. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=880.84s)]
*  Yeah, it was two parents and a child. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=881.84s)]
*  And they had backpack with their gear and a massive cooler. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=884.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=888.12s)]
*  That's what they had. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=889.12s)]
*  No words. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=890.12s)]
*  They're French. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=891.12s)]
*  They speak French to the team that's there. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=892.12s)]
*  People are having a conversation in Russian and then we take off again. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=893.36s)]
*  And I'm thinking, was that plan to pick these people up? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=897.72s)]
*  Were they trapped? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=900.4399999999999s)]
*  I think it was planned. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=901.4399999999999s)]
*  Just there was a lack of communication. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=902.9599999999999s)]
*  But whatever, the helicopter took off twice and then it landed and everybody unloaded [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=907.3199999999999s)]
*  and we set up the tent, the camp. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=912.0799999999999s)]
*  And we discovered over the course of the next few days, we built these cool boats, the zodiacs. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=914.72s)]
*  You blow them up and you bring out the outboard and you put them on the lake and we're looking [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=918.4399999999999s)]
*  around and we discovered that we had landed in a place where we were going to be for six [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=921.12s)]
*  weeks that had been glaciated during the last ice age, which meant that our chances of finding [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=924.6999999999999s)]
*  what we wanted were really small. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=930.16s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=932.48s)]
*  I know it was devastating. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=933.48s)]
*  And the Russian, we had a cook with us. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=936.6s)]
*  The Russian cooks had brought medical ethanol because it weighed less per unit of alcohol [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=940.7199999999999s)]
*  than vodka, which they would normally bring on the helicopter. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=946.4399999999999s)]
*  So they brought medical ethanol to drink. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=949.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=951.12s)]
*  Well, you know, you can only take so much stuff with you. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=952.12s)]
*  Because it weighs less than alcohol. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=954.92s)]
*  That's a crazy decision. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=957.0s)]
*  Well, you know, they decided it was safe. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=960.0400000000001s)]
*  Anyway, by three days in, it's 24 hour sunlight. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=962.5600000000001s)]
*  We're at 72 degrees latitude. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=966.48s)]
*  Did you try it? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=968.5600000000001s)]
*  The medical ethanol? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=970.24s)]
*  I tried the medical ethanol. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=971.24s)]
*  I mean, obviously. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=972.24s)]
*  You water it down with a little bit of river water and you have it with your freshly caught [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=974.24s)]
*  fish that you've laid. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=979.44s)]
*  And yeah, it's great. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=981.32s)]
*  We had fish and rice for the whole time. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=983.44s)]
*  So you had to catch your food. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=986.0s)]
*  We had to catch our food. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=987.6s)]
*  Luckily, it's probably a lot of fish up there. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=988.6s)]
*  Fish and there were some geese and some ducks that they would try to shoot while we were [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=990.6s)]
*  on our zodiacs. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=994.24s)]
*  Normally without telling us that they were about to shoot, it was a very. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=995.48s)]
*  So you just hear boom, boom. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=998.0s)]
*  Or you'd be sitting there looking at something and suddenly the zodiac would take off because [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1001.08s)]
*  whoever was in charge had seen something he wanted to shoot at in the distance. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1004.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't know why I'm telling this story. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1008.12s)]
*  Because it's fun. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1013.36s)]
*  It's a fun story. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1014.36s)]
*  So we were there. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1015.36s)]
*  We're there for, I don't know, maybe it was two or three days looking around and it was [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1016.48s)]
*  about two o'clock in the morning. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1020.32s)]
*  We were inside this little tent that we'd built so that we could eat in it, sort of [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1022.44s)]
*  the kitchen tent where we were. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1025.4s)]
*  And it was a big mesh tent to keep the mosquitoes out so that we didn't have to have everything. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1027.3s)]
*  And everybody is just staring off into the distance glumly. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1030.04s)]
*  The medical ethanol was gone. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1033.46s)]
*  Everybody was sober. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1035.44s)]
*  We were going to be for the next five weeks. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1036.44s)]
*  We were going to be stuck in this place where we weren't going to be able to find what we [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1038.0s)]
*  were. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1040.68s)]
*  And then all of a sudden these three dudes show up outside of our tent with machine guns. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1041.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1047.64s)]
*  And I'm thinking, everybody's thinking, what the fuck? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1048.64s)]
*  Like we just flew forever in a helicopter over nothing at all. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1052.52s)]
*  Nothing except for this French family that we picked up randomly along the way. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1058.48s)]
*  And everybody's looking around and there's this real moment of what the hell are we going [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1062.04s)]
*  to do? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1066.5600000000002s)]
*  And then the guy who was the expedition leader recognizes these two dudes and he's like, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1067.84s)]
*  raw friends. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1073.04s)]
*  Oh, good to see you. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1074.04s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1075.04s)]
*  And I'm thinking, what's going to happen when they realize we don't have any more vodka [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1076.04s)]
*  medical ethanol? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1081.1599999999999s)]
*  And it turns out that they were members of the Dolgan community, which is an actual family [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1083.52s)]
*  of subsistence people that still live up on the time era. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1089.6399999999999s)]
*  They heard reindeer and they had seen the helicopter and had wondered what we were up [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1092.36s)]
*  to and just set out over the landscape that they normally live on to try to find us. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1098.32s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1103.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1104.9599999999998s)]
*  Pretty cool, actually. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1105.9599999999998s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1106.9599999999998s)]
*  So did you hang out with those people? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1107.9599999999998s)]
*  Well, we did. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1108.9599999999998s)]
*  They were disappointed that we didn't have any alcohol, obviously. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1109.9599999999998s)]

*  The French couple said, I got this. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1201.98s)]
*  And they get up and they go back to their little tent area that they'd set up in the [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1204.88s)]
*  middle of nowhere and they bring back their cooler and they open it up and inside is cheese. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1208.18s)]
*  Like a massive Gouda and a massive Brie. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1217.18s)]
*  Why? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1224.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1225.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1226.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1228.38s)]
*  And they were happy with the cheese. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1229.38s)]
*  And so we cut the cheese and shared the cheese with our Dolgan friends and they were happy. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1230.38s)]
*  And the next day we took them back with the Zodiacs to their community. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1236.98s)]
*  And you know what was most amazing about this experience? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1241.0600000000002s)]
*  Everything about it was cool. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1245.5s)]
*  We saw these people that were living in these tiny little huts in part of the world where [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1246.5s)]
*  it goes to 40 below and it doesn't matter if it's Fahrenheit or Celsius because they [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1249.5400000000002s)]
*  cross at that level, right? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1253.2600000000002s)]
*  It's 40 below. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1254.5800000000002s)]
*  And during the winter for months and dark and they're herding reindeer and they're [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1256.22s)]
*  living in these tiny little things that they cut in half during the winter so that half [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1260.78s)]
*  of it is used for heating and half of it is used for the family to live in. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1264.58s)]
*  Everything that they own is on these things, on skids that the reindeer drag across the [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1267.82s)]
*  tundra, across the permafrost in the snow or in the summer trying to find the land for [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1272.5s)]
*  the animals to graze. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1278.94s)]
*  And this is how they live. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1280.42s)]
*  That was the only time in that experience where I could take off the headnet because [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1282.06s)]
*  the mosquitoes didn't care about me around those animals. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1287.06s)]
*  It was really impressive. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1289.82s)]
*  They only wanted to attack the animals? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1292.74s)]
*  They were after the animals and they really left us alone. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1294.62s)]
*  Probably because that's their natural source. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1297.62s)]
*  Yeah, more natural than, there's more of them there. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1299.5s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, maybe they're larger, but it was... [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1302.1399999999999s)]
*  They're probably accustomed to it, right? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1305.3s)]
*  Though also like for thousands of years they've probably been just feeding off of reindeer. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1306.78s)]
*  Yeah, I think about that though, but I think about that poor moose from Alaska who was [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1310.7s)]
*  also clearly bothered by the mosquitoes. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1314.58s)]
*  I imagine the reindeer were as well, but it was pretty cool. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1316.7s)]
*  Were these people riding the reindeer? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1319.8600000000001s)]
*  They did ride them. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1321.54s)]
*  In fact, I got to... [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1322.54s)]
*  They put me up there and showed me how I could ride the reindeer. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1323.54s)]
*  Is this their place? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1325.7s)]
*  Yes, yeah. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1326.7s)]
*  Wow. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1327.7s)]
*  So you were in this area? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1328.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1330.42s)]
*  Yeah, I was there during the summer though, so there wasn't snow on the ground. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1331.42s)]
*  It was all just a very grassy, wet, super wet grassy. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1334.26s)]
*  The moisture in the ground is probably why there are so many mosquitoes. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1337.74s)]
*  It is so fascinating to me that people will live like this generation after generation [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1341.66s)]
*  after generation. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1346.18s)]
*  And the fact that you can somehow... [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1348.22s)]
*  These are one of the weird animals, caribou are, that you can herd. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1349.74s)]
*  And people ride them. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1354.54s)]
*  And milk them. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1355.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1356.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1357.78s)]
*  And then occasionally whack one. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1358.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1359.78s)]
*  I mean, they're great, right? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1360.78s)]
*  Animals have always been a really great storage mechanism. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1362.5s)]
*  And that's one of the hypotheses about animal domestication. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1365.34s)]
*  Why did this take place? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1368.22s)]
*  If we had plants, but there are going to be years where there's plenty to eat and years [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1369.22s)]
*  where there's not enough to eat. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1372.46s)]
*  But in those years where there's plenty, if you store some of that nutrition in animals, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1373.6599999999999s)]
*  then in the years where there's less, you can eat those animals. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1378.8999999999999s)]
*  So it's a very safe way of storing what you can grow. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1381.3799999999999s)]
*  That's a fascinating way to look at storing. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1384.46s)]
*  I just want to know how they ever figured out how to herd those reindeer. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1386.6599999999999s)]
*  What did you do? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1390.8999999999999s)]
*  Who was the first person to figure out how to get them all to stay together? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1392.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1395.46s)]
*  I think that about a lot of domestic animals. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1396.46s)]
*  I also think that about milk. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1398.7s)]
*  Who was the first person who decided, I can have a go at that? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1400.82s)]
*  They're probably starving. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1405.62s)]
*  They must have tried everything. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1407.98s)]
*  I mean, that's how we found out what mushrooms are edible, right? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1408.98s)]
*  Because a large percentage of them will just kill you immediately. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1411.46s)]
*  But people are so desperate for anything. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1414.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1416.3799999999999s)]
*  Some of them are trying to tell you, though, by being like bright red or bright purple. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1417.3799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1420.4199999999998s)]
*  But we're dumb. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1422.14s)]
*  So we're like, bright red, I'll lick that. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1423.14s)]
*  Yeah, it might be an apple. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1424.6200000000001s)]
*  It's confusing. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1426.6200000000001s)]
*  Some bright red things are delicious. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1428.6200000000001s)]
*  It's really good for you. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1430.0600000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1432.02s)]
*  So these people that live up there, what was their history? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1433.02s)]
*  Had they been living up there their whole life? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1437.0600000000002s)]
*  Those particular individuals have, yeah. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1439.5s)]
*  But I think they have a long history. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1441.54s)]
*  The culture has a long history there. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1443.5800000000002s)]
*  And we're still, I think, we're still learning about how humans have dispersed around the [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1445.94s)]
*  world and how they got to be the places where they are today. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1450.34s)]
*  But I really think it's impressive that there are people who are hanging on to that culture. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1452.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1456.62s)]
*  And really able to, you know, they're trying now to relearn their native languages because [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1457.86s)]
*  during the communist era, they were all forced to learn Russian and speak Russian the same [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1462.58s)]
*  way as everyone else. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1466.86s)]
*  Even up there. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1469.06s)]
*  Even up there. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1469.98s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1470.98s)]
*  They sent an emissary and say, guys, it's time to speak the mother tongue. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1471.98s)]
*  They had to go to the squares like you see in Yakutsk and all these other places where [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1477.4199999999998s)]
*  they have the big squares with the speakers on the top where they would go for the daily [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1481.1399999999999s)]
*  admonishings or whatever from the Communist Party. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1485.1799999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1488.1s)]
*  What a weird way to live. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1489.34s)]
*  It's just it's so fascinating that there's pockets of these humans that live like this [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1490.86s)]
*  all over the world. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1495.02s)]
*  Obviously the people in the Amazon, the uncontacted tribes of the world, it's just so interesting. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1496.58s)]
*  And we have so much to learn from them. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1503.62s)]
*  It would be, I mean, obviously that's such a cool job, how getting to go and actually [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1506.78s)]
*  try to communicate with people who haven't been talked to before. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1510.82s)]
*  But you kind of don't want to because you don't want to ruin that. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1513.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1515.9399999999998s)]
*  Isn't that an interesting perspective? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1516.9399999999998s)]
*  Because I don't want to live like that. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1518.4199999999998s)]
*  Like I don't want to live in the Amazon. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1519.74s)]
*  I'm going to leaf over my private parts. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1520.74s)]
*  But we assume they do. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1523.1s)]
*  Not even for a week? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1524.1s)]
*  Nope. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1525.1s)]
*  Don't want to do it. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1526.1s)]
*  There's so many things out there that will eat you. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1527.1s)]
*  There's so many bugs that can kill you and snakes that can kill you. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1529.54s)]
*  It's like, uh-uh. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1532.98s)]
*  I'd rather watch a video. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1534.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1536.26s)]
*  David Attenborough documentary. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1537.26s)]
*  I don't want to go there. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1538.26s)]
*  I have a good friend who lives there, Paul Rosalie. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1540.5s)]
*  He goes there all the time. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1542.82s)]
*  He's been on the podcast a few times. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1543.82s)]
*  And he lives in the Amazon. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1545.6200000000001s)]
*  And his whole thing is he's there protecting the rainforest. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1547.46s)]
*  And what they do is they take these people that are, they're just poor people that have [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1551.3s)]
*  no options and they're loggers. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1555.9s)]
*  And so he pays them more money to protect the rainforest. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1558.26s)]
*  So they get to quit the logging job and then protect the rainforest. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1561.98s)]
*  And then through funding, they buy a parcel of land and protect it and save it. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1565.58s)]
*  But he's had some gnarly encounters with uncontacted people where at one point in time they realized [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1570.1s)]
*  they were actually being hunted and they barely escaped with their life. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1575.38s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1579.3s)]
*  And you start hearing weird noises in the bushes and then you realize like, oh boy, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1580.3s)]
*  these are people. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1583.82s)]
*  Like, we're being stalked right now. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1584.82s)]
*  By the most sophisticated hunting animal out there. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1588.26s)]
*  Not only that, I would imagine at the stage that these people are at, they've been living [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1591.26s)]
*  there for thousands and thousands of years. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1597.1s)]
*  They probably have incredible perception, incredible senses. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1599.5s)]
*  Because they have to. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1603.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1604.78s)]
*  They probably knew these people were coming a long time ago. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1605.78s)]
*  They probably heard the boat coming down the river. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1608.3799999999999s)]
*  They prepared. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1611.7399999999998s)]
*  They got ready. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1612.8999999999999s)]
*  They know where all the paths are. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1613.8999999999999s)]
*  They know which way the people would go. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1616.8999999999999s)]
*  Like, you're utterly helpless. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1618.54s)]
*  How did he get out of this? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1620.42s)]
*  They got out just in time. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1621.42s)]
*  Just in time. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1622.98s)]
*  They just escaped. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1623.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1624.98s)]
*  But one of his friends, one of the people that he was working with, did not. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1625.98s)]
*  They would have these gifts. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1629.0200000000002s)]
*  So they would take these rafts and try to make contact with these people. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1631.6200000000001s)]
*  They would float these rafts towards them filled with food. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1635.42s)]
*  And they were doing this as like a peace gesture. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1638.6200000000001s)]
*  And this guy had done this several times. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1642.0600000000002s)]
*  And then one time he didn't come back and they found him filled with arrows. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1643.94s)]
*  Wow. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1647.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they just killed him. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1648.5800000000002s)]
*  And they just decided, you know, maybe they had a bad experience with some other person [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1649.78s)]
*  from some other Westerner. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1654.3s)]
*  And they decided, you know, we're done. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1656.1799999999998s)]
*  But they're rightly terrified of humans because when these people that come in that want to [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1657.9399999999998s)]
*  extract resources, whether it's the loggers or whatever it is, if there's some minerals [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1666.74s)]
*  or anything else they find there, they just kill everybody. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1671.4199999999998s)]
*  There's horrific human rights violations that occur there. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1674.34s)]
*  They just hire the worst people in the world to go in and wipe out these tribes because [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1678.42s)]
*  these tribes are resisting them taking over this land. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1682.1s)]
*  We have a history of this. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1686.1s)]
*  Yeah, we do. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1687.3s)]
*  We have a deep history, which is really fascinating about the Amazon in particular, because we've [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1688.62s)]
*  had a bunch of conversations on one of them recently with Luke Caverns, where we went [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1693.46s)]
*  over the LIDAR discoveries of these sophisticated grids and all the stuff that's in the Amazon [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1698.3s)]
*  where they really thought that this was just rainforest forever. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1705.54s)]
*  And then slowly over time, they realized, no, there was like a huge civilization here [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1709.34s)]
*  of millions of people. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1712.7s)]
*  So these people that are the uncontacted people, I mean, I wonder how many of them were like [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1714.54s)]
*  the preppers of the Amazon world from, you know, 4,000 years ago or whatever it was. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1719.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1725.86s)]
*  Or it wasn't even that long ago. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1726.86s)]
*  The Percy Fawcett, Percy Fawcett, right? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1727.86s)]
*  That's his name? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1730.1s)]
*  The guy who one of the guys who that's he's the main character in that book, The Lost [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1731.1799999999998s)]
*  City of Z. He's one of the people that went there. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1737.1s)]
*  When they when the first settlers went there, when the first explorers went there, they [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1739.62s)]
*  talked about these incredible, like sophisticated civilizations. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1743.78s)]
*  And then people went back 100 years and there was none of that. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1748.54s)]
*  So they thought that they had just made it up. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1751.2199999999998s)]
*  It turns out the first people probably gave these folks horrible diseases and it wiped [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1753.2199999999998s)]
*  out millions of people. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1759.42s)]
*  And then the jungle just consumed whatever structures and houses and stuff that they [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1760.82s)]
*  had. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1765.26s)]
*  And all that's left is these grids that you can see when you fly over in Lidar. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1766.26s)]
*  That's so cool. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1770.1s)]
*  You can see those when you're flying over any part of the world, really. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1771.3799999999999s)]
*  I noticed it recently was flying over Europe and you can see the old trellises from old, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1774.78s)]
*  you know, I don't know how old, but it's just so cool how we can see remnants of civilizations [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1779.42s)]
*  and just makes you think what happened? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1784.1s)]
*  Like this is some of the coolest mysteries. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1786.3s)]
*  That's what's so cool about working in ancient DNA, too, is we can just go to places, get [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1790.1000000000001s)]
*  DNA from stuff and learn something that we never knew before. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1793.3400000000001s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1797.26s)]
*  So you get interested in DNA. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1798.3s)]
*  You go to Siberia, all that jazz. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1801.3400000000001s)]
*  How do you get started working with a company like Colossal? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1803.46s)]
*  How does that take place? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1807.48s)]
*  All of us working in ancient DNA, we are constantly answering the same question from the media, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1809.8200000000002s)]
*  which is, when are we going to bring dinosaurs back to Lidar? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1817.4199999999998s)]
*  Because Jurassic Park? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1820.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1821.34s)]
*  Great. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1822.34s)]
*  We're so simple. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1823.34s)]
*  One great movie and everybody's like, when's that going to happen? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1825.78s)]
*  And people say, people actually say that my field was spawned by Jurassic Park. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1829.98s)]
*  The whole idea that we could get DNA stuff, that's not true. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1835.62s)]
*  It was actually the other way around. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1837.94s)]
*  And Michael Crichton, when he wrote the book that became the movie, he credited a lab at [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1839.98s)]
*  Berkeley, Alan Wilson's group, the extinct species study group, which was the first group [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1845.22s)]
*  to show that you could get DNA in something after it died. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1849.98s)]
*  That was actually from a quagga, which is a type of zebra. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1853.38s)]
*  They had gotten... [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1856.1000000000001s)]
*  What a cool name. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1857.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1858.1000000000001s)]
*  Well, in Dutch, in South Africa, they actually say the quagga. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1859.1000000000001s)]
*  Oh, even better. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1862.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1863.8600000000001s)]
*  It's better that way. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1864.8600000000001s)]
*  But it's kind of bad for the microphone, probably. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1865.8600000000001s)]
*  Gross. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1868.8600000000001s)]
*  I think it's the sound they're supposed to make. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1869.8600000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1872.78s)]
*  Oh. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1873.78s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1875.34s)]
*  Anyway, they showed that you could get DNA from this skin. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1876.34s)]
*  And everybody was like, that is the coolest thing that I've heard in a long time. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1879.5s)]
*  That must mean we can bring dinosaurs back to life. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1884.22s)]
*  And everybody started racing to get the oldest and coolest DNA. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1886.06s)]
*  And so there were papers in the best journals of science that never published anything that's [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1891.22s)]
*  wrong ever, ever, that said, look, here's dinosaur DNA. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1894.94s)]
*  And look, here's DNA from a myosin-aged leaf. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1898.8999999999999s)]
*  And look, here's this. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1902.1s)]
*  All of it is crap. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1903.4199999999998s)]
*  We now know. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1905.86s)]
*  In fact, the first dinosaur DNA sequences that were published, if you took them at the [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1906.86s)]
*  time and you typed them into the internet and you compared them to the earliest of what [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1911.86s)]
*  is today this big repository of all DNA sequences of everything that's ever been sequenced, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1917.4599999999998s)]
*  what came back was a close match to a bird. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1921.9399999999998s)]
*  We now know, because there's more DNA sequences there, that it was a chicken, an exact match [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1925.6599999999999s)]
*  to a chicken. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1930.42s)]
*  And some investigative work found that the excavation team had been working on those [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1931.34s)]
*  bones had fried chicken for lunch every day. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1935.94s)]
*  So it's chicken contamination. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1938.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1941.74s)]
*  It's like greasy fingers on your dinosaur fossils. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1942.74s)]
*  And look, now we have ancient DNA. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1945.3s)]
*  That is hilarious. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1947.82s)]
*  That's how little they knew about DNA. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1950.14s)]
*  What year was this around? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1951.66s)]
*  That would be the early 90s. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1952.82s)]
*  The early 90s. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1954.86s)]
*  And when was DNA first discovered? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1956.12s)]
*  The idea of DNA is much older than that. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1958.9799999999998s)]
*  What really helped this field along was the invention of PCR. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1964.3s)]
*  It's an acronym for polymerase chain reaction. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1968.4599999999998s)]
*  It's a way of... [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1971.2199999999998s)]
*  Carey Mullis. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1972.2199999999998s)]
*  Carey Mullis, who discovered the idea of PCR while he was high on a road trip. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1973.2199999999998s)]
*  On LSD. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1976.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1977.26s)]
*  That's right. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1978.26s)]
*  We should all do LSD, I think, because clearly you have your best ideas when you're high. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1979.26s)]
*  Some people have great ideas. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1982.3s)]
*  Some people go kooky. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1983.86s)]
*  Some people lose their marbles and never come back. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1985.82s)]
*  I think I probably would not have good ideas on LSD, but I'm willing to give it a shot. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1988.22s)]
*  I like your scientific exploration mind. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1992.9s)]
*  A good scientist always wants to know. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1995.9s)]
*  You never know. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1997.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1998.78s)]
*  Maybe there's a breakthrough waiting behind that little piece of paper. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=1999.78s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2002.78s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2003.78s)]
*  But you never know. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2004.78s)]
*  Anyway, he discovered a way to photocopy DNA to make lots of copies of the same thing, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2005.78s)]
*  which then made it possible to learn the sequence using the technologies of the day. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2009.66s)]
*  And that was what made it possible really for ancient DNA to take off, was this ability [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2013.7s)]
*  to photocopy. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2017.3799999999999s)]
*  Because when an animal dies or plant dies, the DNA in the cell starts to get chopped [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2018.3799999999999s)]
*  up into smaller and smaller pieces by things like UV. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2022.86s)]
*  We go out in the sun, we put sunscreen on, and that stops the UV from breaking our DNA. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2026.94s)]
*  But it's not terrible to get some sunlight, as you probably just saw. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2032.06s)]
*  There was an article out saying, hey dummies, we need some sunlight in order to make vitamin [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2035.3s)]
*  D. But we have a repair mechanism so that when your DNA breaks, it doesn't stay that [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2039.62s)]
*  way. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2045.1399999999999s)]
*  But once you're dead, you no longer have the energy for that to work. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2046.98s)]
*  And so these damaged parts of DNA accumulate. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2050.3s)]
*  And also things like bacteria and microbes get in there and chew up the DNA to recycle [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2053.54s)]
*  the animal to the next generation or plant or whatever. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2058.1400000000003s)]
*  And so the DNA that we get in an old thing, like a mammoth bone, is really short fragments, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2061.08s)]
*  like maybe 30 or 40 or 50 letters of DNA long. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2066.6600000000003s)]
*  In comparison, if I were to take a swab from my cheek and sequence that, I could get strings [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2071.3s)]
*  that are hundreds of millions of letters long. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2075.74s)]
*  This is living DNA. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2078.02s)]
*  So ancient DNA is in really crap condition. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2079.8199999999997s)]
*  And it's also mixed with stuff. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2083.3799999999997s)]
*  So if I extract DNA from a mammoth, I'll get some mammoth DNA. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2085.6s)]
*  But I'll get a lot of those microbes that are in there chewing up DNA. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2089.7s)]
*  I'll probably get some of my DNA because I touched that mammoth bone. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2093.3799999999997s)]
*  Get DNA from whoever else touched that thing. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2096.9399999999996s)]
*  This has been a real problem in archaeology because we're trying to get DNA from humans. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2099.2599999999998s)]
*  But we are humans. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2103.58s)]
*  And so we touch these things. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2104.7s)]
*  And then I don't know if it's my DNA or if that thing DNA. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2106.02s)]
*  This episode is brought to you by The Farmer's Dog. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2110.22s)]
*  If you're anything like me, you love your dog. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2113.6s)]
*  You want what's best for your furry pal. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2115.8599999999997s)]
*  But figuring out what that is can be a real headache. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2118.18s)]
*  There's a lot of misinformation out there, especially around dog food. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2122.14s)]
*  Take kibble, for example. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2126.18s)]
*  Almost everyone has probably fed their dog kibble at some point. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2128.14s)]
*  But if you do a little digging, you may find out how ultra-processed it is. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2131.46s)]
*  Luckily, there's a better option for you out there. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2135.66s)]
*  Real food from people who care about what goes into your dog's body, like The Farmer's [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2138.54s)]
*  Dog. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2144.62s)]
*  They make fresh food that's so simple. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2145.62s)]
*  No magical or miracle recipes. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2148.66s)]
*  Just meat and vegetables, lightly cooked, complete and balanced for your dog's needs. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2151.42s)]
*  And it's all developed by board-certified nutritionists with the same safety standards [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2157.7s)]
*  as our food. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2162.9399999999996s)]
*  When you make the switch, you'll see a massive impact. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2164.74s)]
*  It can help your dogs be healthier, happier and more energetic. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2167.4199999999996s)]

*  predictors of a longer, healthier life. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2186.7s)]
*  Look, no one, dog or human, should be eating overly processed foods for every meal. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2189.74s)]
*  And it doesn't matter how old your dog is. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2195.46s)]

*  In my lab at Santa Cruz and in ancient DNA labs around the world, we have these really [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2229.66s)]
*  sophisticated... [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2233.94s)]
*  It's like working in a virus lab where you're scared of everything, but we turn it around. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2234.94s)]
*  So rather than having the air being sucked in, we're trying to push the air out. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2240.74s)]
*  We don't want any air coming in. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2243.74s)]
*  We wear these suits where it looks like we're terrified with a face mask and the hair net, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2247.14s)]
*  and we're totally covered, and we bleach everything. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2251.3799999999997s)]
*  It's not because we're afraid of those bones. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2253.74s)]
*  We're afraid that we're going to get our DNA in that bone, and then we're not going to [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2255.4199999999996s)]
*  be able to do our work. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2259.02s)]
*  Of course. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2260.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2261.02s)]
*  So it took that and the ability to amplify those tiny little pieces of DNA for us to [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2262.02s)]
*  really figure out that we could get DNA out of things. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2266.14s)]
*  For a long time, people thought we were never going to get DNA out of Neanderthal bones [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2269.46s)]
*  because of this problem. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2273.06s)]
*  We touch a bone, we're just going to get human DNA, and we're never going to be able to know [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2275.38s)]
*  the difference. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2279.02s)]
*  But then with PCR and with the ability to work in these clean labs and distinguish, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2280.18s)]
*  we eventually got whole Neanderthal genomes, which I think is probably one of the crowning [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2284.56s)]
*  achievements of my field. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2288.7s)]
*  Ancient DNA, Svante Pabbo won the Nobel Prize a few years ago for this. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2290.3s)]
*  What did they extract it from? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2293.62s)]
*  Bones, different bones. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2295.7400000000002s)]
*  The very first Neanderthal genome sequence was actually a mixture of several bones because [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2298.02s)]
*  there wasn't very much DNA in any of them, and they were able to pull it together. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2302.42s)]
*  Actually, my husband, who was on part of that team, who put together the first Neanderthal [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2306.02s)]
*  genome sequence. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2309.3s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2310.3s)]
*  Yeah, it was cool. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2311.3s)]
*  That's really cool. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2312.3s)]
*  But then the Denisovans, the Denisova people, that was just a tiny little piece of a finger [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2313.3s)]
*  bone that they had no idea was going to belong to a totally new species of human. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2319.22s)]
*  They were able to get a really high coverage whole genome out of this tiny little finger [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2324.5s)]
*  bone that totally rewrote what we thought we knew about evolutionary history. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2328.9s)]
*  And that's pretty recently, right? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2333.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2335.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2336.62s)]
*  Within the last decade. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2337.62s)]
*  Jamie and I, we did a podcast recently where we were talking about the big head people. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2338.62s)]
*  What are they called again? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2342.02s)]
*  Juliani or something? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2343.02s)]
*  Juliennes? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2344.02s)]
*  I've seen this. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2345.02s)]
*  This is really recently. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2346.02s)]
*  Yeah, super recent. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2347.02s)]
*  It was like December of 2020 for they released this paper. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2348.02s)]
*  Yeah, super cool. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2353.34s)]
*  And it just highlights how much we don't know. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2355.1800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2357.82s)]
*  How every, especially in paleoanthropology, and this is a field where people will take [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2358.82s)]
*  like, yeah. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2363.82s)]
*  Juliren. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2364.82s)]
*  Julirenesis. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2365.82s)]
*  That's it. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2366.82s)]
*  Lost species of humans with an abnormally large skull, which lived alongside Homo sapiens. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2367.82s)]
*  So they died off somewhere. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2373.38s)]
*  They lived in China between 300,000 and 50,000 years ago. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2375.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2379.34s)]
*  And so if they were able to breed with humans, they probably did. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2380.34s)]
*  And they probably bred with Neanderthals and they probably bred with Denisovans because [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2383.58s)]
*  that's what we do. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2387.38s)]
*  Wild stuff. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2388.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2389.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2390.38s)]
*  And then of course the Hobbit people, the Island of Flores people. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2391.38s)]
*  Yeah, Flores. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2394.42s)]
*  A little tiny. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2395.42s)]
*  No one has still been able to get DNA from those samples now, but I mean, someday it'll [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2396.5s)]
*  happen. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2402.1s)]
*  We've tried, Sponti's team has tried, a lot of people have attempted. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2403.1s)]
*  They're too degraded. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2407.2599999999998s)]
*  They're from a hot place. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2408.2599999999998s)]
*  All of those things that degrade DNA, it happens faster in hot places. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2409.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2414.1800000000003s)]
*  There's probably a lot more to be discovered too. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2415.1800000000003s)]
*  So much. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2417.94s)]
*  They only really found it out of one location, right? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2418.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2421.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2422.2200000000003s)]
*  And one thing that people have tested, actually this again was work that my husband did, was [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2423.2200000000003s)]
*  whether the people who live there today, the Rompasasa people, are related to them and [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2427.42s)]
*  they're not. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2431.38s)]
*  It seems like, because they're small as well. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2432.38s)]
*  And the question is, is there something weird about them? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2435.42s)]
*  This is actually really cool. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2437.98s)]
*  It was a really cool result. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2439.02s)]
*  It's hard to know exactly what bits of changes in your DNA code for making you big or small. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2442.1800000000003s)]
*  But clearly it's not just one thing because there's not just people my size and people [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2447.3s)]
*  normal size. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2451.46s)]
*  I'm only five feet tall, right? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2452.46s)]
*  We have a big spectrum of them. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2453.86s)]
*  So there's lots of different genes that are involved with this. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2455.6600000000003s)]
*  But we kind of have an idea of where those genes are in a genome and what they might [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2458.3s)]
*  be. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2462.9s)]
*  And with these people who are all small, the idea, the hypothesis was that there was some [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2463.9s)]
*  new thing in their DNA that led to them being small. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2468.94s)]
*  But it wasn't. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2473.1s)]
*  They just are at the extreme of all the things we already know. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2474.1s)]
*  Is it just island dwarfism? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2476.86s)]
*  It's just a small population on an island. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2478.3s)]
*  Different alleles go to fixation. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2481.7400000000002s)]
*  And yes, I mean, weird things happen on islands. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2483.1s)]
*  Elephants even. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2485.6200000000003s)]
*  Elephants dwarfed. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2486.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but dodos. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2487.6200000000003s)]
*  Dodos got bigger. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2488.6200000000003s)]
*  And so do lizards. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2489.82s)]
*  They dwarf or they get bigger? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2490.82s)]
*  They get bigger. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2492.38s)]
*  Yeah, like the Komodo. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2493.38s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2494.38s)]
*  That's one of the scariest animals. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2495.38s)]
*  Creepiest animal. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2497.06s)]
*  I'm so embarrassed to tell you how many times I've watched videos of them eating large animals [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2498.54s)]
*  whole. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2502.46s)]
*  Like cattle? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2503.46s)]
*  Yeah, they eat sheep and monkeys. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2504.46s)]
*  It's horrific. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2506.34s)]
*  Why do we watch that? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2507.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2508.58s)]
*  You're like, is this going to happen? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2509.58s)]
*  You open up Instagram like, oh no. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2511.7799999999997s)]
*  You see this pork oat and you see this slobbery lizard. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2514.02s)]
*  And you can't help it. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2516.38s)]
*  You're like, I'm going to watch. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2517.38s)]
*  They're so gross. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2518.66s)]
*  Their mouth is filled with botulism. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2519.66s)]
*  Is that what kills them? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2522.86s)]
*  The botulism? [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2524.02s)]
*  I think there's a venom as well. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2525.02s)]
*  They think there's a lot of toxins in their mouth. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2526.18s)]
*  And I think there's also a venom. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2528.66s)]
*  I think they used to think it was just poison, just botulism and just various bacteria. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2530.58s)]
*  But now I believe they think it's a venom. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2536.98s)]
*  I watched another horrible video where they would bite this buffalo. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2539.3s)]
*  They just bite its hindquarters and then follow it while the venom is slowly like taking its [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2544.02s)]
*  running its toll through the body. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2551.58s)]
*  And then eventually the poor buffalo gets to the point where it can't move and they [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2553.46s)]
*  start eating it alive. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2556.5s)]
*  I think I've seen that one. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2557.58s)]
*  I do. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2558.7s)]
*  I think I've seen that one. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2559.7s)]
*  Nature is so rough. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2560.7s)]
*  Would you go? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2562.66s)]
*  It's so brutal. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2563.66s)]
*  To Komodo Island? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2564.66s)]
*  No chance. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2565.66s)]
*  Really? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2566.66s)]
*  I remember Sharon Stone's husband. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2567.66s)]
*  I believe he was either a journalist or someone who owned a newspaper or something like that. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2571.58s)]
*  And they went to see the Komodo dragons at the zoo. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2576.62s)]
*  I think it was in San Francisco. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2579.9s)]
*  They took their shoes off when they enter into this Komodo dragon area to not contaminate. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2582.38s)]
*  And apparently he had white socks on and they decided that his foot looked delicious. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2587.42s)]
*  And they bit him. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2592.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2593.78s)]
*  Yeah, it bit him. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2594.78s)]
*  I don't know what happened with that. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2595.78s)]
*  This was an ex-husband of hers back in the dis-e. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2597.2s)]
*  Maybe that's what she planned for the ex. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2600.52s)]
*  I don't think she did. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2601.86s)]
*  I think it was just one of those things where this guy just didn't know what he was getting [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2602.86s)]
*  into and shouldn't have had white socks on. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2606.3s)]
*  Sure, it's just doing what a Komodo dragon does and biting whatever it can. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2608.74s)]
*  I wouldn't have thought white socks. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2613.22s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2614.9799999999996s)]
*  Bronstein underwent surgery to reattach several thousand severed tendon sand to rebuild his [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2615.9799999999996s)]
*  big toe that was crushed by the dragon's jaws. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2625.1s)]
*  It's just missing his face. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2628.58s)]
*  Oh, tendon sand. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2631.2999999999997s)]
*  So he was able to pry open the reptile's mouth and escape through a small feeding door [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2634.02s)]
*  in the cage while the zookeeper distracted the dragon. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2639.18s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2642.22s)]
*  Wait, he was in the feeding cage? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2643.22s)]
*  Yeah, whoopsies. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2645.38s)]
*  Oh, they mistook his white tennis shoes. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2646.9s)]
*  That's what it was. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2650.74s)]
*  It wasn't socks. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2651.74s)]
*  So this story is old. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2652.74s)]
*  This story is from... [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2653.74s)]
*  They had him taken off. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2654.74s)]
*  It wasn't a shoe. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2655.74s)]
*  Oh, they had him remove his white... [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2656.74s)]
*  Oh, it was a shoeless foot. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2657.74s)]
*  Oh, so they thought that his tennis shoes would look like the rats. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2660.4599999999996s)]
*  So they told him to take your shoes off so they don't look like the rats instead it looks [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2665.02s)]
*  like flesh. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2669.18s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2670.18s)]
*  Sorry, this sounds like someone did a dumb thing. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2671.18s)]
*  Absolutely, a lot of dumb things. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2675.2599999999998s)]
*  What year was this, Jamie? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2678.1s)]
*  2001. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2680.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2681.1s)]
*  Well, bad decisions, bad outcomes. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2682.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2685.5s)]
*  No, I'm not going to Komodo Island. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2686.5s)]
*  Or in the feeding cage at a zoo. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2690.5s)]
*  No, no, I'm not going to any of those places. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2691.5s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2694.5s)]
*  I get it. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2696.2599999999998s)]
*  I know what they are. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2697.2599999999998s)]
*  I can watch them through the cage. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2698.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2700.1s)]
*  I don't need the additional thrill. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2701.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2702.54s)]
*  But there are places where there are big things like dodos that are amazing and probably not [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2703.54s)]
*  going to kill you. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2708.02s)]
*  Sure, there's some stuff that won't kill you, like giraffes. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2709.02s)]
*  Giraffes, I've been told that a giraffe is the dumbest animal. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2711.8599999999997s)]
*  Really? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2715.74s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know this and I wouldn't have suspected it because they're so gorgeous. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2716.74s)]
*  And you wouldn't think that something that gorgeous would be so dumb. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2719.54s)]
*  But I have friends who are, Matt James, who's the chief animal officer at Colossal, he's [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2721.9s)]
*  worked with at lots of different zoos throughout his career. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2726.18s)]
*  And he's told me that there are multiple occasions where he has had to save a giraffe from accidentally [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2728.54s)]
*  killing itself because it's so dumb. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2733.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2735.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, they're so kind that they let babies feed them. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2736.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2739.94s)]
*  There's nothing going on. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2740.94s)]
*  When my kids were little, you could go to the San Diego Zoo and you would give them [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2742.5s)]
*  And little babies are allowed to hold up, like a two-year-old can hold up their arm [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2747.94s)]
*  and this enormous tongue comes wrapping around that piece of lettuce and they giggle and [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2751.7000000000003s)]
*  everything. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2755.86s)]
*  But they trust them so much that they let little kids feed them. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2756.86s)]
*  They set it up so people can feed these and they seem so calm. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2759.5s)]
*  Docile. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2764.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2765.7400000000002s)]
*  They're just happy they're not getting eaten by lions. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2766.7400000000002s)]
*  Sounds a little dangerous to me, though, if they are genuinely stupid, will they accidentally [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2768.06s)]
*  at some point take that baby's hand? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2772.42s)]
*  And then they have huge, strong necks. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2773.82s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2776.7400000000002s)]
*  They fight each other with their necks. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2777.7400000000002s)]
*  This is, they're kind of smart. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2778.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2779.7400000000002s)]
*  But this is, I don't know. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2780.7400000000002s)]
*  The ability to make inferences based on statistical information has so far been tested only on [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2782.6200000000003s)]
*  animals having large brains in relation to their body size, like primates and parrots. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2787.1000000000004s)]
*  They tested giraffes, despite having a smaller relative brain size, can rely on relative [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2791.5s)]
*  frequencies to predict sampling outcomes. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2796.1800000000003s)]
*  They presented them with two transparent containers filled with different quantities of highly [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2798.82s)]
*  liked food and less preferred food. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2803.6800000000003s)]
*  The experimenter covertly drew one piece of food from each container and let the giraffes [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2806.86s)]
*  choose between the two options. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2811.7799999999997s)]
*  In the first task, we varied the quantity and relative frequency of the highly liked [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2813.02s)]
*  and less preferred food pieces. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2817.8199999999997s)]
*  In the second task, we inserted a physical barrier in both containers so giraffes only [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2819.2599999999998s)]
*  had to take into account the upper part of the container when predicting the outcome. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2823.38s)]
*  In both tasks, giraffes successfully selected the container more likely to provide highly [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2827.46s)]
*  liked food, integrating physical information to correctly predict sampling information. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2831.98s)]
*  Huh. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2837.02s)]
*  I mean, cool. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2838.02s)]
*  But I also trust a person who has tried to keep giraffes from killing themselves by doing [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2840.42s)]
*  dumb things to tell me that a giraffe isn't always making the best decisions. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2845.1s)]
*  Perhaps they're intelligent for the environment they belong in. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2849.78s)]
*  I'm sure that's true. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2853.22s)]
*  I mean, otherwise, that's how evolution works. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2854.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2856.26s)]
*  But when you put them in the zoo, they're like, look, we have all our food. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2857.26s)]
*  There's a wire I can get my neck stuck in. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2859.34s)]
*  Like a kid that never leaves his parents' basement and plays Call of Duty till he's [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2861.66s)]
*  35 probably doesn't have the best social intelligence. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2866.58s)]
*  Probably going to be pretty awkward when you get them out in the wild. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2870.58s)]
*  Probably. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2874.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2875.78s)]
*  It's probably the same thing with giraffes. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2876.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2877.78s)]
*  Did you hear that, James? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2878.78s)]
*  Talking to my 15-year-old. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2879.78s)]
*  Oh, as you play a lot of video games? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2880.78s)]
*  They're very addictive. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2882.66s)]
*  It's a real problem. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2883.66s)]
*  And they're going to get worse. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2884.66s)]
*  They're going to get way better. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2885.66s)]
*  Because science makes things more and more addictive. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2887.74s)]
*  One of the things they're really good at, these designers. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2891.58s)]
*  And algorithms. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2895.3399999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2896.3399999999997s)]
*  But they're just so good at making games that are just incredibly compelling. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2897.3399999999997s)]
*  And fun. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2900.18s)]
*  Oh, so fun. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2901.18s)]
*  Way more fun than going outside and getting bullied. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2902.18s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2904.58s)]
*  You could be a badass at Call of Duty. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2907.14s)]
*  All you do is sit in there. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2908.7s)]
*  Or War Thunder. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2910.7s)]
*  That's the game that my son is into. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2911.7s)]
*  War Thunder. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2913.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't know about that one. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2914.2599999999998s)]
*  What's that one? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2915.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2916.78s)]
*  Pretty crazy stuff. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2917.78s)]
*  Just imagine if you could take one of those Denisovans and show them that. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2921.98s)]
*  That is an interesting question. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2926.0600000000004s)]
*  What would we do? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2928.0200000000004s)]
*  If we could bring a Neanderthal or a Denisovan back, de-extinct one of them. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2929.0200000000004s)]
*  We are not doing that at Colossal. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2933.3s)]
*  They're humans. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2934.78s)]
*  We cannot ask them for consent to do this. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2935.78s)]
*  We're not working on them. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2937.0600000000004s)]
*  You won't. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2938.98s)]
*  China's like, tell me more. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2939.98s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2945.5s)]
*  I think it's a bad idea. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2946.5s)]
*  But if they do, I would like to know. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2948.1s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of people that think bringing dire wolves back is a bad idea. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2949.1s)]
*  Well, I mean, what did you think of the dire wolves? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2952.74s)]
*  Well, fortunately, after the last podcast I did with Ben, I did actually get to go visit [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2955.74s)]
*  them and I was blown away. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2960.7s)]
*  It's extraordinary. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2963.22s)]
*  It's so wide. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2964.3s)]
*  I mean, it's one thing to see them in photographs, but it's another thing to be close to them [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2965.3s)]
*  where you're outside. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2970.34s)]
*  There's no fence between you and them and you look in their eyes and like, that is a [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2972.22s)]
*  different animal. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2976.4599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2977.4599999999996s)]
*  That is a totally different. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2978.4599999999996s)]
*  I've seen wolves before. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2979.4599999999996s)]
*  That is a totally different animal. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2980.4599999999996s)]
*  I've never seen a wolf in the wild though. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2982.06s)]
*  I saw one, but it was like running across the road at a distance and it was dusk. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2983.58s)]
*  That was in Alberta. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2988.3799999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of wolves up there. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2989.3799999999997s)]
*  But that I've never seen. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2991.1s)]
*  I've never like looked in one's eyes and it's like, these aren't even that old. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2993.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2998.1s)]
*  You know, they were more than six months old. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=2999.1s)]
*  They were almost a hundred pounds already. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3001.82s)]
*  And they have this look in their eyes. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3005.02s)]
*  You can see they're bigger, they're more muscular and you see that coat, the dire wolf coat. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3006.58s)]
*  It's extraordinary. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3012.14s)]
*  The mane that they have. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3013.14s)]
*  It's very, it's really incredible. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3014.3s)]
*  And then there's a little female, Khaleesi. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3016.62s)]
*  She's adorable. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3019.18s)]
*  And she is like a puppy right now. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3020.18s)]
*  You were able to hold her? [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3021.66s)]
*  She's adorable. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3023.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3024.42s)]
*  She nibbles on your fingers. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3025.42s)]
*  She's a little thing, but she's, you know, one day going to be 140 pounds. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3027.18s)]
*  You can't get anywhere near her. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3031.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3032.2599999999998s)]
*  Which is really crazy. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3033.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3034.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm glad you got to see the boys before. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3035.2599999999998s)]
*  They were probably already a little bit standoffish. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3036.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3038.02s)]
*  Especially compared to Khaleesi. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3039.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3040.02s)]
*  Yeah, they're standoffish. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3041.02s)]
*  They get fairly close though within like 20 feet of you checking you out. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3042.02s)]
*  They pee all over the place. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3046.42s)]
*  You know. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3048.2599999999998s)]
*  Marking their territory. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3049.2599999999998s)]
*  It's just so strange to see an animal in the flesh that didn't exist, you know, for 10,000 [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3050.2599999999998s)]
*  years. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3058.02s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3059.02s)]
*  I remember for Khaleesi's birth and people were asking me afterward, how did that feel? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3060.02s)]
*  And I just, you can't even describe it. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3065.78s)]
*  This moment when she was born and then she screamed. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3069.02s)]
*  She had this cry, this scream. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3072.74s)]
*  I have it on my phone actually. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3074.62s)]
*  I can play it for you. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3075.62s)]
*  Wow. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3076.62s)]
*  But it was just such a, I don't know. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3077.62s)]
*  It's this awe. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3082.06s)]
*  This, I think this is one of the best things about the De-Extinction work and the species [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3083.06s)]
*  preservation work that Colossal is doing is that we live in such a crazy time. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3088.56s)]
*  People don't often have an opportunity to feel genuine awe about something. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3093.7599999999998s)]
*  And this is one of the things that people get about going out, going hunting, go get [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3098.88s)]
*  out and, you know, going and spending time in the woods or going and experiencing something [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3102.46s)]
*  that they wouldn't normally experience is this way to feel genuine wonder and excitement [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3106.32s)]
*  and enthusiasm and Khaleesi's birth. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3112.96s)]
*  I wasn't there for the birth of the boys. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3115.36s)]
*  I was in the UK at a conference and it was very sad and I had COVID and I was asleep [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3117.0s)]
*  and trying to recover. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3122.96s)]
*  And the next morning I woke up and there were like 150 text messages on my phone from Ben [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3125.04s)]
*  going, what the fuck are you doing? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3128.92s)]
*  Where are you? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3130.9s)]
*  Why are you not responding? [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3131.9s)]
*  And I'm like, oh my God, I've missed this moment. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3132.9s)]
*  So I made sure that I was there, present for Khaleesi and I'm glad I was because what an [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3134.76s)]
*  amazing, I'm glad you got to see them. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3140.24s)]
*  I'm glad I got to see them too. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3142.72s)]
*  It's really a crazy experience. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3144.4s)]
*  I felt very fortunate just to be in their presence and also very conflicted by it all. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3146.4s)]
*  This is so odd. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3151.7200000000003s)]
*  Like, is this the beginning? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3152.7200000000003s)]
*  Like, are we going to bring back everything? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3153.7200000000003s)]
*  Like, is that a good thing? [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3155.6s)]
*  Are things supposed to go extinct? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3156.88s)]
*  Are we supposed to just bring back everything that's ever lived? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3158.1600000000003s)]
*  At what point do we draw the line? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3161.08s)]
*  You know, all these thoughts in my head, like why are human beings the deciders of what [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3162.88s)]
*  lives and dies? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3167.2400000000002s)]
*  Are we, do we have an arrogance because of our relative intellect that we think that [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3169.2400000000002s)]
*  we should be able to make these kind of decisions and not understand the comprehensive effect [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3173.96s)]
*  that it has on the entire ecosystem? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3179.44s)]
*  And we know what happens with invasive species. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3181.44s)]
*  When invasive species come into new territories, they destroy everything. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3183.8s)]
*  It's like Florida is an amazing example of that. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3187.28s)]
*  Florida is so crazy. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3190.76s)]
*  It is, I mean, it is Florida. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3192.92s)]
*  You know, I mean, like when you think of Florida, you think like Florida man. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3195.6800000000003s)]
*  So the only state that you can say like the name of the state and then a man and everybody's [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3199.3s)]
*  like, what did he do? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3202.4s)]
*  But that's Florida ecologically. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3204.88s)]
*  Like the entire center of the Everglades is infested with Burmese pythons. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3207.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3212.56s)]
*  Did you see that? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3213.56s)]
*  There is a competition every year to go out and kill as many as they can. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3214.56s)]
*  And there's a there's a monetary reward for people who kill. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3216.7200000000003s)]
*  I think it's the most or maybe the biggest. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3219.7200000000003s)]
*  There's some something like this. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3222.4s)]
*  Even that's not going to put it down. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3223.92s)]
*  No, it doesn't at all. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3224.92s)]
*  People kill. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3226.04s)]
*  And during this competition, they kill hundreds, maybe thousands of these snakes. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3227.04s)]
*  And it doesn't even touch them. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3231.02s)]
*  There's an estimate of a half a million. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3232.5s)]
*  They think there might be a half a million there. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3234.48s)]
*  And there's a guy that's been on this podcast for calls himself Python cowboy. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3236.58s)]
*  He's quite a character. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3240.3s)]
*  And didn't he give us a head? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3242.14s)]
*  We got a head laying around here, right? [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3243.14s)]
*  You got it over there. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3244.14s)]
*  That Python head. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3245.9s)]
*  But that dude, he has been catching them. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3247.94s)]
*  He's his dogs. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3251.78s)]
*  The dogs find where the nests are. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3252.78s)]
*  And the video of these things, you know, you're pulling out this 15, 16, 17. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3254.94s)]
*  I think he's got as big as like an 18 foot long snake. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3259.54s)]
*  Wow. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3262.18s)]
*  They're hundreds of pounds. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3263.18s)]
*  They're enormous. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3264.18s)]
*  They swallow the deer. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3265.18s)]
*  They eat alligators. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3266.18s)]
*  They're eating alligators. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3267.18s)]
*  Thank goodness, because alligators are doing great. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3268.18s)]
*  Like, that's one thing I don't mind them doing. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3271.18s)]
*  We need something that's haunting alligators. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3273.54s)]
*  That's another problem in Florida. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3275.14s)]
*  It's infested with alligators. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3276.58s)]
*  And they used to be on the endangered species list. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3277.58s)]
*  When I lived there, they were on the endangered species list. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3279.46s)]
*  One of the class of 1967, right? [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3281.9s)]
*  The first species to be officially listed. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3284.18s)]
*  Why did they list them? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3286.66s)]
*  Because they were almost gone at that point. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3287.7799999999997s)]
*  How did they do that? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3289.74s)]
*  Like, I can't imagine that you could do that now. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3290.74s)]
*  That you could get them to the point of extinction now. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3293.3399999999997s)]
*  Because they're so hard to find. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3296.06s)]
*  And they're everywhere. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3298.1s)]
*  Maybe it was... [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3299.1s)]
*  I don't want to say they're so hard to find, but I mean, when they get in the water, you [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3300.1s)]
*  know, like, you're not going to get all of them. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3303.1s)]
*  Like, how are you killing all of them? [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3305.1s)]
*  I was watching... [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3306.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, there's a show, I don't know where it's on, but it's a show that's called Florida [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3307.7799999999997s)]
*  Man. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3310.58s)]
*  I was watching it on a flight the other day. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3311.58s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3313.62s)]
*  It was through interactions that Florida men have. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3314.62s)]
*  And one of them is about a dude who was kind of lost in his life. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3317.46s)]
*  And he climbed over a fence that he shouldn't have climbed over and went for a swim in a [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3320.7s)]
*  lake and then had an alligator bit off his arm. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3324.7799999999997s)]
*  That is the story. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3327.5s)]
*  That's that particular... [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3329.54s)]
*  Oh, I saw that guy in the news. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3330.54s)]
*  That's the guy that, like, he had to walk, like, for a whole day with, like, one arm? [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3332.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3337.1s)]
*  I remember there was a guy who... [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3338.1s)]
*  What I... [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3340.5s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3341.5s)]
*  There's probably hundreds of stories like this. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3342.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3343.5s)]
*  And I was trying to sleep, so I'm probably wrong. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3345.38s)]
*  In this video, he laid on the side of the lake, like, probably bleeding to death when [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3347.14s)]
*  an alligator that was in the shape of his mom, I think, came up to him and told him [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3351.86s)]
*  he had to get his ass up and move or he was going to die. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3356.06s)]
*  And he was like, okay, mom, I'll do that. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3358.34s)]
*  It was... [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3359.82s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3360.82s)]
*  He was probably not sober. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3361.82s)]
*  I imagine that... [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3363.82s)]
*  It was blood loss at that point. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3364.9s)]
*  Sure. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3366.42s)]
*  And then also whatever contributed to making him climb that fence in the first place. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3367.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3370.94s)]
*  I won't play the video, but there you go. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3371.94s)]
*  Is that the dude? [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3373.22s)]
*  The show she's watching is on Netflix, I think. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3374.9399999999996s)]
*  This is a similar thing that did happen a month ago. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3377.54s)]
*  Here's the video of it. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3380.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3381.5s)]
*  The one that was the show that was about... [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3382.5s)]
*  I don't want to see this dude lose his arm. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3383.5s)]
*  The show was about something that happened years ago, years ago for them to be able to [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3386.02s)]
*  make it. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3389.22s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, how many people in Florida? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3390.22s)]
*  I bet it happens all the time. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3391.22s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3392.22s)]
*  I mean, it's Florida. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3393.22s)]
*  They are huge. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3394.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3395.22s)]
*  Now they're in Georgia, too, right? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3396.22s)]
*  Oh, they're in Texas. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3397.22s)]
*  Yeah, Texas. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3398.22s)]
*  They're here. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3399.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3400.22s)]
*  They find them. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3401.22s)]
*  I mean, I've seen golf courses in Florida. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3402.22s)]
*  They're like, good luck playing golf out there. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3403.22s)]
*  Are you crazy? [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3404.9399999999996s)]
*  You're playing golf in Jurassic Park. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3405.9399999999996s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen the videos. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3408.06s)]
*  There's one amazing video of this huge alligator. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3409.4199999999996s)]
*  It's like a 14-footer, and it's walking across this golf course, and it looks like a dinosaur [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3413.3799999999997s)]
*  because it's not walking like with it's dragging its belly on the ground like they sometimes [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3419.14s)]
*  do. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3423.7799999999997s)]
*  It's kind of puffed up. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3424.7799999999997s)]
*  There it is. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3425.7799999999997s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3426.7799999999997s)]
*  Holy. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3427.7799999999997s)]
*  Oh my God, that's wild. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3428.7799999999997s)]
*  That is so big. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3429.7799999999997s)]
*  Look at the size of that thing. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3430.9s)]
*  And you're out there playing golf. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3432.5s)]
*  You're like, you see that guy, and you know that they can run fast. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3434.38s)]
*  Yeah, they run like 30 miles an hour. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3438.3s)]
*  Yeah, and they run faster than you. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3440.1s)]
*  Look at this dork. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3441.1s)]
*  This dork can't run 10 miles an hour. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3442.1s)]
*  Florida, man. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3443.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's totally a Florida man. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3444.1s)]
*  Let me get me a selfie for the Facebook. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3445.46s)]
*  He's going to get right up on that thing. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3447.42s)]
*  And there's a lot of them there, too. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3450.6600000000003s)]
*  I mean, they say that pretty much any undisturbed body of water likely has an alligator in it [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3452.6600000000003s)]
*  now. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3458.3s)]
*  So what ate them? [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3459.3s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3460.7000000000003s)]
*  Back in the day, they probably just ate each other. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3461.7000000000003s)]
*  They cannibalize each other. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3464.1400000000003s)]
*  Maybe they're going to do that, too. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3465.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm sure they probably do. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3466.1400000000003s)]
*  They probably have to at a certain point in time. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3467.1400000000003s)]
*  What are the snakes going to eat? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3470.3s)]
*  Snakes have wiped out 90% of the mammals in the Everglades. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3471.6200000000003s)]
*  And they're terrible for birds, too. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3474.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for everything. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3475.6600000000003s)]
*  Ground nesting birds, anything. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3476.6600000000003s)]
*  Anything they can get a hold of. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3477.6600000000003s)]
*  If there's a half a million of them, that is a killing population of extraordinary proportions. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3480.1000000000004s)]
*  Half a million things that could eat a deer. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3487.44s)]
*  There's no skunks left. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3491.08s)]
*  There's everything. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3492.2400000000002s)]
*  Raccoons, they're all gone. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3493.2400000000002s)]
*  Everything's missing. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3494.2400000000002s)]
*  But this is exactly why we need these technologies that we're trying to develop a colossal. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3495.32s)]
*  We're not just bringing species back to life. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3500.78s)]
*  We're a species preservation company. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3502.88s)]
*  It is a sales pitch. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3506.88s)]
*  But birds, whenever I think about birds, I think of this. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3507.88s)]
*  We know that there are things that we can do to help mammals to adapt to rapid changes [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3511.2400000000002s)]
*  in their habitat. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3517.1s)]
*  We can do things like the Florida Panthers. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3518.46s)]
*  One of the things that we did to save Florida Panthers from becoming extinct was we introduced [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3523.5s)]
*  Panthers from Texas, which are the closest genetically and geographically to Florida [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3527.42s)]
*  Panthers. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3533.54s)]
*  They were probably connected at some point until humans created stuff that meant that [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3534.54s)]
*  they couldn't go back and forth. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3538.2999999999997s)]
*  And when Texas Panthers were introduced in the mid 1990s, that population recovered. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3540.02s)]
*  They stopped. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3545.34s)]
*  They had a disorder called cryptorchidism where their testicles wouldn't descend or [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3546.42s)]
*  only one would descend. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3550.86s)]
*  They had all sorts of heart problems. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3551.86s)]
*  Because there's a small breeding population? [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3554.7400000000002s)]
*  Because there were very few of them. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3556.7400000000002s)]
*  And so no genetic diversity. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3557.98s)]
*  The choice was to mate with your family. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3559.58s)]
*  That's it. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3562.54s)]
*  And things want to survive. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3565.7000000000003s)]
*  So they do. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3566.94s)]
*  So you get these highly inbred populations and people fixed it by moving an animal from [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3567.94s)]
*  one population to another, introducing new genetic diversity. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3571.78s)]
*  It's called genetic rescue. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3574.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3576.54s)]
*  And that's a great way of bringing diversity back into a population. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3577.54s)]
*  It's what we're trying to do with our Red Wolf project. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3581.42s)]
*  Red Wolves are one of the most endangered wolf species in the world. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3584.46s)]
*  They're the only endemic American wolf and they are nearly extinct. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3587.54s)]
*  There's a successful captive breeding program. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3592.58s)]
*  And a few years ago, some of the people that we work with at Colossal Woman called Bridget [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3595.38s)]
*  von Holt, who's at Princeton, who's a friend of mine, she was working and discovered because [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3600.1s)]
*  people were sending her photos. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3604.04s)]
*  See, this is why you have to pay attention to people who you think might be crazy when [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3605.2799999999997s)]
*  they send you pictures of things. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3608.88s)]
*  Look at this cool, crazy thing that I think I found. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3610.56s)]
*  You shouldn't just discount it. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3613.04s)]
*  I'm the person who has tested insulation that somebody told me Bigfoot peed on and participated [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3614.56s)]
*  in it. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3619.4s)]
*  Because if it's real, I want to be the person who finds it. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3620.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3624.68s)]
*  So Bridget says this guy who lives down in the coast of Louisiana sent her a picture [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3625.68s)]
*  of an animal that she's like, that is not a wolf and it is not a coyote and I don't [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3632.6s)]
*  know what it is and it's crazy. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3636.2s)]
*  And she looked at it and she goes, yeah, it's not. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3637.6s)]
*  It's something else. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3641.16s)]
*  It's something in between those. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3642.16s)]
*  And so she tested it and found that it has a ton of DNA ancestry from Red Wolves. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3643.78s)]
*  And they're hybridized a little bit with coyotes, but all Red Wolves are hybridized a little [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3650.52s)]
*  bit with coyotes. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3654.48s)]
*  Canids are always hybridizing with each other. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3655.48s)]
*  We know that because there are wolves that are black because black gene for wolves got [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3657.94s)]
*  into the wolf population because a domestic dog had his way with a wolf in heat. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3663.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3668.9s)]
*  That's how that allele got into that population. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3669.9s)]
*  So we know canids do this all the time. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3671.94s)]
*  And she was like, this is so cool because this captive breeding population was established [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3674.2200000000003s)]
*  with just a few founder individuals and the team working with them are doing a great job [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3679.46s)]
*  trying to maximize genetic diversity by picking who's going to pair with who to keep all that [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3683.62s)]
*  diversity there. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3688.5s)]
*  But it's still just a few individuals. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3689.5s)]
*  So they are going to lose genetic diversity. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3692.22s)]
*  It's just how it works. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3694.1s)]
*  But if we can bring other individuals in from this population, that's a way of concentrating [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3695.6s)]
*  more diversity, better able to pick which parts are Red Wolf, either by breeding individuals [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3701.1s)]
*  or by editing their DNA, which is technology that we developed on the path to Dire Wolf. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3706.62s)]
*  We can actually help this population to survive. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3713.84s)]
*  So there are ways that we can do this for mammals that are going to have really amazing [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3715.9s)]
*  consequences for the way we can protect biodiversity. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3721.0800000000004s)]
*  Well that's fascinating for things like Red Wolves and things like that. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3723.88s)]
*  But when you think of the Python problem in Florida, I heard the worst idea. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3726.6400000000003s)]
*  The worst idea they were talking about introducing honey badgers. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3735.1000000000004s)]
*  Honey badgers. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3737.92s)]
*  Because they eat snakes. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3738.92s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if this was a serious idea. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3741.44s)]
*  Because we have never, as a species, humans, introduced a thing to try to control a thing. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3743.88s)]
*  And that thing that we introduced just went horribly wrong. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3749.28s)]
*  We've never done that before. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3752.2000000000003s)]
*  Right Australia? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3753.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3754.44s)]
*  Australia's a wreck. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3755.44s)]
*  They have a terrible feral cat problem. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3756.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3758.92s)]
*  And in Hawaii, they have these giant African land snails. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3759.92s)]
*  Oh yeah, I heard of those. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3763.2000000000003s)]
*  That they introduced this thing called a Rosie Wolf snail that they were going to get to [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3765.84s)]
*  eat the giant African land snails. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3770.12s)]
*  But instead the Rosie Wolf snail prefers the taste of native endemic Hawaiian snails. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3772.88s)]
*  And so the Rosie Wolf snail is leaving the giant snails alone. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3778.2799999999997s)]
*  And they're big. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3782.2s)]
*  Have you seen one of those? [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3783.2s)]
*  I don't think I have. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3784.2s)]
*  A giant African land snail. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3785.2s)]
*  It's worth looking at it. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3786.7599999999998s)]
*  Did they come over on cargo ships or something? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3787.96s)]
*  I think people introduced them for some reason that I can't remember what it was. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3790.2799999999997s)]
*  So we have a good history of doing this kind of thing. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3794.72s)]
*  For giant-esque cargo? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3796.92s)]
*  Whoa! [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3798.52s)]
*  Whoa! [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3800.36s)]
*  Can they eat those? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3801.36s)]
*  Those are delicious. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3802.36s)]
*  I think people can eat them probably. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3803.36s)]
*  But they eat everything from all of the vegetation to the other snails to plaster. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3804.84s)]
*  They'll eat their way through infrastructure that people have built. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3810.68s)]
*  Oh great. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3813.52s)]
*  Oh great. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3814.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3815.52s)]
*  So we introduced these little things, Rosie Wolf snails, to try to control them. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3816.52s)]
*  But instead they're killing all the endemic snails. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3819.48s)]
*  We never learn. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3823.32s)]
*  Yeah I hope they don't bring Honey Badgers to Florida. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3824.32s)]
*  I don't even know if this article I was reading was a serious article. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3827.36s)]
*  But it was just like, that sounds like something that someone would... [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3831.0s)]
*  Because they're really good at killing snakes. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3834.0s)]
*  That's what they like to do. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3837.48s)]
*  They kill cobras. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3838.48s)]
*  And they have an unbelievably resilient body. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3839.48s)]
*  They can tolerate getting bit by lions. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3844.76s)]
*  They're freaks. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3847.92s)]
*  They're really weird animals like Honey Badgers. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3848.92s)]
*  And they just really do... [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3851.76s)]
*  They're cute, right? [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3852.76s)]
*  I remember when my kids were little watching the Wild Kratts, there was a Wild Kratts episode [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3854.0800000000004s)]
*  about Honey Badgers. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3858.2400000000002s)]
*  How they were all cute when they were babies because they were hiding in camouflage. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3859.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3862.7200000000003s)]
*  Maybe when their babies are cute. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3863.7200000000003s)]
*  They're pretty ferocious. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3864.92s)]
*  Like a Wolverine. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3865.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3866.92s)]
*  Very similar to Wolverines. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3867.92s)]
*  I think they're all in the same family, right? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3868.92s)]
*  Yeah there he is. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3871.92s)]
*  Look at that face. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3872.92s)]
*  I think they look very cute. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3873.92s)]
*  Look at that face. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3874.92s)]
*  Just big old deadly snake. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3875.92s)]
*  And that's his lunch. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3878.1600000000003s)]
*  And they get bit all the time. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3879.1600000000003s)]
*  And they just like... [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3880.92s)]
*  They get sick, pass out for a couple minutes and then recover and kill a snake. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3881.92s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3885.52s)]
*  Yeah, they're ferocious little animals. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3886.52s)]
*  So have people been able to understand better antivenom properties from studying them? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3888.44s)]
*  That's a really good... [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3892.76s)]
*  Look at that face. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3893.76s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3894.76s)]
*  He looks vicious. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3895.76s)]
*  That is such a crazy animal. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3896.76s)]
*  That pattern on the coat is really beautiful. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3900.44s)]
*  Oh, they're wild looking. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3902.1600000000003s)]
*  They're wild looking. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3903.1600000000003s)]
*  I just hope they don't bring them into Florida. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3904.1600000000003s)]
*  Because it sounds like someone's going to do it. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3905.6000000000004s)]
*  It sounds like a Florida idea. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3908.8s)]
*  Have you heard about the hippo solution in the early 20th century? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3911.2799999999997s)]
*  No. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3914.84s)]
*  No. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3915.84s)]
*  This is a great sort of American history story because our country is replete with people [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3916.84s)]
*  with brilliant ideas, right? [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3922.16s)]
*  And in the early 20th century when the land in the West was not doing so well, been overgrazed, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3923.68s)]
*  there were too many cattle and there was this thing called the meat question. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3930.36s)]
*  It was the thing of the day, the meat question. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3932.88s)]
*  People were talking about how are we going to survive if there's not enough cattle? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3934.64s)]
*  Maybe we're going to have to eat our dogs. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3938.56s)]
*  At the same time, there was a problem in the Mississippi and other places where the, I [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3940.56s)]
*  think it was the World Fair, people had brought New Orleans, who was the host city of the, [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3945.7200000000003s)]
*  I think in Japan, they brought New Orleans this water hyacinth, this water little tiny [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3951.7200000000003s)]
*  beautiful flower as a gift and they loved it and so they planted it everywhere and it [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3956.8s)]
*  just grew like absolute crazy and was choking up the river. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3960.88s)]
*  Ships couldn't get through because of this like madden where people were putting oil [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3964.92s)]
*  on it to get it to sink and trying to light it on fire and nothing would happen. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3968.2s)]
*  And this team of people that included a congressman from Louisiana came up with a solution for [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3972.64s)]
*  both problems at once and that was that they were going to import hippos from Africa into [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3977.3799999999997s)]
*  Louisiana to live on the bayous. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3985.8399999999997s)]
*  They would eat the plant, this water hyacinth thing, and then we could eat them and that [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3988.68s)]
*  was going to be the perfect solution to both of these problems. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3993.96s)]
*  How did that get stopped? [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3997.92s)]
*  It was an accident. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=3999.52s)]
*  So it was, it's actually a fun story. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4000.52s)]
*  You should look it up and read the whole story because it involved these two guys. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4003.04s)]
*  One of them was the guy who was the inspiration for the Boy Scouts of America and another [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4008.16s)]
*  guy was like a con man who had worked as a pimp and a journalist and all these other [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4011.1s)]
*  things and they had actually been employed during the Boer Wars to kill each other but [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4014.52s)]
*  they came together on part of this congressman's team. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4018.2400000000002s)]
*  The scout thought it was a great idea. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4020.7200000000003s)]
*  He wanted people to bring in all sorts of animals from Africa and put them in national [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4022.12s)]
*  parks so that people would want to go to national parks because they could hunt them [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4025.58s)]
*  and they could and that would have more reason for people to want to support the idea of [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4028.7799999999997s)]
*  national parks at the time which is great. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4033.86s)]
*  You know this utility of nature. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4036.62s)]
*  It seems weird compared to how we think of it now but I think this is really it's really [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4038.2s)]
*  important and it was a really important part of the way we got conservation legislation [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4041.7s)]
*  in the U.S. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4045.18s)]
*  So he was excited about this and then the congressman when he was pulling together the [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4046.18s)]
*  that he wanted to be on his side for this he went to a show that this other guy the [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4051.82s)]
*  sort of con man traveling salesman pimp escape artist dude was having about how he was an [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4056.42s)]
*  intrepid explorer and he was like that guy is an expert as well. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4061.46s)]
*  He can also be on my team and they testified in front of Congress and they asked questions [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4064.82s)]
*  like you know how do you know that they're safe. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4069.6000000000004s)]
*  How do you know that they're tamed. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4072.88s)]
*  This con man he was like well you know there's plenty of evidence that you can even feed [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4073.88s)]
*  them from a baby's bottle with no evidence whatsoever. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4077.96s)]
*  Everybody was like yeah awesome. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4082.96s)]
*  Even the New York Times was completely behind it. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4084.34s)]
*  They published an editorial talking about they called the hippos Lake Cow Bacon. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4086.82s)]
*  What year was this? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4092.88s)]
*  Early 20th century. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4093.88s)]
*  Wow Lake Cow Bacon. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4096.88s)]
*  Yeah everybody was like this is it. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4100.28s)]
*  This is what's going to solve the problem. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4102.4s)]
*  Teddy Roosevelt was behind it. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4105.4s)]
*  It was a bill all the way in Congress. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4106.879999999999s)]
*  It just didn't pass. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4109.879999999999s)]
*  It didn't go up for a vote. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4110.879999999999s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4111.879999999999s)]
*  How the US almost became a nation of hippo ranchers. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4112.879999999999s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4114.48s)]
*  Failed House Bill sought to increase the availability of low cost meat by importing the hippopotamus [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4116.5599999999995s)]
*  that would be killed to make Lake Cow Bacon. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4120.36s)]
*  Yes brilliant. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4123.719999999999s)]
*  This is such a it's so funny but it's not fair to call it failed because it didn't fail. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4124.719999999999s)]
*  It never came up for a vote. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4129.44s)]
*  So they had testified in front of Congress too late for it to come out to a vote that [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4131.28s)]
*  year and then just other shit happened and people stopped paying attention. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4135.0s)]
*  That's it. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4137.72s)]
*  It just went away. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4138.72s)]
*  Wow. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4139.72s)]
*  Yeah so near miss on the hippos. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4140.72s)]
*  Well they kill more people in Africa than any other mammal right. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4142.44s)]
*  Yeah well and now we know that they're good at becoming invasive. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4145.52s)]
*  You saw there's hippos that live now in Colombia because Pablo Escobar nobody knew what to [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4149.16s)]
*  do with them. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4153.92s)]
*  Yeah and they started off with just a handful of them and now there's like dozens of them [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4154.92s)]
*  down there. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4158.88s)]
*  What are they doing about that? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4159.88s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4161.96s)]
*  I think they keep rounding them up and putting them back on his property. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4162.96s)]
*  What can you do? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4165.64s)]
*  How much property did he have up there? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4166.64s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4169.04s)]
*  It's so crazy that you just have hippos and they just get loose and now that Colombia [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4172.04s)]
*  has hippos. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4178.24s)]
*  He took them there on purpose though just like we wanted to bring them here. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4181.0s)]
*  Can you imagine how bad that would be though? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4183.66s)]
*  And I mean do people. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4185.88s)]
*  Well that's the wild boars in the United States. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4186.88s)]
*  That's William Randolph Hearst. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4189.68s)]
*  William Randolph Hearst wanted wild pigs on his property and so he imported them from [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4191.64s)]
*  I think from I don't remember it was Russia or somewhere in Europe and then these wild [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4197.080000000001s)]
*  pigs have now populated all through California. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4202.64s)]
*  I mean they're all over the place now. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4205.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah that's crazy. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4207.76s)]
*  We did have wild pigs around the U.S. at some point. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4208.76s)]
*  Probably not the same thing right? [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4211.68s)]
*  Were there wild pigs? [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4212.96s)]
*  There was all sorts of pigs. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4213.96s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4214.96s)]
*  I think they came over on boats with explorers you know and I know William Randolph Hearst [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4215.96s)]
*  all the ones around like the northern California area I think all of those are the remnants [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4222.24s)]
*  of the William Randolph Hearst pigs. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4228.5199999999995s)]
*  They think. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4231.04s)]
*  We don't see them in Alaska, Yukon where we find all these big stashes of bones coming [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4232.04s)]
*  out of permafrost so it's probably not that they came over like that. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4236.04s)]
*  We find bison and horses and mats. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4238.879999999999s)]
*  Mostly bison. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4241.44s)]
*  Where did the wild boars emanate from? [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4242.44s)]
*  Like what's their original country of origin? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4244.28s)]
*  I think well I have a friend who works on domestication of pigs and they've published [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4246.4s)]
*  a bunch of different papers that are always contradicting each other. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4250.92s)]
*  He gave a hilarious talk at a meeting I was at last week about how he keeps saying something [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4253.28s)]
*  different as a way of you know keeping to publish more papers. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4257.56s)]
*  He was just being nice about how he's open to changing his mind with new data which I [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4261.36s)]
*  think is a valued trait in a scientist. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4265.0s)]
*  But yeah so Southeast Asia or around Asia I think is the origin or at least the domestication [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4268.24s)]
*  and normally things are domesticated around where they were. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4272.76s)]
*  Well they're the weirdest animal right because the domestic ones will become they change [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4275.2s)]
*  they morph when they go feral really quickly. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4280.24s)]
*  I think it's like they start within like six weeks. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4282.48s)]
*  I mean this is the way evolution works right. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4285.24s)]
*  You know something has a particular suite of traits. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4287.32s)]
*  I'm reading this is the testimony of when this was going on. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4289.72s)]
*  This is the guy who presented this. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4293.4s)]
*  The hippo thing. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4295.6s)]
*  He's talking about pigs right here where they're going to bring them from northern Manchuria [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4296.6s)]
*  because of. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4300.28s)]
*  Were they the most delicious pigs? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4301.28s)]
*  They're also talking about bringing in rhinos. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4303.36s)]
*  Yeah I think they did bring in camels in like 1853. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4305.4s)]
*  Well we have camels there were North American camels that were here during the ice ages. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4308.400000000001s)]
*  This is a bad test or something. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4313.4400000000005s)]
*  This is 1853. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4315.4800000000005s)]
*  They're talking about bringing antelopes in and they asked like are they easily tamed [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4316.4800000000005s)]
*  or domesticated. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4320.16s)]
*  He's like they're very easily tamed. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4321.16s)]
*  That's Irwin so this is the guy who worked for the I guess what became the USDA but he [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4324.0s)]
*  was in charge of apples but he was really dedicated to trying to solve this meat problem [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4328.8s)]
*  and he saw importing African animals and animals from other places as the real solution to [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4333.32s)]
*  this. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4337.52s)]
*  Well they've definitely done that in Texas. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4338.52s)]
*  Texas is overrun with African animals. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4340.160000000001s)]
*  All the private ranches are filled with elans, Neil Guy and the beast. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4343.68s)]
*  We used to have so many cool animals here that all went extinct at the end of the ice [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4349.88s)]
*  age so why not. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4353.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean we had mammoths. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4354.4400000000005s)]
*  Why shouldn't we have elephants. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4355.4400000000005s)]
*  But isn't it weird but it's again that's the same argument. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4357.4400000000005s)]
*  You bring in an invasive species. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4360.56s)]
*  Is it invasive though if it used to live here? [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4362.38s)]
*  Well it's invasive in a sense that the wolves that are in Colorado right now that are eating [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4364.72s)]
*  all the cattle are kind of invasive. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4368.6s)]
*  Yeah I mean. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4370.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4372.4400000000005s)]
*  They're not invasive because they do live. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4373.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean there are wolves actually just have moved into the San Juans. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4375.4400000000005s)]
*  I think documented like natural migration as opposed to the reintroduction. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4379.320000000001s)]
*  I think there was something I read about that yesterday but the wolves that they've introduced [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4385.12s)]
*  to like outside of Aspen in particular I have a friend who has a ranch out there and I posted [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4390.4400000000005s)]
*  about it on Instagram. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4394.4s)]
*  He actually sent me some more pictures yesterday and I was going to post about it but so much [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4395.4s)]
*  crazy stuff is happening in L.A. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4399.799999999999s)]
*  I'm like there's not time to talk about like wolf problems. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4401.2s)]
*  But they they're just killing calves and eating their liver. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4404.44s)]
*  They were not even that hungry. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4407.92s)]
*  They're just eating the tasty parts and leaving these calves alone and these people are on [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4409.839999999999s)]
*  a 24 hour run ragged you know. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4413.639999999999s)]
*  They have these teams of guys that have to patrol the area 24 hours a day to try to scare [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4420.52s)]
*  off the wolves and they they're not allowed to shoot them. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4427.200000000001s)]
*  And you know they spent millions of dollars bringing them there and they're just eating [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4430.88s)]
*  cattle. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4434.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah I imagine it's really devastating to see something like that happening and know [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4435.400000000001s)]
*  that somebody else made this decision. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4440.080000000001s)]
*  And that you who actually experience it weren't I mean I imagine the people who voted for [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4442.120000000001s)]
*  that. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4447.6s)]
*  What they imagined. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4449.08s)]
*  Well it's ballot box biology right. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4450.56s)]
*  You get a bunch of people that live in the cities that don't have a lot of experience [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4452.8s)]
*  in nature and wild ecosystems and then you introduce this idea. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4456.160000000001s)]
*  We're going to bring wolves back to their native habitat. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4460.72s)]
*  Oh that sounds amazing. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4462.96s)]
*  What they're not telling you is like this with this rancher told me is that first of [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4464.56s)]
*  all the original wolves that were introduced into Colorado were wolves that were taken [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4468.320000000001s)]
*  from Oregon because these wolves were preying on cattle. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4473.92s)]
*  So they already had a taste. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4478.0s)]
*  Exactly and they already had habits. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4480.32s)]
*  And so then they brought them into Colorado where they start preying on cattle. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4481.84s)]
*  And so then they moved them from this area where they were preying on cattle and put [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4486.32s)]
*  them outside of Aspen where they prey on cattle start preying on cattle. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4489.84s)]
*  It's just stupid. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4494.360000000001s)]
*  And it's again it's not biologists it's not their idea it's ballot box biology. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4496.24s)]
*  This is all being instigated by the Colorado governor. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4501.4400000000005s)]
*  It's so important to actually talk to wildlife biologists and ecologists and we can see from [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4504.88s)]
*  Yellowstone how important having this keystone predator is in ecosystems where they can be [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4509.76s)]
*  and where there is space for them. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4515.72s)]
*  But the land is not the same as everywhere as it is in Yellowstone and we need to be [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4517.2s)]
*  able to make you know when I was at Santa Cruz I taught an introductory biology class [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4521.4800000000005s)]
*  for non-majors where my goal was to give the students tools to be able to think on their [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4527.0s)]
*  own which is harder than you might imagine. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4532.48s)]
*  And their midterm exam was a debate and the topic of the debate was that wolves should [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4536.0s)]
*  be introduced into California. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4540.599999999999s)]
*  Why not New York City. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4543.28s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4544.5599999999995s)]
*  Put them everywhere they used to be. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4545.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean this is where it gets silly. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4546.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like when you're dealing with people that have cattle ranches and this is their [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4548.2s)]
*  entire livelihood and all they're doing now is just compensating them for the calves that [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4551.44s)]
*  get killed and then so you have less output every year. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4555.759999999999s)]
*  So it's like the whole thing is crazy. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4559.16s)]
*  They were already on their way to do a natural migration into Colorado. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4561.84s)]
*  And it would have been different wolves. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4566.68s)]
*  Yes it would have been different sized wolves too because I think there's also like some [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4568.24s)]
*  of the wolves that are being introduced they're introduced from British Columbia or they're [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4573.16s)]
*  being introduced from Alberta or somewhere up there. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4577.76s)]
*  I think those ones that came into Yellowstone. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4580.84s)]
*  Like the Yellowstone thing is cool right. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4583.68s)]
*  It's been a few decades now. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4586.32s)]
*  People kind of like come to this sort of equilibrium you know. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4588.08s)]
*  People recognize that there was an overpopulation of elk for sure. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4593.4s)]
*  I mean they used to have these hunting seasons where they would hunt them in the snow in [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4596.5599999999995s)]
*  the winter because there were so many of them. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4601.5599999999995s)]
*  They wanted to just be able to pick them out and just just shoot them for meat because [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4603.36s)]
*  they really didn't have the resources because they didn't have the apex predators because [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4607.48s)]
*  a lion can only eat so many of them. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4611.5599999999995s)]
*  So mountain lions weren't really putting the dent in the population that a pack of intelligent [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4613.759999999999s)]
*  hunting cooperative animals like wolves could do. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4618.759999999999s)]
*  So they brought it back and you know it's relatively successful. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4623.16s)]
*  They've knocked the population of elk down more than 40 percent but that's probably good. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4626.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean not for the people that hunt elk they're really mad but you know wolves are cool. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4632.96s)]
*  It's cool to have them around but Montana is very different than Aspen. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4637.599999999999s)]
*  It's very different in the mountains of Montana and you see a wolf versus in someone's cattle [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4641.4s)]
*  ranch in Aspen. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4646.16s)]
*  This is stupid. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4648.839999999999s)]
*  Why did you do this? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4650.719999999999s)]
*  But what's interesting this class that I took so it was a debate that I taught. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4652.12s)]
*  Sorry it was a debate and what I made them do was assume roles of a rancher a politician [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4657.24s)]
*  a conservationist and I had several different roles and then I randomly assigned whether [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4662.32s)]
*  they were pro or con and they had a couple of weeks to figure out what their what their [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4666.2s)]
*  debate was going to be and I took a vote before the debate and as you might expect [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4671.0s)]
*  for 18 year olds in California you say at the beginning should wolves be introduced [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4676.0s)]
*  100 percent yes right. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4680.4s)]
*  They do this debate and I did it four years in a row and every year after they had to [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4682.56s)]
*  do this after they had to put themselves in somebody else's shoes and think about it from [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4688.16s)]
*  their perspective it would shift and the majority of people would be like yeah no it's a bad [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4692.48s)]
*  idea. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4697.08s)]
*  I think if you give people the tools to be able to think they can imagine themselves [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4698.12s)]
*  in a different scenario and we need to do that we need to be arming people with thoughtfulness [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4701.92s)]
*  rather than jumping to a conclusion. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4707.6s)]
*  Yeah and also ballot box biology. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4709.32s)]
*  It's like if you but everybody's going to vote so right but you shouldn't be able to [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4712.16s)]
*  vote on things that you're not educated in. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4716.0s)]
*  It's like if you allow people to vote on things that have tremendous consequences to the ecosystem [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4718.44s)]
*  like a reintroduction of an apex predator and they don't understand those consequences [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4724.36s)]
*  they just have this very utopian idea of what it means to bring back. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4728.32s)]
*  Well look I love them. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4732.32s)]
*  I think they're amazing animals. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4733.799999999999s)]
*  It's just like putting them in you know Calabasas is probably not the best idea. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4735.639999999999s)]
*  Putting them where people live they're going to eat pets they're going to they're going [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4741.4s)]
*  to eat a lot of things that are penned up whether they're sheep or goats or whatever [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4744.599999999999s)]
*  that whatever people have that they can get out easily they're not going to chase down [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4749.16s)]
*  a herd of elk. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4752.5199999999995s)]
*  That's hard. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4753.5199999999995s)]
*  Well they're biology right. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4754.5199999999995s)]
*  They're not making decisions on where they can find their next meal. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4755.679999999999s)]
*  We're not planning on rewilding dire wolves just to put that out there. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4758.759999999999s)]
*  Plus you've met Khaleesi I don't think she would be. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4763.5199999999995s)]
*  I bet she will in a couple of years. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4766.839999999999s)]
*  Maybe so. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4768.679999999999s)]
*  But right now. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4769.679999999999s)]
*  In a couple of years she'll freak you out. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4770.679999999999s)]
*  She kind of freaks me out already when you look at her. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4771.679999999999s)]
*  Her eyes are so intense. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4775.4s)]
*  They're so intense. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4777.32s)]
*  You know when you look into a predator's eyes there's something about it. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4778.879999999999s)]
*  It's like you realize like oh my god I'm like a water balloon. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4781.72s)]
*  I'm so you know we're just like so weak and soft. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4784.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah we've been putting together not because we're not going to release them. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4788.0s)]
*  The next step for their lives is to study them and see you know how they're changed [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4792.84s)]
*  by their DNA being modified measure things like their gene expression their growth their [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4797.0s)]
*  health span their lifespan. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4801.4800000000005s)]
*  Learn the consequences of the work that we're doing. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4803.88s)]
*  Learn how they interact with the habitat. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4806.04s)]
*  Use Khaleesi to her brothers and the next animals that we make into that pack to make [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4808.24s)]
*  a small pack but they will stay on that secure expansive ecological preserve. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4812.639999999999s)]
*  Yes and you're not going to let them breed. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4817.16s)]
*  No the plan is not to let them breed. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4820.5199999999995s)]
*  How will you prevent them from breeding. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4822.36s)]
*  Well at the at the moment they're separated. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4825.0s)]
*  But we'll probably use subcutaneous you know you can put a hormonal contraceptive. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4828.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4836.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4837.48s)]
*  There's been some ideas of maybe. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4838.48s)]
*  So we don't want to castrate them which would obviously be a way to stop it. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4840.879999999999s)]
*  But because we want them to be able to reach their full size because we want to know what [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4844.599999999999s)]
*  that would be. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4848.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4849.08s)]
*  And we want them to be able to have the hormones to be able to do that. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4850.08s)]
*  So but they will be controlled there. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4851.679999999999s)]
*  There you know we track them. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4853.599999999999s)]
*  There's cameras on them all the time. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4854.919999999999s)]
*  There's three separate layers of fencing to keep them in. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4856.28s)]
*  We know exactly where they are. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4859.12s)]
*  They couldn't get a splinter without a camera somewhere seeing it and we know exactly what's [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4860.799999999999s)]
*  going on with them. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4864.639999999999s)]
*  So yeah. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4866.34s)]
*  We'll. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4867.34s)]
*  That sounds like a scene in Jurassic Park. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4868.34s)]
*  We have a totally. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4870.74s)]
*  Don't worry. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4871.74s)]
*  We have cameras upon cameras. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4872.74s)]
*  No I was. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4874.58s)]
*  Do I sound like the scientist. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4875.58s)]
*  No you don't. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4877.46s)]
*  And I kind of do actually. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4878.46s)]
*  I was in Mauritius. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4881.42s)]
*  Which scientist. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4882.42s)]
*  You know Jeff Goldblum was the scientist. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4883.42s)]
*  I'm Henry Wu. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4885.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4886.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm the chief scientist. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4887.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4888.9800000000005s)]
*  So I'm a good guy for now. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4889.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4890.9800000000005s)]
*  But he becomes a bad guy in the future. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4891.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4892.9800000000005s)]
*  So I'm looking forward to my evil transition. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4893.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm not. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4895.58s)]
*  We're not making. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4896.58s)]
*  We're not making dinosaurs. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4897.58s)]
*  But you know there were other cool animals that we have DNA for. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4898.58s)]
*  We have. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4902.14s)]
*  I heard you talking about the American cheetah. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4903.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4906.62s)]
*  So I have. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4907.62s)]
*  We have two high quality genome sequences from American cheetah. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4908.62s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4911.66s)]
*  We want them back to help with our with our population problems. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4912.66s)]
*  So let's get to the criticisms because there's people that are saying that these are not dire [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4918.46s)]
*  wolves. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4924.22s)]
*  That what you've done is just manipulate the DNA of a gray wolf. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4925.22s)]
*  They are dire wolves because we have manipulated the DNA of gray wolves. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4929.9400000000005s)]
*  We we took dire wolf genome sequences from animals one animal that lived seventy two [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4934.62s)]
*  thousand years ago and one animal that lived thirteen thousand years ago. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4939.9400000000005s)]
*  And we lined them up next to each other and figured out what it is that makes a dire wolf [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4943.42s)]
*  a dire wolf. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4948.18s)]
*  And then we used the tools of genome engineering to bring those traits back in Romulus, Remus [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4949.22s)]
*  and Khaleesi that are three dire wolves that are alive now. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4955.66s)]
*  And that has created these animals that you saw that are bigger and they're stronger and [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4959.700000000001s)]
*  they have that dire wolf coat. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4964.42s)]
*  And that's a cool thing too. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4966.54s)]
*  That coat the light coat color that you see was something that we absolutely could not [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4967.820000000001s)]
*  have known without the ancient DNA because no one has ever seen a dire wolf. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4972.34s)]
*  When we published a paper before I joined Colossal many years ago that was about dire [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4978.18s)]
*  wolf evolution. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4981.9800000000005s)]
*  We had a paleo artist reconstruct what dire wolves looked like and they made them red [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4983.54s)]
*  and reddy brown. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4987.740000000001s)]
*  And that's because so many other animals seem to be reddy brown like Bamathsar Neanderthal [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4989.62s)]
*  seem to have had red hair. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4994.14s)]
*  And so we thought sure why not. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4995.34s)]
*  We didn't know because we hadn't sequenced the part of their genome that we could use [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=4996.84s)]
*  to see what color their coats were. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5000.26s)]
*  But both of these two animals that we had higher coverage DNA from had gene variants [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5002.38s)]
*  in genes that are associated with pigmentation. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5008.02s)]
*  How are coats, the hair color and eye color and things like that. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5010.46s)]
*  That suggested they had light colored coats and so we thought that's cool. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5015.06s)]
*  We'll have that as one of our key dire wolf traits that we're bringing back. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5018.14s)]
*  Is it possible that it's like other wolves where there's a variation but you would only [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5022.8s)]
*  sequence the DNA of ones that had white? [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5027.26s)]
*  It's possible. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5029.84s)]
*  I'm sure there were different colors but it's interesting to me that two animals that lived [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5030.84s)]
*  so far apart from each other in time and geography would both have this light color coat. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5034.64s)]
*  So maybe it wasn't that every dire wolf had a light coat but it must have been a predominant [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5040.28s)]
*  color in the population. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5044.68s)]
*  What was the environment in which they lived? [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5046.52s)]
*  So if they lived 13,000 years ago you're talking about the ice age right? [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5049.28s)]
*  Do you think that that's why they had white hair? [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5053.400000000001s)]
*  It's possible. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5056.2s)]
*  Both of these animals were from northern part of their range where it would have been colder [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5057.2s)]
*  They did live through previous interglacial periods. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5061.240000000001s)]
*  125,000 years ago it was as warm as it is today or even warmer with predicted to be [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5063.76s)]
*  no ice at the poles. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5068.280000000001s)]
*  And also we know dire wolves were really common around the La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5069.84s)]
*  We haven't been able to get any DNA out of anything from La Brea. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5073.88s)]
*  That would be an amazing discovery. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5077.240000000001s)]
*  Does the tar just destroys everything? [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5078.76s)]
*  Don't know if it destroys it or if it gets into the bone in a way that we can't get the [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5081.240000000001s)]
*  DNA out. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5086.4400000000005s)]
*  So somehow inhibiting the recovery of the DNA. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5087.4400000000005s)]
*  We'll get there. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5090.2s)]
*  Someday we'll figure it out and that's going to open up a lot of really cool animals. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5091.2s)]
*  It kind of makes sense that like polar bears having that white color would a polar bears [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5094.2s)]
*  actually have it's clear right? [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5099.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah they have their hair is long and it's clear in the end. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5101.5199999999995s)]
*  That's why polar bears and if you've seen those pictures of bears in zoos where they [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5104.4s)]
*  look polar bears in zoos would look green. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5107.48s)]
*  No. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5109.24s)]
*  Are they covered in moss? [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5110.24s)]
*  It grows in the the hair is hollow. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5111.76s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5114.76s)]
*  And so if they're too wet and not cold enough they can turn this is like weird. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5115.76s)]
*  Oh they have mold inside their hair. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5119.28s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5121.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5122.639999999999s)]
*  But it just makes sense that them being that color would have an evolutionary advantage [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5123.639999999999s)]
*  for hunting. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5127.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5128.92s)]
*  Because you're in something that's completely white. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5129.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5131.28s)]
*  And you don't see like a grizzly bear you'd see like oh look at that dark blob. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5132.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5135.4s)]
*  That's moving towards us. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5136.4s)]
*  We did some work in my academic lab where we discovered that polar bears and brown bears [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5137.4s)]
*  hybridize with each other. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5142.48s)]
*  This is one of those funny stories about academia with a scarcity mindset there where we've [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5144.719999999999s)]
*  submitted a grant proposal and we say hey we have this really cool observation that polar [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5150.08s)]
*  bears and brown bears hybridized during the last ice age when they overlap with each other [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5154.32s)]
*  and it gets rejected because they're like that's dumb. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5158.48s)]
*  We know that doesn't happen. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5160.72s)]
*  And then we found another hybrid polar bear from the previous interglacial and then there's [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5161.72s)]
*  evidence that they're hybridizing today. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5165.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5166.8s)]
*  They find them today. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5167.8s)]
*  So whenever they overlap geographically they breed. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5168.8s)]
*  But what's interesting about this is that we always find the hybrids living like brown [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5172.84s)]
*  bears even though it's probably that the mom is a polar bear because a brown bear boy will [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5178.200000000001s)]
*  wake up from hibernation and go out onto polar bear territory to scavenge for food. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5185.92s)]
*  And a polar bear female is an induced ovulator whereas brown bear females are seasonal. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5192.360000000001s)]
*  So a polar bear female will ovulate in the presence of a male. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5198.52s)]
*  So the male comes up to her and will mate her. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5202.64s)]
*  The other way around if a polar bear male had encountered a brown bear female he's probably [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5205.64s)]
*  more likely to eat her than to mate her. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5212.08s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5214.280000000001s)]
*  But that's weird then. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5215.56s)]
*  So why do we always find the hybrids living with brown bears instead of living with polar [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5216.56s)]
*  bears. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5221.72s)]
*  And the polar bear biologists who we've worked with worked a lot of time with Ian Sterling [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5222.72s)]
*  who's a fantastic polar bear biologist from Canadian Wildlife. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5226.52s)]
*  His hypothesis is straightforward that they can't successfully hunt seals if they don't [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5232.04s)]
*  have that white fur. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5237.32s)]
*  Completely makes sense. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5240.24s)]
*  It does. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5241.24s)]
*  They have that ability to swim and they dive under the water and they're also like really [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5242.24s)]
*  clever and how they use those ice shelves and swim from one ice shelf to another. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5246.8s)]
*  But they hide in I mean they even have those things where they cover their nose with their [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5251.48s)]
*  hand, the black nose with their hand because the black nose. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5256.82s)]
*  I know it's insane right. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5260.08s)]
*  Biology is cool. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5262.0s)]
*  It is cool. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5263.0s)]
*  It's cool to think of like how they became successful doing that. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5264.0s)]
*  Who figured that out? [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5267.0s)]
*  How do they have the self-awareness to know that the end of their nose is dark and that [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5268.0s)]
*  other animals can see it. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5271.2s)]
*  But they also hybridize just given the chance to do so. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5272.8s)]
*  Because biology doesn't recognize species concepts. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5277.4s)]
*  Biology doesn't care that that animal is called a brown bear by us and that animal is called [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5280.96s)]
*  a polar bear. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5284.92s)]
*  They run into each other they're like cool just like our Neanderthal ancestors. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5285.92s)]
*  Are those hybrids are they are they fertile? [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5289.52s)]
*  Can they have babies? [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5294.56s)]
*  Yes. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5295.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5296.56s)]
*  This is actually how we discovered it because we found that the place where brown bears [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5297.56s)]
*  hybridized with polar bears during the last ice age was probably the ABC Islands off the [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5301.96s)]
*  coast of Alaska because the ice was that far south at the peak of the last ice age and [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5306.280000000001s)]
*  brown bear boys would move onto the islands as the habitat got better where they encountered [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5310.56s)]
*  these populations of polar bears that had been stranded there as the ice receded pretty [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5315.5599999999995s)]
*  much and so they hybridized there and all brown bears in North America today have ancestry [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5319.639999999999s)]
*  from that admixture with polar bears. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5325.0s)]
*  Geez. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5328.2s)]
*  Wow. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5329.2s)]
*  That's so fascinating. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5330.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5331.2s)]
*  It's just like how we all have ancestry from mixing with Neanderthals. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5332.2s)]
*  Is that from the German zoo? [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5335.759999999999s)]
*  Because there's a couple of bears at it. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5339.879999999999s)]
*  That really looks like a hybrid doesn't it? [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5341.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5343.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think that's one of the traits of both of them. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5344.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's impressive. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5345.96s)]
*  Bears are some of the most fascinating animals ever. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5346.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5349.96s)]
*  It's just an incredible animal. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5350.96s)]
*  So that's it. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5353.68s)]
*  It's really I'm really glad you said it that way that nature doesn't know that there's [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5354.88s)]
*  a polar bear and a brown bear. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5360.92s)]
*  Why would it? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5362.4800000000005s)]
*  You're right. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5363.4800000000005s)]
*  It's just our definitions. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5364.4800000000005s)]
*  Is this part of the problem with the criticism of the science is that we are being very [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5366.16s)]
*  specific about what we're calling these things based on our own definitions that we've all [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5372.76s)]
*  agreed upon. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5377.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5378.8s)]
*  But that the true nature of genes is that there's this like proliferation and fluctuation [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5379.8s)]
*  and all these animals breed with each other and it's like. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5386.6s)]
*  It's kind of that. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5390.8s)]
*  But it's also that we haven't agreed. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5391.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5394.92s)]
*  So there's this group of academic scientists who are trying to say, trying to grasp so [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5395.92s)]
*  tightly to this very precise definition of a species as having to do with DNA, how much [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5400.72s)]
*  DNA matches something else. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5407.400000000001s)]
*  But that is and it's interesting. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5410.08s)]
*  I think the reason that we keep having this conversation is because it's genuinely interesting [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5411.92s)]
*  to talk about species. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5415.2s)]
*  We have come up with dozens of different species concepts and they're all for a particular [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5417.320000000001s)]
*  purpose. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5424.08s)]
*  I am wanting to have a conversation about dinosaur fossils or anything that's a fossil. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5426.08s)]
*  I'm going to use the morphological species concept because that's all I've got. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5431.6s)]
*  I'm going to compare the shape of this bone with the shape of this bone. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5435.72s)]
*  And if they're similar enough to my trained eye, I'm going to call that a species. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5438.88s)]
*  I saw you had a bison Priscus, I'm going to say skull out there. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5444.32s)]
*  This is that's from the from the bone yard. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5449.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5452.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5453.04s)]
*  Step bison. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5454.04s)]
*  Or bison crassicornis, bison occidentalis, bison alasquensis, bison. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5456.0s)]
*  I could go on forever. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5461.12s)]
*  I you know, this is the naming of bison was like sport in the 18th, 19th centuries, mostly [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5462.12s)]
*  19. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5469.72s)]
*  Did you go to the bone lab, the bone yard? [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5470.72s)]
*  I haven't. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5472.08s)]

*  So he comes in. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5562.4400000000005s)]
*  Really? [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5563.4400000000005s)]
*  That's what they want to do when they get paid? [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5564.4400000000005s)]
*  Rings the bell and then goes from table to table sitting around with people. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5565.4400000000005s)]
*  We, the nerdy scientists, paleogeneticists in the corner are trying to just be super [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5568.919999999999s)]
*  nice Canadians talking to these people like, I don't want to fight. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5573.879999999999s)]
*  And he's just looking to fight with someone? [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5578.839999999999s)]
*  Just looking to fight. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5582.0s)]
*  Poor. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5583.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5584.0s)]
*  It's a weird part of the world. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5585.0s)]
*  It's a fun place to work. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5586.0s)]
*  But anyway, I digress. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5587.0s)]
*  There's gold mines like the site outside Fairbanks that are super productive like this. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5588.0s)]
*  And every one of the miners out there has this cool collection. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5592.639999999999s)]
*  And he's not nearly as cool as his, but because he's got so much land, he'd be collecting [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5595.64s)]
*  it for such a long time. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5600.04s)]
*  And I heard those great stories about how he donated material to the American Museum. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5601.52s)]
*  Well, it was previous owners of his property. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5606.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5609.64s)]
*  Right? [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5610.64s)]
*  That's the case, right? [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5611.64s)]
*  And they dumped it in the East River. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5612.64s)]
*  And so they denied dumping it in the East River. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5614.84s)]
*  So then they hired these guys to go and dive for it. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5617.660000000001s)]
*  And John Reeves told everybody where it was. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5621.320000000001s)]
*  I don't know if he hired them or just told them. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5623.68s)]
*  So these guys dove in the East River. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5625.68s)]
*  They found step bison, bones, jaw fragments, all sorts of different... [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5627.8s)]
*  You know what I think is great about that story? [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5632.44s)]
*  I really like it, right? [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5634.2s)]
*  Because I'm sure it's true because they have so much of that material at the American Museum. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5635.68s)]
*  When I started working on bison, and I've worked on bison for 30 years, right? [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5640.5199999999995s)]
*  When I started working on bison, getting back to the species concept, I was trying to figure [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5643.82s)]
*  out if the DNA mapped to these species names. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5647.5s)]
*  And they've got a fantastic collection at the AMNH. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5649.84s)]
*  But a lot of it is crap. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5653.12s)]
*  There's so much bone there, broken pieces or other pieces. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5654.6s)]
*  And you get to the point where you're like, what the hell am I going to do with this? [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5657.84s)]
*  Now, they shouldn't have dumped it in the river, obviously. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5660.56s)]
*  That's dumb. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5662.76s)]
*  But he is going to get the last laugh. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5663.76s)]
*  He won't know because he'll be long dead. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5665.92s)]
*  But in 10,000 years, when the paleontologists of the future are looking in that river, they're [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5667.8s)]
*  going to be like, what the fuck? [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5671.360000000001s)]
*  Right, because there's like tons of it out there. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5673.16s)]
*  What happened here? [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5676.04s)]
*  What is that guy's name? [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5677.24s)]
*  Dirty Water Don? [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5679.24s)]
*  Is that his name? [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5680.24s)]
*  This one guy who's one of the divers, he's found multiple pieces. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5681.96s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure it's there. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5685.08s)]
*  And they probably didn't mean anything terrible by it. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5687.2s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5690.32s)]
*  Those people aren't even around anymore. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5691.32s)]
*  I think this was in the 20s, wasn't it? [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5692.32s)]
*  Probably around the 50s. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5695.4s)]
*  That was when most of the collection came from. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5696.76s)]
*  There was a ton of gold mining activity in the 50s and 60s around Fairbanks. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5698.5199999999995s)]
*  So what they have found on John's property that's so spectacular is that it's really [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5702.4s)]
*  only a few acres that he's getting all this stuff from, which makes you question, like, [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5707.12s)]
*  how did all these animals die off in mass in this very small area where you've got warehouses [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5712.08s)]
*  filled with bones and tusks? [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5718.44s)]
*  Near Dawson, it's called the Klondike region. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5721.48s)]
*  You have this really fine glacial silt, and that settles in different places in different [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5724.0s)]
*  quantities. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5729.5199999999995s)]
*  And it's really quickly, so you get this really fast, thick buildup of this really fine silt [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5730.64s)]
*  that preserves the bones really well. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5734.92s)]
*  So when we go, the gold miners are plaster mining, so they're taking these high pressure [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5737.160000000001s)]
*  water hoses and washing away this frozen dirt, and they let it thaw for a bit, and then they [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5741.200000000001s)]
*  wash away the next layer. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5745.4400000000005s)]
*  They're trying to get to the gold-bearing gravel that's underneath. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5746.6s)]
*  But while they're doing that, literally thousands, tens of thousands of bones come out of there. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5749.72s)]
*  And in some places, it's more rich, more intense than others, but it's there. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5754.120000000001s)]
*  I've taken students up there, and they're all mopey because of the mosquitoes, and they're [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5758.0s)]
*  mopey because they're 19, and they're like, oh, we're never going to find anything. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5763.4800000000005s)]
*  They jump out of the trucks, and they're like, holy shit, is that a mammoth tooth? [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5767.52s)]
*  Like, yeah, that's a mammoth tooth. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5771.16s)]
*  Is that what you brought? [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5773.52s)]
*  That's what I brought you, yeah. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5774.52s)]
*  This is a fossil. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5775.52s)]
*  This is from South Carolina. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5776.6s)]
*  Wow. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5777.6s)]
*  That's from South Carolina? [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5778.6s)]
*  And it's a fossil. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5779.6s)]
*  You can see it's fossilized. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5781.0s)]
*  I know they like knife handles out of this stuff, which seems to me, it's kind of gross. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5782.0s)]
*  Oh, that's your logo on it. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5787.719999999999s)]
*  Of course it's branded, and it's colossal. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5789.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes, our logo. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5792.44s)]
*  But yeah, mammoths, do you know the story about our founding fathers and mammoths? [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5794.76s)]
*  No. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5801.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5802.719999999999s)]
*  So Thomas Jefferson was obsessed with mammoths. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5803.719999999999s)]
*  How did he even know about them? [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5808.76s)]
*  So they were, it's probably mastodons because it was these teeth that were melting out of [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5810.0s)]
*  the salt lakes and things like that in the part of the United States. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5814.4s)]
*  But he was obsessed with them. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5817.48s)]
*  He was getting his friends to mail him teeth that he was finding. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5818.92s)]
*  And he was, this is a funny story. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5823.639999999999s)]
*  Let me see if I can get it right. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5826.48s)]
*  You should look this up too because it's hilarious. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5828.04s)]
*  How mammoths made America great before, and now when we bring our mammoth back, we're [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5830.299999999999s)]
*  going to do it again. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5834.04s)]
*  So there was a guy in France who was writing a series of books. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5835.04s)]
*  He was like Comte de Buffon. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5839.639999999999s)]
*  Comte de Buffon, I think was his name. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5840.639999999999s)]
*  I'm terrible with French, so I probably did it wrong. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5842.32s)]
*  But he was writing a series of books about natural history. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5844.799999999999s)]
*  And the fifth, I think, of his books was called The Theory of American Degeneracy. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5847.88s)]
*  And when it was essentially about how all American animals were more shit than animals [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5854.08s)]
*  from everywhere else in the world. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5860.0s)]
*  And it was during the War of Independence. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5861.759999999999s)]
*  And so it was really popular to hate on American stuff. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5863.4s)]
*  And so he couldn't have pissed off Thomas Jefferson more if he tried. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5867.48s)]
*  He didn't know anything about Thomas Jefferson. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5872.12s)]
*  He was busy fighting with Linnaeus. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5873.92s)]
*  And Linnaeus was busy classifying things. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5875.96s)]
*  And this guy was like, there's no more than 200 species of animals anywhere. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5878.08s)]
*  So why would you bother with that sort of academic silliness rather than think about [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5882.24s)]
*  how the animals got this way in the first place? [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5887.44s)]
*  In his mind, discovering why American animals were so shit was the right way to be spending [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5889.28s)]
*  your time as a natural historian. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5895.44s)]
*  But this pissed Teddy Roosevelt off. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5897.72s)]
*  And so he was trying to figure out how he could prove to this guy that American animals [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5899.68s)]
*  were actually better, bigger. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5903.96s)]
*  So he was getting his friends to compile lists of things about how American bears are bigger [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5905.6s)]
*  than European bears. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5910.240000000001s)]
*  American wolves are bigger than European wolves. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5911.52s)]
*  That it isn't that you come to America, like this guy said, and you suddenly get weaker [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5914.0s)]
*  and your blood gets watery. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5919.240000000001s)]
*  That was what happened. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5921.08s)]
*  That's what they thought. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5922.08s)]
*  And it was a best seller, apparently. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5923.200000000001s)]
*  That's incredible. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5925.4800000000005s)]
*  So they thought living under oppression was really good for you? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5926.4800000000005s)]
*  It's like strength training. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5930.32s)]
*  They were probably imagining, I guess when people came over, they did, there were new [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5931.32s)]
*  diseases. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5934.639999999999s)]
*  They probably did get sick. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5935.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5936.639999999999s)]
*  And so there was probably something in it. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5937.639999999999s)]
*  But so Jefferson went so far as he had a moose sent to this guy's house on his doorstep, [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5939.28s)]
*  but it was like partly rotten when he'd gotten there and somebody put the wrong antlers on [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5946.44s)]
*  its head. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5950.5599999999995s)]
*  It was just really dumb. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5951.5599999999995s)]
*  But his main feature was mammoths, that he knew that this animal, he didn't think they [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5952.719999999999s)]
*  were extinct at the time. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5958.64s)]
*  And nobody really knew about the idea of extinction. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5960.0s)]
*  He was convinced that Lewis and Clark were going to find them, that people were going [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5962.240000000001s)]
*  to find these mammoths still there. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5965.320000000001s)]
*  And that was going to prove. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5968.0s)]
*  Isn't that incredible when you just think that just a few hundred years ago, that was [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5970.84s)]
*  the pinnacle of science. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5975.280000000001s)]
*  That was like the peak of understanding of all the species that were still alive. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5977.400000000001s)]
*  We really didn't know. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5981.84s)]
*  What I don't understand about this is how a person who is a scientist can look at how [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5982.98s)]
*  everything has changed in a couple hundred years or in 20 years when it comes to genetics [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5988.54s)]
*  and still say, oh, we know everything. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5994.94s)]
*  Like I'm right. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5997.299999999999s)]
*  I think it's what you were saying earlier. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5998.459999999999s)]
*  It's a famine mentality. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=5999.9s)]
*  It's just weak people's minds. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6001.86s)]
*  And there's weak human beings out there. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6004.7s)]
*  The way they think is a very weak way of thinking. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6007.339999999999s)]
*  And they want all the attention for themselves. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6009.7s)]
*  And they're very egotistical. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6012.7s)]
*  And it's also very supported by academia. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6013.7s)]
*  There's a lot of bitchy infighting in academia. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6016.0599999999995s)]
*  It's really gross. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6018.34s)]
*  Late 18th century, the idea of extinction was only just beginning to be popularized [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6020.179999999999s)]
*  by some thinkers. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6023.0599999999995s)]
*  George Cuvier. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6024.0599999999995s)]
*  He's the- [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6025.0599999999995s)]
*  Cuvier. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6026.0599999999995s)]
*  Jefferson wasn't among the believers. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6027.0599999999995s)]
*  In a pre-Darwinian age, extinction was a violation of religious ideals. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6028.599999999999s)]
*  God would not let animals go extinct. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6032.74s)]
*  And secular ideas, the balance of nature could never be so significantly upset. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6034.679999999999s)]
*  For Jefferson in particular, extinction was just an unusual theory. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6038.76s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6043.160000000001s)]
*  The bones exist, he wrote. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6044.160000000001s)]
*  Therefore, the animal has existed. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6045.160000000001s)]
*  The movements of nature are in a never-ending circle. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6046.88s)]
*  Well, that's the real question. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6051.64s)]
*  There have been animals that went extinct and then came back, right? [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6054.700000000001s)]
*  The dire wolf. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6058.740000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6059.740000000001s)]
*  But that was because of you guys. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6060.740000000001s)]
*  Wasn't there like a bird that thought was extinct? [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6061.740000000001s)]
*  That's not- [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6064.400000000001s)]
*  And then returned- [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6065.400000000001s)]
*  And they didn't go extinct. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6066.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6067.400000000001s)]
*  They just became- or Bigfoot. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6069.2s)]
*  Oh no, Tasmanian tiger was definitely real. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6070.2s)]
*  But some- with thylacine. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6073.12s)]
*  But Bigfoot was real. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6074.5599999999995s)]
*  It was Gigantopithecus. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6075.5599999999995s)]
*  They think that that was real. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6076.92s)]
*  But Gigantopithecus is really old. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6077.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6079.879999999999s)]
*  But- and would have changed until today. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6080.879999999999s)]
*  I mean, I told you, I have tested. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6083.04s)]
*  People send me all kinds of crazy things. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6085.679999999999s)]
*  The insulation was one of my favorites. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6088.12s)]
*  This is something that I got while I was still doing my PhD. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6090.36s)]
*  People would send us all sorts of crazy things. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6092.639999999999s)]
*  Isn't your insulation, they said it's Bigfoot fur? [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6093.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6095.839999999999s)]
*  It was from a guy somewhere. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6096.839999999999s)]
*  No, they didn't say it was fur. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6098.28s)]
*  No, it was better than that. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6099.56s)]
*  It was- [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6100.88s)]
*  Oh. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6101.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6102.88s)]
*  He was from somewhere in the Carolinas, I can't remember where, and he sent a letter, [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6103.88s)]
*  and it was a handwritten letter, on his personal stationery, which had a naked girl dancing [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6106.56s)]
*  around a pole, which gave him obviously more credibility. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6110.28s)]
*  That's his stationery. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6112.96s)]
*  He's emailing you from his trip club. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6115.6s)]
*  It was a written letter. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6117.360000000001s)]
*  Letter from his trip club. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6118.72s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6119.72s)]
*  Everything's an email domain now. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6120.72s)]
*  It was a while ago. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6121.72s)]
*  And he sent a couple of cuttings of insulation from his basement, telling me that the family [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6123.24s)]
*  of Bigfoots that lived in his basement, he had seen urinating on this insulation. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6128.0s)]
*  So if I was going to get Bigfoot DNA, it was going to be from that insulation. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6132.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6136.48s)]
*  Did you test it? [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6137.48s)]
*  Of course I did. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6138.48s)]
*  You really did? [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6139.48s)]
*  I would have tested him for meth. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6140.48s)]
*  I said, I'll test something. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6141.48s)]
*  Let me find out what you're doing, dude. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6144.48s)]
*  Bigfoot bees in your basement. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6148.16s)]
*  I didn't get any gigantopithecus DNA. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6149.92s)]
*  There was some human DNA on it. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6153.36s)]
*  So what was the year that gigantopithecus, we believe, went extinct? [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6154.6s)]
*  The bones were found in an apothecary shop in China in the early 20th century, right? [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6158.56s)]
*  I don't actually know. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6164.68s)]
*  I think gigantopithecus is millions of years old. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6166.68s)]
*  I think the story is that an anthropologist was in an apothecary shop in China and found [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6169.92s)]
*  the bones. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6175.2s)]
*  I think this was in the early 20th century. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6176.2s)]
*  I think he said, where did you get this? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6179.84s)]
*  He's got giant primate teeth. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6181.6s)]
*  They took them to the place and they found jaw bones that indicated it was bipedal. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6184.2s)]
*  Then they started digging and discovering. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6188.64s)]
*  I don't think they have a full skeleton. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6191.04s)]
*  That's so cool. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6193.08s)]
*  Most things from paleoanthropology are, I'm going to rewrite human history because I found [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6194.76s)]
*  a partial jaw bone with three worn teeth. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6199.08s)]
*  Here's the problem. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6201.16s)]
*  You could tell me whether this is correct. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6203.0s)]
*  Most things will never be fossils. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6205.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6207.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6208.6s)]
*  You can't even know how many species existed and never left a fossil because fossils are [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6209.6s)]
*  hard to make. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6213.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6214.96s)]
*  We're essentially getting the tiniest little bits of information. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6215.96s)]
*  We're trying to piece together this understanding of millions and millions and millions of years [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6221.4800000000005s)]
*  of creatures on this earth. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6226.72s)]
*  To do so arrogantly seems so crazy. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6229.200000000001s)]
*  To be arrogant about something that has, just by the nature of its existence, how do you [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6232.6s)]
*  find it? [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6236.84s)]
*  It's a very limited resource. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6237.84s)]
*  This is one of the super fun things about ancient DNA. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6240.0s)]
*  I don't know, remember who it was who said this, but we don't have any idea if your bone, [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6244.96s)]
*  you paleoanthropologist, if your bone has descendants, but I know that my DNA has ancestors. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6251.12s)]
*  I can learn a ton by sequencing the DNA from the people that are around. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6258.44s)]
*  If I am lucky enough to get it from these bones that I know is real about human history [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6262.599999999999s)]
*  and paleoanthropologists and archaeologists in the beginning of ancient DNA hated it because [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6267.88s)]
*  it was going in and going, oh no, turns out you were wrong about that. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6273.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6277.0s)]
*  Oh, Neanderthals and humans didn't interbreed. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6278.0s)]
*  Oh, turns out you were wrong about that. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6280.280000000001s)]
*  I remember them teaching us that in high school. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6282.2s)]
*  Based on what data? [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6285.08s)]
*  I know, but that's the thing is they taught it so arrogantly. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6286.08s)]
*  Did people breed with Neanderthals? [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6289.16s)]
*  Nope, that was impossible. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6290.68s)]
*  They would say it so arrogantly. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6292.4800000000005s)]
*  This is just high school teachers. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6293.72s)]
*  Now we know that they did and we've been able to learn so many cool things about humans [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6295.4s)]
*  from studying this Neanderthal genome. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6301.4s)]
*  I know people get hung up on DNA and how you need lots of DNA to define a species, but [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6304.32s)]
*  we have been able now to look. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6310.679999999999s)]
*  I think one of the coolest things that we've learned from the Neanderthal genome is that [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6313.08s)]
*  we all know that we have somewhere between two and 5% Neanderthal DNA in our genomes. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6318.96s)]
*  We kind of get that now. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6324.32s)]
*  You can get your DNA tested at one of these DNA testing places and they'll even tell you [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6325.32s)]
*  how much Neanderthal you are so you can have a competition with your brother and your cousins. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6329.0s)]
*  I'm more Neanderthal than you. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6333.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm amazing. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6335.08s)]
*  Have you seen my forehead? [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6336.08s)]
*  Less well known though is that we all have a different two to 5% Neanderthal DNA. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6338.759999999999s)]
*  If you were to go around the world and collect all of the Neanderthal DNA sequences that [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6344.04s)]
*  alive today, we could put together like 93% of the Neanderthal genome. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6349.88s)]
*  That's cool, right? [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6356.4800000000005s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6357.4800000000005s)]
*  So two questions then. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6358.4800000000005s)]
*  Are they actually extinct? [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6360.4400000000005s)]
*  If we can put together 93% of their genome by pulling together people who are alive today, [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6361.84s)]
*  that's just a fun philosophical question. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6366.72s)]
*  Second is what the hell is going on in that other 7%, right? [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6369.52s)]
*  And if we want to know what it is that makes us human, that's where we look, right? [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6373.32s)]
*  That's where we ask what are the mutations that arose since we split from Neanderthals [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6378.68s)]
*  that if a baby got that part of the Neanderthal DNA, it didn't survive. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6384.64s)]
*  It couldn't make it as a human. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6389.6s)]
*  That is the bit that is important to define us. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6391.6s)]
*  We've actually been able to narrow that down. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6394.04s)]
*  There's less than 100 genes, we think, less than 100 mutations in genes now that have [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6395.84s)]
*  evolved since that split that most people that are alive today have. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6401.6s)]
*  And that is what makes us human. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6406.4s)]
*  I think I'm still fixated on what you said earlier because I think it's so important [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6409.84s)]
*  that we decided what these animals were. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6414.16s)]
*  We gave them these very specific names and that genes in nature don't they don't care [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6417.5199999999995s)]
*  what we're saying. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6424.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6426.16s)]
*  It doesn't there's this weird thing that's happening from the time we were proto hominids [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6427.16s)]
*  to what we are today. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6432.04s)]
*  It makes sense though. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6433.86s)]
*  We want to have a conversation. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6434.88s)]
*  And if we want to talk about something, we have to call it something. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6436.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6440.08s)]
*  Australopithecus. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6441.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6442.08s)]
*  So we have species concepts that we designed that allow us to have a conversation and know [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6443.08s)]
*  what we're talking about. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6447.4400000000005s)]
*  So when I talk about and I call this fossil a name, you and I know that we're having the [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6448.6s)]
*  same conversation. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6452.400000000001s)]
*  If I am in charge of delineating species because I'm trying to figure out which agency is going [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6453.78s)]
*  care for this endangered species, I might use geography to figure out what one species [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6463.64s)]
*  is and what another species is. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6468.200000000001s)]
*  The species concept that we learn when we take our introductory biology course is a [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6470.12s)]
*  species concept that was developed in the middle part of the 20th century called the [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6475.08s)]
*  biological species concept, which says you're a species if you can breed and if your offspring [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6479.58s)]
*  are fertile. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6485.400000000001s)]
*  But we know that lots of things violate that brown bears and polar bears. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6488.240000000001s)]
*  We just talked about how their hybrids, humans and Neanderthals violate that. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6491.4s)]
*  Cattle and bison violate that to a way less of an extent than we thought that they did. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6496.2s)]
*  This is actually a cool story that I think that I think. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6501.96s)]
*  Do you know what a beefalo is? [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6503.84s)]
*  Yes. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6505.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6506.719999999999s)]
*  Is it the female cow and the male bison or vice versa? [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6507.719999999999s)]
*  No, a beefalo is a breed of hybrid that is five eighths cattle and three eighths bison [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6510.84s)]
*  that supposedly has better meat. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6519.4s)]
*  Do they do it on purpose? [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6521.679999999999s)]
*  Yes, it was one of these breeds that they tried to make. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6522.679999999999s)]
*  But does it work both ways? [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6525.08s)]
*  Does it work with a male bison and a female cow or a male bull and a female bison? [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6526.08s)]
*  It turns out it barely works at all. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6530.799999999999s)]
*  Do they do it artificially or do they have them party together? [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6533.639999999999s)]
*  No, they just lied. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6538.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, it's fake? [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6540.48s)]
*  It's not real. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6543.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6544.5199999999995s)]
*  I've spent a lot of time being interested in this admixture history. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6545.84s)]
*  I was interested in brown bears and polar bears and humans and Neanderthals. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6553.040000000001s)]
*  What is it that suddenly makes a species not able to breed with another species? [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6556.4400000000005s)]
*  What is it that causes that last wall to go up and then suddenly you're the biological [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6561.4400000000005s)]
*  species? [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6566.240000000001s)]
*  What exactly is it? [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6567.240000000001s)]
*  Can we figure it out? [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6568.240000000001s)]
*  I wanted to look at these different species pairs. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6569.240000000001s)]
*  We knew about beefalo because people have beefalo ranches. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6571.240000000001s)]
*  There's a beefalo of the week. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6574.84s)]
*  You should look that up because this is going to be like there's beefalo of the week competition [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6576.28s)]
*  where you see these animals. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6580.24s)]
*  So people in the early 20th century decided that they wanted to make hybrid cattle and [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6582.52s)]
*  bison because they wanted animals that were as robust in the North American prairies as [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6588.16s)]
*  bison but as tame and easy to deal with as cattle. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6593.68s)]
*  They started breeding them together and we're just like this isn't working. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6596.92s)]
*  This is really hard. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6601.1s)]
*  When we get the F1s, that's first generation hybrids, often it's only the females and they're [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6602.76s)]
*  not reproductive. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6609.280000000001s)]
*  There's problems here. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6610.52s)]
*  We can't do this. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6611.76s)]
*  So then people kept trying to do it because they really wanted to do this. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6618.08s)]
*  And then there was this guy called, I can't remember the name of the person who actually [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6620.84s)]
*  did it, who claimed that he had been able to create this animal that was 3 eighths bison [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6625.400000000001s)]
*  and 5 eighths cattle. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6630.56s)]
*  He sold his animal to a guy called Bud Basolo in California who created this herd of 5,000 [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6631.88s)]
*  beefalo and it was announced with great fanfare, like front pages of newspapers. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6637.4400000000005s)]
*  He sold one animal to a farmer in Canada for $2.5 million, $19.75. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6641.68s)]
*  It's still the most expensive single animal that has ever been sold. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6647.88s)]
*  $2.5 million, $19.75 for this animal. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6652.88s)]
*  And so we have this thing. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6656.72s)]
*  I was like, we're going to sample them. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6657.84s)]
*  We were working with collaborators from the USDA. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6659.64s)]
*  We were reaching out to people, reaching out to ranches and saying, can we have a piece [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6663.160000000001s)]
*  of your stuff? [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6666.76s)]
*  And they were like, not sure about research on this. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6667.76s)]
*  And so we started buying tongues because if you buy steak, you just get the same animal [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6670.72s)]
*  over and over again, but they all have one tongue. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6675.12s)]
*  So you can just buy tongues and then you get lots of different animals. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6677.160000000001s)]
*  We sequenced their genomes. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6680.04s)]
*  And then we got from the USDA their expired sperm straws that they have for the animals [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6681.72s)]
*  that they give away to start your beefalo thing. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6686.68s)]
*  We sequenced their genomes as well, including this $2.5 million, $19.75 individual. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6689.04s)]
*  And we've done a lot of work on bison and cattle throughout the last 30 years of my [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6695.48s)]
*  life. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6700.44s)]
*  And so we have this big plot that shows bison on one side and cattle on the other. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6701.44s)]
*  And we had made a hybrid so we could sequence their genomes. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6705.72s)]
*  He wasn't born. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6708.44s)]
*  It was an aborted animal because it's very hard to make a hybrid. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6709.44s)]
*  He fell right in between them in the middle where you expect him to be. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6712.66s)]
*  So now we know exactly where we think our beefalo should be. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6715.32s)]
*  They're 5 eighths cattle, 3 eighths bison. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6718.44s)]
*  They should fall out closer to cattle, but still up here. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6720.4s)]
*  And so you plot them and they're all just cattle. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6722.96s)]
*  100%. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6726.2s)]
*  They're just cattle. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6727.2s)]
*  It was fake. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6728.2s)]
*  So did they use like Highland cattle or something like that that have those crazy furs? [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6729.2s)]
*  There's some evidence that they used zebu. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6732.36s)]
*  So that's a different type of cattle. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6734.84s)]
*  It's the one that came from Asia. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6736.36s)]
*  They have them in Brazil because they have a hump. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6737.719999999999s)]
*  So it makes it look a little bit more like bison. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6739.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, dirty trick. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6741.36s)]
*  But if you look at it, if you look at the pictures of the beefalo of the week, you look [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6742.36s)]
*  at them and you're like, you know, those are cattle. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6745.719999999999s)]
*  Let me see a beefalo, Jamie. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6748.2s)]
*  I did the beefalo of the week. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6751.56s)]
*  I was on a weird path. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6752.56s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6754.88s)]
*  Wrong websites. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6755.88s)]
*  No, it didn't seem like I was on the same path. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6756.88s)]
*  When was this all discovered that these are just cattle? [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6760.84s)]
*  Just look up beefalo. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6763.24s)]
*  And then you look at historic beefalo, you can see the pictures of historical beefalo. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6764.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6768.28s)]
*  When was it discovered that these are just cattle? [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6769.76s)]
*  We just published the paper like a few months ago. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6773.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6776.2s)]
*  So this poor dude from 1975 that spent two million bucks. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6777.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6781.36s)]
*  He sold it back to Pesolo for some of the money getting back. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6782.36s)]
*  I mean, I think there was a thing going on there. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6785.28s)]
*  So these people are out here still selling beefalo. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6787.28s)]
*  Like it's real. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6789.96s)]
*  Like this is a website. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6790.96s)]
*  And their hybrid was something. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6792.0s)]
*  They're mixed with a little bit of zeeboo. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6793.28s)]
*  Some of them have a little bit of bison in them. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6795.96s)]
*  But this is a... [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6797.88s)]
*  They're just cows. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6798.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6800.88s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6801.88s)]
*  I talked to Steve Vernello about this. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6802.88s)]
*  I know that he's a friend of his. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6804.88s)]
*  He was like, that's hilarious. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6806.759999999999s)]
*  It is hilarious. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6807.759999999999s)]
*  It's very funny. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6809.839999999999s)]
*  It does look different than a regular cow though. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6810.839999999999s)]
*  A little bit. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6814.12s)]
*  I mean, they were trying to do that, right? [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6815.12s)]
*  And we can engineer everything. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6816.12s)]
*  But that's not what they did. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6817.879999999999s)]
*  I mean, a chihuahua looks different from a Great Dane, but their DNA is a lot the same. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6818.879999999999s)]
*  So in 1975, how much of an understanding of this stuff did we have? [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6823.04s)]
*  Did these people think that they were doing this or was it just a scam? [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6826.719999999999s)]
*  I think it... [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6829.48s)]
*  Well, this is me speculating at this point. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6830.48s)]
*  I think he had to know, right? [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6832.679999999999s)]
*  At one point, there was a test, a blood test that they had done where they were looking [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6835.44s)]
*  for markers in the blood. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6838.72s)]
*  And there were five different markers and they tested about 150 different animals and [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6840.28s)]
*  they published a paper saying, oh, look, we tested all these animals. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6843.96s)]
*  None of them have all of the markers. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6847.8s)]
*  One of them has one of the markers. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6850.36s)]
*  And we just think the test is bad. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6852.76s)]
*  Oh. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6854.76s)]
*  No, just... [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6855.76s)]
*  Boy. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6856.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6857.76s)]
*  Fun. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6858.76s)]
*  Anyway, I digress. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6859.76s)]
*  I don't remember what we were talking about. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6860.76s)]
*  Well, we're just talking about a bunch of different animals that used to exist. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6862.96s)]
*  We were talking about Gigantopithecus at one point in time. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6866.96s)]
*  You said it's really old. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6869.6s)]
*  Was it 100,000 years ago? [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6870.92s)]
*  They speculate the age of them? [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6872.4s)]
*  Older. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6874.2s)]
*  Older? [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6875.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6876.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6877.2s)]
*  Maybe... [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6878.2s)]
*  So... [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6879.2s)]
*  2 million to approximately 3 to 200,000 years ago. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6880.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6882.6s)]
*  So as recently as 200,000 years ago. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6883.6s)]
*  So you kind of... [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6886.28s)]
*  Homo sapiens are like 300, 400,000 years? [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6888.96s)]
*  Diverged from Neanderthals. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6891.6s)]
*  Is that like around that time? [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6893.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6894.240000000001s)]
*  So it is possible that at one point... [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6895.240000000001s)]
*  And so this is just a very limited amount of bones, right? [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6897.4400000000005s)]
*  It's just limited, just like everything else in paleoanthropology. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6899.76s)]
*  So it's possible that they existed later than that. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6902.6s)]
*  We just haven't found those samples yet. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6904.72s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6906.280000000001s)]
*  But it's just speculation. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6907.280000000001s)]
*  There was a really cool... [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6908.280000000001s)]
*  This is just about how we don't know anything. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6909.280000000001s)]
*  We can actually get DNA directly from sediments. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6911.56s)]
*  And this has been a relatively recent revelation. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6915.0s)]
*  It's super cool because it means that you can take a plug of dirt from the inside of [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6917.320000000001s)]
*  a lake and you can reconstruct the whole ecosystem as it changes over time. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6921.92s)]
*  Super cool, right? [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6926.28s)]
*  Wow. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6927.88s)]
*  But recently there was a paper that was published by some colleagues of mine that had done this [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6928.88s)]
*  for sites in Canada. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6932.84s)]
*  They found mammoth DNA and horse DNA in Canada in these really well-preserved parts of the [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6934.6s)]
*  world where we've been working that date to probably around 4,000, 5,000 years ago. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6940.0s)]
*  Horse DNA? [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6945.24s)]
*  Yes. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6946.24s)]
*  That's weird, right? [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6947.24s)]
*  Because they're supposed to be extinct in North America when? [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6948.24s)]
*  10,000? [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6950.84s)]
*  But there are a lot of Native American cultures who believe that they have a long history [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6952.64s)]
*  of the horse and that the horse has survived. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6956.4800000000005s)]
*  And it's just dismissed because we don't have evidence for it. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6958.4800000000005s)]
*  But until we find DNA directly in dirt, this is just showing us how much we don't know, [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6962.360000000001s)]
*  how much we have to be really willing to... [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6967.24s)]
*  Obviously we have a model of the way the world works. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6970.84s)]
*  And we don't just throw away the model with new data, but we have to incorporate the new [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6972.8s)]
*  data and see how it impacts. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6976.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6977.52s)]
*  You can't be arrogant about the model. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6978.52s)]
*  The problem is, if you correct me if I'm wrong, that horses evolved in North America, but [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6979.52s)]
*  it went to other continents, but then eventually died off in North America. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6983.6s)]
*  But survived elsewhere. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6988.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6989.72s)]
*  Eohippus, the very first horses are from 50 million years ago. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6990.72s)]
*  They're found in Wyoming. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6993.8s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6994.8s)]
*  And the fossil deposits in Wyoming. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6995.8s)]
*  Those are the little house cat-sized horses. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6996.8s)]
*  House cat-sized horses. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=6998.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7000.240000000001s)]
*  But this is early horses. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7001.240000000001s)]
*  Around the same time as we have the first primates and the first of the other things [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7002.240000000001s)]
*  that we know. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7005.080000000001s)]
*  That's so fascinating. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7006.080000000001s)]
*  It's so cool. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7007.080000000001s)]
*  It's so fascinating. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7008.080000000001s)]
*  All this, we were talking about this the other day. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7009.64s)]
*  The big debate that happened with Clovis first. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7011.72s)]
*  That they used to think that human beings, they came over here at a very specific time [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7015.88s)]
*  and then they found those footprints in White Sands, New Mexico and they're like, okay, [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7020.26s)]
*  we've got to rethink this. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7024.12s)]
*  And we're being forced to rethink this. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7025.12s)]
*  And it was another time where archaeologists were horrible to each other. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7026.72s)]
*  These scientists were horrible to each other because they attacked the guy who made the [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7030.8s)]
*  discovery. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7034.76s)]
*  They said, this is nonsense. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7035.76s)]
*  This is impossible. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7036.76s)]
*  We know, we're very clear, which is this arrogance. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7037.94s)]
*  Yeah, they did that to Jacques Sanck-Mars who discovered the bones in Alaska, Northern [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7041.099999999999s)]
*  Canada that had cut marks on them that were older than the accepted time of when humans [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7045.86s)]
*  could be there. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7050.099999999999s)]
*  And now everybody accepts that as it's true. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7051.099999999999s)]
*  We know that. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7053.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7054.58s)]
*  It's so gross. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7055.58s)]
*  It's so gross and they keep doing it over and over and over again. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7056.58s)]
*  So then the question is, okay, if we have 22,000 year old footprints, how many thousands [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7058.299999999999s)]
*  of years were they here before that? [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7064.259999999999s)]
*  Have they always been here? [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7066.219999999999s)]
*  How did they get here? [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7067.22s)]
*  Like, what's the earliest known humans? [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7068.22s)]
*  You know, we know that there's no Neanderthals here so far. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7070.26s)]
*  So far. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7074.06s)]
*  So far, there's no Denisovans. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7075.06s)]
*  But imagine they found a different kind of human. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7076.780000000001s)]
*  Wasn't there something that came up where they found some human that lived, oh God, [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7079.860000000001s)]
*  I want to say 6,000 years ago and his DNA is different. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7086.7s)]
*  This is like very recent, different than anybody that they've ever discovered before. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7089.42s)]
*  So like, okay. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7093.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, that would be interesting. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7094.9400000000005s)]
*  I think this is like super recent, like yesterday or the day before. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7096.099999999999s)]
*  But it's just these things keep, they keep finding new stuff. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7099.54s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7103.78s)]
*  6,000 year old skeletons with never before seen DNA rewrites human history. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7104.78s)]
*  Huh. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7110.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7111.179999999999s)]
*  So this was just June 7th. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7112.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know anything about this. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7113.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7114.179999999999s)]
*  They uncovered 6,000 year old skeletons in Colombia that belonged to a mysterious group [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7115.179999999999s)]
*  of people that could rewrite human history. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7117.5s)]
*  It doesn't match any of the other known indigenous populations. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7119.78s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7121.86s)]
*  Their genetic signature reveals a distinct, now extinct lineage that may have descended [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7123.18s)]
*  from the earliest humans to reach South America. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7127.1s)]
*  One that diverged early and remained genetically isolated for thousands of years. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7130.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7135.3s)]
*  This is, I mean, I have no doubt that this is true. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7136.3s)]
*  I mean, how many of these human settlements are gone now? [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7137.860000000001s)]
*  And so we don't have any evidence of them. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7142.06s)]
*  And they're all lineages that they all go back to humans originating in Africa at some [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7144.02s)]
*  point, but we haven't seen all of them. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7149.06s)]
*  We haven't seen all of the pattern. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7151.46s)]
*  We don't know even what questions we should be asking. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7154.1s)]
*  You know what you guys really need to try to bring back? [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7156.1s)]
*  Those little tridactyl skeletons they find in Peru. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7159.1s)]
*  That's like when we had Luke Caverns on and Jessie, when we had Jessie Michaels on the [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7163.14s)]
*  other day, who has an amazing YouTube show, both of them great guys, they were showing [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7168.22s)]
*  us these skeletons that they found in Peru that are very bizarre. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7173.14s)]
*  And people initially thought they were hoax, but then they found these newer ones that [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7177.34s)]
*  they've discovered that they have three fingers and three toes and done cat scans on these [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7181.5s)]
*  things and they seem to be human or human like these things. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7186.34s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen these. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7191.02s)]
*  They're amazing. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7192.26s)]
*  Like I thought 100% horse shit when I first saw them, because I think some of them are [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7193.26s)]
*  horse shit. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7197.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7198.46s)]
*  But then when they've done like, look at that image below where they do like X-rays of them. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7199.46s)]
*  Like come on. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7202.54s)]
*  Like what the hell is that? [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7203.54s)]
*  Like what is that? [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7205.66s)]
*  That's seen that there's no way if again, I'll say it again. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7206.66s)]
*  But that's art. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7210.62s)]
*  Let me buy it. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7211.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7212.62s)]
*  Like somebody made that. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7213.62s)]
*  So those those X-rays are from the the things themselves. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7214.62s)]
*  I think I've seen some of these. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7217.46s)]
*  The cat scans are even weirder because the cat scans when they show like these the 3D [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7218.46s)]
*  cat scan of the body, you're seeing all the areas where the cartilage is and it just but [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7225.62s)]
*  it doesn't look totally human because this is it. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7231.78s)]
*  So they have three fingers and three toes. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7234.66s)]
*  It's really weird stuff. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7237.3s)]
*  Like there's layers of them as they go, you know, as you go through a cat scan. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7238.62s)]
*  How old are they? [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7242.38s)]
*  I've seen some of the reports. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7243.38s)]
*  This is the thing that was presented to the Mexican government at some point. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7245.3s)]
*  This is Peru. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7248.18s)]
*  The Mexican one seemed to be horse shit. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7249.18s)]
*  OK, it seems like and the guy who discovered them air quotes, right, seems to have a history [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7250.860000000001s)]
*  of finding silly things. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7255.34s)]
*  But this seems real. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7257.88s)]
*  This seems very real. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7259.3s)]
*  Like look at this thing. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7260.3s)]
*  What's that on the neck? [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7262.820000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7263.820000000001s)]
*  What is that on the neck? [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7264.820000000001s)]
*  Who the hell knows? [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7265.820000000001s)]
*  Why does it have so many ribs? [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7267.34s)]
*  Like look at it. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7269.219999999999s)]
*  Go back to that image where it shows the back. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7270.219999999999s)]
*  Jamie where it was like, yeah, like when you see this thing, this guy's not like showing [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7273.219999999999s)]
*  you the full body in this particular image. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7278.34s)]
*  Whatever the hell that thing is on the back of his head is where the shape of its head [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7280.54s)]
*  is very weird. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7283.42s)]
*  But it looks real. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7285.099999999999s)]
*  Like if you guys could find that that's real, I know you won't bring back Neanderthals, [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7287.179999999999s)]
*  but why don't you bring back one of them little three-toed alien people? [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7292.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7295.179999999999s)]
*  We still have to ask their permission. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7296.54s)]
*  It looks like a person. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7297.54s)]
*  Listen, just talk to them. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7298.54s)]
*  Bring them back. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7299.54s)]
*  If they say no, shoot them in the head. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7300.54s)]
*  I don't know what to tell you. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7303.54s)]
*  But bring them back. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7304.54s)]
*  Some things you just have to do. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7306.34s)]
*  Like if we find out that that thing was a real thing, like what is that? [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7307.9400000000005s)]
*  What's that thing in the back of its head? [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7312.22s)]
*  People tried to do DNA work or protein work on these things? [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7313.740000000001s)]
*  I think there's a small select group of people that are even taking it seriously. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7316.3s)]
*  But more people are taking it seriously now because of the CAT scans. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7322.54s)]
*  Because I think initially, have you seen the original ones, the ones that look super fake? [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7325.42s)]
*  Yes. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7329.42s)]
*  The ones that look super fake look like something you'd buy in a roadside stand. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7330.42s)]
*  They look totally bullshit. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7334.18s)]
*  But then I was going back and forth with Jesse Michaels and Luke Caverns and they were sending [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7336.74s)]
*  me these images of, I think it was 800 BC. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7343.58s)]
*  This is how old these drawings are and these tapestries that show these weird three-toed, [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7350.259999999999s)]
*  three-fingered things that look like a little one of those things. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7357.5s)]
*  So was this another type of human that lived with us at some point in time? [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7363.2s)]
*  It's interesting. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7367.62s)]
*  There are the three-toed and three-fingered thing. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7369.179999999999s)]
*  It's interesting. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7371.42s)]
*  I wonder if there's a genetic mutation that would lead to that. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7372.42s)]
*  You've seen that the tribe, there's an isolated tribe that has the two. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7374.54s)]
*  So maybe that was that. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7380.38s)]
*  Maybe that's what that was. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7382.0599999999995s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7383.0599999999995s)]
*  It would be fascinating to see if there's any DNA that could be recovered or proteins. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7384.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7388.7s)]
*  So why don't you guys get down to Peru? [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7389.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7391.98s)]
*  I'll run it by Ben and see what he thinks. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7392.98s)]
*  He would be into it. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7394.82s)]
*  I know. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7395.82s)]
*  Ben seems like he'd be like, let's go. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7396.82s)]
*  If you could find Gigantopithecus DNA, I think Ben would want to bring back Bigfoot. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7397.82s)]
*  Yes, probably. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7403.0199999999995s)]
*  Let's not tell him. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7404.0199999999995s)]
*  I think that's what Bigfoot is, don't you think? [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7405.3s)]
*  Gigantopithecus? [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7407.7s)]
*  Was it in Asia though? [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7408.82s)]
*  Yes. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7409.82s)]
*  Bigfoot is supposed to be in North America. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7410.82s)]
*  Well, they found the bones in China. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7411.82s)]
*  Yeah, so it could have come across. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7413.3s)]
*  Make sure that story is right that I said. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7415.46s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it's true. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7417.179999999999s)]
*  Gigantopithecus bones found in the apothecary shop in China. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7419.0599999999995s)]
*  I just didn't want to bring it up. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7421.5s)]
*  That's a guy named Ralph von Konigswald, 1935. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7423.5s)]
*  They're being sold as dragon bones. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7428.5s)]
*  So they bought a bunch of stuff and then they started looking at them and found out that [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7431.5s)]
*  that's not what they were. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7435.86s)]
*  So it's 35. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7437.58s)]
*  Early to middle Pleistocene in China. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7438.58s)]
*  That was super interesting. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7442.58s)]
*  And I wonder if these populations were there. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7445.18s)]
*  They're there at the same time as Denisovans were there, Neanderthals were there. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7447.22s)]
*  If they could have hybridized with humans, they probably would have. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7451.38s)]
*  Geez. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7454.82s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7455.82s)]
*  We know so little. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7456.82s)]
*  Well, it seems to like it coexisted with Homo sapiens. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7457.82s)]
*  So I mean, but when did it start existing? [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7462.1s)]
*  How long was that? [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7465.46s)]
*  Neanderthals were around for what? [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7466.46s)]
*  300,000 years or so. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7468.3s)]
*  Which is kind of crazy when you think that people, you know, we've really only been running [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7470.5s)]
*  things for a small period of time. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7475.3s)]
*  I don't know who added this. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7477.34s)]
*  Closely allied with orangutans. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7479.02s)]
*  Once thought to be hominem, now thought to be closely allied with orangutans. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7480.82s)]
*  So once thought to be a member of the human line. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7485.18s)]
*  Well, it was thought for a long time that orangutans were our closest living relative [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7488.7s)]
*  as well. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7494.66s)]
*  Have you seen them spearfishing? [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7495.86s)]
*  No. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7496.86s)]
*  Yeah, they've learned that spearfish. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7497.86s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7498.86s)]
*  They don't know whether it's from observing people. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7499.86s)]
*  That's what they assume. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7501.58s)]
*  But there's this crazy photograph of this orangutan hanging onto his branch. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7502.7s)]
*  He's got a long stick in his hand and he's like leaning into the river stabbing a fish. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7506.9s)]
*  You got to see it. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7510.94s)]
*  So crazy. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7512.38s)]
*  Did they learn from us? [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7513.38s)]
*  We don't not necessarily know. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7514.5s)]
*  So cool. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7516.26s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7517.26s)]
*  Really crazy. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7518.26s)]
*  Like he's figured out how to catch fish. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7519.26s)]
*  Really? [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7521.94s)]
*  Oh, it says after observing locals, which totally makes sense. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7523.219999999999s)]
*  Right? [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7526.379999999999s)]
*  Smart. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7527.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7528.379999999999s)]
*  I mean, he's seen people catch a fish and he's like, whoa, how did you do that? [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7529.379999999999s)]
*  Which is probably how people learn. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7531.98s)]
*  Like some really smart ape guy was like, you know, I think I can hit that bird with a rock. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7534.58s)]
*  Learning and being able to communicate is one of the ways that we got the advantage [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7541.299999999999s)]
*  over everything else. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7544.139999999999s)]
*  Right? [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7545.139999999999s)]
*  Because I don't have to evolve the ability to cook dinner. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7546.139999999999s)]
*  I can learn from my mom. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7548.419999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7550.58s)]
*  Right. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7551.58s)]
*  That's what's so fascinating about living today is you don't have to even learn from [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7553.22s)]
*  someone who's anywhere near you. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7555.5s)]
*  You're learning from things on your phone instantaneously, on your laptop. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7556.82s)]
*  And you don't have to learn because there's DoorDash. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7561.0599999999995s)]
*  Right. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7563.18s)]
*  You can stay alive very easy. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7564.18s)]
*  That's true too. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7566.42s)]
*  But it's just, you know, when AI gets involved in this stuff, when we have sentient AI that [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7567.5s)]
*  you can use to try to, you know, figure out what the consequences of bringing certain [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7574.1s)]
*  species back and whether or not it would be a pro or a con. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7580.38s)]
*  Like what, you know, that's where things get weird. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7584.02s)]
*  Like if we decide, okay, let's bring back the woolly mammoth. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7587.14s)]
*  Okay, what's going to be the negative impact of bringing back the woolly mammoth? [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7589.5s)]
*  Well, they're going to eat a lot. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7592.26s)]
*  So they're going to push out. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7593.74s)]
*  You don't need sentient AI to do that. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7594.74s)]
*  I mean, we have, we can. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7596.900000000001s)]
*  No, you don't. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7597.900000000001s)]
*  But humans will make decisions based on biased evidence. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7598.900000000001s)]
*  We'll make decisions based on our, the potential for a financial windfall. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7603.18s)]
*  You know, we'll gaslight people into thinking things are really a good idea and it's safe [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7608.54s)]
*  for everyone. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7613.98s)]
*  And we'll do things if we know that we could profit. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7614.98s)]
*  Whereas if you have AI that's going to be completely objective and its only mission [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7617.78s)]
*  is to analyze the outcome. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7623.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7625.86s)]
*  Ooh, that world. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7626.86s)]
*  You know, we're actually working with teams of people that are external to colossal to [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7628.98s)]
*  put together the rewilding plans and that sort of thing for each of the different species. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7632.94s)]
*  We're not planning to rewild the dire wolves, but we still have done this. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7637.22s)]
*  We've put together a plan of what the potential impacts would be, but we deliberately keep [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7640.42s)]
*  that outside and hire people to put this together for us. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7643.860000000001s)]
*  And we haven't been delivered this yet. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7647.740000000001s)]
*  So we'll see what it says when we get it. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7649.54s)]
*  Like, yeah, they're going to kill everything. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7651.42s)]
*  They are not going to kill everything. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7655.62s)]
*  So what animal do you think? [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7657.18s)]
*  Well, obviously you guys are working with the red wolves and you plan to use which, [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7660.26s)]
*  which are normal native animals in North America that are threatened, which most people would [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7664.38s)]
*  agree is a good idea to give them a healthy population and release them. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7668.860000000001s)]
*  And that's the best argument because there's a lot of people saying, oh, this work could [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7672.66s)]
*  be used for conservation. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7676.74s)]
*  It is being used for conservation. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7678.5s)]
*  That's so infuriating about some of these haters. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7680.66s)]
*  They don't even bother looking it up or they don't care because they just want attention [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7683.22s)]
*  and they just want to be negative. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7687.02s)]
*  And that's the best way to get attention. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7688.02s)]
*  They want the click. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7689.02s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7690.02s)]
*  And the best way to get that click is to whine, to whine and complain. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7691.02s)]

*  That's the punishment. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7697.660000000001s)]

*  You just want to be this bitchy person. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7700.860000000001s)]
*  You're going to say that one thing forever. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7702.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7704.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is like, oh, congratulations. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7705.860000000001s)]
*  You get a lot of attention for just being super negative all the time. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7706.860000000001s)]
*  But the if you had to like look at their argument, like the so the argument of like not doing [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7710.42s)]
*  this and that you're not really creating a dire wolf and this is just you're just taking [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7717.42s)]
*  dire wolf genes and adding them to gray wolf. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7722.54s)]
*  Have you ever had conversations with these people where they want to tell you that what [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7726.3s)]
*  you're doing is wrong? [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7730.58s)]
*  And what is your response to these people? [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7731.58s)]
*  I think that this idea that the technology that we are developing is something that we [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7733.54s)]
*  shouldn't be developing because it's it's wrong. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7740.0199999999995s)]
*  It's for some somehow playing God. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7742.58s)]
*  Yes. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7745.38s)]
*  I mean, people have been playing God for as long as we've existed as a lineage. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7746.38s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7751.5s)]
*  Making species become extinct as we spread around the world, not intentionally initially, [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7753.26s)]
*  but we change the habitat. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7757.46s)]
*  We hunt things. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7758.74s)]
*  Then we figured out that we didn't have to make a species go extinct in order to feed [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7760.18s)]
*  our families. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7763.7s)]
*  And so we evolved domestication. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7764.7s)]
*  We figured out how to only take the males or leave the juveniles or some way of maintaining [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7766.78s)]
*  that population so that you knew you could go back to the hunt the next year and they [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7773.98s)]
*  would be there again. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7777.14s)]
*  And we domesticated things. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7778.14s)]
*  And then we transformed to really authority over everything. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7779.44s)]
*  When we protect a species, people who think about conservation often think of this as [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7782.96s)]
*  super hands off. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7787.12s)]
*  Like I'm not doing anything. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7788.32s)]
*  Everything just gets to evolve the way that it should be. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7790.16s)]
*  That's bullshit. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7793.32s)]
*  Like we decide how many animals live, where they get to live, what they get to eat, how [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7794.32s)]
*  many they get to eat. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7798.799999999999s)]
*  We call them when we want to. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7800.32s)]
*  We protect them if we want to. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7801.759999999999s)]
*  We don't if we want to. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7803.2s)]
*  We are as gods, as Stuart Brand wrote in the Whole Earth catalog. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7804.92s)]
*  We just better get good at it. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7809.56s)]
*  These technologies are not exactly the same as the technologies that our ancestors had [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7811.68s)]
*  because we are directly changing DNA sequences. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7816.64s)]
*  But they are technologies that we can deploy to hopefully try to fix some of the things [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7820.0s)]
*  that we have fucked up already. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7825.3s)]
*  And I think the biggest challenge that I have is to show people that deciding not to allow [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7828.06s)]
*  ourselves the space that we need to figure out what we can do with these technologies, [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7836.780000000001s)]
*  we're still operating within regulatory frameworks. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7842.8s)]
*  We're still operating within the bounds of biological reality. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7845.22s)]
*  There's a long way to go here. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7848.9400000000005s)]
*  But if we decide that that's too scary, that we don't trust ourselves, that we're always [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7850.660000000001s)]
*  going to make the worst decision. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7854.5s)]
*  First of all, it's that attitude of negativity, right? [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7856.32s)]
*  It's the I don't want to do it because it's too scary because I'm going to be bad. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7858.9s)]
*  Second of all, it's a decision. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7862.6s)]
*  And to think that that decision has no consequences is naive. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7864.9s)]
*  We know what the consequences are. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7869.14s)]
*  The rate of extinction today is thousands to tens of thousands times higher than it [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7870.94s)]
*  is across the history of the fossil record. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7875.98s)]
*  And a lot of that is because of us. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7879.54s)]
*  But we have the capacity to slow that rate. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7881.5s)]
*  We have the capacity to help species that are alive today adapt to the rapid changes [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7884.32s)]
*  in their habitat. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7889.5599999999995s)]
*  What if we could make Hawaiian honey creepers resistant to avian malaria, which we introduced [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7890.719999999999s)]
*  by introducing mosquitoes into their habitat and save them from becoming extinct? [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7896.44s)]
*  Or figure out how to transfer resistance to bleaching to corals around the world? [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7900.04s)]
*  Or anything that we could do to save some of these habitats that we know are in trouble [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7905.759999999999s)]
*  Because of this combination of people expanding and natural change to the ecosystem that we [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7911.04s)]
*  just don't like. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7916.160000000001s)]
*  We don't want to see spruce forest disappearing because it's getting drier. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7917.9800000000005s)]
*  And that means that they can't make enough resin to fight off the beetles. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7921.780000000001s)]
*  We have the capacity to use these tools or at least to think about how we might develop [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7926.56s)]
*  and deploy these tools to have a future that is both filled with people and biodiverse. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7930.52s)]
*  I think what people are concerned with is the crude application of these techniques [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7935.92s)]
*  and this science when it's in its infancy. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7943.08s)]
*  And if you just take that and draw it out to its natural conclusion with improvements [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7946.96s)]
*  over time and innovation over time, it could be something that's of an enormous benefit [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7953.22s)]
*  to not just animal species, but humans. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7958.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7960.88s)]
*  To everyone. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7961.88s)]
*  It's kind of like a test run. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7962.88s)]
*  We can make a dire wolf, can we make a super person? [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7965.96s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7968.2s)]
*  It's probably the future. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7969.34s)]
*  Having regular children just rolling the dice on seeing what your kid turns out will probably [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7972.28s)]
*  be super novel a hundred years from now. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7978.96s)]
*  It's an interesting thing to think about. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7983.88s)]
*  And I think we're getting gradually more accustomed to using these technologies to cure genetic [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7986.32s)]
*  diseases like the baby that was in the news over the last couple of weeks, baby KJ, this [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7990.96s)]
*  boy who was born with a metabolic disease. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7996.84s)]
*  He couldn't, he had a genetic change, just a single mutation that meant that he couldn't [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=7998.68s)]
*  digest protein. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8002.88s)]
*  And people came together and mounted this incredible collaborative effort to find a [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8004.52s)]
*  cure using the tools of genome engineering for this child. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8010.68s)]
*  And he went home from the hospital last week with CRISPR editing, having gone into his [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8014.24s)]
*  own body to cure this particular disease. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8018.88s)]
*  Wild. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8021.4400000000005s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8022.4400000000005s)]
*  And it was such a, it was a rush, you know, and it's a, but it's a, it's a really great [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8023.4400000000005s)]
*  example of personalized medicine that right now, obviously this is slow, but we start [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8029.0s)]
*  somewhere and we always have to start somewhere. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8034.72s)]
*  Like yes, it took six months and it's one baby and it took a lot of people to do this, [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8037.0s)]
*  but this is the beginning of how we can use these tools to cure your cancer, to figure [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8040.92s)]
*  out how we can engineer a fix for a baby who's born with cystic fibrosis. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8045.14s)]
*  Or if you get blood cancer, can we edit the blood cells to make sure that make that cancer [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8051.14s)]
*  mutation just go away? [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8055.280000000001s)]

*  just the beginning. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8062.860000000001s)]
*  You know, we've figured out how to learn DNA sequences from the past and actually transform [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8063.860000000001s)]
*  that into an animal that has, that's bigger than a gray wolf and it's more muscular than [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8068.9800000000005s)]
*  a gray wolf. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8074.9s)]
*  We've, we've made dire wolves using dire wolf DNA and these amazing tools that we will have [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8075.9s)]
*  the potential to use to stop other species from becoming extinct. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8082.46s)]

*  I think it is, obviously there are risks associated with using technologies that we don't fully [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8087.099999999999s)]

*  We're very carefully evaluating every single one of the edits that we make. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8094.379999999999s)]
*  We are in every case interested in making the fewest number of changes possible to still [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8098.5199999999995s)]
*  bring those animals back. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8104.5s)]
*  What other animals are you going to bring back? [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8108.78s)]
*  Well, what's the plan? [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8110.9s)]
*  What's the plan, Beth? [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8112.38s)]
*  Well, we have announced obviously the mammoth and the thylacine, that's the Tasmanian tiger [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8114.62s)]
*  and the Dodo, which is my favorite, I see my Dodo. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8121.1s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8125.14s)]
*  But we have DNA from lots of different animals. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8126.7s)]
*  So you know, you never know. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8129.3s)]
*  So but is there like, so you've announced the woolly mammoth. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8131.9s)]
*  That's right. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8135.98s)]
*  And where will that be? [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8136.98s)]
*  Where are we going to put mammoths? [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8139.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, are you going to reintroduce them area into areas? [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8140.219999999999s)]
*  Eventually, that is the goal to have animals that live in wild habitats, but this will [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8143.46s)]
*  be a very long process. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8147.259999999999s)]
*  Dire wolves? [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8149.0599999999995s)]
*  No, we won't be reintroducing dire wolves. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8150.0599999999995s)]
*  Okay, so not predators, but you would consider... [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8151.9s)]
*  Well, not dire wolves. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8154.299999999999s)]
*  Oh, so you weren't joking about the cheetah? [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8155.82s)]
*  Well, I mean, we don't currently have any plans to bring cheetahs or saber toothed cats [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8159.22s)]
*  back to life. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8164.099999999999s)]
*  But you might. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8165.54s)]
*  I don't like how you said that. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8166.54s)]
*  But if you did that, like that would be where it would get sketchy. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8168.72s)]
*  If you reintroduce an animal that can run 60 miles an hour to the plains, those poor [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8171.98s)]
*  antelopes who've been like living it up, because they evolved, you know that pronghorn antelopes, [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8177.0199999999995s)]
*  the reason why they're so fast, they evolved to get away from these cheetahs that don't [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8182.86s)]
*  exist anymore. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8185.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8186.98s)]
*  We know also from looking at the cheetahs that we have that they didn't only eat pronghorns. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8188.5s)]
*  They were eating lots of things in their habitat. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8193.18s)]
*  We found... [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8195.7s)]
*  Because pronghorns are fast. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8196.7s)]
*  They had to eat something else, otherwise they would die. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8197.7s)]
*  They had to eat some slow stuff because the pronghorns are like, let's get out of here. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8200.1s)]
*  I mean, for every species, there will be different work that has to be done to figure out whether [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8204.380000000001s)]
*  and where is a good idea to reintroduce them. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8209.28s)]
*  For each of the species that we're working with, we have councils that we've put together [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8212.06s)]
*  in the part of the world where we would bring them back together to have conversations about [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8215.76s)]
*  where they should go, whether they should go, how many there should be, and who is willing [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8220.44s)]
*  to be the long-term stewards for these animals. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8224.6s)]
*  Now I know that they've talked about releasing woolly mammoths if they ever do make them [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8226.880000000001s)]
*  in Siberia, right? [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8231.4s)]
*  Well right now we're not focusing on Russia because issues. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8233.6s)]
*  Obviously. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8236.800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8237.800000000001s)]
*  So probably it would be somewhere in North America. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8238.800000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's why Trump wants Greenland. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8240.960000000001s)]
*  For mammoths. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8243.42s)]
*  Isn't Greenland filled with ice? [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8245.24s)]
*  I mean, mammoths really need a lot of lush. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8247.14s)]
*  The vegetation. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8249.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8250.14s)]
*  So I think maybe not. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8251.14s)]
*  That's right. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8252.14s)]
*  But you know, there's plenty of space in Alaska, right? [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8253.14s)]
*  Or Northern Canada or even around the plains. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8256.42s)]
*  I mean, mammoths lived through warm periods and cold periods. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8258.34s)]
*  They're cold adapted because they're big and furry. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8262.74s)]
*  Alaska would be the move, right? [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8265.02s)]
*  Because it's like the size of one-third of the United States and they lived there. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8266.34s)]
*  Right. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8272.06s)]
*  Right. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8273.699999999999s)]
*  And I'm not worried about the mammoth population getting out of control. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8274.699999999999s)]
*  I mean, these are animals that take 10 to 14 years to reach reproductive maturity. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8278.26s)]
*  They have a two-year pregnancy. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8283.74s)]
*  It's not like there's suddenly going to be a thousand mammoths. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8285.9s)]
*  This will be a very slow and deliberate and careful process. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8290.38s)]
*  And like with the dire wolves, there will be a stage in between the first calf being [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8293.18s)]
*  born and understanding how they're able to thrive in whatever habitat they're in. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8296.46s)]
*  And these are really important parts of the de-extinction process. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8301.300000000001s)]
*  I was blown away when I heard that mammoths lived up to about 4,000 years ago on an island. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8304.1s)]
*  Yes, Wrangell Island off the coast of Siberia. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8309.1s)]
*  But now maybe even in mainland North America based on that environmental DNA data. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8312.02s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8317.62s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8318.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8319.62s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8320.62s)]
*  Well, the horses were 4,000 years, right? [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8321.62s)]
*  Horses and mammoths. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8322.62s)]
*  And mammoths, that was 4,000 years old too? [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8323.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8326.62s)]
*  Wow. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8327.62s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8328.62s)]
*  Because we're not going to find the last fossils of something. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8329.62s)]
*  Of course, because fossils are so difficult to make. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8331.060000000001s)]
*  Most of the things don't leave fossils when they die. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8333.94s)]
*  That's right. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8335.900000000001s)]
*  What percentage of the entire fossil record, bad pun, bad word to use there, but record [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8336.900000000001s)]
*  of animals have been fossilized? [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8341.980000000001s)]
*  It's really hard to know, right? [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8344.380000000001s)]
*  And because the taphonomy, which means like how things are going to preserve, differs [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8346.94s)]
*  so much depending on where you are in the world. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8350.92s)]
*  Like when things die in Alaska and you have this glacial silt that preserves things really [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8353.380000000001s)]
*  quickly, we're probably finding a lot of things, right? [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8358.34s)]
*  But we've never found woolly rhinos in North America. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8361.34s)]
*  So the hypothesis is they never made it across the bearings. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8363.82s)]
*  When the sea level was lower, the bearing straight was not a sea level. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8368.82s)]
*  And instead it was, they called Beringia, it was a land bridge. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8373.58s)]
*  Animals walked across that land bridge, including people walked across the land bridge to come [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8376.380000000001s)]
*  into North America. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8380.18s)]
*  Which brings me to the short face bear. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8381.18s)]
*  Oh, I don't like how you giggled. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8383.82s)]
*  Are you guys going to try to bring that thing back? [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8386.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8388.58s)]
*  We do have its DNA. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8389.58s)]
*  I love the short face bear. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8392.58s)]
*  You know what I like the most about it is because I think it's so dumb that it's called [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8393.94s)]
*  the short face bear. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8398.42s)]
*  Like why? [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8399.42s)]
*  Who was giving it that common name? [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8400.42s)]
*  And they're like, oh, here's a bear that if it stands up, it's 12 feet tall. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8402.42s)]
*  I'm going to call it the short faced bear. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8406.62s)]
*  Right. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8409.1s)]
*  It's such an innocuous name for such a terrifying animal. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8410.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8413.1s)]
*  One of my favorite photos on the internet is a photo of the short face bear standing [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8414.1s)]
*  up next to these scientists that are standing there. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8417.54s)]
*  And you realize the size of it, you're like, that one. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8419.94s)]
*  Like what in the hell? [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8422.58s)]
*  Have you seen the long horned bison, this bison that lived 120,000, 150,000 years ago? [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8424.26s)]
*  I think I have. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8430.94s)]
*  This is, there's a great photo that's somewhere on the internet of one of a skull on the ground [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8431.94s)]
*  and a scientist like laying that one. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8436.42s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8439.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8440.02s)]
*  We have DNA from him. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8441.18s)]
*  He might bring that back. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8442.18s)]
*  Yeah, wouldn't that be cool? [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8443.74s)]
*  What about the Irish elk? [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8445.34s)]
*  Yep, we could do that one. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8446.9s)]
*  We have DNA from the Megaloceros. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8448.220000000001s)]
*  When did that thing go extinct? [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8450.380000000001s)]
*  I think that's also the end of the ice age. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8451.380000000001s)]
*  It wasn't in North America. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8453.98s)]
*  Right. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8454.98s)]
*  Yeah, super cool. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8455.98s)]
*  That thing's nuts. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8456.98s)]
*  It's like a moose slash elk looking thing. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8457.98s)]
*  There were also camels in North America. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8462.460000000001s)]
*  There's a camel called Camelops. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8464.42s)]
*  That was pretty cool. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8466.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8467.140000000001s)]
*  Giant beaver, like a five foot tall beaver. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8468.26s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8470.82s)]
*  I forgot about the giant beaver. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8472.38s)]
*  Beavers scare me. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8473.9s)]
*  Especially a five foot beaver. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8474.9s)]
*  A five foot beaver? [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8476.9s)]
*  Think about what a little beaver could do with its teeth. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8477.9s)]
*  People have found logs that have been chewed on by this thing. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8479.9s)]
*  Just imagine. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8484.619999999999s)]
*  Did that die out in the ice age as well? [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8485.619999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8487.18s)]
*  So that's like 65% of all the megafauna in North America, right? [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8488.18s)]
*  So many big things. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8491.14s)]
*  We lost so many big things. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8492.14s)]
*  Thomas Jefferson thought he had discovered a giant lion. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8493.5s)]
*  But it was a sloth. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8497.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8498.94s)]
*  Giant sloth. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8499.94s)]
*  They were just different species of giant sloths. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8500.94s)]
*  It's named after him. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8502.94s)]
*  Megalonyx Jeffersoni. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8503.94s)]
*  Wow. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8504.94s)]
*  Well, when you look at its face, it kind of looks like it could be a cat if you don't [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8505.94s)]
*  know that much. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8510.42s)]
*  Like, if you don't know what we know now, look at the bones. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8511.42s)]
*  That bone right there. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8515.1s)]
*  Make that head, like, look at that thing. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8517.060000000001s)]
*  That was like some crazy cat. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8519.02s)]
*  What a weird animal. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8521.02s)]
*  Sloths. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8523.02s)]
*  I wonder if they moved as slowly as the small ones did. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8524.02s)]
*  I can't imagine that they could have, or they would have been really easily eaten by the [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8526.7s)]
*  giant short-faced bear. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8530.740000000002s)]
*  Right. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8531.740000000002s)]
*  Maybe that's why they're not around. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8532.740000000002s)]
*  Or the American cheetah or the smilodon. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8533.740000000002s)]
*  Well, the cheetah's probably too little. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8535.740000000002s)]
*  You know, it gets smashed. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8538.740000000002s)]
*  Yeah, but if that thing was moving super slowly, you could just hack at it for a while. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8539.740000000002s)]
*  Well, have you ever seen sloths, even little slow-moving ones swing at leopards or jaguars [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8542.62s)]
*  rather? [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8547.62s)]
*  No. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8548.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8549.62s)]
*  There's a video of a sloth, a regular one, that is crawling on this vine and this jaguar [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8550.62s)]
*  is trying to get at it. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8555.42s)]
*  And it's swinging at it pretty fast. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8556.42s)]
*  I was like, well, I didn't know they could swing that fast. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8558.98s)]
*  But it moves really slow, which is like, I wonder if it knew. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8561.3s)]
*  Why does nature want you to die so easily? [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8564.06s)]
*  Don't they move so slowly that stuff grows on them? [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8566.06s)]
*  Yes, mold grows on them. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8568.82s)]
*  There's a rescue place. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8570.38s)]
*  So this, see, look at that. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8572.38s)]
*  Look how beautiful these jaguars are. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8574.02s)]
*  God, they're so beautiful. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8576.02s)]
*  Big cats, yeah. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8578.7s)]
*  So would you want the big cats that were here to come back? [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8580.4s)]
*  Well, I mean, I don't know. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8582.9s)]
*  Jaguars are reemerging in the Southwest. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8585.859999999999s)]
*  They've spotted at least a couple of them in Arizona, which I think is great. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8590.699999999999s)]
*  I think they're awesome, but I wouldn't want to run into one. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8595.699999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8598.58s)]
*  If you're out there camping and you see a jaguar, you're in a lot of trouble. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8599.58s)]
*  That's a giant mountain lion. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8603.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8605.699999999999s)]
*  And I think about mountain lions too. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8606.699999999999s)]
*  When I go running in the woods, in the red woods I live in San Diego, I go running and [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8608.3s)]
*  I'm thinking, oh, mountain lions, bring my dog. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8612.9s)]
*  Right? [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8615.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8616.1s)]
*  Well, the dog's going to get eaten, I guess. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8617.1s)]
*  I think they're afraid of dogs. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8618.1s)]
*  A little bit. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8619.58s)]
*  Yeah, it depends on the dog. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8620.58s)]
*  They eat a lot of dogs. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8622.18s)]
*  I have a 75 pound Labrador retriever. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8623.18s)]
*  He would probably want to be its friend. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8626.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's like my dog, my golden retriever. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8627.18s)]
*  Ooh, friend, can we play? [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8630.18s)]
*  Or he would just like tuck his tail and run, and just leave me there to defend myself. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8631.98s)]
*  But they know that the ones that they get, the ones that are problem cats in Northern [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8637.46s)]
*  California, when they found them and they do these depredation tags, they found that [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8642.140000000001s)]
*  50% of their diet is dogs and cats. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8646.140000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8649.220000000001s)]
*  50%. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8650.220000000001s)]
*  That's nuts. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8651.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8652.220000000001s)]
*  That's nuts. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8653.220000000001s)]
*  They're just eating people's dogs and cats. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8654.220000000001s)]
*  Yikes. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8655.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8656.220000000001s)]
*  I don't know, they're spooky. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8657.220000000001s)]
*  They're cool, but they're spooky. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8658.220000000001s)]
*  I don't know how many you want around. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8659.220000000001s)]
*  And there are a lot of cats. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8662.74s)]
*  Maybe it's because we don't have any of the other predators that used to be there. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8664.58s)]
*  I mean, the California golden bear is another one that Hearst, I think Hearst collected [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8667.02s)]
*  one of the last ones of the California golden bear in Southern California, had him shipped [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8671.480000000001s)]
*  up to San Francisco and he became the bear that's the inspiration for the flag. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8674.76s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8679.2s)]
*  His name is Monarch. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8680.2s)]
*  We actually sequenced his genome too. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8681.2s)]
*  The last guy that got killed by a grizzly bear or brown bear, whatever it was, in California, [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8682.720000000001s)]
*  they have a town named after him, LaBette, California. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8688.2s)]
*  It's named after the guy. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8690.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, named after the last guy to get killed by a bear. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8692.04s)]
*  I wonder if it's worth it to him. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8694.4s)]
*  Nope. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8697.2s)]
*  Nope. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8698.2s)]
*  Nope. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8699.2s)]
*  It's kind of funny though that the bear is on the flag and then they killed all of them. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8700.76s)]
*  There's none of them. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8704.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8705.960000000001s)]
*  Well, by the time I think it was on the flag, it was already on their way out. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8706.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, probably. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8709.400000000001s)]
*  Well, people are probably wanting to bring them back too. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8710.400000000001s)]
*  We showed recently using DNA that they're really closely related to the bears that are [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8713.2s)]
*  in Yellowstone right now. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8716.640000000001s)]
*  So if we really want bears in California, you could just bring those guys over. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8718.0s)]
*  Don't do it, people. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8721.76s)]
*  The thing about it is once you have them in your area, you can't manage them because then [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8724.32s)]
*  people have decided that they're precious. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8730.800000000001s)]
*  So once they become problems and once they become overpopulated, like Montana has a bit [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8732.960000000001s)]
*  of an issue with that now, they would like to list them. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8738.72s)]
*  With bears? [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8741.64s)]
*  Yes, with grizzly bears. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8742.64s)]
*  They would like people to be able to hunt them. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8744.2s)]
*  That's Monarch. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8746.12s)]
*  They put a smile on his face. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8747.12s)]
*  Oh, hi guys. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8748.12s)]
*  Only you can prevent forest fires. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8749.12s)]
*  He looks so sweet. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8751.12s)]
*  He had a miserable life though. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8752.480000000001s)]
*  He was mostly in a cage. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8753.76s)]
*  He was being fed the wrong diet for a brown bear, just mostly meat. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8754.960000000001s)]
*  So right now he's on display. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8758.76s)]
*  He's not on display actually. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8761.84s)]
*  He is in the basement in a fridge at the Cal Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8762.92s)]
*  But his post-cranial skeleton, everything except his head, is at Berkeley in the museum. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8767.28s)]
*  We've sampled it for DNA. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8772.12s)]
*  So his diet should have been fruit and vegetables and meat. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8773.84s)]
*  But they were just giving him meat. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8778.04s)]
*  I imagine he was just really uncomfortable all the time. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8779.36s)]
*  Can you imagine if you just ate only meat? [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8782.64s)]
*  That's all I eat. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8784.039999999999s)]
*  I mostly just eat meat. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8785.039999999999s)]
*  I'm not uncomfortable at all. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8786.519999999999s)]
*  I think meat is... [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8788.32s)]

*  But I bet if you had a plate... [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8792.119999999999s)]
*  Well, actually not true. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8793.599999999999s)]
*  I was saying if you had a plate of meat and a plate of fruit, the bear would just eat [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8794.679999999998s)]
*  the meat. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8797.599999999999s)]
*  But the bear would probably eat the fruit too. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8798.599999999999s)]
*  The bear would eat everything. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8799.599999999999s)]
*  They just eat everything. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8800.599999999999s)]
*  They eat cars. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8801.599999999999s)]
*  When I lived in Colorado... [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8802.599999999999s)]
*  Just like people, not us, would have been. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8804.519999999999s)]
*  They're involved in the world of scarcity where you eat the stuff that's in front of [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8807.359999999999s)]
*  you. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8810.359999999999s)]
*  They really have to get fat because they're going to chill out and just take naps for [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8811.84s)]
*  three months. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8814.68s)]
*  I love the Fat Bear Week competition. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8815.68s)]
*  I love that one. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8817.44s)]
*  Do you know that? [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8818.44s)]
*  No. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8819.44s)]
*  What is that? [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8820.44s)]
*  It's around the time when they come out there, they're eating all the salmon because they [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8821.44s)]
*  got to get... [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8824.12s)]
*  They have a competition between which is the best fat bear and you get to vote for them. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8825.12s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8828.560000000001s)]
*  And there's a fat bear that wins. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8829.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8830.560000000001s)]
*  That's pretty fun. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8831.560000000001s)]
*  I love it. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8832.560000000001s)]
*  To me, that's the most fascinating species of bears is the bears that live on those salmon [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8833.560000000001s)]
*  rivers. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8836.880000000001s)]
*  Because they don't care about people at all. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8837.880000000001s)]
*  There's this crazy video of this guy that's sitting in a lawn chair and this bear comes [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8839.96s)]
*  up beside him. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8843.32s)]
*  And this bear, he's not in the lawn chair, he's beside the lawn chair, but the lawn chair [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8844.64s)]
*  is great for perspective when you see how big the bear is. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8848.679999999998s)]
*  This bear is huge. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8851.259999999998s)]
*  It's like 10, 11 feet tall, long, whatever. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8853.56s)]
*  And it doesn't care about the person at all. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8857.4s)]
*  It just has been eating salmon. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8859.8s)]
*  So this is it. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8861.359999999999s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8862.359999999999s)]
*  And salmon are so much better. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8863.359999999999s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8864.359999999999s)]
*  Look at the size of that thing. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8865.359999999999s)]
*  Imagine... [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8866.359999999999s)]
*  Give me some volume so you hear this guy talking. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8867.359999999999s)]
*  Because it's so crazy. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8869.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8870.720000000001s)]
*  The bear's not interested in them. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8871.720000000001s)]
*  There's meat right to his right. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8875.16s)]
*  And he just lays down. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8876.880000000001s)]
*  I'm going to chill. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8878.560000000001s)]
*  Humans probably make a terrible snack though. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8880.320000000002s)]
*  Right? [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8882.320000000002s)]
*  I mean, we're bony or fatty. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8883.320000000002s)]
*  That salmon is absolutely a delicious source of protein. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8886.380000000001s)]
*  Also it's just flopping around in there. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8890.36s)]
*  It's easy to catch. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8892.6s)]
*  And he's probably full, which is also why they're so big, right? [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8894.320000000002s)]
*  He looks full. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8898.08s)]
*  I like him. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8899.08s)]
*  He looks chilled. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8900.08s)]
*  That's the bear that I would want to run into in the field. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8901.68s)]
*  Now I'm talking to it. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8903.68s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8905.68s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8906.68s)]
*  Like it's a dog. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8907.68s)]
*  Like, get out of here. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8908.68s)]
*  You're going to convince him, hey man, this is my space. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8909.68s)]
*  Don't invade it. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8912.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8913.48s)]
*  They just... [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8914.48s)]
*  All those Kodiak bears, that's why they're so huge. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8915.48s)]
*  They get so much protein. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8917.48s)]
*  I've never been out there. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8918.48s)]
*  Oh, I want to watch them. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8920.0s)]
*  I want to watch them eat salmon with a high powered rifle right next to me. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8921.039999999999s)]
*  Maybe in a giant bulletproof hamster wheel or something. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8926.480000000001s)]
*  I'm so scared of those things. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8929.400000000001s)]
*  Have you seen the documentary Grizzly Man? [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8931.08s)]
*  Yes. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8933.240000000002s)]
*  Another great Werner Herzog film. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8934.240000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8936.240000000002s)]
*  I have to look at the... [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8937.240000000002s)]
*  Werner's actually in that film. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8938.240000000002s)]
*  He's interviewing the people in that film, which is one of the best unintentional comedies. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8939.92s)]
*  It's a really funny movie. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8945.560000000001s)]
*  I don't even think it's unintentional because Werner Herzog is a genius. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8947.560000000001s)]
*  I think he made it funny on purpose because there's some like smash cuts where you're [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8950.12s)]
*  just like, oh my God, where you're just laughing. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8953.36s)]
*  The guy was so nuts. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8955.64s)]
*  He just decided to, I think in my eyes, I think he was like suicide by bear. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8957.359999999999s)]
*  I think he just decided to stay long enough where eventually they just got him. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8962.439999999999s)]
*  He was like super depressed and wanted to be an actor and never made it. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8965.76s)]
*  He decided he was going to save the bears. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8969.76s)]
*  The bears didn't even care that he was alive. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8971.72s)]
*  They're not used to people being around at all. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8974.88s)]
*  They didn't even know what he was. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8976.32s)]
*  One of them eventually decided to eat him. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8978.199999999999s)]
*  I can't imagine that as a good way to go. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8979.64s)]
*  That's not a good way to go, but if you're completely obsessed with bears and you're, [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8981.88s)]
*  you know. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8985.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8986.4s)]
*  There's a woman who's worked in my lab for a long time. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8987.4s)]
*  She works on mountain lions or mountain lion genetics. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8989.08s)]
*  She said when it's her time, she wants to go. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8991.4s)]
*  Oh God, lady, don't say that. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8993.119999999999s)]
*  Don't say that. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8995.72s)]
*  One thing better about getting killed by a cat than a bear is a cat will kill you and [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=8997.08s)]
*  then eat you. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9001.039999999999s)]
*  A bear will just hold you down. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9002.039999999999s)]
*  And eat you while you're still alive. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9004.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9005.08s)]
*  They don't care at all. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9006.08s)]
*  You just have to hope that you die of shock. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9007.08s)]
*  Wow. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9009.08s)]
*  That's one of the things that freaks hunters out is when they see them skinned and they're [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9010.08s)]
*  hanging, they look like humans. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9024.64s)]
*  It's like very weird. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9026.88s)]
*  Or Bigfoot. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9027.88s)]
*  No. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9028.88s)]
*  Well, that's probably what Bigfoot is, honestly. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9029.88s)]
*  When people are seeing Bigfoot, have you ever seen a bear walk on two legs before? [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9033.24s)]
*  They walk on two legs all the time. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9037.6s)]
*  All the time. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9039.0s)]
*  They walk on two legs to present themselves as larger, to scare the other males. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9040.0s)]
*  And sometimes they have injuries. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9044.800000000001s)]
*  Like there was a famous bear in New Jersey that was missing a paw. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9045.960000000001s)]
*  And so he always walked on two legs. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9050.6s)]
*  And it just looked like a man. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9052.2s)]
*  Like a man. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9053.6s)]
*  Like a Bigfoot. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9054.6s)]
*  Like if you see him through the woods, right? [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9055.6s)]
*  If it's dusk and you're going on a hike and you're already like heightened senses, you're [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9057.76s)]
*  a little weirded out already. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9061.52s)]
*  And you see this thing, it's a black bear that's walking on two legs through the woods. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9063.0s)]
*  You would be convinced that you saw Bigfoot. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9067.8s)]
*  Don't you think? [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9069.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9070.8s)]
*  There was a paper that was published maybe a decade ago or so where people had done nish [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9071.8s)]
*  modeling, environmental nish modeling based on Bigfoot sightings. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9076.599999999999s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9079.8s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9080.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9081.8s)]
*  Isn't that nuts? [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9082.8s)]
*  So if you saw that walking through the woods, 100% you'd think it's Bigfoot. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9083.8s)]
*  Oh my God, I found it. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9086.8s)]
*  He's real. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9088.8s)]
*  He's real. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9089.8s)]
*  If that picture was just a little bit blurrier, it would be Bigfoot. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9090.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9093.8s)]
*  It's a little bit blurrier and then a little more distance and in between trees. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9094.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9097.8s)]
*  I talked to a lady once. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9098.8s)]
*  We did this television show. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9099.8s)]
*  Look at him. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9100.8s)]
*  I know. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9101.8s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9102.8s)]
*  I know. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9103.8s)]
*  It's nuts. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9104.8s)]
*  And that's a small one. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9105.8s)]
*  We did this television show a long time ago. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9106.8s)]
*  Me and my friend Duncan, we went to go look for Bigfoot. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9108.8s)]
*  It was part of the show. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9111.8s)]
*  It was called Joe Rogan Questions Everything. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9112.8s)]
*  And I met this one lady who was so convincing. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9114.8s)]
*  And she told me she saw Bigfoot. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9117.8s)]
*  The Pacific Northwest where we were at outside of Seattle, like up in those mountains, it's [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9120.8s)]
*  so dense because it's a rainforest. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9124.8s)]
*  And it's like the way I describe it, it's like a box of Q-tips. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9127.8s)]
*  That's what the trees are like. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9130.8s)]
*  You know, you get a box of Q-tips. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9131.8s)]
*  You can't see in between those Q-tips. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9132.8s)]
*  Super dense. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9134.8s)]
*  Super dense. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9135.8s)]
*  And she said she saw something that was like 100 yards away that was moving through the [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9136.8s)]
*  trees that she is sure was a giant. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9139.8s)]
*  She goes, I saw a giant ape. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9142.8s)]
*  And I was like, what is that, an ape? [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9144.8s)]
*  And she goes, oh my God, it's Bigfoot. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9146.8s)]
*  And my brain was going, I think it was a bear. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9149.8s)]
*  Well, that's what this niche modeling or environmental modeling study found is they looked at all [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9152.8s)]
*  the reported sightings of Bigfoot and then created what would be the environmental niche [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9157.8s)]
*  for a Bigfoot. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9161.8s)]
*  And it pretty much just overlapped the niche for bears, for brown bears. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9162.8s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9166.8s)]
*  I mean, it's the only thing that makes sense. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9167.8s)]
*  But the weird thing about it is the Native Americans. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9168.8s)]
*  Because Native Americans have a name for that creature and they have many names for it, [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9171.8s)]
*  different tribes. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9177.8s)]
*  So it's not like an isolated thing, but they don't have a lot of mythical animals. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9178.8s)]
*  They don't have fake animals other than Sasquatch. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9182.8s)]
*  It is weird because if Beringa, as I was called, the Bering land bridge, Beringia, Beringia, [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9185.8s)]
*  Beringia existed and we know that it did. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9191.8s)]
*  And we know that people during that time made their way across. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9193.8s)]
*  If Gigantopithecus lived alongside people, we don't know if it did, but it could have. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9197.8s)]
*  And if it did, it would be in the same area. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9202.8s)]
*  It would be in the same area of Asia. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9205.8s)]
*  And perhaps it would have come really far north, though, to get across the Bering land [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9207.8s)]
*  bridge, because that was really far. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9211.8s)]
*  That was all glaciated and cold. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9213.8s)]
*  So it would have to be something that was adapted to living in warmer climates like where [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9215.8s)]
*  it was found, as well as being able to survive. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9218.8s)]
*  It's not like a week of a walk across the Bering land bridge. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9220.8s)]
*  Also, we don't find primates in cold climates like that, other than humans. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9224.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9228.8s)]
*  You have to have the ability to keep yourself warm. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9229.8s)]
*  We're so dumb. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9231.8s)]
*  We're like, let's just keep walking north. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9232.8s)]
*  We've got to get away from these other assholes. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9233.8s)]
*  Yeah, I really love mosquitoes. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9235.8s)]
*  I think this is what I'm going for. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9236.8s)]
*  The more mosquitoes, the better. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9237.8s)]
*  I think they're probably just chasing animals, right? [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9239.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9241.8s)]
*  That's probably what they were doing. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9242.8s)]
*  Bison, mostly. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9243.8s)]
*  Following the herds. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9244.8s)]
*  And then eventually they had to learn to adapt to these colder climates. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9245.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9248.8s)]
*  We talk about it as people are moving deliberately through this landscape, when clearly they [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9249.8s)]
*  weren't. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9253.8s)]
*  They're just trying to find food, like the Dolgan people. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9254.8s)]
*  They're going to places where there's still grass that their reindeer can graze on. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9257.8s)]
*  Yeah, they just want to eat. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9261.8s)]
*  And it's just so weird to think that we live in houses and we have internet and we drive [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9263.8s)]
*  an electric car to work and live in this sophisticated world. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9269.8s)]
*  But not all the people are living in this world. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9274.8s)]
*  And there's indigenous people that are living the same way they've lived, but now they have [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9276.8s)]
*  a snowmobile. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9281.8s)]
*  Now they have a rifle. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9282.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9283.8s)]
*  But they're still... [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9284.8s)]
*  If you had to live there, you'd be like, oh my God. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9285.8s)]
*  What am I doing? [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9288.8s)]
*  Where is Starbucks? [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9290.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9291.8s)]
*  But somehow they're happier than us. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9292.8s)]
*  That's so weird. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9294.8s)]
*  It's really weird. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9295.8s)]
*  Out of all the animals that you guys might potentially... [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9297.8s)]
*  What's the word? [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9303.8s)]
*  Rebirth? [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9304.8s)]
*  What's the word? [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9305.8s)]
*  I mean, people have used the word de-extinction, which I kind of hate because I can't figure [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9306.8s)]
*  out how to conjugate it in a way that doesn't make me cringe. [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9310.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9313.8s)]
*  If you've done it successfully, do you say you de-extincted something? [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9314.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9318.8s)]
*  So what would be the word? [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9319.8s)]
*  Do we need a new word? [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9320.8s)]
*  Because it's never happened before. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9321.8s)]
*  Bring back, resurrect. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9322.8s)]
*  Resurrect. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9323.8s)]
*  I think resurrect is probably the word, but that has biblical implications. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9324.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9326.8s)]
*  So that's why we try to stay away from that. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9327.8s)]
*  But you're kind of playing God, so let's go with that. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9328.8s)]
*  Okay, cool. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9331.8s)]
*  I'm in. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9332.8s)]
*  Is there one that gives you pause? [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9333.8s)]
*  Like maybe the short face bear? [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9335.8s)]
*  Pause? [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9336.8s)]
*  Like maybe like maybe this isn't the best idea. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9337.8s)]
*  The host eagle? [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9340.8s)]
*  Well, humans. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9341.8s)]
*  I've already had pause at this. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9342.8s)]
*  Like Neanderthals and Denisophans, they were people. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9344.8s)]
*  And so I feel like that's not really the thing that... [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9346.8s)]
*  That's not somewhere we should go. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9349.8s)]
*  Host eagle, that's a cool one. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9351.8s)]
*  That's a cool one. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9353.8s)]
*  This was a massive, massive giant eagle that ate Moa, which was a bird, an extinct bird. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9354.8s)]
*  And ate people too. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9359.8s)]
*  Probably they were huge. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9360.8s)]
*  No, they think that they found the markings on human skulls there that indicate talons of raptors. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9362.8s)]
*  Wow. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9368.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9369.8s)]
*  Wow. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9370.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9371.8s)]
*  Which makes sense that that's how they went extinct. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9372.8s)]
*  Like the New Zealanders are like, enough of this shit. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9373.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9375.8s)]
*  Well, the Moa went extinct and so they couldn't eat any more. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9376.8s)]
*  Oh, is that what it was? [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9378.8s)]
*  But maybe it was both. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9379.8s)]
*  So they ate them all? [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9380.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9381.8s)]
*  I mean, why did short-faced bears go extinct? [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9382.8s)]
*  Probably because nobody wanted a bear that stood 12 feet high. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9383.8s)]
*  What are you going to do about it though? [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9386.8s)]
*  Like imagine... [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9388.8s)]
*  They would kill it. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9389.8s)]
*  Would you imagine the daunting task of getting a group of guys together with spears to go [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9390.8s)]
*  after a short-faced bear when you know at least four or five of you are getting whacked [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9395.8s)]
*  before you can get a spear tip into one of them? [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9399.8s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9401.8s)]
*  Doesn't it depend? [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9402.8s)]
*  I mean, maybe what they were doing is, you know, they would ambush mammoths and things [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9403.8s)]
*  like that. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9406.8s)]
*  So you hide around bluffs and you can have a group of people in different places and [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9407.8s)]
*  hit them all at once. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9409.8s)]
*  Maybe you wait until that bear is eating something else. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9410.8s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9414.8s)]
*  And then it's paused and you have time to... [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9415.8s)]
*  I mean, how much did they even understand the wind back then? [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9418.8s)]
*  They probably understood it really well, right? [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9422.8s)]
*  They probably did, right. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9424.8s)]
*  Because these are people who relied on that. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9425.8s)]
*  They probably understand it better than people who aren't hunters today, right? [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9427.8s)]
*  They probably knew that these animals had a greater sense of smell than we do. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9430.8s)]
*  They probably had a greater sense of smell than we do. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9433.8s)]
*  Or more attuned. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9436.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9437.8s)]
*  They probably could smell it. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9438.8s)]
*  Because you can smell certain animals when you're... [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9439.8s)]
*  Like if you go into the elk woods, you 100% can smell elk. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9441.8s)]
*  And is that something that you've been able to develop? [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9445.8s)]
*  Well, I was taught it. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9447.8s)]
*  You know, I would smell something and then, you know, like the guys that I'd be hunting with, [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9449.8s)]
*  like you smell that? [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9454.8s)]
*  Like that's elk. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9455.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9456.8s)]
*  Because they urinate everywhere and you get this sense. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9457.8s)]
*  They have this really musty smell during the rut too. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9460.8s)]
*  And you could smell them. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9463.8s)]
*  Could you smell the direwolf? [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9464.8s)]
*  Well, they were stinky. [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9466.8s)]
*  I don't think you guys are bathing them. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9468.8s)]
*  Why would we bathe a direwolf? [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9470.8s)]
*  I know. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9472.8s)]
*  My wife would be like, take him to the groomer. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9473.8s)]
*  She hates when my dog gets stinky. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9475.8s)]
*  She hates when I take him out into the dirt and play around with him. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9478.8s)]
*  And he comes back covered in burrs and stinky. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9482.8s)]
*  You got to brush him down. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9484.8s)]
*  Did they smell different? [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9485.8s)]
*  Yeah, they did smell different. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9486.8s)]
*  But I don't smell a lot of dogs that are never bathed. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9488.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9491.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9492.8s)]
*  You know, most of the dogs that I've ever smelled... [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9493.8s)]
*  Wolves. [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9494.8s)]
*  Because they aren't dogs. [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9495.8s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9496.8s)]
*  Wolves. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9497.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9498.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9499.8s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9500.8s)]
*  Which is really weird. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9501.8s)]
*  There was the other conversation we had that they all come from wolves. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9502.8s)]
*  Jamie has a French bulldog. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9504.8s)]
*  He's adorable. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9505.8s)]
*  That was a wolf. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9506.8s)]
*  One important time. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9509.8s)]
*  And... [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9510.8s)]
*  We don't know which wolf. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9511.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9512.8s)]
*  Right? [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9513.8s)]
*  I mean, I think dog domestication is one of those places where both we come to terms with [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9514.8s)]
*  what we don't know and the opportunity to discover new things. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9520.199999999999s)]
*  The very first scientific paper that said when dogs were domesticated looked at a type [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9523.8s)]
*  of DNA that's only inherited from your mom called mitochondrial DNA. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9530.279999999999s)]
*  Our cells have a nucleus that has the DNA in our chromosomes that make us look and act [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9533.76s)]
*  the way we do. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9537.800000000001s)]
*  And then it has little cells that were once bacteria that we co-opted that make energy. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9538.800000000001s)]
*  And you're only inherited from your mom. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9543.44s)]
*  And there's a ton of them. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9545.4s)]
*  Like there's thousands of mitochondrial genomes in every cell and only one of your nuclear [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9546.6s)]
*  genome. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9551.0s)]
*  So in ancient DNA, because there's way more, we started just with that. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9552.0s)]
*  It was the only thing we could recover. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9554.84s)]
*  And the first dog mitochondrial genomes that were recovered, people were like, dogs were [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9556.58s)]
*  domesticated in Asia 150,000 years ago, which is clearly wrong, right? [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9560.84s)]
*  There weren't human populations, societies, which is kind of what you need for dog domestication [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9565.84s)]
*  because they're attracted to the garbage or the living around where people were. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9571.48s)]
*  So you need communities of people that are staying in place together for some time before [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9575.32s)]
*  you can have dog domestication. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9579.0s)]
*  Do we know for sure there weren't human populations like that 150,000 years ago? [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9580.759999999998s)]
*  We don't. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9584.72s)]
*  But we do know now that dogs probably aren't that old. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9585.72s)]
*  I think what I read was 36,000. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9588.119999999999s)]
*  It changes all the time, which is because we don't know everything. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9591.439999999999s)]
*  And also probably because the first dogs were in warm parts of the world. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9595.199999999999s)]
*  And so we don't have the fossils. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9599.16s)]
*  We don't have the DNA and the fossils just didn't preserve. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9601.0s)]
*  I think right now what people are happiest with is that it was probably sometime after [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9604.88s)]
*  the peak of the last ice age, sometime 15 to 20,000 years ago. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9610.16s)]
*  And I'm not sure where because again, probably in a warmer spot, there's been lots of gene [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9615.2s)]
*  flow, lots of hybridization between domestic dogs and wolves that have made this a really [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9620.16s)]
*  hard problem. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9624.24s)]
*  Like you were talking about with the black wolves. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9625.24s)]
*  Right. [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9626.76s)]
*  Exactly like that. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9627.76s)]
*  But what's cool about this date 15 to 20,000 years ago is that most of these people are [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9628.76s)]
*  like, yeah, that's probably the date for dogs. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9632.48s)]
*  Which means if dogs only form when there are human communities that are together, groups [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9635.12s)]
*  of people that are living together in the same place for a long time, that they were [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9642.320000000002s)]
*  around 15 to 20,000 years ago. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9645.92s)]
*  That is not what archaeologists think. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9648.12s)]
*  Right. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9649.960000000001s)]
*  So these two, these two weights of evidence are saying, you know, we still don't know. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9650.960000000001s)]
*  Sort of right. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9656.24s)]
*  But they do believe hunter gatherers existed in small tribes 15,000 years ago. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9657.24s)]
*  And maybe that was enough. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9660.640000000001s)]
*  But you know, if you think of domestication and scientists like to have names, we like [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9662.16s)]
*  to have ways of classifying things. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9667.04s)]
*  And so there was recently a couple of friends of mine have published a paper in which they've [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9669.4s)]
*  redefined how you consider something domestic. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9673.56s)]
*  And they say a domestic population is something that can only survive within a human environment, [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9676.56s)]
*  within a human niche. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9681.44s)]
*  And if you think of that as what our dogs are, right, they can only really survive and [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9682.44s)]
*  breed as dogs within this human niche, then you need a lot of humans around and you need [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9686.82s)]
*  a steady stream of the crap that humans produce to do this. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9692.16s)]
*  That's still kind of early. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9696.52s)]
*  It's still. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9698.44s)]
*  Yeah, maybe there were hunter gatherer populations that were more established somewhere in the [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9699.44s)]
*  South where we don't have dog bones. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9704.92s)]
*  Right. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9706.56s)]
*  Right. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9707.56s)]
*  That's what we don't know. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9708.56s)]
*  Right. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9709.56s)]
*  It's and then wolves don't are most wolves from warmer climates? [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9710.56s)]
*  No, right. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9715.04s)]
*  They're from colder climates all over the place. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9716.04s)]
*  All over the place. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9718.16s)]
*  Well, Mexican wolves, right? [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9719.16s)]
*  There's Mexican wolves. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9720.16s)]
*  Mexican wolves. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9721.16s)]
*  That there's but we think that the closest living relative of dogs is is gray wolves. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9722.16s)]
*  It's this gray wolf lineage. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9728.6s)]
*  But we don't know if dogs are outside of the diversity of gray wolves. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9729.6s)]
*  So it's an extinct type of gray wolf that was the pretend of dogs or if they fall within [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9733.2s)]
*  the diversity of all the lineages of gray wolves that are around. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9738.36s)]
*  And that's just because there's been so much movement of DNA around that part of the tree. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9741.4s)]
*  I think it's a fascinating story that as we get more information, we're going to learn [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9747.16s)]
*  more about people as well. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9751.84s)]
*  I just. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9753.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9754.44s)]
*  That's the most fascinating to me because it's so obvious that there is manipulation [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9756.12s)]
*  involved. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9761.04s)]
*  It's so obvious that through selective breeding and also getting these animals to get accustomed [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9762.04s)]
*  to people getting close to the fire, feeding them so they don't have to hunt anymore. [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9767.480000000001s)]
*  And then they bark when intruders come and they develop this sort of relationship where [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9770.880000000001s)]
*  we work together. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9775.36s)]
*  It's so interesting that we see the genes change into a poodle. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9777.640000000001s)]
*  We see this weirdness or now it's a border collie. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9783.32s)]
*  What? [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9786.24s)]
*  And then the variety. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9787.24s)]
*  All of those too are probably Victorian. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9788.24s)]
*  All of the breeds that we think of today, whether it's cattle or bison, they're within [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9790.96s)]
*  the last couple hundred years. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9795.32s)]
*  That is really fast selection by humans. [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9796.619999999999s)]
*  So we are manipulating the DNA of the species that we surround ourselves with. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9799.76s)]
*  And we have been for 15 to 20,000 years and probably longer. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9805.279999999999s)]
*  Just not in a laboratory. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9809.539999999999s)]
*  Just not in a laboratory. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9811.0s)]
*  Is our backyard a laboratory? [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9813.0s)]
*  If I say, I like the way that dog looks, but I like the way that that one can swim in water. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9814.36s)]
*  And I bet if I breed them together, I can make one that has this double layer coat so [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9819.28s)]
*  they can go get in that frozen water, but they'll still have that cute look or something. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9822.76s)]
*  That's interesting, right? [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9827.04s)]
*  Because we're thinking about science as only being done in a laboratory or manipulation [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9828.080000000002s)]
*  only being done in a laboratory. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9833.78s)]
*  It's clearly done with food. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9835.04s)]
*  I mean, it was done with plants forever. [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9836.800000000001s)]
*  The breeding of plants, splicing two plants together. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9839.96s)]
*  Right. [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9842.519999999999s)]
*  I mean, when we graft plants together, I mean, that is like all of the vineyards in France, [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9843.519999999999s)]
*  which are grafted onto American rootstocks because of the introduction of phylloxera, [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9848.72s)]
*  this aphid that came from North America that was going to completely devastate the wine [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9852.64s)]
*  industry. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9857.439999999999s)]
*  Now they're all spliced onto American rootstocks that can survive this aphid. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9858.439999999999s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9862.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9863.64s)]
*  I talked to a rancher in California and they were telling me that I think it was either [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9864.96s)]
*  the avocado trees were spliced onto the pistachio trees or vice versa. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9869.96s)]
*  It's amazing that the plants can survive that, that they don't go like, yo, that's not me. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9876.16s)]
*  Right. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9879.96s)]
*  We can't do that. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9880.96s)]
*  We can't take a pig liver and shove it in your... [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9881.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9884.599999999999s)]
*  Your body would fight it off. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9885.599999999999s)]
*  Your immune system would fight it off. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9886.599999999999s)]
*  Well, we're trying. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9887.599999999999s)]
*  Again, that's another cool thing that we can do with this gene editing technology is we [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9888.599999999999s)]
*  can turn off the genes that would cause that rejection to happen. [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9892.2s)]
*  So maybe someday we can use pig organs in the face of humans and save people from dying. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9895.880000000001s)]
*  Or we can just re-engineer a new version of your organs. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9901.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9905.12s)]
*  So that is really cool science. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9906.12s)]
*  This thing called the organoids where you can actually grow in a dish in a lab, a version [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9907.28s)]
*  of a little brain, something that approximates a brain or that approximates a heart or a [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9912.720000000001s)]
*  kidney or something else. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9917.92s)]
*  We're using this at Colossal, for example, to test hypotheses about what changes we might [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9919.32s)]
*  make to bring about, to resurrect, to de-extinct the phenotypes that we're interested in. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9924.6s)]
*  If we grow an organoid that grows hair, can we see what that hair looks like without having [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9929.6s)]
*  to make a mammoth in order to see what that change is going to do? [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9934.039999999999s)]
*  But it has really amazing potential for personalized medicine. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9937.72s)]
*  So I can take some of your cells, if you get a tumor, I can grow them in this dish and [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9941.56s)]
*  I can challenge those cells with different drug cocktails to see what works before I [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9946.12s)]
*  put them in you. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9949.84s)]
*  This technology is so cool and really just beginning. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9951.76s)]
*  Well, it's amazing when you think about this technology and you think about what we had [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9955.24s)]
*  just a few hundred years ago and then you push a few hundred years from now and you [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9961.12s)]
*  think what are the possibilities? [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9966.68s)]
*  And the only way to find out is to do experiments like what you guys are doing. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9968.64s)]
*  And so that's one of the reasons why some of this pushback is so silly. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9973.36s)]
*  Would you rather no one ever do this work or would you like to be the one who does the [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9977.0s)]
*  work or is it just that you think the work should never be done? [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9981.92s)]
*  What is the thought process? [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9986.96s)]
*  Again, I think it's this negativity and it's this scarcity mindset that if they do this, [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9988.56s)]
*  then we can't do this, which is just it's not the way we innovate. [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9994.48s)]
*  It's not the way we make progress. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=9998.96s)]
*  Is this the nature of academia? [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10000.52s)]
*  Because it's very gate-keep even inside of academia, right? [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10004.0s)]
*  You work for a university and you have to get the approval of all the other people and [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10007.84s)]
*  you have to be politically aligned with them and everyone has to say the right things on [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10013.039999999999s)]
*  Twitter. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10016.24s)]
*  It's like there's a lot of weirdness, a lot of group think that comes along with all that [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10017.24s)]
*  stuff and then you have to play politics in order to get funding. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10020.64s)]
*  You can't be ostracized. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10024.88s)]
*  If you're ostracized, even if you have tenure, you know, when you see this with certain scientists [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10026.119999999999s)]
*  that have very outside-the-box ideas, they get pushed out and they can't get funding [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10031.279999999999s)]
*  anymore or if they don't agree with a certain narrative, what's being pushed with whether [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10037.16s)]
*  it's public health or the environment or anything, they get ostracized, even if they're actually [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10041.119999999999s)]
*  talking about real data and science. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10045.759999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think, you know, we can agree that it's a mess, right? [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10047.759999999998s)]
*  It's a hot mess, but there is genuine, real science that comes out of the university system, [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10052.76s)]
*  of the academic system that we need. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10059.2s)]
*  You know, all the technology that led to MRIs, the early technology that gave us CRISPR, [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10061.04s)]
*  this gene editing platform, was developed using, you know, funding from the government [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10066.04s)]
*  in scientific labs by people who are willing to take risks and step outside of that box [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10071.12s)]
*  and then it's taken outside of there and it's turned into all of these cool things. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10076.0s)]
*  I mean, there has to be a place where we get both of these things because there's some [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10079.76s)]
*  things that no one is ever going to build a business around until it exists and we need [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10083.960000000001s)]
*  this public system in order to do that. [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10089.6s)]
*  Yeah, and that's what's so scary about what's going on with politics and funding and research, [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10092.0s)]
*  you know, because it's like as soon as you stop defunding research, you start making [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10100.64s)]
*  it more scarce and then making people... [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10104.16s)]
*  It's just going to get worse. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10106.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10107.48s)]
*  And we're going to fall behind and we are going to lose the place that we have had [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10109.199999999999s)]
*  as innovators and by we, I mean this country. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10113.4s)]
*  We are going to lose the place we have. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10116.359999999999s)]
*  We've had innovators in biotechnology, innovators in physics, innovators in all of these technologies [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10117.88s)]
*  because we've had such a robust system. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10122.6s)]
*  It's a balance. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10125.119999999999s)]
*  You know, we clearly need both of these things and right now, it's broken. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10126.119999999999s)]
*  And there's a lot of weirdness that's going on with biology in general in the world right [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10130.56s)]
*  now and one of them is I think there was a third scientist that was arrested for trying [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10137.2s)]
*  to bring in toxic mold from China. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10143.68s)]
*  We know that this one scientist was arrested and then I think there's been two more. [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10147.16s)]
*  So they're trying to introduce this toxic mold into our food supply. [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10152.24s)]
*  The same toxic mold? [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10156.32s)]
*  I think so. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10157.72s)]
*  It might have been a different one, but I know it's also, it's the same kind of thing. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10159.76s)]
*  See if you can find it, Jamie. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10163.48s)]
*  When I heard this the first time and I've only heard about the first one, my first thought [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10165.0s)]
*  was is this deliberate or is this super naivete on the part of the student? [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10168.52s)]
*  It's coming from China, which scares the shit out of me because if China wanted to cripple [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10173.96s)]
*  America's food supply, there'd be a great way to compromise basically everything. [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10177.64s)]
*  There is a country that is investing in science. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10181.52s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10183.64s)]
*  Yeah, just their drone technologies off the charts. [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10184.64s)]
*  I was watching a documentary yesterday on the autonomous production of coal and so they [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10187.76s)]
*  have these coal mines now that are done entirely with electric trucks and everything's done [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10193.16s)]
*  with AI and humans aren't involved at all. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10198.039999999999s)]
*  So these trucks go, they dig, they mine, they fill the trucks, they bring the coal back [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10201.88s)]
*  and then when they're low on batteries, they charge themselves. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10208.039999999999s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10210.56s)]
*  Yeah, and they're running 24 hours a day around the clock. [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10211.56s)]
*  We don't have anything like that. [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10216.68s)]
*  No. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10217.68s)]
*  We're not even close to doing that. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10218.68s)]
*  No, and we're fighting about the amount of money that we should invest into very basic [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10219.68s)]
*  infrastructure. [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10223.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10224.36s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10225.36s)]
*  It is terrifying. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10226.36s)]
*  It's terrifying because we always hope that with every administration, there'll be positive [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10227.36s)]
*  changes and it just never seems to be the case. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10232.68s)]
*  It's just like more and more of the same and more short-sightedness. [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10235.2s)]
*  Is it also this scarcity mindset? [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10240.7s)]
*  I can't agree with this person because they once said this thing. [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10242.56s)]
*  Why can't we have just a normal conversation like you and I are having right now? [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10245.84s)]
*  I think it's because it's kind of engineered into our social media structure that human [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10252.16s)]
*  beings are going to fight with each other. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10258.08s)]
*  The algorithm favors you looking and interacting with things that upset you. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10259.599999999999s)]
*  This is just natural human nature. [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10265.619999999999s)]
*  If you look at some of the people that we were talking about earlier, negative scientists, [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10267.46s)]
*  you see them online. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10270.96s)]
*  They're tweeting negative things all day long. [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10272.199999999999s)]
*  It's probably because they don't have any funding, so they can't actually do any science. [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10274.839999999998s)]
*  Chinese scientist was arrested while arriving in the U.S. at Detroit Airport. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10279.48s)]
*  A second case in days involving the alleged smuggling of biological material. [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10282.68s)]
*  But is it the same biological? [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10286.279999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10288.4s)]
*  Different stuff? [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10289.4s)]
*  What is this stuff? [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10290.4s)]
*  This is worms. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10291.4s)]
*  Worms? [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10292.4s)]
*  Described as worms. [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10293.4s)]
*  Certain worms require government permit. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10294.72s)]
*  I had heard that there was a third one. [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10298.039999999999s)]
*  This is the third. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10299.8s)]
*  This is the third, so there's a second one. [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10300.8s)]
*  This one happened. [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10302.6s)]
*  Oh, second case in days. [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10303.6s)]
*  I will say, they were going to the same place. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10304.6s)]
*  Oh boy. [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10306.84s)]
*  Another Chinese scientist also going to the University of Michigan. [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10308.6s)]
*  Boy, that's also really crazy because the thing about China and their scientists that [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10313.56s)]
*  come over to America is they all have to check in with the CCP. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10318.72s)]
*  If you are a Chinese scientist and you're from China and you're working in America, [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10322.12s)]
*  you got to check in. [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10326.4s)]
*  Which means how much of this research is just getting shared with China. [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10327.68s)]
*  It's all weird. [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10332.960000000001s)]
*  And we're focused on something else. [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10333.960000000001s)]
*  We're focused on the acid. [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10335.4s)]
*  They play a very long game and I think their game involves Raptors and T-Rexes. [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10337.52s)]
*  They're going to release all the stuff you won't do. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10341.800000000001s)]
*  I've seen that movie. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10344.12s)]
*  I wonder, I worry about that, your information, the stuff that you guys are working on, if [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10346.68s)]
*  that stuff can be compromised, if someone can get a hold of it. [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10352.24s)]
*  And then they start doing that stuff over there. [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10356.2s)]
*  Well, the thing is the foundation for what we're doing, all of the stuff from sequencing [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10357.76s)]
*  gene editing technologies to learning how do we link certain DNA sequence changes to [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10363.04s)]
*  the way something looks. [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10367.720000000001s)]
*  This stuff is all out there anyway. [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10370.12s)]
*  CRISPR technology exists. [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10372.640000000001s)]
*  We're not working on humans, but other companies are openly. [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10374.160000000002s)]
*  It's not like there's a big scary... [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10377.68s)]
*  Well, you know the story from China where the one doctor got in trouble and wound up [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10378.68s)]
*  going to jail because they had supposedly inoculated these babies from HIV, but in fact [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10381.960000000001s)]
*  were making them more intelligent. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10387.480000000001s)]
*  I think maybe that was two separate stories because I know the story about Jiang Ke, that's [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10389.44s)]
*  He Jiang Ke was the name of that scientist, and he went to jail for three years. [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10394.52s)]
*  He actually did some training in the US. [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10398.12s)]
*  His name is He. [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10401.2s)]
*  But he was trying to use gene editing tools to make these babies have a particular mutation [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10403.6s)]
*  that we know is protective against HIV. [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10413.880000000001s)]
*  It's the one that stops the HIV from entering the cells where it then kills the cells. [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10416.32s)]
*  I think this was a story that was broken by a guy at MIT Tech Review a couple of days [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10421.8s)]
*  before it was announced, but he thought that he was going to be able to announce this to [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10426.08s)]
*  great fanfare in front of a community that was going to celebrate him for having done [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10429.339999999998s)]
*  this. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10433.72s)]
*  The story broke a few days early, but he had set this up, the whole PR thing. [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10434.72s)]
*  He had YouTube videos that were ready to go to explain what he had done. [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10438.039999999999s)]
*  He wasn't trying to do it in secret. [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10442.599999999999s)]
*  He thought he was going to be a hero. [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10444.32s)]
*  But people were like, holy shit, dude, what the fuck? [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10447.279999999999s)]
*  No, we're not editing human germ lines, the cells that will be passed on to the next generation. [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10450.84s)]
*  There's still a moratorium against doing that work. [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10456.72s)]
*  The baby that was just born, for example, they didn't edit any of his cells that would [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10458.96s)]
*  get passed on to the next generation. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10463.08s)]
*  It's only the cells in his body, so those edits will only ever live in him. [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10464.52s)]
*  There's a difference between doing that, and it's the second one that we're uncomfortable [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10469.4s)]
*  with. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10473.08s)]
*  I thought they were editing it to make the children have a potential for higher intelligence. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10474.84s)]
*  I think that's maybe an unintended consequence of the gene that they were editing, because [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10481.039999999999s)]
*  mice did something like that. [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10485.52s)]
*  I think they just assume they're going to be smarter, but I don't think that they're [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10489.0s)]
*  old enough to even test that yet. [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10492.52s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10494.68s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10495.68s)]
*  But if they knew that, wouldn't they do that? [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10496.68s)]
*  It didn't end up even being the right mutation. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10497.68s)]
*  Because is HIV a real issue today? [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10499.12s)]
*  It's not really. [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10501.32s)]
*  The reason that he got whatever ethical permission he did in China to do this is because they [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10502.56s)]
*  were children that were born by IVF, because the dad had AIDS. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10507.16s)]
*  What he claimed he was trying to do was create an environment where they would never accidentally [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10513.72s)]
*  get it, I guess, if there's blood. [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10518.76s)]
*  And it also makes them smarter. [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10519.76s)]
*  I don't know if they knew that at the time. [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10520.76s)]
*  Oh, it was the same thing they did. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10523.76s)]
*  China's played a long game. [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10526.76s)]
*  It definitely affected their brains, is what they just keep saying in this article. [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10527.76s)]
*  They don't know, because they haven't been able to measure anything with these. [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10531.92s)]
*  They're guessing that would have affected their brains at this point. [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10534.68s)]
*  When they're the leaders of the world in 20 years, we'll know. [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10537.76s)]
*  We'll know for sure. [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10540.800000000001s)]
*  What makes us smart has been a thing that people have been trying to solve for a long [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10543.800000000001s)]
*  time. [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10547.84s)]
*  We're always looking for the one or two genes that figure out this. [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10548.84s)]
*  Very few traits are encoded by one or two genes. [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10552.400000000001s)]
*  There are some hair traits. [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10555.800000000001s)]
*  Whether your lobes are attached or not, that's one gene that you can change. [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10557.160000000002s)]
*  It is quite fascinating to think that in the future, dumb people will not exist. [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10560.92s)]
*  I doubt that's true. [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10565.640000000001s)]
*  Why? [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10567.0s)]

*  and shut up so that you're actually listening to another person? [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10589.880000000001s)]
*  Emotional intelligence. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10592.24s)]
*  Do you mean somebody who can solve shitload of math problems and be a physicist or whatever? [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10593.24s)]
*  And be awkward socially. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10597.72s)]
*  Do you mean somebody who's just really fucking good looking? [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10599.0s)]
*  What do you mean when you say, is this thing? [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10601.56s)]
*  You have to define that first. [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10604.880000000001s)]
*  And then once it's defined, if you look for associations between genes at high frequency [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10606.880000000001s)]
*  with people who rank high on whatever your thing is that you're ranking them on, it's [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10612.84s)]
*  different depending on which human population you're studying. [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10617.4s)]
*  And this makes total evolutionary sense. [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10624.32s)]
*  Different things were under selection in different habitats at different times, and that made [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10626.92s)]
*  different people smarter in different ways for whatever that was. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10631.4s)]
*  I actually think this is not how we start editing ourselves because that's not how evolution [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10635.48s)]
*  works. [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10642.16s)]
*  If we edit everybody to be smart in that particular way and to be 5'10", blonde with [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10643.16s)]
*  blue eyes and perfect and never going to have diabetes, the most attractive thing out there [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10649.8s)]
*  is going to be the opposite of that. [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10654.24s)]
*  So there will be, I just don't think, people are always thinking about we're going to get [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10656.84s)]
*  super humans, but they have a specific picture in their mind of what that means. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10661.88s)]
*  That's not the same picture that the Chinese government has in mind. [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10666.56s)]
*  It's not the same picture that I have in mind. [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10670.18s)]
*  That's why I don't fear it as much, I think, because that's not how it's going to happen. [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10674.62s)]
*  How it will happen is there will be some massive pandemic and we discover that there is a particular [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10679.9s)]
*  mutation that means you're going to die. [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10686.42s)]
*  And then suddenly this most unethical thing that is completely abhorrent and you absolutely [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10688.28s)]
*  can't do it will be the only ethical solution. [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10693.74s)]
*  That is how we get there. [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10697.18s)]
*  In my imagination. [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10699.86s)]
*  Wow. [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10700.86s)]
*  Well, I would love to have you back on when you get more information and more breakthroughs [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10701.86s)]
*  and more stuff that you're doing. [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10708.7s)]
*  I would love to come back on. [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10710.26s)]
*  I really, really enjoyed our conversation. [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10711.26s)]
*  You should come to the lab. [[02:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10712.26s)]
*  I know you got to see. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10713.26s)]
*  I would love to come to the lab. [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10714.26s)]
*  I will definitely do that. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10715.26s)]
*  I promise you. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10716.26s)]
*  I promise. [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10717.26s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10718.26s)]
*  It was really great. [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10719.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10720.26s)]
*  I really, really enjoyed it. [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10721.26s)]
*  And your book, Life As We Made It, How 50,000 Years of Human Innovation Refined and Redefined [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10722.26s)]
*  Nature, Beth Shapiro. [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10727.58s)]
*  I think the rest of my Siberia story is in there, including the part at the end where [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10729.3s)]
*  I got arrested. [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10732.62s)]
*  Did you do an audiobook? [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10733.62s)]
*  I did. [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10734.62s)]
*  I read the audiobook for that. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10735.62s)]
*  Yes. [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10736.62s)]
*  Yes. [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10737.62s)]
*  I love it. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10738.62s)]
*  I'm so glad you read it. [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10739.62s)]
*  I hate when other people have to read people's work. [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10740.62s)]
*  I asked if I could read it because my first book, How to Clone a Mammoth, I didn't read. [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10742.06s)]
*  And I heard the audiobook and I write in first person and I tell stories and I try to make [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10746.14s)]
*  it funny. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10749.82s)]
*  And I was like, that's not how it should be read. [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10750.82s)]
*  So I wrote to them and I said, can I read this book? [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10752.86s)]
*  And they said, oh, you're going to have to audition. [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10755.86s)]
*  Audition for your own book. [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10757.9s)]
*  What if I am not good enough to read my own audiobook? [[02:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10760.74s)]
*  Well, you clearly are. [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10763.82s)]
*  Well, luckily you're a great talker. [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10765.18s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMH1-Bbqr0&t=10767.66s)]
