**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=5.8s)]
*  And we're up. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=12.72s)]
*  Yeah, if you have to pee, that's the key to this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=13.72s)]
*  You can't talk when you have to pee, because if you do, you're not gonna, nothing's gonna [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=15.6s)]
*  come out right. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=20.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=21.44s)]
*  You're just gonna be concentrating on peeing. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=22.44s)]
*  Such a good conversation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=24.44s)]
*  I was like, go off, you're a piece of land. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=25.44s)]
*  If I snap, what's gonna happen? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=26.44s)]
*  Yeah, I've learned. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=28.44s)]
*  I've learned, I just gotta let it go. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=29.880000000000003s)]
*  Did Ari really pee in the fucking? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  Oh, always. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=33.24s)]
*  Yeah, he pees in everything. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=34.24s)]
*  He pees in whiskey jugs, he pees in kombucha bottles. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=35.72s)]
*  He's a psychopath. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=40.84s)]
*  It's like my buddy AJ Hawk, he'll be doing the podcast and he's like just pissing in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=41.84s)]
*  a Gatorade bottle. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  I'm like, how many of those you got up in the fucking attic? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=46.68000000000001s)]
*  He's like, oh, I stopped doing that. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=49.08s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, right. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=51.56s)]
*  When Matt Serra was fighting in the UFC, he used to drink so much water that he would [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=52.56s)]
*  have to get up in the middle of the night to pee all the time. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=57.8s)]
*  So he put like a bucket by the side of his bed. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=59.48s)]
*  And just leaned off? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=62.4s)]
*  Yeah, he just leaned off and pissed in something. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=63.4s)]
*  I think maybe he had a jug, like a one gallon empty jug. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=65.32s)]
*  I had a teammate who would piss himself in practice and games and then spray a bunch [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=69.16s)]
*  of water to make it like he didn't piss himself. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=72.96s)]
*  What? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  What a psycho. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  That's a guy committed to winning. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  I was like, oh, hey, Max is doing it again. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  Max is doing it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=83.0s)]
*  He's like, fuck, what is he doing? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=84.0s)]
*  Did he let you guys know he was doing it? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=85.0s)]
*  At one point, somebody's like, what the fuck is that? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=86.8s)]
*  Did you piss yourself? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=88.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=89.96s)]
*  Like, how long have you been doing that since college? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=90.96s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong with you? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  He just throws water on it? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  They just spray it, like takes the water and puts it in his mouth and like sprays it down [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=98.88s)]
*  there. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=102.16s)]
*  We know, Max. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=103.16s)]
*  We know. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=104.16s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong with you? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=105.16s)]
*  Fucking athletes. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=108.52s)]
*  You have to be a fucking crazy person. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=110.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=112.0s)]
*  I mean, especially, I mean, your line of work, you're playing like, other than fighting, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=113.0s)]
*  it's the most dangerous game. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=118.88s)]
*  Fighting a little more dangerous. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=121.76s)]
*  Yeah, fighting is more dangerous, but not necessarily, you know, like overall impacts. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=122.76s)]
*  The kind of impacts. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=130.28s)]
*  More concussion zone. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=131.44s)]
*  In fighting? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I would imagine. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  Just the sparring and training, that's the thing that people don't really take into consideration [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=136.1s)]
*  how many times guys get hit in the head training, depending on what gym they're from and how [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=140.44000000000003s)]
*  the gym operates. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=145.4s)]
*  Some guys, they go really hard in the gym. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=147.0s)]
*  That's a lot of micro concussions over and over. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=149.8s)]
*  And then if you got one, then you get another hit. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=153.8s)]
*  Do you ever spend any time in hyperbaric chambers? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=158.96s)]
*  I did a bunch. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=159.96s)]
*  I did a bunch for my rehab. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=160.96s)]
*  It was awesome. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=161.96s)]
*  It helps a lot. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  I think so. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  I think it's like anecdotal, but I know there's research. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=167.04s)]
*  But it wasn't like I felt like, oh my god, I feel fucking incredible. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=170.11999999999998s)]
*  It's like, I think it's helping. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=173.48s)]
*  Everything's helping. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=175.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=176.16s)]
*  There was some research that was done in Israel about lengthening of telomeres, where they [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=177.16s)]
*  put people on this protocol. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  I think it was like a 90-day protocol where they did 60 sessions in 90 days, and it showed [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=184.88s)]
*  their telomere length increased, which was consistent to a change in age, a biological [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=191.16s)]
*  age of 20 years. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=197.92s)]
*  20? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=198.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=199.92s)]
*  I'm going to jump in that thing right now. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=200.92s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=201.92s)]
*  I don't know whether that, I mean, I've talked to Peter Atti about that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=202.92s)]
*  He's like, that doesn't necessarily mean you're 20 years younger. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=206.84s)]
*  It's probably beneficial, but there's like, you know, but Peter's like very hard-nosed, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=210.6s)]
*  like buy the book, science. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=216.6s)]
*  He doesn't leave any room for fuckery. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=218.6s)]
*  He was late on the bandwagon for peptides. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  He's like, I don't know. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=223.76s)]
*  But now he's in. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  He's very willing to accept information, but he just wants to make sure that it's absolutely [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  accurate before he talks. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=232.24s)]
*  I respect that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=233.44s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=234.44s)]
*  He's rock solid. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=235.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=236.44s)]
*  So you are, how many months out since your injury? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=237.44s)]
*  Almost five. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=242.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=243.56s)]
*  My wife was just here and we were talking about how we wanted to see your game. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=244.56s)]
*  We set it up. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=246.68s)]
*  We're going to go see Aaron play. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  He's going to be playing the Cowboys in Dallas. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=249.16s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=252.12s)]
*  We got all pumped up and four plays later. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=253.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=255.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  How is it now? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  It feels good. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  It feels good. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  I can do everything except sprint at a top speed. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  So the cool thing is I really attacked the rehab the first few months and kind of wanted [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=261.96000000000004s)]
*  to go as hard as I could for two months to see where I was at and also see where the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=268.8s)]
*  team was at because my goal was to come back. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=272.16s)]
*  Nobody has come back really quick from that injury. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=275.8s)]
*  Most of the time when it happens, especially during season, there's no need to push a [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=280.52s)]
*  rehab because it happened the first week of the season. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=284.08s)]
*  I said, you know, let's push this as hard as I can and see if I can come back in December [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  at some point. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=291.72s)]
*  So I kind of in my mind had circled Christmas Eve, which would have been 14 weeks post surgery. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=292.72s)]
*  And yeah, I worked really, really hard. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=298.52s)]
*  I had a great surgeon who did a newer process where they kind of attach, anchor the sutures [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=300.04s)]
*  through the tendon back into your heel. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=308.48s)]
*  So it allows you to get on your feet quicker. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=310.68s)]
*  I did a lot of other things to speed up the rehab. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=313.04s)]
*  I did hyperbaric chamber, worked with Brigham and Ways to Well. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=317.4s)]
*  I know you're very good friends with and saw him on the podcast here and he's amazing. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=322.8s)]
*  He did some stem cells, did full time rehab up to eight hours a day with, you know, an [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  incredible spot in L.A. and also at home doing extra stuff. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  My diet was rock solid, a lot of bone broth to increase the collagen levels, to increase [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=340.52s)]
*  healing. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  And so I felt, you know, I felt really, really good. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=348.35999999999996s)]
*  I made it back on the practice field at 11 weeks. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=351.2s)]
*  The way the NFL works with the IR, you can have a three week window before they got to [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=355.76s)]
*  make a decision. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=360.36s)]
*  So they designate you to return. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=361.36s)]
*  You have three weeks before you get activated. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=362.36s)]
*  So I was hoping we'd win those three games. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=365.0s)]
*  I could come back. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=367.32s)]
*  Now, I couldn't sprint and still can at top speed, but I felt like there's been times [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=368.32s)]
*  in my career where I played in a small circle and could have been able to be effective. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=371.8s)]
*  That didn't happen. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=376.44s)]
*  And so they didn't activate me to the roster. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=378.14s)]
*  I just got to practice, but I didn't get to play. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=382.44s)]
*  But I feel good. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=384.96s)]
*  You know, it was I had a lot of things working against me, my age being the biggest one. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=385.96s)]
*  But I learned a lot about a lot more about health, which I'm sure people will love to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=390.28s)]
*  hear about. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=394.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=395.92s)]
*  I mean, if you follow like a ways to well protocol, you can pretty radically speed up [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=396.92s)]
*  recovery for injuries, you know. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=403.12s)]
*  What's interesting is that there's stuff that you can do that you didn't do because it's [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=406.92s)]
*  not allowed, which is, you know, very admirable on your part. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=412.0s)]
*  But I would have done it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=415.36s)]
*  I would have done everything. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=416.36s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=417.36s)]
*  I would have gone the full Conor McGregor route. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=418.36s)]
*  But when you do, how do they determine whether or not you are fully here? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=421.96000000000004s)]
*  Do they do an MRI and check the tissue? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=427.36s)]
*  Yeah, we're doing the ultrasounds actually for a while just to see what type of blood [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=429.88s)]
*  flow we're getting to the area. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=434.56s)]
*  We didn't actually do another MRI. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=437.32s)]
*  If I had been activated with the intent to play, I think just for safety for everybody, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  we probably would have done another MRI just to see the integrity, structural integrity [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=445.08s)]
*  of the tendon. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=449.08s)]
*  But really, it was about how I felt, you know, and I was able to to do all the quarterback [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=450.08s)]
*  stuff, move in the pocket, throw step into my foot. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=455.32s)]
*  I could actually, you know, jog to slightly faster than a jog to move and throw all things [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=461.52s)]
*  I kind of showed in practice the last few weeks. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=467.64s)]
*  What happens over that? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=469.68s)]
*  If you speed it up a little, do you feel pain? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=470.68s)]
*  Do you feel I don't have the explosion. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=473.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't have the ability to kind of get up on my toe. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=475.32s)]
*  The biggest hurdle was just single leg calf strength, like being able to from a standing [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=479.64s)]
*  position, shift my weight onto the single leg and do a heel raise. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=485.65999999999997s)]
*  That's how you know you're ready to run because you run on your athletes play on their toes. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  So I need to be able to do that. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=495.96s)]
*  Now I could get around that by subtle movements in the pocket. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=498.16s)]
*  But there was multiple times throughout my career, I had lower leg injuries in 14 and [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=501.84000000000003s)]
*  18, especially where I was able to play in a small circle in 14. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=505.36s)]
*  I ripped my calf up pretty bad and was able to kind of play in the shotgun and the pistol [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=508.88s)]
*  for a stretch of time and be effective in 18. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=514.6s)]
*  I banged my knee up on the second drive of the game, tore my MCL, had a fracture on the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=516.72s)]
*  lateral side and was able to play for a while, mostly in the shotgun until that healed up. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=526.96s)]
*  So I knew I could do it. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=533.88s)]
*  I wanted to show I could play under center, which I did in practice, but we just were [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=534.88s)]
*  out of it. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=540.12s)]
*  So I didn't come back. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=541.12s)]
*  Well, it seems like it's the smartest move at your age to make sure it's 100 percent. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=542.16s)]
*  Like, like I've seen a lot of athletes come back, particularly from ACL injuries with [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=546.68s)]
*  fighters. They come back too soon and pops again. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=551.36s)]
*  Yeah, I totally agree with that on many levels. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=555.4s)]
*  But then there's the competitor part where I see that that window closing and there's not [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=559.04s)]
*  many guys who've been who've played as long as I have. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=567.0s)]
*  There's a few. Obviously, Tom did it for a long time. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=570.12s)]
*  But, you know, there's kind of an age where Father Time is winning. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=572.9200000000001s)]
*  And I know that, you know, I'm on the last couple of holes in my career, so I didn't want [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=577.36s)]
*  to miss an entire season. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=583.1600000000001s)]
*  Are you 36 now? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  No, 40. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=585.72s)]
*  40. Thank you, though. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=586.4000000000001s)]
*  You look 36. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=587.6800000000001s)]
*  What is what is like the old is Tom the oldest that people have played? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=589.24s)]
*  I think Tom was 45 as last year. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=593.08s)]
*  There was there were some kickers that played about as long. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=595.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, 45s. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=599.36s)]
*  45s crazy. That's crazy. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=600.08s)]
*  Because you hear about a fighter that's 45. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=602.28s)]
*  You hear about a fighter in their late 30s is kind of like. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=604.1600000000001s)]
*  Except in the juicy days, the juicy days of the UFC. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=608.36s)]
*  There were some guys that they competed really well. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=611.88s)]
*  Well, there's still some guys that are that are late late 30s. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=615.28s)]
*  Yo, Romero. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=619.44s)]
*  Yo, that's what I was going to say. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=620.44s)]
*  I mean, but he's the freak of all freaks. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=621.96s)]
*  They need to study that guy in the lab. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=624.64s)]
*  I think you've said that before. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=626.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I've told the story so many times. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=627.72s)]
*  People get annoyed if I bring it up. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=629.88s)]
*  But I don't care. You bring it up. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=631.0400000000001s)]
*  The UFC brought him to a doctor and the doctor's like, where did you get this guy? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=632.08s)]
*  And they're like, he's awesome, right? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=635.96s)]
*  They're like, no, no, no, you understand. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=637.64s)]
*  Like, I've never seen a human being that's built like him. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=639.0s)]
*  They said that is the tendon in his eyes were three times larger than a normal person's. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=642.84s)]
*  His eye fracture, he had an orbital fracture, was already healing by the time [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=647.0s)]
*  they're bringing him into the doctor. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=650.9200000000001s)]
*  They're like, this guy is just a freak. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=652.6s)]
*  By the way, his neck is completely fused. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=654.6s)]
*  So if you see when he runs, his neck is completely stiff. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=656.68s)]
*  His neck is totally fused. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=659.64s)]
*  And that's some shit they did in Cuba. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=660.96s)]
*  Like when he broke his neck. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=663.24s)]
*  So he's got this is nice, Jamie. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=667.12s)]
*  This is he has this is new, this whole setup. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=668.72s)]
*  No, no, it's always been like this. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=671.0799999999999s)]
*  It's really nice. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=674.12s)]
*  I mean, he didn't even get into the UFC. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=674.8s)]
*  I think he was like 36 or 37 when he fought his first fights in the UFC. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=676.4s)]
*  And he's still fighting in a world class level. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=680.4399999999999s)]
*  Did he rip his knee up and keep fighting? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=682.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=685.24s)]
*  I thought he had like a ligament damage and kept fighting. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=686.24s)]
*  Maybe that's somebody else. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=689.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=690.3199999999999s)]
*  He's probably one of those guys that if he did, he wouldn't tell you. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=691.0799999999999s)]
*  You know, that Cuban athletic program that he talked about, it was a fun podcast [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=694.24s)]
*  because I did with him and Joey Diaz. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=699.04s)]
*  So he would talk in Spanish and Joey Diaz would translate it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=700.76s)]
*  But occasionally he would talk in English, but he was like, they turn you into a machine. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=704.1999999999999s)]
*  He was talking about the Cuban program. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=709.4s)]
*  Like if you're competing for Cuba, if you're on the elite team, you eat three times a day. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=712.24s)]
*  If you're not on the elite team, you eat twice a day. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=717.6800000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=719.76s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=720.28s)]
*  You sleep in better places. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=722.36s)]
*  You have better food. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=723.76s)]
*  And so he's like, so the competition is just intense. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=725.12s)]
*  Broken leg in KO in over Luke Rockhold. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=730.76s)]
*  He broke his leg. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=733.12s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=734.8s)]
*  He broke his leg when he won. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=736.84s)]
*  Huh? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=738.52s)]
*  Broke his shin, is that what it said? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=739.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=742.04s)]
*  Please broke his shin after he checked. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=742.44s)]
*  Suffering what he believes is a broken leg. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=743.88s)]
*  Huh? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=746.2s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=747.48s)]

*  they get into office. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1040.0s)]
*  They have to figure out a way to stop that. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1041.2s)]
*  I mean, it's it should have never been allowed in the first place. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1042.96s)]
*  Another thing would be get back on the gold standard. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1046.8s)]
*  That would be a great move, too. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1049.3600000000001s)]
*  But that's too late. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1050.2s)]
*  But Jeff Gave is trying to do that. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1051.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1053.0s)]
*  Silver standard. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1053.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1054.28s)]
*  Guess what they did to him? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1054.6s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1055.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1057.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1057.84s)]
*  They see Bobby Kennedy out there. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1060.28s)]
*  They won't even give him secret service protection, which is just fucking egregious. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1061.4s)]
*  It's so wild. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1066.96s)]
*  They won't give him. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1067.76s)]
*  He's the only presidential candidate ever. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1068.76s)]
*  It's been denied secret service protection three times, I think. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1072.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1074.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1075.08s)]
*  It's just they're so fucking corrupt. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1076.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1079.04s)]
*  And they're so in your face with it and no one does anything about it. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1079.4s)]
*  You had Bobby on the podcast. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1082.16s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1083.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1084.0s)]
*  What did you think of him? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1084.32s)]
*  I love him. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1085.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1085.96s)]
*  I love. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1086.24s)]
*  Look, forget about the vaccine stuff, which I think he's got very good points about all that stuff. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1087.2s)]
*  There's real data. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1092.96s)]
*  And if you read his book, if you read the real Anthony Fauci, you'll be sick to your stomach. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1094.08s)]
*  If you know the absolute truth, if it wasn't truth, wasn't truth, he'd be sued. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1098.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1102.72s)]
*  He's not getting sued for a fucking reason, but just that alone. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1102.96s)]
*  But then if you forget about the vaccine stuff, just look at his environmental record, what he did when he was an environmental attorney, when he was suing these companies, they were. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1106.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1113.28s)]
*  I mean, they cleaned up the Hudson River because of him. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1113.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1116.6000000000001s)]
*  He's amazing guy. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1117.3600000000001s)]
*  I really love him. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1118.8s)]
*  And the things that he's been saying about what happened during the pandemic, you know, he had some talk that he did recently, some speech, some conversation he did recently that was public, where he was talking about this is we're being poisoned by food. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1120.44s)]
*  And this is why everybody got so sick from COVID. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1135.04s)]
*  The disparity between people who got COVID and it was just a cold versus people who got COVID and they were deadly ill is 100% what they're eating and what that does to their body and how it compromises their immune system and how it causes comorbidities like diabetes, type two diabetes and obesity and heart disease. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1136.92s)]
*  This is all a direct relationship to food. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1156.0s)]
*  But there's no money in in in healing people. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1160.0s)]
*  You know, the chronic disease, that's it's a huge moneymaker. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1162.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1165.52s)]
*  And it's not going to change. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1165.8s)]
*  I was watching something the other day with with Tucker Carlson was interviewing somebody named Callie Means and I'll be sad this but he's talking about. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1167.36s)]
*  Ozempic. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1175.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1176.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1177.0s)]
*  I did see that. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1177.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1178.36s)]
*  We're talking about it yesterday. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1178.48s)]
*  But one of the big points that he made that people I think forget is that why are these drug companies, big pharma, spending so much money on advertisements during the news is not to sell their products. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1179.48s)]
*  They don't have a problem with that. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1191.36s)]
*  It's to control the messaging. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1192.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1194.16s)]
*  I mean, they're fucking controlling the message. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1194.6799999999998s)]
*  For sure. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1197.0s)]
*  So if if somebody went after and said, hey, you're not going to be allowed to advertise on TV anymore, because I think we're one of the only countries. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1197.6s)]
*  Maybe there's one other country. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1205.08s)]
*  New Zealand's the only other country. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1206.1999999999998s)]
*  OK, so there's two countries. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1207.24s)]
*  It would be, you know, they would be attacked for anti-science or whatever it might be. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1208.9199999999998s)]
*  What what RFK wants to do, you know, kind of the dismantling or the reforming realigning of the CDC and NIH and some of these alphabet companies who've been lying and misleading the public for so long. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1213.52s)]
*  You know, he would get absolutely slaughtered by by the media. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1228.16s)]
*  Why? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1232.32s)]
*  Not because they actually believe that, but because who's paying them. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1233.1200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1236.88s)]
*  It's those companies. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1237.16s)]
*  So they control the message. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1237.88s)]
*  So when when you come out and talk about, you know, what you use to heal yourself during Covid or when I come out and talk about or Dr. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1239.04s)]
*  Peter McCalla or Robert Malone or insert anybody who was just trying to bring up Corey, they get absolutely railroaded and censored and silenced and attacked. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1247.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1256.64s)]
*  Slandered. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1257.12s)]
*  It's not I mean, it's not the news. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1257.96s)]
*  It's corporate controlled. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1260.8s)]
*  It's completely controlled. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1261.84s)]
*  And it's it's not good for us. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1263.0s)]
*  And the fact that people went along with it because they thought ideologically that that group of people aligned with their side and the other side was Donald Trump and the MAGA and the vaccine deniers and all all the craziness that they attributed to that. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1265.32s)]
*  I mean, it's really kind of brilliant the way they've pushed this propaganda. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1277.6799999999998s)]
*  But at the end of the day, it's not beneficial to the greater good of society. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1281.96s)]
*  If the if the media was legitimate, they would be talking about one of the biggest crises that's happening in this country right now, which is a massive increase in all cause mortality. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1286.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's a massive increase and they're completely sign on on it. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1296.44s)]
*  It's like in some age groups, it's a 40 plus percent increase in all cause mortality, heart attacks, strokes, cancer. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1300.1200000000001s)]
*  Gee, what do you think happened that changed where all of a sudden there's this massive increase and it coincides with something else? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1308.3200000000002s)]
*  Don't you think maybe they would investigate that? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1314.72s)]
*  Wouldn't don't you think that like you would have some sort of investigative reporter that dives deep into this and gets to the bottom of it? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1316.64s)]
*  No, they can't because they're captured. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1322.88s)]
*  They're totally captured. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1325.96s)]
*  Hundred percent. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1326.72s)]
*  And yeah, it's just on and on and on through this whole thing. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1327.28s)]
*  My thing is this is, you know, all of us who've been attacked for our position to all those people. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1331.76s)]
*  What do you think the fucking motivation is? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1338.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1340.8s)]
*  I mean, you know, just look at my own situation like I lost friends, allies in the media, millions of dollars in sponsorship because I talked about what worked for me in my own beliefs and my own health reasons why I didn't get vaccinated. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1341.1599999999999s)]
*  And by the way, you were right. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1359.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you were right. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1361.36s)]
*  Look, you didn't need it. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1362.12s)]
*  Look how quickly you recovered. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1363.36s)]
*  You're fine. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1365.04s)]
*  And same with you. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1366.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1366.9199999999998s)]
*  And what did they do? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1367.36s)]
*  They changed the color of your face. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1367.9199999999998s)]
*  They vilified all early treatments, including the medicine that has one of the safest profiles out there that we've talked about. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1371.1999999999998s)]
*  The guy who invented it got a Nobel Prize. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1379.32s)]
*  They were using it all over the world in Uttar Pradesh, Africa and various places. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1382.4799999999998s)]
*  And that's what you do during a pandemic, right? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1387.1599999999999s)]
*  You find ways to repurpose drugs for early treatments. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1388.3999999999999s)]
*  But now they couldn't do that because if there's an early treatment, then they can't get the UA. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1391.1999999999998s)]
*  Drugs have been proven to have antiviral properties. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1394.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1397.2399999999998s)]
*  But what's the motivation for Peter McCullough who got vilified? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1398.04s)]
*  What's the motivation for Robert Malone? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1400.72s)]
*  Like, well, if you know Peter McCullough, Peter McCullough is like that guy has standards and morals and ethics. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1402.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, he is a rock solid guy. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1407.8s)]
*  And he actually treated patients to actually treated patients. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1409.6000000000001s)]
*  He's also the most published doctor in history in his particular field of study. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1412.04s)]
*  Like, what's what is the the conspiracy on that about motivation? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1419.44s)]
*  Like, what do I get out of? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1423.44s)]
*  What do you get out of sharing what you share? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1425.0s)]
*  Well, I didn't think anything was going to happen when when it happened with me. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1427.0s)]
*  I knew that people were upset at me because I was hesitant to take the vaccine. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1430.56s)]
*  But that was because two people I knew got strokes. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1433.9199999999998s)]
*  I wasn't initially hesitant at all. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1436.52s)]
*  I was set up to take it. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1438.28s)]
*  I was set up to take it by the UFC. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1439.8799999999999s)]
*  I was ready to do it. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1442.24s)]
*  I was like, OK, shoot me up. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1443.08s)]
*  I was going to have them do it to me. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1444.04s)]
*  I thought of it like a flu shot. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1445.56s)]
*  Like, if I was about to do the UFC and they said, oh, you have to take a flu shot for the UFC. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1447.36s)]
*  I'm like, all right, stick me. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1451.36s)]
*  I didn't think it was going to be a big deal. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1453.0s)]
*  And then they said, well, in two weeks when you're back, just come early and you come to the clinic. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1454.9199999999998s)]
*  I said, OK, we'll do that. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1460.08s)]
*  And then within that two weeks, it got pulled. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1461.3999999999999s)]
*  Luckily, you know, but it's not just those two guys. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1463.36s)]
*  I know a lot of people now with pretty severe vaccine injuries. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1466.8799999999999s)]
*  So do I. And so many people have reached out to me because of what happened to me. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1470.76s)]
*  Celebrities that wanted to be quiet about it. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1474.52s)]
*  You know, people that are like really hesitant about talking about it openly and publicly. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1476.96s)]
*  But they were really scared. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1481.2s)]
*  Like people that have like real serious problem. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1482.8s)]
*  I have two friends that have pacemakers now. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1484.92s)]
*  Yeah, I talked about that. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1487.76s)]
*  They're like one of them are 30s. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1488.76s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1490.32s)]
*  We said a dentist. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1491.24s)]
*  That's not fucking normal. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1492.52s)]
*  No, it's not normal. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1493.52s)]
*  It's not normal. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1494.48s)]
*  I know your heart to stop for nine seconds at a time. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1494.8799999999999s)]
*  He's a thin, healthy young guy. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1497.24s)]
*  And all of a sudden, his heart starts fucking up. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1499.72s)]
*  Why does nobody care about that? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1501.4s)]
*  Well, everyone's scared. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1502.84s)]
*  There's people that are scared because they took it and they're worried that they have a ticking time bomb and they want any information, any information that refutes that and that confirms that they made the right choice. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1504.4s)]
*  Also, they did make the right choice morally and ethically when they did it. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1515.04s)]
*  They did it because they thought they were doing the right thing. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1519.6000000000001s)]
*  Everybody has to do it. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1522.48s)]
*  We're going to protect everyone. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1523.72s)]
*  If we all do this, this is going to get us out of the pandemic because the news media was being used by these pharmaceutical drug companies to push a very specific narrative. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1524.8000000000002s)]
*  And they didn't do any critical thinking. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1534.4s)]
*  They didn't step outside the box. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1536.52s)]
*  They didn't talk to any scientists that differed. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1538.04s)]
*  They all just stuck with whatever Fauci said, whatever the NIH said. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1540.92s)]
*  And they also demonize people who are saying things that have been proven to be absolutely correct, like the fucking lab leak theory. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1545.8s)]
*  If you brought up the lab leak theory, you used to get banned from YouTube. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1552.28s)]
*  Now it's widely accepted by everyone. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1555.48s)]
*  Everyone. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1559.0800000000002s)]
*  So was all the all the conspiracies that got people censored and kicked off. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1559.4s)]
*  So many of them have been proven to be true. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1564.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1566.88s)]
*  And I agree with you. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1567.52s)]
*  So many people thought they were doing the right thing. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1568.24s)]
*  They thought I'm doing my part. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1569.84s)]
*  This is what we're supposed to do to stop the spread. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1571.52s)]
*  You know, you know, I'm full on board. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1573.84s)]
*  We're all together. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1576.24s)]
*  But let's look at what happened. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1577.52s)]
*  And people are always like, why do you keep fucking bring up the vaccine for multiple reasons? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1578.68s)]
*  But listen, this is a playbook that now we have for the next time they fucking try and do this shit. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1582.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1586.96s)]
*  Don't forget about this. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1587.32s)]
*  Don't forget about disease. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1588.3600000000001s)]
*  Disease X. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1590.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1590.8s)]
*  When was the last time they were talking about a disease that doesn't exist, that's not affecting anybody, that's that literally there's no one sick. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1591.44s)]
*  There's no one dying. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1598.8s)]
*  And they're talking about how it's coming. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1599.8s)]
*  Well, just watch what Bill Gates does because last time he invested 50 million dollars and in a company made a pretty good score. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1601.52s)]
*  And then he pulled all his money out. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1607.6000000000001s)]
*  And then he started disparaging the effectiveness of the vaccine. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1609.28s)]
*  He pulled his money out, though. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1612.0s)]
*  After he pulled his money. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1613.04s)]
*  And he also started saying that the virus wasn't as bad as we thought it was. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1613.84s)]
*  Oh, gee, how convenient. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1617.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1620.0s)]
*  What happened to the flu? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1620.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1621.52s)]
*  Flu went away. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1622.44s)]
*  Zero cases. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1624.1200000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1626.56s)]
*  I mean, it is pretty crazy. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1627.04s)]
*  But we can't we cannot forget about what happened. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1628.68s)]
*  No. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1631.2s)]
*  Because this is what they're going to do next time. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1631.8000000000002s)]
*  Well, the big loser in in this, besides the people that lost their jobs and their businesses closed and people lost their lives, the big loser has been mainstream media because the trusted mainstream media is at an all time low. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1636.0s)]
*  I mean, they are laying off journalists left and right. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1649.96s)]
*  No one wants to read the newspaper anymore. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1652.64s)]
*  No one believes them. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1654.44s)]
*  CNN lost all their big hosts. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1655.8400000000001s)]
*  It's like they lost and they lost their streaming service. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1658.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1663.08s)]
*  Well, that was that was hilarious. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1663.4399999999998s)]
*  They dumped money into something to get people to pay for something that no one wants for free. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1665.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1669.8799999999999s)]
*  And it was like Anderson Cooper's book club. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1670.4399999999998s)]
*  Like, what the fuck are you doing? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1672.24s)]
*  If I was a shareholder in CNN. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1675.56s)]
*  How much? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1677.08s)]
*  Only ten dollars a month. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1677.52s)]
*  OK. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1678.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1679.36s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck are you guys doing? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1679.52s)]
*  Do you really think anybody's going to pay for CNN? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1681.6s)]
*  Like, what are you offering? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1684.32s)]
*  Nobody watches now. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1685.56s)]
*  Yeah, the Trumps now. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1686.44s)]
*  The numbers they get are so small. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1687.24s)]
*  That's why, you know, it's platforms like this that are actually bringing the information that people want to watch instead of watching the fucking news. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1689.36s)]
*  Like people used to trust in you and there's six o'clock nightly news and I'm going to get this story. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1695.96s)]
*  You know, there's no more Walter Cronkite out there. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1700.48s)]
*  It's it's it's long form conversations that are actually informing people on what's going on. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1702.6399999999999s)]
*  It's that and it's people steering you to legitimate journalists that are independent. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1707.3999999999999s)]
*  Michael Schellenberg is the Glenn Greenwalls, the the people that are experts in their field, the Brett Weinstein's, the people that actually know what they're talking about. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1711.96s)]
*  But it's just a weird landscape that we're in now that didn't exist before, where we don't we we're absolutely sure that you can't trust the mainstream media anymore. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1719.64s)]
*  We're absolutely sure of that. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1728.3600000000001s)]
*  And even boomers know that now, even the people that have been trusting the mainstream media their whole life. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1729.68s)]
*  Like, well, there are definitely something's wrong. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1734.6000000000001s)]
*  They don't know what it is. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1736.68s)]
*  But something's wrong. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1737.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1738.68s)]
*  Oh, those are amazing. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1739.3600000000001s)]
*  Those conflations. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1741.16s)]
*  Anderson Cooper brought to you by Pfizer. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1742.24s)]
*  I was watching the playoff game there and it said NFL football brought to you by Pfizer. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1745.16s)]
*  I was like, yeah, I knew that. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1751.2s)]
*  Yikes. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1753.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1754.16s)]
*  Well, they made a lot of money and they'd like to do that again, you know, and that's what you have to be really careful about. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1755.44s)]
*  But what they're doing that again now with is Ozempic. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1760.76s)]
*  And they're making a shitload of money off of this drug that essentially paralyzes your fucking stomach. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1763.8799999999999s)]
*  It slows your body's ability to digest. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1772.08s)]
*  It causes a host of gastrointestinal issues for some people, all sorts of weird side effects. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1774.52s)]
*  People have died taking it and they're pushing it and they're pushing it even on kids. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1779.12s)]
*  It's like a primary weight loss strategy for obesity instead of dietary change, instead of realizing like you got to get better the same way you got sick. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1783.76s)]
*  How did you get sick? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1792.28s)]

*  Exercise. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1798.6000000000001s)]
*  You had too many calories. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1799.0800000000002s)]
*  This is how you got to lose weight. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1800.28s)]
*  So you have to have less calories in than you're burning and you got to exercise and you get. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1802.32s)]
*  How about start drinking water? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1807.2s)]
*  Stop drinking soda. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1808.88s)]
*  We had this chart up yesterday of how many people on food stamps buy soda. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1810.04s)]
*  Like how much of food stamps is spent on soda. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1815.32s)]
*  It's fucking crazy. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1817.72s)]
*  It's like poor people just drinking poison, drinking sugary poison. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1818.72s)]
*  But see, that's part of the problem too. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1823.52s)]
*  You look at not just what they pushed or what they closed down during the lockdowns. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1825.04s)]
*  You know, you had what was open. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1830.4s)]
*  You had fast food restaurants. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1832.0s)]
*  Yeah, like you had fucking processed food places open. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1833.1200000000001s)]
*  But but the food that's actually the best for you oftentimes is the most expensive. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1835.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1841.2s)]
*  So you have to find a way to whether it's doing all out, you know, tariffs on certain extra taxes on certain types of products or, you know, I don't know how you're going to change [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1842.0s)]
*  the farming system, especially with Bill Gates being one of the biggest farm landowners there. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1853.16s)]
*  And he's pushing, you know, insects and his what's it called? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1857.92s)]
*  Appeal thing that he's putting on all the all the fruit and stuff. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1863.0800000000002s)]
*  But the problem is, in order to eat healthier, you have to spend more money because the shitty food is the least expensive. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1867.44s)]
*  What scares the shit out of me is what they're doing to farmers in Europe, like the Dutch farmers. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1873.0800000000002s)]
*  And in Ireland, they're telling farmers that they have to kill cows because they have too many cows and they're contributing to the [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1877.52s)]
*  global warming. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1883.64s)]
*  See, the guy had I think he was in Congress who was interviewing somebody and asking these, you know, climate change people about how much CO2 is, you know, and then they're way off. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1884.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they're way off. And then and they're making the decisions. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1895.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1898.0800000000002s)]
*  And they they they literally are just it's completely ideological. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1898.52s)]
*  The ideological battle, the demon that you're fighting is climate change. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1902.6000000000001s)]
*  And we must do something to stop climate change. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1906.1200000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, India and China aren't doing a fucking thing, and they're contributing to most of it, literally most of the carbon that's being released. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1909.08s)]
*  Like, if you look at the amount of fucking coal plants that China has, they're opening up new ones. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1918.72s)]
*  They have hundreds of them in construction. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1923.04s)]
*  Wasn't that the whole point of the was in Paris? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1925.04s)]
*  They had some sort of climate accord. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1928.32s)]
*  Yeah. And but it wasn't taking effect or there was different rules for other countries that we had to adhere to something that nobody else was adhering to. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1930.48s)]
*  It's control. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1938.12s)]
*  But that's what we've done the last. If you look at it, I saw some some, you know, someone on X about like what they were telling us in the 60s and the 70s and the 80s. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1939.12s)]
*  The world was always going to end based on something, you know, and they and now it's it's this climate change. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1947.44s)]
*  We got to change the, you know, the way we live in order for us to keep going. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1952.44s)]
*  It's like they've been doing this for the last five decades. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1955.96s)]
*  They would like to control the food system. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1957.96s)]
*  And there's a tremendous amount of money in controlling the food system. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1960.28s)]
*  And if they could get you to only buy their food and they can convince you that their food is somehow another emits less carbon and come up with some fucking Hollywood math that shows you that this is the only way to do it. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1963.0s)]
*  And this is the way out of this. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1978.72s)]
*  Well, I just learned something online that if you grow your own food, actually your carbon footprint is much greater than I posted on my Instagram. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1980.2s)]
*  And it got it got back checked. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1990.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, not I don't see the fact check. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1993.52s)]
*  But if someone goes to my page and sees that it says something about like partially true or not. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=1995.72s)]
*  Like, listen, it's a fucking article that was in whatever newspaper it was that I saw. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2003.24s)]
*  And I was like, this is hilarious. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2007.76s)]
*  Like there. How is it even crazy is that? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2010.3600000000001s)]
*  How is it even possible that it emits more carbon? [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2013.6000000000001s)]
*  You're literally growing plants in the ground, which take carbon dioxide and convert them to oxygen. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2016.44s)]
*  That's all you're doing. You don't have any heavy machinery. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2023.92s)]
*  You're growing your own food. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2026.56s)]
*  So you just got a little garden. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2027.56s)]
*  So you growing your own food. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2029.1200000000001s)]
*  Don't do this more carbon. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2030.96s)]
*  Not do it. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2032.24s)]
*  I don't even know how they did the math. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2032.92s)]
*  Like, how the fuck did they even say that? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2034.44s)]
*  I don't. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2036.44s)]
*  What does it say if you go to my page and it says it's fact check? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2037.2s)]
*  Oh, it's definitely fact checked. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2042.0s)]
*  My wife showed it to me. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2043.88s)]
*  I'm just saying I didn't see it. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2044.8s)]
*  I just checked on my phone too. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2046.04s)]
*  I don't see it. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2047.04s)]
*  Well, maybe they took it down because people freaked out. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2047.6s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2049.92s)]
*  Five times greater. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2050.6s)]
*  How's it possible? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2052.88s)]
*  You're literally growing something that takes oxygen and puts it out into the air. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2054.32s)]
*  It converts carbon dioxide to oxygen through photosynthesis. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2061.72s)]
*  That's literally what it does. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2065.12s)]
*  It's literally what plants do. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2066.8s)]
*  They make oxygen. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2068.64s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2069.76s)]
*  What if you didn't? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2070.24s)]
*  What if you didn't have? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2070.96s)]
*  Everybody's got lawns, right? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2072.04s)]
*  What if you had your own fucking garden? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2073.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2075.48s)]
*  Like how different would things be? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2076.12s)]
*  Well, you'd be a lot fucking healthier. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2078.24s)]

*  number, what is it, like 90 something percent of people they tested had glyphosate at [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2091.0s)]

*  So that company, Bayer, did that. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2127.96s)]

*  Those that was through Pegasus. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2355.2400000000002s)]
*  Pegasus one, he got a WhatsApp link, supposedly from MBS from Saudi Arabia, and he got this [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2357.12s)]
*  WhatsApp link. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2363.8399999999997s)]

*  I don't understand that. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2382.88s)]
*  I've had the guy who created Signal here and, you know, he seemed to think it was pretty [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2384.48s)]
*  rock solid, but that was back then. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2388.96s)]
*  You know, it's like they're always one step ahead of this. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2390.68s)]
*  And before we know about it, there has to be some whistleblower that comes out and says, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2394.16s)]
*  hey, the NSA can do this now. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2398.48s)]
*  Ed Snowden tried to do that. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2400.52s)]

*  I have nothing to hide. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2409.2s)]
*  It's like you're missing the fucking point. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2410.4s)]
*  The point is that there should be some freedom of privacy. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2412.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2417.04s)]

*  This country was founded as a constitutional republic to protect personal freedoms. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2422.6s)]
*  And I shouldn't have to worry about somebody fucking in my shit all the time. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2428.76s)]
*  Well, that's one of the things that they did that was very insidious after 9-11, because [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2433.08s)]
*  after 9-11, they passed the Patriot Act and the NDAA. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2437.08s)]
*  They had that thing dialed up right away. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2439.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2440.32s)]

*  And then when 9-11 came around, they just rolled all those all those bills, everything [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2444.92s)]
*  that they wanted to do. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2449.7999999999997s)]
*  They just chucked it into the Patriot Act and then the Patriot Act, too, which is even [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2450.4s)]
*  more draconian. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2453.88s)]
*  And now all that stuff's in place indefinite indefinite detention, like for people that [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2455.16s)]

*  Like the crime was surprise sex. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2470.2s)]
*  Like that's what they were trying to get him. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2473.56s)]

*  it, he didn't have the condom on. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2478.3599999999997s)]
*  It's there weren't no one was there. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2480.04s)]
*  And then she didn't want to press charges. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2481.48s)]
*  Like, I don't know what the extent of that case is now or what they're going after him [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2483.64s)]
*  for now, but that was what they were initially trying to get him on. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2487.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2492.24s)]

*  His ultimate crime is letting people know that what the hell's going on. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2495.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of well, there was also that the collateral murder video. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2498.64s)]
*  People had a really hard time with that, where they gunned down those reporters. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2504.8799999999997s)]
*  And then you could hear the soldiers saying, yeah, you shouldn't have kids there [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2508.2s)]
*  when they're shooting up that van. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2512.8799999999997s)]
*  Like, yeah, the whole thing is very, very difficult to watch. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2514.56s)]
*  And it's one of the cold, hard realities of the evil that is war. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2517.8399999999997s)]
*  And, you know, you're seeing that right now. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2524.44s)]
*  What's going on in Gaza? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2526.3599999999997s)]
*  You're seeing the same fucking thing. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2527.44s)]
*  You know, it's just that's what war is. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2529.48s)]
*  And there's people that will justify that all day long and saying they shouldn't have done this. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2532.2400000000002s)]
*  And, you know, that's how it goes. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2536.04s)]
*  But, man, if you live in Gaza, what the fuck do you do? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2537.44s)]
*  Like, you didn't do anything. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2541.64s)]
*  You just got the wrong roll of the dice. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2542.6800000000003s)]
*  And you're stuck in this place that's controlled by Hamas with abject poverty and no sanitation. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2544.52s)]
*  And now it's getting bombed into oblivion. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2551.0s)]
*  I mean, the videos, we see what Gaza looked like and what it looks like now. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2553.92s)]
*  It's fucking insane. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2557.88s)]
*  And they're not stopping. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2559.96s)]
*  They're not stopping. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2561.52s)]
*  They're just going to keep bombing it into oblivion. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2562.32s)]
*  Some of that has to change. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2565.68s)]
*  I mean, like, there has to be something that turn. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2566.72s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2569.96s)]
*  Amos. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2570.76s)]
*  Yeah, it might be. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2571.56s)]
*  Might be the only thing. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2572.92s)]
*  It might be. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2573.72s)]
*  I mean, that's it's interesting to see how much has changed, you know, in that over the last, I don't know, 15 years, just how people can talk about it now [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2575.2400000000002s)]
*  without being called crazy. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2583.2s)]
*  Yeah, there's some disclosure. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2584.6s)]
*  I actually went back to the day I was watching an old, I think it was from 2018 or 19 when you had Bob Lazar and Jeremy on. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2589.4399999999996s)]
*  And I mean, he's been talking about this forever. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2597.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2600.2s)]
*  But like, what what's going to happen with that? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2602.0s)]
*  There's got to be something. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2604.04s)]
*  You know, there's been conspiracies about Project Bluebeam. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2605.3999999999996s)]
*  And there's obviously a lot of these dumbs around the country where there's interesting technology and stuff. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2608.4s)]
*  But I got to think that something I think this is going to be a crazy year. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2615.0s)]
*  I think something, especially if it gets down to it and it looks like the Trump wave is going to, you know, because they can't roll out weekend at Bernie's and expect him to to be able to debate or actually carry a conversation. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2618.92s)]
*  That's the plan. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2633.1600000000003s)]
*  I think the plan is you wait until it becomes extremely obvious that Biden can't do it. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2633.92s)]
*  And then they pull him out. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2640.6s)]
*  And I think they probably put in Gavin Newsom. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2641.88s)]
*  That's what I hate. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2644.48s)]
*  He's hated, though, in California. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2644.96s)]
*  Yeah. But there's enough zombies out there that'll just blue no matter who. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2647.2400000000002s)]
*  And he's our guy. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2652.6400000000003s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2654.12s)]
*  They like no one could have had California. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2655.04s)]
*  There's just the population is too high. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2657.36s)]
*  And it's like, what are you going to do? [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2659.12s)]
*  And they'll come up with some sort of a reason and he'll move a little bit towards the middle. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2661.08s)]
*  He'll do some common sense things and get people go, all right, I like that. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2664.8799999999997s)]
*  And that'll be enough. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2668.68s)]
*  Well, any these anyone but Trump people, you know, look at the fucking view. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2670.7599999999998s)]
*  What we go over saying that he's going to you might be poor and you might be saying, well, maybe Donald Trump, Trump, he better for the guy. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2675.12s)]
*  He's got to put you in camps. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2681.16s)]
*  See, you're saying that. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2682.8399999999997s)]
*  No, but I'm surprised. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2683.64s)]
*  Put you in camps. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2685.2s)]
*  Nobody watches. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2686.3599999999997s)]
*  Crazy old ladies. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2688.04s)]
*  Crazy old ladies are home right now. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2689.24s)]
*  But instead of like if you look at the this two party system and go, who's the lesser of the two evils? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2691.64s)]
*  I would say, how about let's fuck the two party system and let's have some more options. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2699.52s)]
*  And one of them, in my opinion, is RFK, who's phenomenal. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2707.04s)]
*  Well, they kept him off the ballot. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2710.0s)]
*  They did. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2711.68s)]
*  They did a phenomenal job of making sure that he wasn't in the primaries the same way they were going to do with Bernie Sanders. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2712.24s)]
*  That's why he went independent. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2717.8s)]
*  But get him in a debate. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2719.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2720.52s)]
*  Why do we have to wait till fucking September for a debate? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2721.0s)]
*  Well, how about the fact that he won't debate, nor will Biden. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2723.28s)]
*  No one's debating. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2726.12s)]
*  This is the first time we've ever had a presidential election where neither the incumbent nor the main guy on the opposition is. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2727.12s)]
*  So Trump said he's not going to debate. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2735.2s)]
*  He's not debating anybody. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2736.84s)]
*  Why? [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2737.64s)]
*  He'd mop the floor. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2737.92s)]
*  He doesn't have to. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2738.96s)]
*  Yeah, I guess that's true. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2740.28s)]
*  So he's like, fuck you. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2741.2s)]
*  I'm not debating. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2741.84s)]
*  And also because they keep trying him. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2742.44s)]
*  They keep bringing him into court. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2744.44s)]
*  They keep. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2745.64s)]
*  There's all these cases that they keep bringing up. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2746.36s)]
*  They just lawsuit into oblivion. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2748.36s)]
*  You know, it's the whole thing is wild. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2751.6s)]
*  It just emboldens his followers. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2753.96s)]
*  Yeah, it does. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2755.44s)]
*  It has the exact opposite effect. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2756.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's a similar sort of playbook in a lot of ways to what they did during the pandemic, where the more they attack him, the more people like, what the fuck is true? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2758.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2769.1200000000003s)]
*  Because I don't believe you guys anymore. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2769.48s)]
*  And when you're going after him, I kind of think that you're just doing this because you don't want him to win. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2771.88s)]
*  And that's banana republic shit. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2776.32s)]
*  When you're prosecuting your political opponents specifically because you don't want your political opponents to be able to make it to the vote, that's banana republic shit. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2778.76s)]
*  That's that's what we're living in. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2788.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2789.6800000000003s)]
*  We have a captured media system. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2790.6400000000003s)]
*  We have a captured medicine system. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2793.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2796.7200000000003s)]
*  We have education system, captured education system. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2797.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2799.52s)]
*  Like, and we're Team America, World Police with bases all over the world. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2800.32s)]
*  It's every country on the southern and eastern border of Russia. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2805.5600000000004s)]
*  What I'm hoping is one of the things that's happened over the last few years specifically is the deterioration of the trust of media because of the access to information that people have now, where it's just undeniable. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2810.2400000000002s)]
*  At a certain point in time, they have to admit certain things like lab leak theory. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2824.96s)]
*  They have to admit certain things. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2828.36s)]
*  They're avoiding like the plague, this all cause mortality increase. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2829.84s)]
*  But enough people are aware of it. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2834.6800000000003s)]
*  Enough people know people that have been vaccine injured. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2836.32s)]
*  Enough people know people that have died. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2839.04s)]
*  Enough people know young people that have had heart attacks where it's there's enough suspicion and there's enough pause where people are reconsidering. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2840.52s)]
*  And then there's been this silent shift to the center of people that were like radically left friends of mine that I had in California that were fucking so left, far left. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2850.4s)]
*  And now they're like ready to vote Republican. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2860.7200000000003s)]
*  They're literally ready to vote Republican because they don't want this anymore because they see where this is going. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2863.1200000000003s)]
*  My hope is that with AI and with even more access to information because the information just streams and it moves on and innovation moves on no matter what we do, that it's going to get to a point where lying is virtually impossible. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2867.6s)]
*  And I think that's where this kind of emergent technology leads us to unless some other superpower gets a hold of it before we do. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2885.2s)]
*  But don't you think one of the I agree with the other percent. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2893.92s)]
*  I would just say with AI, haven't we seen enough examples already of some hardwired coding of information that is like a little bit woke? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2896.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we have. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2908.2400000000002s)]
*  We have. But then there's grok, which is Elon's AI, which is the opposite of that. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2910.36s)]
*  I haven't seen that. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2915.76s)]
*  I haven't used it either. But the idea is that it's supposedly the antidote to that. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2916.88s)]
*  I think there's enough people that don't want that. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2920.6800000000003s)]
*  And it just as time goes on, look, even the fucking New York Times wrote a major story about detransitioners. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2923.04s)]
*  So people that were convinced at an early age that they were trans and now they're detransitioning and their lives are ruined, their bodies ruined, they can't have children anymore. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2930.1600000000003s)]
*  They lost their breasts. They lost their penis. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2939.32s)]
*  In fucking sanity. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2942.7200000000003s)]
*  They just took they just had an eight year old kid that was taken away from his father because the father doesn't want the boy to be on hormone blockers. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=2944.16s)]

*  I mean if I had some sort of a super sophisticated [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6191.64s)]
*  drone technology that is above and beyond what we [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6196.04s)]
*  think of in terms of what's technologically [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6201.16s)]
*  available today I would say it's UFOs too. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6203.76s)]
*  I would say you know we've out of this world [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6206.92s)]
*  craft. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6209.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6210.92s)]
*  Yeah but some of that is reverse engineered stuff. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6211.48s)]
*  Could be right. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6215.96s)]
*  That's what it could be. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6216.96s)]
*  Or there could be a branch of physics. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6219.08s)]
*  This is what Eric Weinstein is theorized. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6221.28s)]
*  And the way he talks about it it's quite brilliant. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6223.28s)]
*  And he talks about this one particular college in [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6225.599999999999s)]
*  New York one particular university that has an [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6227.92s)]
*  insane physics department. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6230.04s)]
*  And it's also connected to this hedge fund that [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6231.68s)]
*  does like Bernie Madoff numbers that don't seem [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6233.64s)]
*  to make sense. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6237.04s)]
*  But so that would be a great way to get money for [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6238.12s)]
*  these things. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6240.84s)]
*  And that you have this insane physics department [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6241.76s)]
*  so you have these people. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6243.92s)]
*  They if you talk like that's one of the things [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6244.76s)]
*  that Diana Pasolko talked about in her book about [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6247.72s)]

*  involved in these crash retrieval programs and [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6252.04s)]
*  supposedly involved in these back engineering [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6254.64s)]
*  programs. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6257.08s)]
*  The the amount of secrecy and their adherence to [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6258.24s)]
*  secrecy is spectacular. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6261.08s)]
*  And this idea that people can't keep secrets for [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6263.24s)]
*  the fuck they can't. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6265.2s)]
*  People who can keep secrets. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6266.639999999999s)]
*  What do you what do you think is the ultimate [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6268.5199999999995s)]
*  reason for that because there's a lot of ideas on [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6271.0s)]
*  why they can't release it because like Roswell and [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6273.4s)]
*  there's been a number of different types of Roswell [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6275.28s)]
*  which whether that was E.T.'s that we interacted [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6277.44s)]
*  with whether there's some sort of alliance between [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6281.44s)]
*  other you know alien extraterrestrial races. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6284.48s)]
*  And what do you think is the major fear around not [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6288.0s)]
*  releasing that. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6290.64s)]
*  Well I think there's a bunch of fears. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6291.72s)]
*  First of all someone is going to be held responsible [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6293.4s)]
*  for misallocation of funds. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6297.04s)]
*  So let's say that you have defense spending of [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6299.68s)]
*  some private company which is by the way which they [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6304.76s)]
*  all think it's private companies that are involved [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6307.52s)]
*  in defense companies that are involved in this [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6310.32s)]
*  research. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6312.52s)]
*  Like the Lockheed. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6312.84s)]
*  Yeah which are much better at keeping secrets. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6313.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6316.360000000001s)]
*  You know then the government is and that if you [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6316.84s)]
*  have a misallocation of funds and you've lied to [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6321.0s)]
*  Congress like someone goes to jail for that. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6324.68s)]
*  You were talking about laundering essentially could [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6327.8s)]
*  be hundreds of millions if not billions and billions [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6332.0s)]
*  of dollars over decades. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6335.16s)]
*  So who made these decisions. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6337.320000000001s)]
*  Did they make the decision. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6338.8s)]
*  Did Congress not know about it. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6339.96s)]
*  So if they didn't know about it they're going to [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6342.04s)]
*  want to know about it. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6343.56s)]
*  And if they find out that you've been lying to them [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6344.320000000001s)]
*  all this time well guess what you're going to jail. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6346.0s)]
*  So who's going to jail. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6348.04s)]
*  Who misallocated funds. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6349.84s)]
*  Where the funds go. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6351.6s)]
*  Was any of that funds filtered. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6352.8s)]
*  Did anybody get wildly rich during this time. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6354.120000000001s)]
*  Was there some skimming like we think is going on [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6357.76s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6359.72s)]
*  It was there. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6360.92s)]

*  Nobody. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6370.400000000001s)]

*  Right. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6372.8s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6419.04s)]
*  So Diana Pasolka's work what they're talking about [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6419.36s)]
*  is not even necessarily something from another [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6422.4s)]

*  maybe something. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6427.16s)]
*  No maybe something that's from another dimension [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6428.400000000001s)]
*  maybe something that's hyper advanced that has the [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6431.2s)]

*  pleases can go in and out. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6439.96s)]
*  So it's basically here all the time we just can't [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6441.8s)]
*  see it because it's multi-dimensional. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6443.400000000001s)]

*  It's something. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6446.32s)]
*  And then also I mean some again this is what Bob [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6447.2s)]

*  people that live in a prehistoric civilization. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6852.66s)]
*  That's probably how you would describe it. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6855.94s)]
*  Especially if you're telling this story over and over again. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6857.86s)]
*  It's passed down generation to generation, and someone writes it down in ancient Hebrew [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6860.38s)]
*  or in Aramaic, and then it has to get translated into Latin and into Greek, and then eventually [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6864.66s)]
*  to English. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6869.34s)]
*  I mean, the whole thing is nuts. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6870.34s)]
*  And the Vimanas, the ancient Hindu texts that talk about them. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6873.46s)]
*  And the hieroglyphs, too. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6877.26s)]
*  There's a ton of examples of that. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6879.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's likely that they've always been here. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6882.66s)]
*  And it might be connected somehow or another to our minds. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6885.54s)]
*  The mind which produces psychedelic chemicals might also be a gateway to other dimensions. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6889.66s)]
*  Whatever you experience when you experience dimethyltryptamine, which we know is produced [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6896.14s)]
*  by the brain, which is the key component of ayahuasca, you experience entities. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6900.46s)]
*  You experience exactly what they're talking about there. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6904.54s)]
*  So what is that? [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6907.82s)]
*  Do we just dismiss that as hallucination? [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6909.259999999999s)]
*  I think we legalize it and promote it and encourage people to do it. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6911.54s)]
*  And then the aliens come. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6914.78s)]
*  And then we realize they've been here all along. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6915.78s)]
*  I think they've probably been here all along. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6918.219999999999s)]
*  I think they're probably here right now. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6919.7s)]
*  They're just not here here. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6920.94s)]
*  They're just not here here. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6921.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6922.94s)]
*  But they're part of this. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6923.94s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6924.94s)]
*  We just have a very limited ability to see. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6925.94s)]
*  Do you think they're benevolent? [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6927.74s)]
*  Probably not. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6929.94s)]
*  No. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6930.94s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6931.94s)]
*  I think progress requires a lot of chaos. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6933.94s)]
*  I think human beings in particular, innovative, creative creatures, have to have something [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6937.42s)]
*  to battle against to become their better selves. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6943.86s)]
*  We find that in human beings. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6947.02s)]
*  I think it's probably a universal rule as far as how progress gets perpetrated. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6948.86s)]
*  It probably gets created through battle. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6956.58s)]
*  And not just like battle, like war. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6960.3s)]
*  I mean, like battle, like conflict, like competition. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6961.78s)]
*  It seems to be that's the key driver of innovation in our world, is this sort of competition [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6965.58s)]
*  with each other, which is a form of conflict in a lot of ways. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6971.74s)]
*  You're battling the other competitors to see who can push each other the furthest and get [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6975.42s)]
*  to the greatest discovery quickest. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6979.58s)]
*  There's got to be some benevolent races though, if there's multiple races of... [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6982.7s)]
*  Perhaps. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6986.86s)]
*  But perhaps benevolence is just like our desire for ultimate peace. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6987.86s)]
*  We have this ridiculous idea that you can have good with no evil. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6991.86s)]
*  And there's no real evidence for that. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6998.219999999999s)]
*  I agree. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=6999.66s)]
*  There's no real evidence as far as human society. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7000.66s)]
*  There's been utopian groups of people that have figured it out for short periods of time. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7003.54s)]
*  But there's circumstances that lead to utopian groups of primates. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7008.38s)]
*  Robert Sapolsky discovered this group of orangutans that had been... [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7012.42s)]
*  Excuse me, baboons that had been eating out of garbage that was in a resort. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7017.5s)]
*  And the alpha males, the most vicious, got to eat the food first. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7023.78s)]
*  Then they wiped them out, right? [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7027.22s)]
*  Yeah, they were poisoned. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7028.62s)]
*  So the only ones that survived were the beta males. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7029.9s)]
*  And the beta males created this really peaceful society and it lasted for a long time. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7031.78s)]
*  So we've got to wipe out the alpha males. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7036.66s)]
*  The meek will inherit the earth. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7038.18s)]
*  I mean, that might be with all this fucking LBGT, IQA, but that's not true necessarily [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7041.18s)]
*  because they're not peaceful. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7046.38s)]
*  Like Antifa and all those people, they're some of the most violent counterculture groups [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7049.22s)]
*  that we've ever seen. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7053.1s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know about the meek inherit in the earth. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7054.1s)]
*  I think that might be taken quite some day out of context. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7056.74s)]
*  But it's sort of like kind of what's going on with the creators of technology. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7059.54s)]
*  Think about who's controlling the narrative in this world. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7064.02s)]
*  The narrative is essentially being controlled other than by X, because Elon has essentially [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7066.74s)]
*  thrown a monkey wrench into the gears of where all this stuff was going. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7071.18s)]
*  It was all adhering to a very specific ideology. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7074.78s)]
*  There was no real, like no real prevalent right wing online technological creation like [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7077.7s)]
*  a Google or a Facebook or a YouTube or a Twitter or all these things. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7088.38s)]
*  Instagram, all these things are controlled by leftists, every single one of them. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7093.46s)]
*  And they tend to be the most feminized, the least masculine, the least at least outwardly [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7098.78s)]
*  aggressive. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7104.52s)]
*  You know, they promote things like toxic masculinity and they demonize what's, you know, characteristics [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7105.52s)]
*  of masculine behavior. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7114.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's... [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7116.4800000000005s)]
*  They're the meek. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7117.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they're kind of the meek, right? [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7119.88s)]
*  They're the nerds. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7122.52s)]
*  And the nerds are the ones who create this kind of technology. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7123.72s)]
*  And they're the ones that are in control of this technology. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7126.400000000001s)]
*  It's not sustainable. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7128.72s)]
*  Well, it's definitely not, because China's not that way. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7129.72s)]
*  And they're ruthless. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7133.639999999999s)]
*  And if they get control of the same type of technology, we will see the same sort of results [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7134.84s)]
*  that they have in their society, which is a centralized digital currency. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7140.0s)]
*  Social credit score. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7143.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7144.92s)]
*  And then we're fucked. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7145.92s)]
*  How do you feel talking about all this stuff, being this prominent public figure who's a [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7149.16s)]
*  revered athlete, you know, like... [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7154.84s)]
*  Less revered now. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7157.639999999999s)]
*  Well, not really. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7158.639999999999s)]
*  Not when you kick ass. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7159.639999999999s)]
*  They let all that shit go. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7160.639999999999s)]
*  All that COVID shit they let go. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7161.639999999999s)]
*  I was COVID MVP. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7163.12s)]
*  I was two-time MVP during COVID. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7164.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7166.12s)]
*  They had to shut the fuck up when it comes down to the performance. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7167.12s)]
*  And then over time, I think a lot of people that demonized you, especially the fans, they [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7171.240000000001s)]
*  realized you were right. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7174.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7175.56s)]
*  Well, I don't think all of them will entirely admit that. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7176.56s)]
*  In the back of their head, they know you weren't nearly as nutty as they thought you were. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7181.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7184.56s)]
*  I mean, I think it's more research comes out. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7185.56s)]
*  There's more papers published in very reputable scientific publications that talk about, you [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7187.0s)]
*  know, all the things that I was kind of stopping for and talking about. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7194.04s)]
*  I think in the end, you're on a decision. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7198.68s)]
*  You stand for something. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7202.36s)]
*  You stand courageously for what you believe in. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7204.76s)]
*  Or the opposite side of that is either saying nothing or being a coward. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7207.24s)]
*  And I wasn't willing to do that. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7213.52s)]
*  Say whatever you want about the way I went about doing it. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7217.080000000001s)]
*  In the end, I made a decision that was best for me. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7221.660000000001s)]
*  And I'm going to continue talking about this stuff because it's important to me. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7224.160000000001s)]
*  And I don't want the memories to be lost. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7227.64s)]
*  I don't want what I went through to get brushed over. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7232.72s)]
*  And also, I don't give a fuck. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7237.56s)]
*  You know, I've been able to make a ton of money playing a sport that I'm really good [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7239.6s)]
*  at and I'm thankful for that. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7243.04s)]
*  I have a platform. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7245.88s)]
*  Some people want you to just shut up and throw a football. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7247.56s)]
*  And that's fine. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7251.24s)]
*  But I think there has to be certain voices of reason. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7252.4800000000005s)]
*  And many people say I'm an idiot. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7255.6s)]
*  I don't have I'm not smart. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7257.24s)]
*  I got attacked for my intelligence levels, which is an interesting angle to attack me [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7258.84s)]
*  on. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7262.64s)]
*  There's a lot of things you can say about me, but that's an interesting angle to go. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7263.64s)]
*  But in the end, I believe that what I did and what I stand for is is a tough position [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7267.28s)]

*  give other people the permission to stand up as well, because there's a lot of people [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7282.48s)]
*  that believe a lot of the things that I believe in that don't have the opportunity to do it, [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7286.36s)]
*  don't have the courage to do it, don't have the platform to do it in. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7291.12s)]
*  And I feel like I can speak for some of those people and hold the line for some of those [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7294.2s)]
*  people, regardless of what kind of crosshairs that's put that puts me in with certain media [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7297.68s)]
*  members. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7301.96s)]
*  You know, they want to shut me down on being on Mac fee. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7302.96s)]
*  They want to shut me up from. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7305.08s)]
*  Well, that was the Kimmel thing, right? [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7306.76s)]
*  Well, no, they were talking for that. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7308.16s)]
*  Have you ever talked to him? [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7309.96s)]
*  I've been on the show. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7311.0s)]
*  Yeah. Years ago. Yeah. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7312.12s)]
*  Would you do would you ever have a conversation with him in person? [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7317.08s)]
*  Of course. Yeah, of course. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7320.04s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, they wanted me on to be on a show in the summertime after I got traded. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7322.16s)]
*  Really? [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7328.0s)]
*  There, you know, obviously been some things that he had said about me that made me go, [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7329.36s)]
*  I don't know if I want to do that. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7332.72s)]
*  I'd rather, you know, maybe have a side conversation first, iron some things out. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7333.92s)]
*  Well, also, I don't think that conversation is a conversation that should be held in front [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7338.2s)]
*  of an audience in five minute chunks like they do on television. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7343.32s)]
*  Yeah. That's a conversation that you have to let air out. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7348.24s)]
*  I want to know why you think the way you think him, you know, sit down with Jimmy. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7350.68s)]
*  Why do you think the way you think? [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7355.12s)]
*  Why would you think that it's OK to say that it's a real simple thing? [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7356.6s)]
*  The people that have been vaccinated, you treat them and the people that took horse goo, [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7362.280000000001s)]
*  you know, rest in peace, wheezy. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7369.16s)]
*  Really? Is that really how you feel? [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7371.6s)]
*  Like people that are sick from a disease that was created in a fucking lab that was funded [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7374.0s)]
*  by our own tax dollars. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7379.24s)]
*  That's how you feel like those people should just die because they don't trust the government [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7381.36s)]
*  or they don't trust the pharmaceutical and just real complex that's been responsible [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7385.4s)]
*  for lying so many fucking times. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7389.2s)]
*  They're literally criminal organizations that have some of the biggest criminal fines in [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7391.72s)]
*  the history of this country. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7398.24s)]
*  And that all of a sudden, they're the ones we're supposed to trust. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7400.32s)]
*  The liberals were always the ones that were anti big pharma. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7404.04s)]
*  They were always the ones that had no trust in the government. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7408.36s)]
*  Anti big banks. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7410.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, anti big banks. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7411.799999999999s)]
*  All that. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7413.2s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, all of a sudden the ideology shifts because so many people [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7414.2s)]
*  are compromised by this very thing that we were talking about before. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7419.48s)]
*  The very thing that they use to control the media in terms of the news, they use it to [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7422.4s)]
*  control the media in terms of late night talk shows and monologues as well. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7426.96s)]
*  It's the same influence because they're the same sponsors, the same people are spending [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7430.5199999999995s)]
*  the same money on the same networks. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7435.6s)]
*  And it has an impact. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7438.240000000001s)]
*  If it affects your livelihood and affects your future and your ability to do this thing [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7439.76s)]
*  that you love doing, which is hosting a talk show, and you're doing it on a network that [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7443.8s)]
*  is paid for by that money. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7448.360000000001s)]
*  Guess what? [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7451.4400000000005s)]
*  That affects you. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7452.4400000000005s)]
*  If you don't think it affects you, look what they did with the number one guy on TV news, [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7453.68s)]
*  Tucker Carlson. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7458.88s)]
*  They fired him. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7459.96s)]
*  He was the number one guy. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7461.52s)]
*  And they're like, you're getting too crazy. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7464.5599999999995s)]
*  See ya. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7467.5199999999995s)]
*  You're asking too many questions. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7468.5199999999995s)]
*  Too many questions. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7469.839999999999s)]
*  You're getting a little too nutty. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7470.839999999999s)]
*  All this talk about the CIA definitely killed Kennedy and all the talk, all the things. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7472.5599999999995s)]
*  And now you look at that guy. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7478.32s)]
*  Now he's wild. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7480.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7481.0s)]
*  What they've done now is it's like, what a fucking mistake firing that guy. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7482.0s)]
*  You should have kept him there and contained him. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7486.919999999999s)]
*  Like the letting that guy go loose and do his own show. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7489.879999999999s)]
*  Unless you kill him, it's not like people are going to stop listening. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7493.72s)]
*  They're going to be fascinated. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7496.52s)]
*  And the impressions, the amount of people watching this stuff, it's crazy. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7497.88s)]
*  It's way bigger now. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7502.32s)]
*  His show is way bigger than it ever was before. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7503.32s)]
*  A lot of people, they don't even have cable packets. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7506.56s)]
*  They have a couple streaming services. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7508.52s)]
*  Now you've got a fucking app. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7510.4800000000005s)]
*  You can watch his shit whenever you want. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7511.4800000000005s)]
*  Anytime you want. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7513.44s)]
*  Imagine that conversation that he had with that guy about Ozempic. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7514.88s)]
*  Imagine that being on Fox News. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7518.76s)]
*  You can't imagine it. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7520.4s)]
*  No chance. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7521.4s)]
*  There's no fucking way. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7522.839999999999s)]
*  But it goes back to what he said in it, is that they pay to control the message. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7523.839999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7527.24s)]
*  They get some other advantages about pushing their medicine, but they don't need any other [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7528.24s)]
*  help. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7533.639999999999s)]

*  It keeps them from mass media or corporate media scrutiny. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7536.759999999999s)]
*  Be careful. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7539.799999999999s)]
*  Because if you look at the amount of percentage of their budgets that are paid for by pharma, [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7540.799999999999s)]
*  it's pretty wild. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7548.679999999999s)]
*  It's a lot of money. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7549.679999999999s)]
*  How much Bill Gates has put into all the different media stuff. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7551.04s)]

*  And why the fuck did that term even come into existence? [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7597.08s)]

*  And it's not just great conversations with the boner from Alaska or what's her name, [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7650.04s)]
*  who does the traffic show, which is fucking awesome. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7655.360000000001s)]
*  But you give a platform to people who are... [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7657.84s)]
*  Yeah, she's amazing. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7660.0s)]
*  She's amazing. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7661.0s)]
*  But this gives me hope because more people listen to this than fucking watch any news [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7662.12s)]
*  stuff. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7665.4s)]
*  So they're getting real information from interesting people who are experts in their field about [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7666.4s)]
*  stuff. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7670.8s)]
*  But what hope can we have that shit's going to get better? [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7671.8s)]
*  My hope is literally that technology will make it impossible to lie. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7676.04s)]
*  I really think that's the battle. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7682.24s)]
*  The battle is between people that are trying to limit our access to the truth and technology, [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7684.6s)]
*  which essentially illuminates all ignorance. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7690.64s)]
*  As this technology progresses and is essentially right now at a runaway train pace, kind of [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7694.120000000001s)]
*  out of control, and it's been... [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7700.92s)]
*  There's this understanding that we have to continue in this path because if we don't, [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7703.8s)]
*  China gets there first, we're fucked. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7709.160000000001s)]
*  If Russia gets there first, we're fucked. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7710.4400000000005s)]
*  And so we're guns blazing towards this thing that will dissolve all access to information. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7712.280000000001s)]
*  It will dissolve all boundaries, rather, to access to information. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7719.08s)]
*  They won't exist anymore. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7722.5199999999995s)]
*  You'll have the ability to understand the inner workings of everything. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7724.28s)]
*  And that transparency will make it increasingly difficult for them to fuck us. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7728.76s)]
*  And they're going to have to adjust accordingly. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7734.44s)]
*  And then also people are going to die. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7736.12s)]
*  The old people, the old guard, they're going to die off. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7738.44s)]
*  When you see... [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7741.2s)]
*  What's the fucking dude's name that looks like a turtle? [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7743.2s)]
*  Soros? [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7745.48s)]
*  No, the old dude. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7746.48s)]
*  Mitch McConnell. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7747.48s)]
*  When he's locked up, those guys are going to die. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7748.5599999999995s)]
*  It's a human reality. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7752.799999999999s)]
*  You're a finite life form. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7754.48s)]
*  You only have so much time. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7755.48s)]
*  You can only rob the world of so much before eventually your heart stops ticking. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7756.879999999999s)]
*  And then the new people, as they come into place, these are people that are... [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7761.759999999999s)]
*  They're growing up with the internet. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7766.04s)]
*  It's a different understanding and reality of life itself. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7768.0s)]
*  But don't you think there has to be some sort of field of value that can orient people into [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7772.28s)]
*  Hey, let's do things a little bit better because these things actually matter. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7776.64s)]
*  There is right and wrong. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7780.4400000000005s)]
*  There is morality. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7781.4400000000005s)]
*  There is certain... [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7782.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, the problem with living in a secular society and living in a society [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7783.4400000000005s)]
*  that has a lot of people that are atheists, that have no belief system at all, is you [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7791.56s)]
*  find a belief system. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7795.72s)]
*  And that's a lot of these people that call themselves atheists or they've subscribed [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7797.68s)]
*  to the religion of woke. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7801.88s)]
*  Their God is equity and inclusiveness. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7804.32s)]
*  Their God is this ideology that they think that you have to subscribe to. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7806.96s)]
*  And that's why it's spooky because people, human beings seem to have a very strong desire [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7810.82s)]
*  for some sort of order and form and some sort of pattern that they can follow that seems [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7819.12s)]
*  to be the right way to go. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7825.04s)]
*  And they can be led by cults. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7826.44s)]
*  They can be led by groups of people. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7828.96s)]
*  They can be led by intolerant governments and evil armies and corrupt politicians. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7830.5599999999995s)]
*  They can be led. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7838.44s)]
*  But I think as time rolls on, people are going to understand the need to have some sort of [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7839.799999999999s)]
*  divine structure to things, some sort of belief in the sanctity of love and of truth. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7847.2s)]
*  And a lot of that comes from religion. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7855.32s)]
*  A lot of people's moral compass and the guidelines that they've used to follow, to live a just [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7858.3s)]
*  and righteous life, has come from religion. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7865.22s)]
*  And unfortunately, a lot of very intelligent people, they dismiss all the positive aspects [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7868.26s)]
*  of religion because they think that the stories are mere superstitious fairy tales, that they [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7875.22s)]
*  have no place in this modern world and we're inherently good and your ethics are based [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7882.1s)]
*  on your old moral compass and we all have one. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7887.2s)]
*  And that's not necessarily true because you see the way people behave in war. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7889.5199999999995s)]
*  They don't have any moral compass. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7894.12s)]
*  They're just fucking murderers and killers. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7895.28s)]
*  And we've asked people in service of our country to go to these places and behave like murderers [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7896.92s)]
*  and killers and then reintegrate into society, right back into society and be a good person [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7903.32s)]
*  again. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7908.12s)]
*  And they don't know how to do it. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7908.679999999999s)]
*  And they go crazy. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7909.679999999999s)]
*  And there's a lot of them. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7910.72s)]
*  A lot of them who come back and they don't. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7911.639999999999s)]
*  Their down is up and up is down. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7913.24s)]
*  They don't know what the fuck to do. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7915.639999999999s)]
*  And we don't help them out. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7916.2s)]
*  We don't help them out on the suicide rate. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7917.2s)]
*  Suicide is the, I think, is it the number one killer of veterans? [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7919.32s)]
*  Pretty sure. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7924.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7924.8s)]
*  Yeah, but. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7927.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's a fucked up world we live in. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7928.4s)]
*  We need Jesus. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7930.08s)]
*  I think for real. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7933.0s)]
*  Like if you came back now, it'd be great. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7934.2s)]
*  Like Jesus, if you're thinking about coming back. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7935.599999999999s)]
*  Right now? [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7938.08s)]
*  Now's a good time. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7938.5599999999995s)]
*  Pretty soon. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7939.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7939.679999999999s)]
*  Now's a good time. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7940.0s)]
*  We're kind of fucked. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7940.88s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of people who think that might be coming. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7942.0s)]
*  Well, it might be. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7944.679999999999s)]
*  Mark of the beast. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7946.0s)]
*  That might be the aliens. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7946.72s)]
*  I mean, that might be what all this stuff is. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7948.2s)]
*  It might be we reach a certain point where we're so unmanageable and so [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7951.52s)]
*  chaotic that something comes down and gives us a guideline. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7956.48s)]
*  I mean, this is what Moses essentially experienced, supposedly, right? [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7961.04s)]
*  When he came back with his Ten Commandments. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7964.72s)]
*  This is supposedly what these people that have had these religious visions. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7966.8s)]
*  What are they? [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7972.48s)]
*  None of the religious visions. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7973.28s)]
*  Oh, my God, we're fucked. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7975.0s)]
*  All the religious visions were there's a way to do this. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7976.56s)]
*  There's a guide. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7980.400000000001s)]
*  There's a way to follow. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7981.64s)]
*  And there's a greater power that's above everything that controls this whole thing [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7983.4800000000005s)]
*  and keeps it all together. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7989.08s)]
*  And there's laws to adhere that will make for a much better life for all humans, [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7990.2s)]
*  all life on Earth. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7996.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's hope. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7998.28s)]
*  Hope is a memory of the future. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=7998.88s)]
*  You know, this shit matters. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8000.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8003.28s)]
*  It does matter. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8004.32s)]
*  Yeah, everything we do matters. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8004.96s)]
*  I think if you know, atheists, I think, can find their own religion. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8006.24s)]
*  It might be religion of science or religion of climate change or whatever [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8009.799999999999s)]
*  it might be. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8013.679999999999s)]
*  But but to not believe in a higher power means that really nothing I do matters. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8014.08s)]
*  Ultimately, I live, I die. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8018.12s)]
*  That's it. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8019.799999999999s)]
*  You know, so whatever purpose you might have, it's short lived. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8020.679999999999s)]
*  It's just for this. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8024.639999999999s)]
*  There's there's nothing else going on. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8025.4s)]
*  I have a hard time with that because I believe there's a seen world and unseen [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8028.12s)]
*  world and there's forces of good and forces of evil and that there's a [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8031.04s)]
*  purpose for all this. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8034.24s)]
*  And there's, you know, there's a lot of reasons why we're doing this. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8035.24s)]
*  There's a lot of opportunities to do this. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8039.28s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8081.36s)]

*  I'm not accusing Mr. Klaus Schwab of being on Epstein's Island. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8083.8s)]
*  Why did you bring up Jimmy Kimmel when that whole thing was going on? [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8087.32s)]
*  I had said on the McAfee show before they had talked about, you know, forever, [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8090.639999999999s)]
*  they talked about releasing the Epstein list or whatever. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8096.16s)]

*  And he had got on his show and called me a tin foil hat wearing, you know, [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8100.44s)]
*  doofus who is talking about, you know, I thought he had said that I'm an idiot [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8106.4s)]

*  That the list was going to get released, I guess. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8116.96s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know what it was. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8121.88s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8124.04s)]
*  Why would anybody defend the people that apparently were on that list? [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8124.64s)]
*  Because it is a real list. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8129.68s)]
*  There was something about. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8130.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, there was something, a conversation that Pat was having about [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8131.32s)]
*  about this list coming out and we were talking about as a distraction [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8135.6s)]
*  to something else. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8139.0s)]
*  And I and I was referring to the list being that there being a list and it coming out. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8139.76s)]
*  He might have said, might have been thinking that I was trying to connect [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8144.639999999999s)]
*  a distraction that was going on with a list being released. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8149.24s)]
*  So I just said, you know. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8153.28s)]
*  So when you were saying that he doesn't want that list to come out, [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8155.5599999999995s)]

*  No, no. OK. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8159.599999999999s)]
*  See, that was a lot of people if they saw it out of context. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8161.36s)]
*  Nobody watched the fucking clip. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8164.2s)]
*  That's why they just saw a headline. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8165.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, it's the anti-vax guy again. Let's fucking hammer. Right. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8167.68s)]
*  But if someone saw that out of context, you could see how [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8170.5599999999995s)]
*  and I thought that you were saying, oh, I saw it out of context. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8174.12s)]
*  I thought that you were saying that Jimmy Kimmel was on that list [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8177.64s)]
*  because a lot of celebrities were on that list. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8180.44s)]
*  Well, the list hasn't even been released yet. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8182.84s)]

*  that's a big fucking accusation that I wouldn't make. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8207.64s)]

*  He said he's been murdered. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8420.0s)]
*  By the way, your dog's been farting like crazy. Is he? [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8421.0s)]
*  Oh, Marshall, what are you doing? [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8423.72s)]
*  I'm farting. I was I don't want you to think that was me. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8426.16s)]
*  He's smells like he farts some sort of he's a dog. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8429.04s)]
*  Yeah. Dogs fart or something. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8433.52s)]
*  That's good. No, he didn't eat any Asian food. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8435.08s)]
*  He eats he eats raw food. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8436.68s)]
*  Boy, that changed. By the way, folks, feed your dog real food. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8438.64s)]
*  So many people are feeding their dog kibble. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8442.52s)]
*  That's tough. The reason why I can sit on a shelf for so long [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8444.6s)]
*  is because it's not real food. It's garbage. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8447.76s)]
*  What do you feed him? [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8449.72s)]
*  Because I'm about to get a dog. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8450.88s)]
*  So I feed him something called Maeve. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8451.92s)]
*  M-A-E-V. It's frozen raw food. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8455.199999999999s)]
*  So it's frozen meat and it has [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8458.960000000001s)]
*  it has vegetables in it and like blueberries and stuff like that. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8462.2s)]
*  And man, he gobbles it up and it's changed his body. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8466.16s)]
*  He lost a ton of weight. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8469.32s)]
*  He was getting kind of thick, unfortunately, and I'd exercise him a lot. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8470.68s)]
*  And he but, you know, give him what he wants to eat. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8474.08s)]
*  And he eats a lot of it. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8476.88s)]
*  And then you're like, is this stuff good for you? [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8478.52s)]
*  It's expensive. This is the best dog food. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8480.12s)]
*  It says dog food. It says the purest ingredients. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8482.24s)]
*  But if you could just sit on a shelf, how you wouldn't eat that. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8484.960000000001s)]
*  Like if you eat pop tarts forever, your body is going to fall apart. Right. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8487.96s)]
*  And a lot of dogs are getting cancer these days. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8491.96s)]
*  So there's a company called a farmers dog. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8494.08s)]
*  And Jamie feeds his dog that it's all real food, too. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8497.0s)]
*  There's quite a few companies that do that now. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8500.519999999999s)]
*  And what it is is just real food, real meat and real vegetables and stuff. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8502.64s)]
*  And man, it's changed his energy level. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8509.4s)]
*  He was getting like gray hairs in his face. They went away. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8511.64s)]
*  It's like he went backwards in time. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8514.16s)]
*  Have you got him on the red light bed yet? [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8516.44s)]
*  No, no, no, no. He gets a lot of exercise, though. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8518.28s)]
*  He's got a nice big yard. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8521.160000000002s)]
*  We we always throw the ball to him for quite a while before I take him here. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8522.28s)]
*  So he's tired him out a little bit. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8526.28s)]
*  Yeah. Whenever you take him somewhere, you got to like wear him out first. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8528.2s)]
*  He's unfortunately he's not good on a leash. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8531.640000000001s)]
*  Marshall's quite a polar. But I can see that. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8534.28s)]
*  He's just fucking he's got a lot of energy. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8536.960000000001s)]
*  He's enthusiastic dog. But he's the best. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8538.6s)]
*  He's such a sweet dog. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8540.880000000001s)]
*  And you see him like everybody he meets is his best friend. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8541.84s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and everybody loves him. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8544.4s)]
*  So he's just used to how we bonded pretty quick. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8546.08s)]
*  He's like, run my belly. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8547.92s)]
*  Yeah. As soon as he sees me, he drops down. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8548.92s)]
*  It's like, you want to rub me? Yeah. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8550.76s)]
*  A big smile on his face. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8552.68s)]
*  He's walking the ground with this deal. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8554.8s)]
*  I'm sorry. He's farting on you, though. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8556.76s)]
*  That's all good. I love dogs. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rqfCDZlGc&t=8558.199999999999s)]
