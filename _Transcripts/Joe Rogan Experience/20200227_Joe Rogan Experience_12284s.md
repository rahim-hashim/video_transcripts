*  yeah Nashville or Denver for me yeah when I think about it I think about a couple places I think of
*  Salt Lake City like like Park City like that area I think of that just but that I would never live
*  there full-time just cuz my family like skiing I think of Montana I think of Bozeman Montana I
*  love Bozeman yeah just cuz the mountains and the beauty you ski though I do but reluctantly yeah
*  I only ski cuz they like it it'll mess up your knees man I fucked up my knee this that's what I'm
*  saying to her some and it wasn't even my fault man this lady slid she was a newbie she didn't know
*  what the fuck she was doing and she was she was trying to put her shit on she slid right into the
*  trail right when I was coming around this corner I'm like goddamn it I knew if I hit her she was a
*  goner yeah that bitch was gonna get broken up I almost so I went around her and I wiped out and
*  I got a fracture of my shin actually really yeah I've got something called an insufficiency
*  fracture it's like where your my shin bone hits my cartilage it's fairly lucky really cuz it just
*  requires like six to eight weeks of doing not much so no running for me I just been hiking with
*  my dog and I lift weights it's not you know it lets me know every now and then like hey fuckface
*  settle down but I've been doing yoga but doing a lot of my normal stuff I can't kick the bag but
*  it's not bad it's not bad as injuries go it'll heal up I skied once and I almost took out four
*  kids oh Jesus yeah like literally would have killed those kids I couldn't stop I couldn't
*  stop no you're a big guy I'm a big guy so I was going at these four kids and their parents were
*  screaming oh my and I just wound it up like rolling down the hill oh my god and so I was
*  like all right I'm done like I don't ever need to ski again because the key is to stay on those
*  green ones stay on the easy bit I was on an easy one the easy baby ones are so much better
*  and my kids my 11 year old is a fucking psycho she's like I want to do double black diamond she does
*  all the black ones all the black diamonds those are so hard man they're so but when you're like
*  fucking she's probably like 80 pounds I guess yeah it's not that bad you fall like nothing
*  happens they bounce right back up but you're also so low to the ground and you're made out
*  of rubber back then they're all they're all like flexible and shit when you're old bro you hit the
*  ground your backs like what it really bothered me is my head when I wiped I went around the corner
*  I went to try to get away from this lady I tried to turn around her and my skis went up and when I
*  went down I hit my head pretty fucking hard and I had a helmet on for sure but still even with a
*  helmet on your my bell got rung like I was dizzy and I was a little confused and disoriented for
*  like the rest of the day I definitely got rocked it was a fight I would have the doctor like checking
*  my eyes with a flashlight do you have you gotten concussions before oh yeah okay okay but then but
*  when we got him it wasn't a big deal they like oh go ahead go back in I've probably been hit in the
*  head a thousand times like I don't even know how many times I've been hitting the head from all the
*  days of sparring and fighting and I don't know how many times it's been a lot but that was a big
*  one like recent I haven't had a recent head injury like a recent bang of the head that's called
*  success you don't need to get hit in the head plan ahead yeah I mean I'm okay everything's fine but
*  it's um head injuries are very touch-and-go man very touch-and-go I still want to get checked out
*  because I got knocked out in a in football practice and this was in college at the
*  University of Arkansas and I played outside linebacker and a guard pulled and hit me right
*  here in the temple I was out I woke up in like ICU and I still get headaches I've always gotten
*  headaches all my life but you know I watch different programs I go they go hey are you
*  having headaches maybe you should go in to see a doctor and I'm like you know what maybe I should
*  get another MRI you know what's really crazy how many years people have been alive people been
*  alive I mean we've been human beings have been around for a quarter million more or more years
*  or it depended upon who you ask and how long have they really known about chronic traumatic
*  encephalopathy is that how you say it encephalopathy how do you say it yeah okay was it the ct the
*  doctor the movie concussion was not the guy that like discovered it well or I don't know if he's
*  the one that brought it to life yeah and he was the one who's I mean explaining how all of these
*  football players have it you know it's really interesting I saw an article about him that was
*  kind of shitting on him lately encephalopathy that's it chronic traumatic encephalopathy
*  neurodegenerative disease caused by repeated head injuries fucking hey man my parents threw me in
*  football when I was like eight years old so I was taking hits look at this symptoms may include
*  behavioral problems got that mood problems got that problems with thinking definitely got that
*  symptoms typically do not begin until years after the injuries check ct often gets worse over time
*  it can result in dementia why why is the guy getting shitted on his head oh there was an
*  article recently that was saying that um he is profiting off it's most likely someone trying to
*  discredit like have you noticed all the negative uh bernie sanders ads that or articles that have
*  been written lately like really crazy ones like saying uh calling him a climate change denialist
*  which is 100 not true yeah you know there's so many look here it is from scientist to salesman
*  how uh benet omalu doctor of concussion fame built a career on distorted science yeah I don't know
*  if what they're doing it's the washington post which is another one that read they there are also
*  the ones that ran that thing on bernie with climate change denial god damn it media anytime
*  there's so much horse shit going on in the news I can't watch it anymore it's it's just reading
*  it and watching it it's like so much of it is biased and distorted and they're trying to paint
*  a perception of someone instead of just just laying out the facts in an objective way it's just so much
*  of that going on now it's just I feel like it's a very unfortunate case but I feel like one of the
*  things that's happened is because of uh subscription models for newspapers things like washington post
*  new york times they have to be outrageous like sometimes in my google news feed I'll get a story
*  and I'll click on it and then it'll say to subscribe go here oh I'll fuck you because so
*  they got me to click on it with the click baity shit and I bet you know one out of a hundred or
*  whatever will follow through and give them the credit card information and subscribe but they're
*  they're almost starving to death someone told me that the new york times only survives because of
*  their podcast now oh it's the daily yeah the daily is I used to listen to it a lot but uh
*  it's a thing where I think news when we watch news it's it's more salacious than entertainment
*  news I remember you know they they're all about the headlines and here's what like they just had
*  this democratic uh you know the where they went against each other the debate and the next day
*  on the news all they showed was the same five clips of elizabeth warren going after this person
*  bernie sanders going after that person and they have 24 hours to at least tell you the good things
*  they said on like yeah give me some policies or something but no they're just going to show you
*  those five clips yeah and that's and that's what the debate and then they're going we don't
*  understand why everybody's mad because you're only putting five clips up that where all the
*  candidates are mad at each other the news is a big part of the division right now and I feel like
*  it's worse like entertainment news is supposed to be like brad angelina uh jennifer aniston but now
*  you have polit politicians elizabeth warner bernie sanders like they're doing the same thing that
*  we did in entertainment news you're 100 right and I think they're doing that because it's a business
*  and they have to stay alive it's ratings but I would love it if one channel existed that didn't
*  do that one channel existed that was 100% unbiased these are the facts as we know them
*  you know some old school walter cronchite type shit can you do that nowadays I don't know why
*  you can't I don't know because it's about ratings question it's a good question can you it's like
*  we're so personality driven these days everything's personality driven it's so hard it's hard to trust
*  people you know it's like when when you see these hit pieces that are written about bernie sanders
*  and you know it's horse shit that's where like when you know something's horse shit that's when
*  you go oh wow look what you're doing and then you see a bunch of other news uh articles that are
*  similar and that are on similar left-leaning publications or similar establishment connected
*  publications and you go oh this is like a sort of a concentrated effort to try to minimize this
*  campaign but even when it's bullshit somebody's going to believe it a lot of people believe you
*  know a lot of people believe that well it's a certain number are going to believe it what's
*  really interesting to me is that bernie sanders just keeps winning right he keeps winning he won
*  nevada he's won three in a row and they're trying to bullshit us and pretend that people are he's
*  got a chance he's got zero chance that guy's got zero chance you know how do you see it all playing
*  out bernie sanders 100 the only way it's not going to happen is if they give him some fucking cia
*  injection into his coffee one day and his fucking chamomile tea to give a little squirt in there
*  i mean the guy already had a goddamn heart attack which is crazy that he's doing this well he had a
*  heart attack on the campaign trail i mean bro this is like like if you have a car and uh you're
*  you're driving it over to the guy's house who wants to buy it and one of your cylinders blows
*  he's still like that's a good car i'll fucking take it like that guy you know he needs that car
*  that's how much america needs bernie sanders this motherfucker had a heart attack running for
*  president and they're like so what he's still alive let's go let's go let's go let's go but
*  what's interesting to me and i you know we were talking about it at this benefit you did you came
*  out and made this statement about bernie sanders he was losing at that time he was not the front
*  runner and after you said that he became the front runner i really believe you had a lot to do with
*  that i don't know i mean you have a huge audience man something to do with it but that's all the
*  why they attacked me which is hilarious they did exactly what i said you can do about a person i
*  said if you take all the worst aspects of a person and ignore everything else and just magnify those
*  you can paint a very distorted perception of someone and so they're like good let's do that
*  to him let's make bernie sanders look like a piece of shit for using that well also the fact
*  that he used the most wishy-washy endorsement ever what i said is i'll probably vote for it
*  like run with it i might run with it i like it i might vote for it listen man if you i always
*  say this this is very important if you're getting your politics from me uh you're fucked because
*  i'm not the guy you listen to kyle kalinsky listen to jimmy door listen to the people that are really
*  paying attention to listen to the hill people that are really on top of it where it's their business
*  it's not my business my business is stand-up comedy and cage fighting and then a few other
*  things i'm a comedian like you you know we're we talk about shit but i'm no expert but what i like
*  what bernie stands for socially i like what he stands for socially you know when you and
*  when he made his when he explained how he was going to put a very small tax on wall street
*  speculation on each one of these little transactions less than a penny and explains that over time and
*  all these transactions that's that's a valuable thing and that could contribute and that could
*  what could potentially pay for education and health care and all these different things
*  i don't know if he's right you know i know many people say he's wrong and i would like to see a
*  real honest debate not a debate on television where you have to cut every seven seconds for
*  or seven minutes for a commercial and you have these people that are these moderators that are
*  you know steering this thing no i want to see the two of them like him and someone who opposes his
*  ideas who actually understands the economics of it and discuss it in a long-form discussion like
*  a youtube video make a youtube video everyone would watch it have bernie sanders sit down with
*  someone who's an economist or a mathematician or someone who understands it and let's find out if
*  that really would work and how it would work same thing goes with education same thing goes with
*  health care how are you going to pay for these things is it feasible is it possible to do this
*  where's the fat that we're going to cut how much taxes are you going to raise and who are you going
*  to raise the taxes on and how is it going to be done and where's that money going to go now do you
*  believe that if you're bernie sanders you have to talk about that information because we have a
*  president that didn't give any information i i feel now politics is i'm gonna give as least
*  information as i can so they can't use it against me and it works obviously because you have a guy
*  like that in the white house so if i'm bernie sanders why would i tell you how much everything
*  is going to cost trump the personality overshadowed everything else his personality overshadowed all of
*  his shortcomings so because of the fact that he could say things like when he was talking about
*  china you know you could go to china and you ever see that video which one was where he explains
*  to china or you could say listen motherfuckers have you ever seen that video no pull that video up
*  because it's one of my favorite trump speeches it's like this is what people love about don't
*  the fact that he would say this think about who obama was right obama this like articulate
*  statesman who you were proud that that was the representative of america he spoke so well he was
*  so measured so educated donald trump is not that do you feel that some american people since obama
*  was like that felt like he was speaking down to them for sure okay dummies yeah dummies don't like
*  smart people yeah that's always the case you know but the i don't think he was ever speaking
*  down to people he's a very measured person i don't either but some people get upset about that oh he
*  doesn't speak his mind he doesn't say what he wants to say there's some people that don't like him
*  because he's a liberal there's some people don't like because he's black there's some people that
*  don't like him because he's young there's some people that don't like him because he went to
*  harvard here it is listen to this so listen play this because this is one of my favorite trump
*  speeches ever he said well what would you do what can you do so easy i drop a 25 tax on china
*  and you know i said to somebody that is really the messenger the messenger is important i could
*  have one man say we're gonna tax you 25 percent and i can say another listen your motherfuckers
*  he said the same thing
*  he does not give a shit he doesn't and here's the thing people keep saying he's dumb he's not dumb
*  he's just not concentrating on the things that intelligent people concentrate on
*  wait he's concentrating on money money he's concentrating on his ego himself all right he's
*  not concentrating on i mean when when he's talking he's not talking about the great literary works
*  he's talking about not talking about great philosophers or great historians these are
*  not things that he's concentrating on his whole life he has a sharp mind but his whole life he's
*  been concentrating on donald trump and donald trump kicking ass and donald trump's name and
*  donald trump's ego and filling that ego and cheating at golf and doing all the things that
*  he wants to do whenever he wants to do him that's what he concentrated on it doesn't mean that he's
*  dumb and that's what people get distracted they get confused i agree with you on that but but i
*  what i'm surprised about look and i don't care what side of finch you're on but what i'm surprised
*  about is some people believe he's doing things for the country's best interest not for his own
*  well he's definitely doing things for his best interest 100 and also probably doing things that
*  he thinks are for the country's best interest as well i don't think all of what he's doing is just
*  for him because you wouldn't be president if you did that that doesn't make any sense because it
*  the the beating that you take in terms of like well that's also your ego boost but he's also
*  getting rid of everyone that opposes him yeah or so i mean well that's how he runs all of his
*  companies exactly so that's how you would run a company and you got the guy 70 fucking three
*  years old right when you're that old you don't change you know you're not i mean the the way he
*  runs companies to expect him to do any different once he became president it's kind of silly like
*  that's how he's become successful i mean that's why his fucking name is on these giant buildings
*  all over the world right it's like it's this ego thing and the way he does business i'm the fucking
*  boss listen you motherfuckers we're going to tax you 25 that's his attitude that's his thought
*  some people love that shit oh no i i know a lot of people are attracted to this the strong man the
*  strong confident man who tells everyone to fuck off they want to align with them because most
*  people feel like they don't have a voice in life they don't feel like they don't feel like they're
*  they feel frustrated they they owe money it's a lot of poor people which is really ironic right
*  because he doesn't you know his policies don't give a fuck about poor people he talks about the
*  working people and but that's he doesn't care to get them to vote for him he cares about him in
*  that way because they they are very valuable to him but why do they latch on to him so because
*  they don't have that voice that he has well it's that it's that right you like people are very
*  tribal they want a leader of a team and you're seeing that with bernie sanders you clearly saw
*  that with elizabeth warren so many women were clinging to elizabeth warren they wanted to call
*  bernie sanders a misogynist and this and that and what they were doing is they're just team warren
*  i'm on team warren they didn't want to paint an objective opinion of him like well he's got some
*  good policies and he's got some questionable economic theories and i don't know whether or
*  not they're accurate but this is why elizabeth warren stands out to me and as a mother and as a
*  woman i think it would be great to have a woman in the white house and i'm biased in that direction
*  people don't say that no they don't say that they don't say that they're tribal they're on team
*  warren fuck everybody else and that's how people are but it's just then you're not making any
*  progress you're just as bad as the other side like you're blaming the other side for doing that but
*  yet i see to me trump is so right like for that for that party he's doing his own thing where now
*  bernie i feel like i always feel there's an overcorrection me too was an overcorrection
*  i think now bernie will probably get it because that's the left's answer for overcorrection yes
*  i think you're 100 right and i think that's what's going on i think aoc and a lot of other people are
*  also part of this sort of philosophy of overcorrection which is probably good i think we need that i think
*  people go back and forth and we need to find our fucking equilibrium and that's what that's what
*  humans do you know look things are getting better man i'm a fucking rock solid optimist i think
*  i think even the me too shit what that is is it's i mean i have a bit about it i can't really talk
*  too much about it without giving up the bit i heard it is fucking hilarious it's hilarious
*  but the the thought process behind it is that ultimately the direction is moving towards less
*  bad things and i think that's the same thing with even woke culture like i'm a critic of woke culture
*  i think a lot of it is ridiculous and i think a lot of it is tribal it's the same kind of shit it's
*  like people decide they're on team ultra progressive and you know and then everybody else can go fuck
*  off and they want to attack those people and force those people to comply it's like a thought war
*  and that's what's going on but when you look at the tenants of woke culture but cut out all the
*  horse shit what are they trying to do they're trying to have less homophobia less racism less
*  sexism they want more inclusiveness they want more people to have opportunities that's great
*  that's all great it's just they're going about it in this militant psychotic way wearing ski
*  masks and professors are hitting people over the head with bike locks and everybody's losing their
*  fucking mind they won't even let conservative people speak at universities in a debate that
*  stuff is wrong but i understand what that is that's just rabid tribalism and it needs that's an
*  overcorrection and that needs to be called out and it needs to be it needs to be stopped because the
*  only way to really find out who you agree with is to let both sides talk that's the only way
*  and then this idea that this infantile like perception of of people including young people
*  that a lot of people on the left have is that you don't even want to hear people with questionable
*  ideas speak because then they're going to radicalize young people and they're going to
*  people are going to get drawn to them well that's a very egotistical perspective that's like i can
*  see they're full of shit but these young people are not going to be able to and i'm smarter than
*  them and i want to stop them from being able to speak i don't like when people get mad when you
*  have questions about what like if you ask a question to a different party or a different
*  movement and they don't like your question they get mad at you and then they'll attack you like
*  well it's fools but it's because it's people that don't understand all the tenants of rational
*  discourse you need those you need do you know what the four agreements are you ever heard don
*  mcgill ruiz the four agreements um it's a great it's a great book and it's really simple it's a
*  small book it's an easy read but the the four tenants are first of all be impeccable with your
*  word always do your best don't take take anything personal and i think the other one is like don't
*  have any expectations i think that's the other one here here they are okay don't make assumptions
*  that's what it is okay don't make assumptions always do your best don't take anything personally
*  and be impeccable with your word now if you just apply those and a lot of people like how does this
*  relate the way this relates this is a philosophy on just going through life and all of these
*  tenants be impeccable with your word don't take anything personally don't make assumptions always
*  do your best these are anti-tribal tenants this is a way to not get sucked into this like really
*  biased tribal perception that a lot of people get sucked into and they get sucked into this team
*  mentality and they get blinders on and they they can't see things for what they are we have a real
*  problem with wanting to be in tribes and it's just a part of our dna it's a part of our nature it's
*  how we survive to the 21st century i mean we survive by teaming up and and having this loyalty
*  to the people in our group to fight against the invaders want to take our women and our food it's
*  all it's all fight i mean you can that goes from politics to even religion like that's your that's
*  your tribe yeah that's exactly what it is and if you question a tribe yeah then they all come after
*  you i mean it's with everything man it's with everything it's with sports teams it's with the
*  part of the country you live in it's with the style of eating it's veganism versus carnivore
*  it's it's like it's fucking everything we do we break off into tribal groups man you know it's
*  like people are into american cars only and you know people are only buy electric guns yes with
*  everything man no one should have a gun everyone should have a gun i mean and by the way those
*  people that no one should have a gun or the everyone should have a con they're the same
*  person they don't even realize it they don't even realize it they just needed the right amount of
*  the right amount of influence the right the right people around them the right positive
*  the positive reactions from those people around them all of the the debate that comes from one
*  side versus all the debate that comes from the other side so much of the mindsets are similar
*  so much of that absolute mindset whether it's absolute left wing or absolute right wing it's
*  so similar you know what i hate is i think we're at a point in the country where everybody wants
*  to think their problem is bigger than your problem yeah and and so it's like well i'm gay well i'm
*  black and gay well i'm black gay and this you know so it's like it's a thing where everybody
*  you we can't acknowledge there's problems yes but we have to say my problem is more bigger is bigger
*  than your problem so you need to listen to me yeah it's like no let's just say everybody has
*  problems and let's address them yeah rather than you you being the big problem and also kindness
*  and understanding yeah those two things are so giant and whenever people just start attacking
*  people you realize okay there's no kindness there there's no understanding there and that's why
*  you're doing that if you had kindness and understanding you temper your words you take a deep breath
*  and you go well i assume she's just trying to do her best or i assume he's just trying to get by
*  just like all of us and that kindness and understanding goes a long fucking way because
*  as soon as you dehumanize someone as soon as you say you know hey he's on the left fuck him he wants
*  to take away your money and turn american to cuba fuck you you know like that yeah that kind of
*  nonsense man it's uh i read a book called uh uh never split the difference have you read that one
*  it's amazing bro it's about uh an old fbi uh terrorist negotiator and he he basically the
*  book tells you how to talk to people like he took that that tactic they use in fbi to bring it to
*  real life business and everything how to talk to people where you can get them on your side
*  and just certain questions you ask where it instead of them helping you well it turns it from me asking
*  you to do something to you wanting to do it it's brilliant like it's a game i use it in in real
*  life every day yeah how do you use it well it's about the how question okay you know for instance
*  you're negotiating a price on something somebody says i want to do the joe rogan podcast studio and
*  it comes in at twenty thousand dollars and you go you know what how can we make this where it's not
*  as much is there how can we how can we lower this price so instead of you going hey i need a lower
*  price and they're going no it's 20 000 you go how can we get this lower now all the onus is on them
*  to try to figure out your problem so you're basically putting your they're trying to figure
*  out your problem for you instead of you figuring out the problem you fucked up by telling people
*  this because then they're going to go uh we can't and then you're stuck it's like you're playing
*  chess here i know but they they just like check i just forgot about like how many millions watch
*  this now now people are going to be taking shit away from me now they were like oh you did that
*  oh i see what you're doing i see what you did you motherfucker you went with the how you came with
*  i do it to my wife and i mean but she knows i read this out every time my wife is at the house and
*  i'm just kind of chilling i go how can i help you oh jesus christ what are you doing
*  why don't you just get out when i am no no no when i ask that she always goes oh nothing but
*  when i'm doing nothing and don't ask her there's always something to do oh i get it you know what
*  i mean so yeah it's a thing where if somebody you're just putting the onus on them and it's a
*  fun like never split the it's it's a game changer man yeah that's interesting yeah there's all sorts
*  of weird techniques that people have used in negotiations uh interrogations interrogation
*  techniques are very interesting how they catch people lying by repeating what they said back
*  to them and having them repeat it again and then because he talks about that too okay yeah because
*  he had to do that like when he had to know over the phone though if they were lying so he had
*  through the book they go through all these cues you can do and he goes i want everybody know this
*  is not manipulation this just teaches you what to look for and how to basically get along where
*  you're not fighting with somebody on something because when you're when they have your hostages
*  you don't want to fight with the captors right you know you you have to talk to them in a civilized
*  manner to get these people out that is some high pressure shit man imagine you like you're you're
*  dealing with you know isis or some shit you're trying to get hostages back you're trying to
*  communicate with them and trying to figure out how what's the best way to do this without using
*  drones you know well you use drones everybody's gone yeah not anymore they're pretty good now
*  when they took out albeck daddy uh no that was an albeck daddy solomani they uh they only killed one
*  other person yeah they're good at it now it's scary well it's look it's gonna get scarier
*  they're gonna be able to get drones down to like i mean they used to call them they used to talk
*  about the precision of drones but really like a lot of times they're blowing up entire buildings
*  and killing a ton of innocent people like the numbers of innocent people that have overall been
*  killed by drones is fucking staggering yeah if that was a cop if a cop had done what drones had
*  done you would be like that guy is a fucking psychopath and he's just trying to kill people
*  like the the decision that a cop would make there's a bad guy in this building so
*  i'm gonna blow up the whole fucking building like you go what yeah you're gonna do what like there's
*  weird decisions that you're allowed to make in two cases one war and two when it's not a human
*  doing it per se it's a human piloting a drone well i mean what was that movie with the it was
*  these animals these mechanical animals killing everybody in the movie it had that it was like
*  this dog type of creature it was a big movie i forgot what the name of it was mechanical animals
*  yeah it's it's they have all these robots now it's a robot i think black mirror the black mirror
*  episode yeah oh you're right it was a black mirror it was a black mirror episode it's one episode
*  yeah i saw that but man like these robots they're jumping over things like like the mafia can just
*  like buy robots now to go do hits for people you know like it's gonna get that kind of money
*  i think it'd be more like the the more like the federal government using our money that's what's
*  fucked up about the government like they're using our money they don't even have to give you like a
*  sheet like say if you pay taxes and you know you make a good living you probably have to pay us
*  a hefty sum of taxes they don't send you hey michael we used all this money on education we
*  fix the streets with this money that you sent so you should feel happy that you're contributing to
*  sorry no invoice fuck you pay us yeah and if you don't pay us they wesley snipes you they just send
*  you to fucking jail they lauren hill you they just send you to jail they don't even let you pay it
*  off they don't say hey fuckface you owe us three million dollars you have to pay this off and this
*  is how we're gonna force you to pay it off and wesley's like look good i'm just gonna i'm sorry
*  i'm gonna go back to work i'm gonna make that money give me a you know a couple years to pay
*  it off and i'll pay it off no no no fuck you go to jail so you can't even make any money while
*  you're in jail so now you're more in the hole when you get out so they put you in jail but that
*  doesn't take any money off no oh no you still owe all that money wesley snipes had to do like a
*  more than a year in jail oh yeah well so did lauren hill i believe lauren hill did a year in jail
*  i mean these taxes man fucking taxes these that's the only thing where you owe money they put you
*  in a fucking box they don't do that with anything else if you owed money on your mortgage you just
*  have to pay it you know if you had credit card debt you just have to pay it but if you have irs
*  debt fuck you yeah you're going to jail they make it's like they're thugs man they they make an
*  example out of you see and by you saying that you better watch out i pay my taxes i pay my taxes i
*  always have and i think you should pay your taxes i'm not i'm i've never ever tried any sort of
*  manipulation to try to pay lower taxes i don't think about it i'm very happy that i get to live
*  in america i'm very happy that we have this incredible system where you literally can be
*  a person who's struggling and go on to become incredibly successful we don't have a caste system
*  in this country it's not perfect it's definitely not equal there's definitely people that grow up
*  in terrible environments and impoverished crime-ridden gang-ridden neighborhoods and
*  they're way more fucked than i ever was growing up however you can go from a kid like me who's on
*  welfare when he was young and you know when i was a little boy and go on to become someone who can
*  make money in this country you can you can have an influence you can do something i'm proud to pay
*  my taxes i never complain about it i mean it's a staggering sum of money when you really think
*  about it but i'm proud to pay it i think we all should be but i don't know what they're dealing
*  with why well i tell you this my dad pays all what sly did three years three years three years
*  and no money you're making no money and bro when you're like 52 like how old was he when he went
*  away it was 2010 so he's probably he was sentenced in 2008 and he went into 2010 how old is he
*  he's now 57 okay so he was like 47 so when he was 47 he got out at 50
*  jesus christ that's a those are important years man yeah man just doing push-ups playing cards
*  and here's the thing you don't get fucked with the irs my dad pays all his taxes but they messed up
*  on his taxes and they thought he was jordan peale they did
*  they yeah exactly yeah this guy makes way more money than that have you seen his fucking movies
*  my dad looks exactly like have you seen the pictures of his dad and jordan peale
*  oh pull the pictures on my instagram or the hell did way less though by the way how much time did
*  she do she had like three months oh hmm well i think what was going on there was wesley was a
*  part of some wacky group that was saying that you don't have to pay taxes because it's
*  unconstitutional dude sometimes people that work out for the same way people get locked in a thing
*  and the earth is flat you talk to a couple people that are very convincing and charismatic and
*  articulate and you're like really next thing you know you're launching off in the sky is a tax
*  protester as he was called oh so his tax process is probably still in the pokey maybe so so yeah
*  oh yeah look at that come on that's your dad dude dna test coming that's crazy right i mean
*  that is absolutely perfect like if there was ever a michael yeoh movie that guy is playing your dad
*  for sure 100 that's crazy i know like it's not even a little different that's exactly the same
*  exactly he looks exactly like your dad amazing the only thing that's different is the beard
*  yeah like you take away the beard that's the same purse that's fucking stunning
*  it's crazy that's a that's a dopal ganger bro that's a real dopal ganger i mean bro look at that
*  i know i know i've never seen one that good no it's my i was just looking through instagram and i was
*  like these this is because people have mentioned it to me that i've met my dad and seen pictures
*  and i'm going ah whatever but then i found those two pictures i was like dude
*  this is the same fucking person this is the same person they have those things we like see kiano
*  reeves in a 1920s photo and you're like kiano reeves is a fucking time traveler like occasionally
*  someone would look like so i've seen some photos of me in the middle east like joe rogan is really
*  you know really lives in pakistan or some shit but the that is about as good as i've ever seen
*  yeah that's the best and it's not a blurry picture no it's like perfect difference yeah yeah like the
*  kiano reeves one isn't there a kiano reeves one it's black and white though and kind of fuzzy right
*  right so yeah yeah yeah like it looks like he might be in the old west or some shit famous time
*  travelers yeah yeah let me see any more oh the eddie Murphy one is nah nah not really that's just
*  that's just like that could be eddie murphy's brother nicklaus cage nicklaus cage a little bit
*  yeah a little bit pretty close who else charlie sheen look at charlotte oh wow
*  that's close wow who is that guy charlie sheen i think lincoln a little bit yeah with no beard
*  kind of sort of that the bruce willis one's kind of stunning i don't i think a lot of people draw
*  these like make them look old you know what i mean i think i don't think david schwimmer yeah

*  handsome man he was probably throwing tons of dick around in 1875 right that guy doesn't look like
*  him either that guy on the right no those aren't even close those are not close but i know which
*  one you're talking they had a black and white one that was like he was kind of behind the photo
*  yeah i remember that your dad set the standard though yeah it's over now that should go viral
*  that one needs to go viral yeah yeah it's one of the these pictures where it doesn't yeah there's

*  was it but i'm sure it's gotten more awkward with somebody else in here or was that oh yeah okay
*  way more yeah what's the most awkward thing oh jeez i ever happened on the pod i don't know can
*  we move on to greener pastures oh my god go back go over awkward things
*  it's just comedians they don't like being poked fun of it's like that's weird like if it's good
*  you know well you know what's funny is a lot of roasters people that are great at roasting
*  do not like to be made fun of of course it's so true yeah that's well i'm not gonna mention
*  any names but i know like three that if you make fun of them but get touchy oh yeah you know that
*  expression about hoes about the girls who complain about girls being hoes are the biggest hoes
*  right everyone knows that's a fact that's a fact that bitch is such a fucking slut like
*  it's like what you're up to it's like the girl when you first start a day the first date she goes now
*  i'm not the girl to sleep on the first day and then that every dude knows oh i'm about to sleep
*  with that girl on the first date yeah when they have to tell you when they go out of their way
*  to tell you about it yeah they go out right away from the beginning let you know that's a weird
*  thing that girls have to do right because every girl knows that every guy wants to fuck like if a
*  guy picks you up he wants to fuck and every guy knows when he picks up a girl like she might not
*  want to fuck yeah this might not ever happen this is just dinner yeah it might not ever happen it
*  might not ever happen but you know what i always say like like to women like you control it like
*  you're the goalie you're the goalie yeah so if you if you're Harvey Weinstein
*  convicted going to jail son and that's just in new york he still hasn't get tried out here
*  oh he's got a bunch of trials that's just one have you seen how much he has aged in the last
*  like eight months like me and my wife were watching him on the news last night we go
*  i saw him on a red carpet a couple years before and he was like vibrant and just the stress and
*  the guiltiness and everything is just beating him down i don't think he'll even make it to jail
*  i mean i might kill himself i told my wife that because yeah you're gonna die in jail well he's
*  probably depressed so deeply imagine going from being the toast of the town posing with oprah top
*  of the world go on the red carpet everybody loves you everybody thanks you when they get their
*  academy award have you ever seen the compilation of all the stars thanking harvey oh yeah and then
*  many of them went on to accuse him accuse him later of being a monster but meanwhile they're
*  just praising him well it's but you don't you have to play that game
*  fuck don't you i don't know i guess i mean but i talked about this yesterday owen smith and i
*  were talking about this yesterday we were on the podcast we were talking about like how much
*  i'm so happy i don't have to go on auditions and i don't act and i'm not i don't want to be a part
*  of that anymore that's one of the reasons when people think like god why is everybody hollywood
*  so fake it's because they're all trying to get cast in something it's true they're all trying
*  to get accepted by producers and casting directors and and executives and so they're all just like
*  hedging their bets like playing it safe like a guy on the first date just a bullshit artist
*  just like a fucking slick guy with loose morals on a first date trying real hard is this was this
*  him getting arrested and how long ago was that where's this fucking walker walking perfect now
*  how come how long ago was that this was yesterday when he got he's walking yeah he was all like
*  why they have to cuff him do they think that fat fuck's gonna kick anybody's ass
*  i like it what's up with that no cuff him but isn't it weird no it's great the cuffing thing
*  is weird when you like if someone's i guess if you don't cover him he could run away he could run
*  where's little fucking toothpick legs his big old belly look at that meatball belly he ain't going
*  anywhere that dude ain't running but here's the thing it's like i guess he's accused of violent
*  crime so you have to cuff him right if someone's accused of murder and they're convicted you got to
*  cuff him what happens to him if he goes to jail does he get epstein like do prisoners i i know
*  with any kids if you mess with any kids old video apparently yeah i thought so he doesn't look like
*  that anymore that's probably two three years ago right oh that was when he initially got arrested
*  yeah i about to say that's not him well now he looks that was one of the things that the court
*  artist there was a an artist that drew him throughout the case and she was saying that you could see
*  his deterioration his physical deterioration over the course of the trial have you seen him lately
*  no did you oh you got to pull up the video of him like yesterday it literally him walking up
*  yeah he looks 20 years older i wonder if that walker shit's real you think that walker shit was i
*  don't think it's real but i think it became real whoa that's right i think it was yeah look at that
*  look at just his face yeah i think it was a thing where oh let's play it for the court
*  and then he just got so broken down through the process which he deserved and it just took a toll
*  on a man look at him this is the video you just showed is like two years old it was may 2018 may
*  2018 look at him now look he's lost most of his hair yeah he he looks so old and tired he's
*  probably not getting any sleep he's a fucking beaten man god and he was on top of the world
*  if if there is karma right if karma's real that's the karma because this guy was on the top of the
*  world but he was like forcing everyone to suck his dick so you want to be a star suck it's like
*  demonic shit yeah you know come on in now karma's like karma's saying do you want to suck my dick
*  i don't want to i don't but i don't want to hurry come here get over here you want to make you a star
*  sorry sorry don't tell anybody about this like whoa and then signed and then his contract had it
*  in there you heard about that oh yeah like they had a disclaimer in his contract not only didn't
*  have a disclaimer for one count of sexual harassment two counts you get you have to pay up this amount
*  three counts you have to pay up that amount like he would lose money based on how many different
*  counts of sexual harassment he had so they were negotiating depended upon him being a predator
*  like they kind of knew well what do you mean kind of if they put in a contract they knew they knew
*  they're putting in a contract you know well that's the other thing how many people are also liable
*  here oh my thing is when are the agents going to jail the ones that kept sending all the actresses
*  to the guy the one they knew they knew everybody an actress can say hey harvey weinstein raped me
*  and then the agency says listen do you want this job or not like those those people those people
*  but if you're an agent and you've known harvey weinstein for four or five years or 10 years
*  and you know he's been doing this but yet you continue to send actresses right to this guy
*  here's you have some type of responsibility too yes but here's the question did they think that he
*  was just a pig and he was trying to talk those girls into willingly having sex with him which
*  many did or did they think he was a rapist because he was both of those things apparently yes he was
*  a guy who had sex with girls who were willing to whore themselves out to be in movies and he also
*  forced himself on women who did not want to have anything to do with him so he had both of those
*  things were going on but you don't think the agencies that were sending all these big actresses
*  and they didn't know they knew the both types hey they had some girls willing and some girls
*  are saying they're right you don't think question you don't think any actress ever go went back to
*  their agent go i'm never going in again i got raped and then that and then that agent was like
*  all right i'm not going to send you anymore but hey over here go in the harvey well i like the way
*  you're negotiating here because the way you're saying it doesn't give a person out you're saying
*  you don't think because no one's saying that they don't think that no one's arguing that they don't
*  think that so you're saying you don't think that so you're learning from that book yes very clever
*  i wouldn't say it that way what i would say is there's a high likelihood that they at least
*  suspected he had forced himself on some women and there was probably some rumors there was a
*  hundred percent likelihood they knew he was a pig there was a high likelihood that there were some
*  stories about some things that he had did that were probably criminal high likelihood i don't know how
*  many people were privy to those stories i don't know how deep it got in whether i mean like if
*  you're an agent how many actresses do you actually get to send to harvey weinstein how many you know
*  i don't know i'm sure i'm sure whoever he wanted to see right but i don't know what that number is
*  i don't know how much they actually knew what we can be pretty sure of at this point is there's no
*  way all these women are lying oh no i know they're all i i believe look i know so pit talks about the
*  time he threatened to murder harvey that's a great story like this is right after guinness paltrow
*  was uh harvey weinstein made an advancement on guinness paltrow and brad pitt confronted him and
*  said i'll fucking kill you you do that again so this is the thing brad pitt knew right so if brad
*  pitt knows and he's one of the biggest movie stars these agents know i don't want to
*  he uh purr paltrow he approached weinstein outside of a play premiere in 1995 and he told him if you
*  ever make her feel uncomfortable again i'll kill you brad pitt went gangster on it wow
*  but this is a night look joe this is in 1995 25 years ago bro so you're telling me that these
*  agents and the industry we all i didn't even know the guy but i heard these stories right this what
*  it said is that he touched her inappropriately and invited her to his bedroom she told her then
*  boyfriend brad pitt about it see that's what i think most people had heard and that's gross
*  for sure but it's not crossing it's not great see that i think most people knew about that shit and
*  brad pitt was willing to kill him over that which i love yeah yeah but yeah i just think it's a it's
*  a thing now where like we talked about earlier it was an overcorrection with me too that was well
*  deserved and now you're seeing these guys like harvey and get actually money's not going to get
*  you out like money can get the cosbys yes of the world he's i think he's the tip of the of the
*  monster pyramid you know this cosby because he they they they did this thing about him where they
*  said he's probably the most prolific serial rapist in history which is like holy shit and he was
*  doing it on the set of the cosby show yeah like he would invite actresses to oh i want to make a
*  guest appearance on the cosby show yeah take him to yeah have to go to his trailer they wake up
*  covered in jizz with an empty teacup what the fuck it's like this is not the part i want it
*  disgusting and then they're probably like what happened did that really happen you imagine if
*  america's dad raped you and you're like that this did that what like you probably if you were an
*  actress and you went to him you were probably thinking okay this guy is probably exactly like
*  he is on tv he's mr huxtable he's going to be nice to me and you know he's just a nice guy
*  he's just gonna do that try to help me out he helps people out i would think when these women
*  woke up they didn't believe it happened there's probably a big shock yeah well they say that
*  that's one of the things that happens with rape victims is that they sleep with the person
*  willingly afterwards and it doesn't mean that they weren't raped but it's almost like they
*  are trying to erase the shame of rape by going back to that person actually willingly having
*  sex with them it was one of the arguments that harvey weinstein apparently had used
*  was that these girls had willingly had sex with him after these encounters and then you know they
*  tried to show that but psychologists talk about that and they say that this is a coping mechanism
*  that some victims actually wind up using which is just i mean the mind plays crazy tricks on you
*  right and when you're going to someone who's america's dad like bill cosby you think he's
*  gonna help you out and give you that little boost and get you going in your career and you can't
*  wait to be there with the academy award going and i just want to thank bill cosby because he gave
*  him my first break and he's always been a beautiful mentor figure to me and a father figure and
*  meanwhile empty cup of tea and you got a headache and your pants are off you're like what the fuck
*  yeah i mean i don't like the argument that that people make like when these like you know the
*  actresses think harvey weinstein and stuff like that it's like you have to he paid for the movie
*  you know you can't be like you argument that they're not really they're not really victims
*  because but or or the argument that you know oh it took 20 years to say something you know it's
*  it's that stuff happens where you just don't want to say anything you know look it's a whore
*  business yeah right and people whore themselves out in one way or the other there's men that
*  whored themselves out and said things that they didn't really mean because they wanted to keep
*  working so they praised people that they really probably despised there's probably a lot of that
*  going on yeah you can't say just because all those people kissed his ass that he wasn't really a
*  monster monster yeah but but a lot of people use that argument you can't you really can't it's not
*  valid it doesn't make sense it's it makes sense that it's distorted that the whole thing's
*  distorted and gross even more gross maybe than just a simple he met this woman then he tried
*  to rape her it's even more gross like they worked together for long periods of time and
*  her career success was dependent upon his acceptance of them i mean that's like the ultimate
*  state of power right if you're the head of one of the biggest most prominent movie studios in the
*  world and you bang all the actresses and everyone knows it but also if you go against them he'll
*  call the other studios and make him blackball you know that i think if it was just okay he runs this
*  studio yeah and he did me wrong yeah and i okay we're not going to work with that studio he would
*  go out of his way to call other people to blackball those people and that's where that's where you're
*  petrified because you know like we're comics but some people are actors and that's what they do
*  that's what they want to do so it's a thing where you know if that's your thing you have to play
*  that game it's no different than the comedy store like i'm past that prime of hanging out there
*  because i have a family but that's the game you hang out in the club it becomes a fraternity you
*  know and then you get past you know that like you got to invest time in that club you know in the
*  comedy store and that's what everybody tells me you know and it's a thing where are you not past
*  no no no no but my thing also have you auditioned no well that's how you get past yeah but i heard
*  it's a you know they like to pass like people that invest time it's like a fair how can you
*  never just text to me ask me to get you set up for an audition i don't ask i don't i'll set that up i
*  didn't even know i thought you already passed no i'm there i've seen you there oh yeah i perform
*  there a lot but those are promoter shows promoter shows yeah yeah yeah yeah be careful because
*  they're they're probably going to eliminate those oh okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah this is
*  because there's a lot of people that go up that are not really common standard and someone will
*  come the first time to the comedy store and they'll see a promoter show and one of the promoters
*  goes up and eats shit for 20 minutes in the middle of a star stack lineup and you're like what the
*  fuck that i just see or they put a girl they're trying to bang on the lineup that a little bit
*  yeah now now i'm gonna get heat for that no you're right you're right heat from who the girls that
*  are well i'm not talking about but i'm promoters yeah it's um yeah i hate that i said that i know
*  that it's gonna come back it's true though but i've seen might because my friends are some of the
*  promoters and go oh yeah i'll put her on the show yeah yeah i'm like okay yeah you know but look
*  look there's a lot of there's weasels in all lines of work it's um the promoter thing is a weird
*  thing because you know yeah you had your issues well it's everybody's other issues and the big
*  issue is the quality of the performers a lot of those guys that are promoting these shows that
*  really are not professional comics they kind of like are sometimes comics they occasionally do it
*  so they'll insert themselves into these star stacked lineups like there's delia and jessal neck
*  and all these and they'll get up in there and do 20 minutes in the middle of that that's just
*  comedy store hates it do you um like i was with uh jim jeffries is on my podcast this week and he
*  was talking about he doesn't like going to comedy store because he's so used to performing in front
*  of his own crowd that he actually gets kind of nervous going up at the comedy store because
*  why it's good for you exactly exactly so my thing is but it must be different from you because any
*  time you're on the lineup your fans show up there so you're always playing home court now well there's
*  some home court to it but there's also a bunch of people who are there to see delia there's a bunch
*  of people that are there to see jessal neck and whitney cummings and ali wong and whoever that
*  else is there that's true you you get all those things yeah you're winning people over for sure
*  is it as easy as no one knowing who you are no it's it's it's it's or is it as hard rather
*  there's no one knowing who you are no it's not it's much harder if people don't know who you are
*  then you have to really win them over but you know i did that yeah i've done that forever like i know
*  what i'm doing like doing stand-up at this point is really about being honest about the material
*  reps putting in the time putting in the effort putting in the focus and then grinding you gotta
*  grind you gotta trust the process do you ever get nervous before you go on or is that sure
*  really yeah get a little antsy yeah yeah get a little fucking here we go here we go we go
*  i like that man i like being nervous when i used to fight when i wasn't nervous is that i had my
*  worst performances always i got too relaxed because you got to be on edge man because that
*  it's an unnatural state right going on on stage in front of thousands of people is an unnatural
*  state you should be a little on edge it shouldn't be like waking up or going to the gym or anything
*  normal it should be weird it should be weird every time i go on stage it's fucking weird you know
*  what it's like it's the closest because i don't fight but like gladiator like you're a gladiator
*  walking into an arena except they're not cheering you on at the beginning they want to make me laugh
*  you know but with you when they see you they're ah but you still got to make them laugh you gotta
*  you gotta crush it well also i have all these things that i put into my head before i go on stage
*  not just about the material itself because i have the over the last three or four years i've
*  altered my preparation for shows and one of the big things is index cards i take index cards and
*  i write down all my shit before i'll spend a whole hour just writing on index cards and then in my
*  hotel room before that i will write and it doesn't even have to be about the material that i'm doing
*  sometimes it is sometimes it's not but i will write for over an hour i'll make sure i do that
*  so i have two hours of solid writing the day of a show and that's just to keep everything going
*  that's like every i want everything popping and it's sharp and i want it to be i don't want it to be
*  oh let me think about my bits right before i go on stage no no i'm thinking about that shit all
*  day long and then i think about people getting babysitters i think about people dragging their
*  wife and wife's like he's not even funny like i think about all that shit i want all those people
*  to have a good time man i think about people paying money i think about people saving money
*  i think about people taking trips and driving in their cars and getting on planes and coming to see
*  me like i get jazzed up man i get fired up i want to do a good job i don't ever take it for granted
*  i think these people paid money they they put invested their time in me i don't want to let them
*  down no that's great because it's almost like by you preparing like that you've already done the
*  set five times before you even hit the stage so you're like where so many people just exactly oh
*  what are you what you're gonna do oh i don't know i'll figure it out when i'm up there they're not
*  paying all this money for you to figure it out but here's the difference when i do the comedy store
*  sometimes i don't do that yeah you work out yeah and one of the reasons why i don't do that is
*  because i'm trying to experiment and i'm i'll do things backwards where i'll do like my closing bit
*  first or i'll do punch lines first then try to reinvent the the beginning of it like at the end
*  and i'll do that just to try to figure out if i'm doing a bit the right way because you don't really
*  know i know the beats i know where there's jokes i know where it's funny and i know the premise
*  but i don't know if i'm doing it the right way i'm i need to find out and there's a lot of guys
*  that they'll come up with a premise and they'll start working it and they never change it it gets
*  a few laughs and it could have been better but they never allowed it to grow they never were loose
*  they never opened it up so i'll get baked as fuck i'll drink i'll have a couple shots of whiskey and
*  i'll go on stage and just ramble and sometimes that's not my best set but sometimes it hits a
*  groove and then you catch this new part of a bit that's way better than any other version of it's
*  been before and then it becomes your closing bit and that's so it's a it's a gym in a lot of ways
*  it's like there's a there's a whole process to it but that shit doesn't happen in arenas yeah you
*  know when i do an arenas you know i got music playing in the green room i'm pacing and shadow
*  boxing i stretch i do yoga i do cardio the day of that's another thing i do before every show
*  i always do cardio i want to blow off all the extra steam i don't want any bullshit in my head
*  i want to like pump it out sweat it out stretch so then so i've covered my mental bases i've covered
*  my material i've covered my my brain preparation i've covered my uh my gratitude i've covered all
*  those things cover all those things so that when you and when i go out there i'm still nervous
*  wow that's that's amazing like i i just love what you're what you're doing with this podcast what
*  you're doing with stand up like last time i was here i it changed my life and i and i'm telling
*  you to change my life in a good way because you know i i said i didn't work out and i never got
*  so many shirtless pics of dudes saying dude you know when you work out you don't have to get big
*  you could be shredded so they were sending me your your audience was sending me workouts and it
*  inspired me to start working out and so i started like going to the gym and i tried out you know i
*  do a lot of research so i tried different things i tried the ones where you run around jump up and
*  down wasn't my thing run up and jump down you know those boot camps and all that stuff okay
*  and i'm 45 that kind of shit yeah that's not me i'm a college football player i'm a high school
*  football player i need weights in organization okay so i did research but nobody just does weights
*  and i found a place called lift society it's changed my life literally every day you do glutes
*  i mean you do legs one day you do chest one day or upper body one day and it just rotates in the
*  and you change workouts every week it goes from 12 to 10 to 8 it's just like college football
*  and it's and the thing is you control you have your own rack so they only let like nine people
*  in the class and it's one trainer so it's almost like a personal training because you're all doing
*  the same thing and nobody's in your space and it's all weights it's not just jumping around
*  grabbing a rope and throwing balls i just need weights you know what i mean do you do any cardio
*  no don't you want to do a little cardio do i joe i don't know i don't man i've lost like
*  way a little it's not for weight loss it's for heart health well but when you're doing squats bro
*  your heart's girl
*  yeah like your heart is going great for sure especially doing the high reps yeah we're doing
*  12 reps right okay five sets of 12 and then it goes four three man i don't know it's i weigh a
*  little more but i'm a i'm a lot more shredded that's strong yeah i love lifting better
*  100% that see there you go like i actually that's what's up i don't have muscle legs but my legs are
*  strong now you know i believe it like you used to be able to touch like the first time i came here
*  you could touch my leg it would touch my bone like literally squishy yeah that's it's tight like you
*  have muscle memory which is interesting isn't it yeah like but your body goes oh yeah we're playing
*  football again yeah yeah well that's why i don't go super heavy because i was so hard for people
*  that have never done jack shit that's the hardest for people who never done jack shit to get in
*  shape because their body's like what in the fuck are we doing whereas with you your body's like oh
*  we're getting big again all right we know how to we're getting strong again we know how to lift
*  weights we did this yeah unless yeah but i'm not into the the jumping around classes it's the body's
*  so interesting man it's great you can like i went years especially when i was doing jiu-jitsu i went
*  years without hitting the bag or doing any kicks and then one time someone asked me to explain
*  something and uh like like how do you do that thing like i've heard about a spinning back i'm
*  like i'll show you how to do it and i went over to the bag and i'm like part of me was like do i
*  really know how to do this like i haven't done this in years it's like a false memory like is
*  this real do i really know it and then i start doing it and then my body's like oh we're doing
*  this shit again i know how to do this it just clicks but it's weird because it doesn't seem
*  real like it's like when i'm about to do it i'm like i'm gonna fall in my ass right here do i
*  really know what i'm doing like when you don't do something for a long time your body has to like
*  kind of go oh yeah oh i remember this you have to do it a couple times yeah you have a memory
*  like i have a memory of it but that memory seems fake i have a lot of memories in my life that
*  seem really fake really oh yeah man oh yeah well life is weird right and my life is very weird
*  my life is weird every everyone's life is weird life is weird where these weird monkeys that are
*  clinging to a rock that's hurling through space there's no roof above us sky is infinite it's
*  weird yeah we're gonna live a certain amount of time and then we're gonna die and we don't even
*  know what the fuck happens then but do you okay so there's that and then there's famous weird
*  which is really weird and then this famous weird that's i've lived so many different lives
*  so i have like these lives in my bat in my past where i'm like oh boy is that real did i do that
*  stuff wait wait now now i'm getting lost you have martial arts stuff martial art okay okay yeah
*  fighting but even stand-up man like there's moments before i go on stage was like do i
*  am i really do i really do this yeah like there's a it's a weird freakout when you're about to get
*  introduced in a fucking sold out arena and you're in the back and you're like is this real do i
*  really do this like i feel like i have a false memory of me doing this like i know i did all
*  that stuff i know i did all that preparation but then you got to kind of trust it and then you know
*  they go ladies and gentlemen Joe Rogan you go out there like yeah like what's up what's up what's
*  up and then it all falls into place yeah and like you have to trust the process but you got to do
*  it a lot to trust it that's why stand-up is it's so critical to do the reps you got to do mad reps
*  and i've fucked that up in the past before man i've done that in the past where i was only working
*  like one or two shows on the weekend and that's it that's all i was doing for like a few years
*  a couple years and my my performances suffered they did they weren't as good you have to do a
*  lot of reps man that's what that's what i love about stand-up it's it's stage time it's the great
*  equalizer you know what i mean like i i know comics that say i've been doing it 15 years but
*  their stage time maybe five or six years right because because that's the thing russell peters
*  said it doesn't matter how many years you do it it matters the stage time yes because stage time
*  makes the years that's not true this is why it's not true okay because you need reflection time too
*  so the time in between that stage time is critical as well it's not just the time you go on stage the
*  time you think about that as well you can't just get 10 years where the stand-up in three years you
*  can't do it you won't ever be able to do it yeah because you're not going to grow enough as a human
*  and also your your your values and your your perception will be distorted because you'll be
*  too stand-up centric one of the things about stand-up that i've found you have to have other
*  life experiences and i think my other life experiences enhance my stand-up yeah i think
*  i think he was more talking about the people that's done it for yeah no i don't want to say that
*  everybody's equal no no no they're not they're not equal there's people that look there's people
*  that do it just for girls like i know lots of comedians that just do and i've been doing
*  comedy for 15 years but really you're just doing it for the girls you know you don't have to mention
*  any names i know a lot of those dudes yeah that's what i'm saying those guys suffer they suffer they
*  suffer because they know they know they could have really pursued it as a real art form they could have
*  they could have appreciated the unbelievably fortunate position that you are in where you
*  have an opportunity to be a professional stand-up comedian and i think a lot of those guys they
*  probably never had real jobs yeah like if you had like a real job working on a construction site or
*  doing something hard driving limos and you know working in a fucking shitty office sitting in a
*  cubicle every day suffering yeah and then and then internalizing that suffering and realizing i don't
*  want to fucking do this god i wish i could be a comedian god i wish i could be a professional
*  you know greg fitzsimmons and i we started out exactly the same time like a week apart from
*  each other greg and i have been buddies forever and one of the things that we talk about is when
*  we first started in boston we never thought about having a career we always thought about is man
*  if i could imagine if i could pay my bills doing stand-up like having like greg has won multiple
*  emmys he's had showtime specials and you know headlines all over the country he's and we were
*  talking about it's like i never would have dreamed that would have been possible it wasn't even a
*  dream yeah the dream was make a living that's it just make a living yeah that's it that's what i
*  was saying it was so inspiring like coming on this podcast because it kind of was a domino thing
*  after doing this because to me this podcast is very inspirational to people and it was the moment
*  i was on here like i so i did this whole lifting then i listened to the david goggans book and i
*  was like oh my god this dude's crazy and a beast like and i did the mirror thing like he said like
*  the first thing on my mirror is wtfo work the fuck out right so that's the first thing i do
*  in the morning and i go if this dude can go through all this i can wake up and work out in the morning
*  and then comedy's up there and then sell a tv show which already happened this year that's
*  going to be announced in a couple weeks so it's a thing congratulations oh thanks but it's a thing
*  where sometimes you just need to see it firsthand yeah because once i saw what you've done live i've
*  seen it on on youtube but once you hear and you feel the magnitude of it it was like what the
*  fuck am i doing i need to really start pushing harder and i need to really focus just on comedy
*  on podcasting i built me a podcast like it was just so inspiring and then it just
*  dominoed into more and more things where and it had a lot to do with your listeners like saying
*  jiu-jitsu gyms reaching out to me because i said i wanted to try that you should try it you're built
*  for it man you told me not to because my knee i have knee problems that's right what's wrong with
*  your knee again it's a meniscus i did no i never got it fixed so but get it scoped but like the
*  shirtless dudes and the whole the whole jujitsu body right now your knee yeah yeah all the time
*  well i squat and stuff it's fine but i couldn't imagine somebody like i i did a workout i did a i
*  did one of these classes where i just jump around a little bit and hurt it that's why you uh ever
*  get an mri i did they said it's just it's just you know it rough like it's grinding on each other
*  so they injected it with the gel so jels i can't remember what they threw it hyaluronic acid
*  yes yes yes yes so they did that that'd probably give you a little bit of space yeah a little bit
*  yes so it feels better but i know i couldn't take like yeah man somebody punches me or hits me i'll
*  evaporate man literally yeah but you don't have to get hit jiu-jitsu is not about getting hit it's
*  just grappling okay yeah no no i'm good okay yeah all right i don't think i could handle that like
*  i don't have to baby steps yeah yeah i just started working out again but i can send you to
*  someone who can inject some stem cells into your knee that'll help you a lot do you believe in
*  stem cells oh 100 yeah i've had some significant results in fact results that are shown on the mri
*  i had a full-length rotator cuff tear in my right shoulder that they were thinking i was going to
*  need surgery on i got some stem cells and less than a year later um i had two stem cell injections
*  and less than a year later i got another mri and it was gone have you have you heard that means
*  the tear disappeared it's gone it's it's it healed up prp and something called exosomes exosomes and
*  prp fixed my shoulder i've done prp on my knee once that can help no it did help for like a couple
*  years but have you have you done nda yes no not ivy no i've done the pills i've done the pills
*  and uh we've talked about having an ivy lady come down here why say lady nad not nda
*  what did you say nda is like a non-disclosure agreement but nad i'm sorry i translated
*  i want to know they're really in my system
*  it's so ridiculous no yeah yeah yeah i heard that's the shit i've never done the but i take the
*  pills but i've never done the intravenous i've heard the intravenous i want to i want to try it
*  but the only thing that scares me uh i have a doctor friend so he's like oh you gotta try it
*  you gotta try it yeah and uh what scares you well the tightness of chest when they do it oh that's
*  yeah the he goes to your gut apparently yeah 10 minute version the 10 minute push version really
*  is painful no no well he says it takes like three four hours yeah the three four hour one is easy
*  apparently the 10 minute one is the one we like jesus ah come on bro we'll do it together i'll hold
*  your hand oh hell no i'm just scared my i'm just scared much like i'm scared of that anything that
*  because my friend's name is dr sha and he's amazing like he's the type of dude where we'll
*  just go to lunch and he'll tell me all the new stuff that's coming out right and he he owns this
*  place called next health it's awesome but we'll go to lunch right next door and he'll just break
*  down everything and he's like dude nad it restores cells you know it makes you it won't
*  necessarily keep your life you won't live longer but your cells get younger and they they work
*  better your heart will pump blood better everything will be better but you have to do it five days in
*  a row five days in a row five days in a row for five days in a row for but how often well he's
*  like once a year once a year just five days in a row yeah that's it yeah but it's like three to
*  four hours man like it's 750 milliliter milliliter i think you can do it in 10 minutes if you can
*  gut it out no i'm but you can no i bet david gargans would do it in 10 minutes
*  well here's what i didn't understand about david gargans to do stretch for two hours
*  yeah every night but every night i want to know this routine like he i don't how could you stretch
*  for two hours he just does it he doesn't have a job first of all he made i don't want to say i'm
*  sure a lot i don't want to say his numbers but he made an ungodly amount of money on his book
*  and uh he doesn't even own a car he goes i'm a black jew i don't spend no money on no car so he
*  runs everywhere like his video his wife has a car and uh he doesn't buy a car he's and he's not
*  spending any of that money like he's he's the real deal like he's not posing that's that guy all day
*  long 24 hours a day you know and he's honest about every step in the way he goes sometimes
*  i get up and i just look at my sneakers i look at my sneakers like a half hour i don't do shit
*  i just sit there feel sorry for myself i don't really want to run but then it's that fuck you
*  bitch you're gonna run run motherfucker and he goes then once i run then i feel it he goes and
*  then when i run i get mad at myself for not wanting to run earlier so i run more like he's
*  he's honest about like his vulnerabilities and his weakness he's honest about who he is but it's also
*  there's no no question he's going to get everything done like he's he's a complex individual
*  and i think because of the fact that he's so honest about all that stuff it makes him even
*  more intriguing like he's honest like all the pictures of him when he was drinking milkshakes
*  and he was 300 pounds and yeah he loves showing those to people he's like that was me he's that
*  was me i was a fat fuck i was a fat fuck i was lazy he's like the first time i went running i
*  ran like a quarter of a mile and i was gassed out i sit on the side of the road like but do you
*  believe like in that book he thinks everybody has that in him do you think everybody not to that
*  degree man because that book was insane well i think it depends i mean everybody has that in them
*  if you choose to act the way he acts but a lot of that book is insane and you learn because i read
*  the book as well you learn from that book in the audio bush book i would actually recommend oh it's
*  so good because in between chapters he talks about all the different things that happen and
*  actually elaborates in a more extensive way makes you go holy shit like his life was hell his father
*  was a monster and he did not have a happy childhood by any stretch the imagination was horrible
*  it was he it was filled with torture and racism and strife and struggle and he felt sorry for
*  himself and it was terrible but all those demons now he has those motherfuckers locked up pushing
*  the wheel you know that iron wheel that conan was on they're in his head now pushing his wheel
*  he's got those motherfuckers working for him now those are they work for him like he's in control
*  and so that fuel is not everybody everybody doesn't have those demons like the person that's
*  gone through the kind of life that david goggans has had is the type of person that has those
*  demons and all of those long distance motherfuckers they all have demons all my friend cam haines he's
*  got a ton of demons he'll tell you he's like you would not want to have had my childhood it was not
*  a happy childhood and those people that like you would think that you would think that having a
*  happy childhood is good and that's what i'm trying to provide for my family and i know that's what
*  you're trying to provide for your family but and to be there and to be loving and to to be
*  playful and be supportive and all the good things that i wish i had when i was a kid
*  i want to provide that to my kids but part of the reason why i'm who i am was because my childhood
*  sucked that's what it was it didn't suck as bad as david goggans it didn't suck as bad as people
*  that have been raped and didn't suck as bad as people who were continually molested and beaten
*  and all those things i didn't you know i want to compare with someone who's had a real who was a
*  real victim it's just mine wasn't good yeah but it wasn't it wasn't happy and that drove me that
*  drove me i needed i needed to prove my value i need i don't know my dad i needed to prove my
*  self-worth i needed to prove that i was worth something i didn't feel like i was as good as
*  other kids i felt i felt insecure always always growing up it wasn't until i started being good
*  at something that i realized you could get positive reactions from people from being good
*  at something and then i became obsessed with being good at things and so that became my life it became
*  i i know what to do now i know how to grind so do you think when people have a great upbringing
*  for them to be successful it's actually it's harder it's harder it's harder because you have
*  everything show me the a man who's the son of a great man show me a great man who's the son of
*  a great man it's very rare it's very rare most men who are the sons of great men struggle in
*  the shadow of their father most of them and i think because they because the kid doesn't have
*  to struggle the kid doesn't have to struggle and you also you're comparing yourself to someone who
*  is exceptional and you're always in their shadow there's it's the only time it's different is in
*  sports occasionally those fathers mentor those kids and those kids derive a bunch of self-esteem
*  and a bunch of positive feedback from that parent if the parent does it correctly like
*  ilio gracey who's the founder of brazilian jiu-jitsu one of the founders along with carlos gracey
*  one of the things that he did with his children and he had an ilio was a great man and his children
*  are fucking assassins i mean he developed literally an army of the greatest martial
*  arts the worlds of the world's ever known one of the things he did when they would compete
*  he would give them prizes if they lost he didn't put any pressure on them he understood early on
*  that putting pressure on kids and making like this is your whole life they crack they break they just
*  can't take it anymore and then they wind up doing drugs and they escape and they give up
*  he made it playful he made it fun for them and then when things were terrible and they lost they
*  felt awful he would give them a toy he would buy them things and he was like you you know you did
*  your best it's okay like no pressure no pressure like that and i don't know if that would work on
*  everybody but god damn it work on his kids yeah his hoist gracey hickson gracey heuler gracey
*  helsen like some of the greatest martial artists the world's ever known all out of one man all one
*  man's child with children and because this guy had this philosophy on not putting pressure on them
*  and keep being loving so it can be done so most people are not going to do it because to him
*  probably when he was coming up he was punished probably probably i don't know i mean it's hard
*  to tell i don't know i don't know what his life was like was with his father i've never read into
*  it but i think that it's it's really hard to come from a happy loving life and be exceptional and
*  be charismatic like guys like joey diaz right where's the joey diaz come from you can't make a joey
*  diaz in a lab there's no right he's a fucking animal he's a savage yeah and the shit that he
*  says on stage and how funny he is bro you gotta have a hard life joey diaz found his mother dead
*  on the floor while he was on acid when he was 13 years old okay and his dad was already gone by
*  that point he was adopted by his friend's parents like joey diaz had a hard fucking life i would
*  never wish that on anybody especially my children but that is what made him the animal that he is
*  today that i mean you read david goggin's book that struggle made him who he is mike tyson terrible
*  childhood became this ferocious combat sports athlete that probably one of the greatest heavy
*  not probably one of the greatest heavyweight champions of all time a legend right why out of
*  pain out of suffering out of understanding that you don't want to ever go back to that place again
*  you have to find some way out so i i think that's why some parents you know they call them the
*  helicomter parent or the the the dad that's always at football practice that's yelling at their son
*  you know like i think they know that too so they try to make sometimes parents try to make it more
*  difficult on their kids i think those people are usually living vicariously yeah through their
*  children and they usually were bitch athletes yeah and they want their kids to be good yeah are you
*  competitive what you're like are you a competitive dad what do you mean in what way would you i don't
*  i don't know sports i make a real concerted effort to be happy for everybody okay for everybody the
*  other team to to say that was really good wow she's like when when my daughters play sports
*  they played basketball and soccer and a bunch of other shit i always make i always go out of my way
*  to say that girl on the other team is really good like wow look how good she is at passing like no
*  judgment like no like fuck that team we're number one that's nonsense yeah i mean some of those
*  parents do that shit and that gets me upset i'm like that little girl knows how to hustle look
*  at her go like i make an effort to praise everybody see i would be like that but right now my son is
*  two and i get mad when other two-year-olds are bigger than him like i'm that dude right now like
*  i'm sorry like why is this like you love them i love them but i it's hard but i i want them to be
*  the biggest the best and why the biggest i don't it's a big guy he's gonna be a big kid some no
*  grow later i hope so how big is your wife she's five five nine so you're gonna have a big kid i
*  hope but right now don't worry about it feed him give him elk meat i'll give you some but the
*  doctor was like well he's on the smaller side and that really messed me up and so now every time
*  and i hate that i'm this guy every time i'm always at hey how's your how's your kids too i know but
*  i'm that dude dude no but i won't be that after i know like he's very athletic he hits a golf
*  ball like a beast already at two oh joe you got another tiger woods coming pull up do me a favor
*  you have to see this joe really pull up my instagram go down about six rows it's sad that
*  i know exactly where it is but it's a photo of him or no it's a video of him hitting a golf ball
*  out of the yard like over a fence really and this was six months ago so he was like he was just
*  turned to wow and we don't even i don't force it on him i want to put that put him through
*  god he watches it on tv because i like watching golf sometimes so he watches it it's him you see
*  it yeah i mean it's amazing we take him to sometimes he'll he has to ask to play so if he
*  asked me he'll go i want to go like to range so i'll take him to the driving range professional
*  golfers sit there and watch them really coaches coaches will how do okay no no no go back a couple
*  more go back a couple more there is it's right where is it where is it where is it no
*  yes that one right there here we go watch this
*  over the fence and watch him hold and watch him hold it
*  dude that's incredible yeah that's incredible for a two-year-old yeah he like he got some fucking
*  airtime there look at that thing go yeah over the crazy so the ball looks so little so big
*  because he's little so little yeah wow look at that that's nuts over the fence dude and it's
*  over the fence dude and we didn't even teach him see if that's incredible you didn't teach him how
*  to do that he watched it on tv and i don't know how to play golf i've never played how to play
*  golf i've never played golf that's crazy yeah you watch golf and you don't play golf i went
*  tiger woods you remember when he won the this was about the time like six seven eight months
*  ago when he won that he came back and made a big win and i was like oh let's watch it so he my son
*  started like golf golf golf so we grabbed a golf club my father-in-law plays golf but he comes over
*  sometimes but my son just took to it picked up a golf club we bought him some stuff and he just
*  started hitting balls that's crazy it's bananas but that's really crazy because if he can do that
*  with twisting the torso and he knows how to rotate his feet yeah that's one of the things
*  that kids get stuck when you teach them martial arts they don't rotate their feet right because
*  the way to get torque is you have to you have to pivot on your the ball your feet he's doing that
*  instinctively already got it that's amazing he's mirroring so i was saying these coaches are like
*  how old is he i'm like two they're like okay let me know when he's five because they can't they
*  can't coach a kid till they're five i guess that's some kind of golf rule or something he's going to
*  be a wizard by the time he's five take him to miniature golf and work on his putting skills
*  and then by the time he's five dude i'm i'm sure i'm gonna be retired in about 17 years
*  he goes pro dude i'm just i'm talking about gravy training that's so much money in golf like that's
*  something you should really i have a friend and his daughter is uh playing golf and he got her into
*  golf specifically because he said that's a great way to get a scholarship if you girls if you could
*  go back and play one sport what would it be me it's golf 100 pool i wish pool had a professional
*  league i wish that would be like a little i mean it does have a professional league but it's not
*  you can't make any money well i'm talking about money like if you go back and play
*  one thing to make money i avoided golf because uh i get addicted to games and i knew golf would
*  take eight hours it takes i would see comics that would really get into golf and i'd see their their
*  comedy slip off because they were paying too much attention to golf and i was like oh that ain't good
*  and he's tired he's walking around the course all day with a fucking bag of clubs because comics are
*  poor they can't afford a fucking golf court you know you're playing in public courses and i would
*  see these guys they would they'd come in sunburnt eight hours of drinking and and knocking a ball
*  around and then they'd be tired when they did stand up and i was like oh i can't fuck with this
*  that golf bag is heavy well also i have a real addiction problem with games like it's a real
*  issue i get very very very addicted to games so i can't i can't fuck with golf i know you love
*  those shooter games right i love all those games i love quake quake is the big one for me but i love
*  playing pool too playing pool was a huge part of my uh my youth when i lived in new york i played in
*  tournaments i played every day i would go to the comedy club this is what i would do is my morning
*  day i would get up around noon usually i'd go to the gym work out go to the pool hall hang out play
*  a little bit go to do my comedy show come home from my comedy show go straight to the pool hall
*  that's i would bring my pool cue with me to the to the shows i'd leave it in my trunk and then uh
*  on my way back from the comedy club i would go straight to the pool hall i play all night so were
*  you good yeah i was good oh okay yeah i could play like i'm a b player i'm like what you call a b
*  player like i've won tournaments before when i was playing every i mean not like a big tournament
*  but i played in some professional tournaments i never did well but uh you know i i beat some
*  people that were pretty decent players i never beat a real like legit pro but i could have played
*  professional if i really put the time and effort into it like i got i can run out like i can break
*  and run out a game of nine gotcha i can i think i'm the most i've broken a run i was i think i
*  broke out four racks in a row and i think i ran 70 balls playing straight pool it's not it's not
*  top of the food chain but it's legit i can play a little bit which you call a short stop that's
*  what you call a short stop player but i could i mean this is when i was in my early early 20s
*  if i dedicated myself to it i had the desire and i had the interest to try to play professionally
*  and that and the difference between someone who's an amateur and a professional is really just about
*  time and focus and design but there's no money in it yeah if there was money in professional pool
*  like golf money i would have went i would have went pro yeah 100 like i love it my thing is i
*  wanted to be professional football player until i got all these concussions now i look at my son
*  and everybody goes are you gonna let your son play football and i'm like no don't i can't no i would
*  let my son fight for sure i would never let him play football no those are car wrecks happening
*  every time you get each other hit each other in the head exactly that's exactly the way to look
*  at it it's a car wreck because like even when you get knocked out like it's not nearly even
*  occasionally it is but most of the time it's not it's not nearly the kind of force that a football
*  player gets hit all the time and you get hitting like that in practice you get hit like that in
*  high school you get hit like that in college you get hit like that in all these games and it
*  all adds up man it all adds up and a lot of these guys by the time they're young like they said
*  aaron hernandez when he died when they checked his brain he had one of the worst cases of cte they
*  had ever seen i think they said it was like of a almost like his brain lived like 50 or 60 it was
*  so much in a short amount of time did you watch that documentary i haven't watched that documentary
*  it's insane but also when you when we go over the stuff that's in cte mood and all the other
*  impulsive bad behavior all those issues like that was that guy's life yeah that was that's what he
*  did and how much of that shit came from playing football all of it a giant percentage of it a
*  giant well even football when you get successful it brings on the wrong kind of friends so even if
*  it wasn't his head money and fame brings different kind of people in your life too for sure and and
*  also you're being rewarded for being ultra violent like your your your success comes from being
*  ultra violent you know that's the thing that happens with fighters like you develop skills
*  to hurt people right and then as you get better at hurting people you get more accolades you get
*  more success and then you delve further and deeper into this world of being this ultra violent assassin
*  and then you know you that becomes your identity your identity is you're the guy who smashes people
*  you know and it's it's all that's it's a hard train to get off too once you're on that and that's your
*  life and then all of a sudden you're 36 37 and then you can't do it anymore you can't do it anymore or
*  you're not doing it well and you're getting you're becoming the nail and not the hammer
*  and you're like fuck what am i doing with my life and then with each fight that you have when
*  you're you're slipping a little bit you say i'm just going to fight till i'm 40 the real damage
*  is those ages 36 37 38 39 40 fights those that's where the real damage is coming in because those
*  are the ones you're getting KO'd those are the ones you're getting rocked all the time you know
*  you're you lost a step you've taken a lot of damage maybe your knees are gone maybe your backs
*  up and it's hard man people have a tough time quitting like like it i look i i see football
*  players i used to know a lot of football players i would interview them and different things like
*  that it's crazy that all your life you're glorified as this one thing and then once it's gone it's
*  it's hard like i remember when i couldn't play couch football anymore it's like what do i do now
*  you get it's some type of depression where you're like for sure yeah this is what i was this is what
*  i trained all my life for and now it's gone now what i do well one of the reasons why i do so many
*  different things is because i don't like banking on any one thing 100 i don't think it's wise it's
*  not good for me either i like being i like being interested in different stuff you know that's
*  also like why i have all these hobbies i have all these different things that i'm interested
*  whether it's playing pool or archery or hunting or any of these other things that i'm interested in
*  interested in them for the end like with hunting the end is always the the excellent meat that
*  you get out of it and the fact that you're eating this organic wild game that's the best food in
*  the world that's for sure number one but it's also the difficulty in the pursuit allows me to
*  express myself in a different way allows me also allows me because i'm not that good at it i mean
*  i'm better at it than a regular person but in terms of like i have friends that are like world
*  class archers and bow hunters like my friends john dudley and cameron haines those two guys are two
*  the very best bow hunters in the world and they're my mentors they help me out a lot
*  but i like sucking at things because you can learn about yourself you learn about yourself from
*  concentrating it's not something that's ingrained in my psyche in my brain it's something that i
*  have to concentrate on and practice every day and i think there's a real benefit in sucking at things
*  yes even if you're a you're excellent at something find something you suck at and get better at it
*  it's it's really there's real benefit to that for being a beginner it's it stimulates your mind in
*  a way that when you've already achieved a certain level of of success or a certain level of some
*  high level of ability at something where you've been doing it most of your life you sort of like
*  you get accustomed to this feeling of being really good at something the real growth is in sucking
*  the real growth is in like that's why i like yoga i've been doing yoga for like
*  fucking years i still suck i suck like most classes i fall out of poses i don't ever i mean
*  occasionally make it through the whole pose without falling out sweating and shaking and
*  straining but i never made it through an entire class without ever falling out of any poses i've
*  never done that ever ever i've never had one class where i made it to the end but i see these
*  old ladies doing it right next to me all the time crushing it little 90 year old old lady just
*  fucking holding her feet up in front of her and they some people have done that kind of shit a
*  long time but the real i mean it's great for them don't get me wrong the real growth in things
*  is sucking learning learning like how do i do this what do i do because then when you can do it is
*  all the more gratifying it's all the more gratified but also it opens up new pathways in your mind when
*  you learn learning things whether you're learning a language and i'm talking on my ass there because
*  i don't know any languages yeah but this is what i've been told is that it helps you intellectually
*  when you're learning a game like chess that's complex when you're learning archery when you're
*  learning things that require all these moving parts to come together that's why martial arts
*  is so good you're you're you're using your brain because you're thinking things through you're also
*  using your brain because you're managing your emotions you're also using your brain because
*  you're managing your discipline and your will so because you don't want to quit and then you're
*  using your brain to try to harden your body and condition your body and get it to the point where
*  you can actually do jujitsu effectively yeah and then you also have to get disciplined so that you
*  go to the gym all the time so you have strength in order to execute these moves and you have
*  cardiovascular endurance and survive the rounds like all those things are not just good for
*  jujitsu they're good for life like my taekwondo instructor said something to me when i was real
*  young and he said taekwondo is a vehicle for developing your human potential and i was like oh
*  i get it so this is just the thing i'm doing and the better i get at this thing now i understand
*  how to get good at things that's what it is so when you do something new that you suck at whether
*  it's yoga or playing golf or anything the the the growth is in learning the growth is in figure oh
*  what do i how am i holding it like this yeah okay like this here huh like you learn and in learning
*  there's something that happens to you like your your mind expands the synapses fire you see things
*  better i i'm so disappointed in myself because i i said when my son was born i have a lady that
*  comes over and i tell her just speak spanish to him you know three days a week so and i said by
*  the time he's two or three i'm gonna know spanish too because i'm gonna learn it when he learns it
*  god damn it i don't know one word of spanish besides hola right but i'm upstairs the other day
*  and this lady is talking to my son in spanish and he's answering in spanish and i have no idea what
*  they're talking about playing spanish it is great for them oh it's so good but but like my
*  i don't know my my parents didn't didn't like why wouldn't they teach me another why wouldn't my mom
*  talk to me in korean she wanted to americanize me because people made fun of her so now it's
*  except like it's cool to know other languages now before it was like oh you know they would
*  do this to my mom you know the asian eyes of my mom so my mom was like i gotta americanize you as
*  soon as possible i don't want you to have to go through that and i feel cheated because i should
*  know korean i should know spanish i lived in texas and miami and i'm just this dude that doesn't even
*  i lived in miami for eight years and don't know spanish and texas like i'm pathetic and i said my
*  daughter was born i go you know what by the time she's three i'm gonna learn spanish and she's
*  three months i haven't taken one class but i am though i i am gonna start doing it what do you
*  listen to when you're in your car when you're driving around books books just listen to spanish
*  listen listen to things on like uh one of those rosetta stone see that's that's i i'm gonna do it
*  um you know what last time i was here do it i started working out do it next time i come
*  i'm gonna do my whole interview in spanish you know tom sagura is doing his whole special in
*  spanish i didn't even know the dude spoke spanish that's amazing fluent you should see him and his
*  mom together doing a podcast in spanish is fucking hilarious his mom's hilarious his mom farts so loud
*  and he caught her like she was farting like in the house and she they were laughing at it and so then
*  he filmed her when she didn't know and she's sitting in front of the kitchen and she rips this
*  fucking tremendous fart listen to them play play some of it because it's hilarious
*  normal
*  see he looks like a bro yeah he does you know it's interesting people talk shit around him in spanish
*  and then he'll like wait let it go for a little while and then he'll just respond in perfect
*  spanish and they're like oh yeah he just signed a two deal netflix one in english that's one in
*  english and one in spanish dude i could have done one in english and one in korean
*  oh mom you're screwing me out of money over here is there anyone who's doing other bilingual
*  specials is there anyone who's doing two different i mean i'm sure there is but i mean joey diaz does
*  spanglish shows so he'll do like half of it in english and half in spanish and he'll let the
*  people know like he's doing some shows in miami and and he writes down they're in spanglish
*  so he's letting people know a lot of what he's going to be doing is like cuban flavored stand up
*  well in miami they're all the radio stations they are spanglish most of them yeah they go
*  hola como estas all right coming up we're gonna and then they go like that's all i know that's
*  sad that's all i know is hola como estas you can learn i will okay i will don't get aggressive no
*  no no no last time i was here i started lifting weights and everything so now next time i come
*  i'm speaking spanish korean beautiful you got a podcast studio now and you're rolling i'm telling
*  you it's inspiring dude you are inspiring oh thank you i'm very happy to hear that but i think but
*  but what i love about your there they are all about like the positivity you know i know a lot
*  of times they can leave some comments and stuff like that but the people that reached out to me
*  and i don't read comments but the people that directly dm me it was all like dude this this
*  this this this is beautiful sending me workouts and i was like this is great man this is what it's
*  very very happy this is what it's about that is what it's about that makes me very happy yeah
*  yeah man i think you put it out if you put that out there that's what comes back you know i think
*  when you have a negative message you know you're gonna get a lot of negativity your way
*  yeah you know people that are real negative all the time their fans are all negative
*  i mean it just goes hand in hand doesn't it yeah it does it does like my friend you know i have a
*  friend he you know he hasn't broke or anything but he's a comic but when he goes up he goes i don't
*  know why i always get heckled like literally every time i go up i get heckled and i go well
*  you're always yelling out the crowd you like like he's matt he goes up yelling out the crowd if they
*  don't laugh at the beginning well fuck you guys you know i'm like well i mean you're you're yelling
*  at them yeah of course they're not laughing right well i don't think it's them you gotta look
*  well here's like think about people that are inspiring like think about gogans right like
*  gogans's message has changed so many people's lives and it's it's he's changing their lives a
*  lot of it just by explaining what he does so he puts that energy out there people attract that
*  energy and then they respond likewise they respond in turn you know that's what happens in this world
*  when you know and then there's always people that are hating on him fuck you pussy you know you this
*  you that you know you you didn't do this you didn't do that like you ain't shit i'll fuck you up if i
*  find you like this people like why do you want to fight them you know these people are crazy
*  people also one of the reasons why they hate one of the reasons why they hate people is they don't
*  like being they don't like measuring up to someone and coming up short when you see a guy like david
*  gogans and you realize like i don't have that kind of will i just don't have that kind of will like
*  this guy's getting up every day and running marathons he's doing broke the world record for
*  the amount of chin-ups you can do in 24 hours but he's not asking you to do that like like this
*  morning but the perfect example 4 30 i woke up and i always have coffee at five and and i was
*  like you always wake up at 4 30 4 30 why after i read that book uh it's now oh yeah i wake up at
*  4 30 now every morning and at five i drink a coffee and i work out at six at 5 15 i was like you know
*  what maybe i'm not gonna end in wtfo on my mirror i was like work the fuck out and i was like i'm
*  because of that book i'm still like drinking that kool-aid man like that's good kool-aid though so
*  it's changed my life like when i say i did this it changed my life 4 30 every morning and i go
*  and i fall asleep around nine every single day that's my schedule that's beautiful yeah that's
*  a good schedule and since the last time i've been here i was like look i hosted a lot but now i'm
*  just gonna invest in and stand up and i know you're out of acting but i want to just i want to
*  my goal by the end of this year is be able to 100 fully support my family just on stand up
*  you know just touring and it's gonna happen do that it's gonna 100 yeah it will the acting thing
*  is fine if you love acting like this like i was uh watching this show last night that i'm addicted
*  to the the outside of this hbo show i've heard of it i haven't seen it it's good when there's
*  this one guy who plays the lead detective he's such a good actor he's so good he's so good that
*  it makes you want to act it makes you like oh god damn that would be like acting with someone
*  like that where you it's a real craft like there's a fucking dance that he's doing with those people
*  he's acting with i really enjoy watching that and i'm like maybe maybe i could do something like that
*  maybe i would be interested in doing something like that because like there's not like the the
*  prejudice that i have about actors is the because of the worst ones that i've worked with or the
*  worst ones that i've met are the worst ones that i've known that are just really annoying and
*  self-obsessed and they're doing they're doing nonsense they're like they're like terrible
*  comedians but they don't have punch lines you know terrible comedians are all about themselves
*  and they just they dominate every conversation talking about themselves and what they're doing
*  what they want to do and how they're not getting booked anywhere else because these people don't
*  like them because they're fucking jealous because of this night dude you know those people right
*  yeah you know and i just all right all right bye you know you gotta just keep moving with those
*  people they'll stick to you like glue they're like leeches they just they just start sucking
*  blood out of you well because they're always blaming other people for their downfall yes
*  it's like well you know i i'm not getting because this person got it or i don't understand why this
*  person is doing it because i was here way before them and i was like well that's a problem yeah
*  you had an opportunity yeah that's a problem you fuck something up and you don't want to listen
*  you don't want to listen and some some of them are good at taking advice but most of them are bad
*  most of them when you tell them this is what you're doing wrong they just go yeah that's not right
*  yeah most people don't want to hear their own issues you know and because they haven't been
*  saying it to themselves like there's not a fucking person on this planet that will criticize me harder
*  than i criticize myself i do not say why i get up in the middle of the night to take a piss and i'll
*  be like you fucking loser like get your shit together like i know i've done a lot of crazy
*  shit i know my life has been pretty extraordinary in terms of like amount of success that i've had
*  i fucking i'm still never happy never happy with anything anything i've done anything well you
*  always can get better always that's why always and the people that like like i don't understand and
*  i hope nobody takes this wrong way but i don't understand how you could be in something i don't
*  care if it's comedy or working wherever you and you haven't shown progress yeah how do you stay
*  in it how do you stay how do you stay and what are you doing wrong you're just floating by yeah
*  how are you not getting better they're not yeah but there's a lot of people like that man you know
*  there's people like that in everything and like i remember that in pool there was people that never
*  developed the proper technique and i would watch them play and i mean years and years and like
*  when i started i sucked in the beginning and then there was people that also sucked with me now
*  years later i became a good player and those people stayed the same they still fucking say
*  didn't put in the work yeah so when i would want to play with them they didn't want to play
*  i'm like why don't you want to play they're like you're too good i'm like what do you mean i'm too
*  good bitch we started i started out after you like how come you're not any better like what's going
*  on here well what's going on is they didn't really concentrate on evaluating what they're doing
*  and looking at it from like a technical perspective looking at it like and like your
*  mechanics are your mechanics off like the way your son hit that golf ball he is already on
*  this crazy path where he understands physical mechanics some people never get it some people
*  there's guys you'll go to i'm sure i don't follow golf but i'm sure if you went to a public golf
*  course there's guys right now that are 50 years old they can't hit a ball that they've probably
*  been playing their whole life yeah they don't do it right yeah some people just don't learn but i
*  also though i i think and like i'm a fail fast person like if i'm not good at something i don't
*  stay in it like i'm that's me i feel oh yeah i feel how's that possible because you learned
*  and got way better at stand-up well yeah but i didn't but i did okay my first couple times i
*  was gonna give myself three times i said if i go up three times i did that was what i said because
*  i i'm from that mentality fail fast you know because i don't invest time in something i don't
*  think that's gonna move forward for me you know what i mean so i first time i did stand up was
*  the miami improv it went well second night the i opened up for the waynes brothers well you were
*  first night you were already a radio personality yeah in miami so i had a home i was home team
*  right and then waynes brothers they were in west palm beach home team kind of and but after the
*  first time i got off stage i called my mom and i was like this is what i was born i love it so much
*  i'm at home i'll just be staring off in the distance and my wife will walk by and go comedy
*  like she knows because she's talking to me i'm not hearing it and that's how much i love it so
*  much because it's the it's the only true art where it's just you and the crowd and what i
*  love about it is the stage is not prejudice that state it may be political getting on that stage
*  but once you're up there it doesn't matter if you're funny you're funny yeah and that's that's why
*  i love it because we're in an industry you know where what i do you get a lot of nos man no no
*  no you can't do it but to have an outlet that same night to go up and get 300 yeses yeah it
*  just keeps you in the game you don't need someone to approve whether or not you get to work yes
*  yeah yeah like you don't have to you don't have to get picked out of a lineup of people that are
*  trying to play the part of bob like are you reading for bob come on in here michael so i
*  see you're a comedian and you were one on the first season of fear factor oh yeah thank you
*  that's my credits thank you so you were in justin and kelly and fear factor yeah that's my two
*  credits come on come on in and uh okay you're you're reading for the part of bob remember bob is gay
*  did you know yes of course i did we're not playing it like okay we're not yes but think mayor pete
*  don't think uh like the next door neighbor on three's company well you gotta give me some
*  direction i mean who's uh who is a famous gay character on sitcom oh will and grace right oh
*  jack yeah just jack yeah yeah so i did it right yeah if that's your example you're gonna do it
*  like that yeah well if if it's i'm going off you're the cast and i'm going off your cue so if you say
*  you how to do it don't they want to see you like what your take on it is yeah yeah but no they give
*  a description okay so by your description will and grace i did it right yes so nobody can get mad
*  okay bob has ptsd okay and um yeah he's he's ready to rock and he's drunk ready go
*  just fucking acting uh but i mean you're not you're way past this level but you gotta admit
*  i mean comedy when you're up and coming is like that too oh yeah you're trying to get stage time
*  on these places you know so you're really on auditions all the time too yeah in a way so you're
*  also trying to find your voice on stage how you do it you're not not totally sure is this the right
*  way is that the right way how should i be going to but that's also why it's so exciting no that's
*  what i love it i love it and there's also one of the things that's so exciting about stand-up is
*  there's really no one way to do it you know like if you play golf kind of one way to do it right
*  you learn how to do it correctly i mean there's there's variations same thing with pool same thing
*  even well not jujitsu jujitsu is pretty eclectic there's a lot of different influences a lot of
*  different styles but with comedy man you could be stephen wright or you could be chris rock yeah
*  there's just a lot of and that's what's so great about it it's the best yeah it's the best like at
*  the comedy store when all these different what i love about the comedy store and what i don't
*  like about la people is they debate about spending thirty dollars on a lineup where the rest of the
*  country is spending fifty to a hundred dollars for that one comic like that just but that's how
*  that's how the people in la are so just not thankful isn't that normal there's so much
*  they take it for granted yeah no they take it for granted they take it for granted like i mean when
*  you have these kids look i just did salt lake city and wise guys i love salt lake club oh my god
*  dude big shout out to keith they have two there right yeah they have two yeah i did one it was my
*  first time there i haven't i did a while ago but it's my first time really there and man those
*  people appreciate every joke yep they appreciate the experience where a lot of times i'll see to
*  me a comic crushing up there and people on their phones people just yeah they don't
*  i don't know i just can't worry about that i know but i'm i'm not on say i'm just i i just
*  they're disrespecting i get mad when people disrespect the craft like i'm so in it like that
*  it's like you should be paying attention to that i get angry at people yeah you can't concentrate
*  on them though just gotta do yourself yeah it's like your dumb friend who yells at the crowd yeah
*  i know same shit yeah don't worry about but but i'm in the back watching so i'm like dude this
*  you need to be watching yeah well you're definitely going to get a lot of self-absorbed
*  people in this crowd you get a lot of uh i find that more at the improv not necessarily these days
*  because most of the times i'm at the improv it's my show yeah um but i feel like uh that's a more
*  hollywood crowd in some weird way you know one of the things that's the comedy store is really
*  shocking how many people come from not just out of state but out of the country oh yeah to come to
*  those lineups like i run into people all the time they're like yeah we're doing comedy tourism we're
*  flew in from scotland i'm like what you guys flew in from scotland hey yeah yeah you motherfuckers
*  won't come out there so we came to you i was like wow that's crazy but i feel like right now
*  comedians that that are really killing it they're rock stars dude like rock stars i just saw joe
*  coy sell out two shows at the forum yeah and i was there and when he walked out it could have been
*  bruno mars it could have been like same applause same everything and that's what i love is that
*  this industry right now is on fire but the people leading it too and i like i've only been in it
*  nine years but they're giving you know like when i eat that's new yeah oh nine years ago when i
*  started it was all about people backstabbing and talking shit about people now i think podcasting
*  has changed again now people are having i don't want to call them clicks but you got your people
*  you know and those people that are in that click they help other people yeah and i think it's that
*  thing where with you with tom with bird with even delia theo va it's almost a uh uh britney
*  schaub and uh brian callan i think it's a thing where people are like oh everybody can be successful
*  it's not just one person that has to be successful yeah a lot of people can be successful yeah and
*  there's 350 million people in this fucking country that's what i'm saying you want all of them
*  bitch they're all for you greedy asshole
*  that's what i'm saying well it's also too there's a brotherhood and a sisterhood amongst us and our
*  friends that you are dealing with a very small number of people that are professionals at this
*  on earth like when you go to the comedy store if i run into anthony jesson i'm gonna give him a hug
*  it's not just he's my friend it's also he's one of maybe a thousand people like him on earth
*  yeah maybe it's true maybe my it might not even be a thousand it might be 500 like legit world
*  class headliners that can sell out of theater how many of those now i would say less than yeah i
*  mean but it's not even just sell out of theater i mean there's a lot of people that can't like
*  my friend owen smith who i think is one of the best stand-up comics on earth he's so good he's
*  so good i tell everybody i'm like that guy he just spent too much time writing on sitcoms and on
*  movies and people just didn't know but when you go see him you know he's working with me tomorrow
*  night the improv for the second show he's a murderer man he's like as good as any comic alive
*  as good as any comic alive he's one of the best on earth what do you think it is because you've
*  reached that that that uh the peak and continue to grow but what do you think that when you're a
*  comic and all of a sudden you just pop like find out i think today it's the internet today it's
*  the internet like a youtube video can make you one youtube video like angela johnson that nail bit
*  that bit made her her whole career yeah yeah russell peters he got famous off of youtube clips
*  people seeing his youtube clips and a lot like joe coy also it's like hey our people are represented
*  yeah because like for a long time like who the fuck was indian that was a famous comic nobody
*  russell comes along hilarious indian you know and make it fun of all races and people like holy shit
*  yeah and then it starts with that and then like what i love about joe it started with filipinos
*  and now everybody's enjoying it and i think like when i watched joe's journey it was like chel he
*  was already in full stride of like killing it and stand up then he got on chelsea then at work with
*  so everything kind of exposure like you said i i today it's kind of like american idol there's a
*  lot of kelly clarkson's but kelly clarkson won the first season of american idol carrie underwood won
*  whatever so these are great singers you just need exposure yeah exposure is everything podcasts the
*  beautiful thing about podcasts is every first of all comics unlike in the past like say if you were
*  the host of the tonight show and you were jay leno and then david letterman was the host of his show
*  you guys were in competition i guess that shit's on the same time fuck him fuck you and everyone's
*  backstabbing like these have deals like if you would go on one of those shows you couldn't go
*  on the other show i was still like that i think i think or maybe it's not as hardcore but yeah
*  that's so dumb it's so dumb but they had to do that back then because there was only one host of
*  the tonight show and there was only one host of this show and one host of that show i mean all
*  told that all the people on television that did late night talk shows there might have been six
*  six people and how many comics were there thousands hoping jay leno had a heart attack so
*  they could take that spot hoping cone o'brien would drop dead hoping hoping yeah right now it's
*  not like that anymore now everyone can have a podcast and everybody does each other's podcasts
*  and everybody tells everybody hey go see michael yo hey joe coy's hilarious hey i saw christalia
*  the other murder i saw you know i saw anthony jesslyn that crush it in the main room and
*  people love it they're happy that that other people are successful it's a good feeling so you
*  you see that too that that's only happened in the last like three or four years it's like i think
*  it's about five five years about five years yeah um i think it's all a part of this might be even
*  a little more than five years but the point is it's all part of this transition to the internet
*  because the transition to the internet is a transition of opulence like this where we're
*  all blessed there's there's abundance there's no scarcity like there used to be scarcity before it
*  was like oh there's only a few spots if you want to get a sitcom you and i show up in the audition
*  room i'm looking at you and you're looking at me and like you're playing for bob yeah you're gonna
*  play gay are you gonna play it how you gonna play it how you gonna play this yeah yeah oh good luck
*  with that choice you know backstab each other and get weird there was a lot of backstabby weird
*  shit in those days and that stuff's gone you know everybody's happy to see each other and also they
*  support each other on the road they take each other places like they do shows together and one
*  of the things that i realized early on you know you make less money if you take people on the
*  road with you and you pay for their flight you pay for their hotel and you pay for their meals but
*  you have so much fun but you have way more fun it's way more fun it's way more funny it goes from
*  being depressing like i've done the road by myself and you're sitting in a hotel room staring at the
*  fucking tv board you go counting down the time to the show and then you're working with some dick
*  shit some ass fuck from fucking pittsburgh that sucks and just like god this local guy is terrible
*  and you call your friends bro where are you you know i'm in baltimore are you any good no
*  hold the phone i'm working with sucks like yeah i wish we were doing a show together
*  and then i realized somewhere along the line that i for my own mental sanity i'd rather take a pay
*  cut and just take guys in the road with me so i started doing that i was doing that early on i
*  was doing that in like the early 2000s i was taking people in the road with me and too much to the it
*  was a problem sometimes like club owners were like we would like to book the opening acts i'm like
*  uh-uh yeah like we want to use our local guys i'm like i don't know them and then a lot of those guys
*  step on your material too like say if you have a bit about your dad oh yeah a bit that's real
*  similar about their dad you're like well it's a thing where ever since i started like once i
*  started headlining i've always brought my own people and yeah it is a bit and i don't make
*  close to the money you make but it's it's a thing where i know the investment it makes me a lot
*  better on stage because i know the whole show from start to end is going to be good oh yeah you know
*  i've had horrible experiences like i remember one time one of my friends couldn't come and man
*  hosts is just i mean literally 20 minutes of silence and then it's like all right here's your
*  headline and the audience is angry angry go up they've wasted their money i i think also uh just
*  being around uh the comics at the laugh factory improv and comedy store it's a thing where now
*  people before it's like oh if somebody crushes you know i don't want them to crush now people
*  love to go once they want to be a part of the great show not be the only funny one at the show
*  you know that's so insecure that not wanting anybody to be good here's the thing just didn't
*  you get into comedy because you like it yeah so bring people that are funny dude i brought joey
*  diaz with me from the start i know i had some rough shows early on where i was like dude i gotta
*  get better because joey'd be up there murdering and then i'd go up after i'm not doing so good
*  you know but it made me realize i had to step it up yeah but it's also like i wanted to laugh like
*  i want to have fun you know i not only did i bring joey in the road with me but this is during joey's
*  drug days i brought a second opening act in case joey didn't show up because joey did instead of
*  not booking joey i started booking ari so i brought booked ari and joey so if joey showed up great we
*  got three men show if joey didn't show up we got a two-man show but i always had an opening act that
*  way wow did he ever not show up a couple times okay not that many but it was always touch and go
*  yeah ever knew and sometimes you just leave on sunday i told you i'm leaving on sunday
*  i'm like you didn't tell me you leave it on sunday i don't do sundays okay okay i mean but can you say
*  the nicest human being i love him on earth i love him to death he's my brother every time i see him
*  man it's like yeah he's just so nice i love him i love him so much and i love him and i've uh i've
*  seen him on his full journey you know i've seen him from being this guy who's like fresh out of
*  jail was a fucking criminal when i first met him i could tell but i knew so many guys like that from
*  the pool hall and from fight gyms and i was like oh look at this real guy hanging around the comedy
*  store i'm like what's up man and joey and i we hit it off like that like immediately like immediately
*  and then to see him transform to being one of the best comics on earth it's uh it's so satisfying
*  to see him go and sell out the chicago theater chicago theater is 3,700 people he sold it out
*  like instantly he's a murderer he's so good he's so good no one no one on earth makes me laugh
*  harder there's a lot of great comics out there but joey's special to me he's special and the thing is
*  nobody can duplicate what he does like i can't touch it not at all not at all no it's amazing
*  but you know it's also he's he's a product of the comedy store like a real product of the comedy
*  store like that the freedom to take chances and to be loose and wild like that's that's where all that
*  stuff's from when you first met him was he like that like on stage no he had to learn how to be
*  that way okay off stage he was hilarious though he would hold court in the back like in the back
*  parking lot we'd all be hanging out back there and joey did just be telling us stories we'd be
*  falling down laughing and he would be good on stage he would do well but he would tighten up
*  he would worry about being cast in a movie you know that was always the thing like he wanted to
*  be in a movie or a show or and you know that that kind of pressure of worrying about people
*  what people care that's constricting and then somewhere along the line he just stopped giving
*  a fuck he just stopped giving a fuck and when he stopped giving a fuck he would just go up there
*  and destroy and it was a quick transition it was like he went from being like kind of good
*  doing okay but really funny off stage to figuring it out and if you ask him he just stopped giving
*  a fuck he just realized he goes i realize all these motherfuckers aren't gonna help me yeah like
*  they're not gonna help me fuck them they're all idiots and they'd come and go the agents would
*  get fired and he realized like what was i fucking thinking and he figured it out you know how long
*  did it take you to get to that point because i know like you were in the acting world and but
*  when did you get to that point well i started doing stand-up first i did stand up in 88 and
*  i never planned on acting i got into acting just because of stand-up i did a mtv half hour comedy
*  hour and from there i wound up getting a development deal and i wound up being on a sitcom and i didn't
*  really like it and i was ready to quit but i had already gotten a lease so i was out here and i
*  already had an apartment i was i was ready to go back to new york like 100 what didn't you like
*  about it i didn't like the actors oh that okay the actors on it i didn't but no the actors on
*  the show some of them i was friends with i enjoyed their company but there was a bunch of ones that
*  i meant that i did not like i didn't enjoy the circles like i'd go out with com with the actors
*  rather i'd go out to dinner with them they'd bring their friends like who's this fucking liar
*  you're bringing this crazy egomaniac like narcissist liar and we'll have to sit here and
*  have dinner with these people they so many of them are so crazy and again this is low level
*  people trying to get into acting like open micers right if you go to open mics you'll see the
*  occasional gem like wow that guy is probably going to make it and then you'll see oh this person's
*  fucking crazy they're hanging around this industry and you got that with acting too and i just i
*  didn't like it i didn't and i also didn't like the whole thing of needing people the auditioning
*  thing that you would get in la would develop a type of person that was just like very guarded
*  and fake and very they were trying to project what they wanted you to see rather than be who they
*  were i enjoyed new york i enjoyed boston i enjoyed the east coast it was just those are my people
*  so i didn't like it but i had a i had a lease so i stayed and so then i got on this news radio
*  show and i was on that for five years and then after that was over i was like okay i'm done with
*  this acting shit okay so what'd you say is that the time where you were like i tried a little bit
*  after that i did a little bit of it i did um i did some auditions and i got a couple of development
*  deals to do my own show but they were terrible and then fear factor came along and i was like
*  oh this makes sense i'll do this did you like it the whole time or no no no but it was money
*  it was money crazy money and it was also and it was the biggest show in the like in the u.s at
*  that time too at one point in time it was yeah and we did 148 episodes there was so many episodes
*  and then we came back and did six more it was um it was a good way to make money and not need
*  need hollywood anymore and that's when i really realized i don't want to act anymore that was
*  where it was the only thing i acted in at all after that was my friend kevin james's movies
*  just because he asked me to and we're buddies i did zoo keeper and here comes the boom but i
*  only did them for fun because i was his friend and um and then podcasting and when podcasting
*  came along then i was like in the beginning it was just fun like i didn't realize what was even
*  going on until many years in i was at the chicago theater the same place i was talking about where
*  joey sold out and uh i was gonna bring something up and i go i go so this happened how many guys
*  listen to the podcast and it went yeah and i was like whoa like i did not expect that
*  i didn't i don't pay attention to the numbers so i didn't know how many people were downloading
*  how many years in was this other podcast three or four four four yeah maybe four so six years ago
*  and i was like holy shit because for those years in the beginning it was nonsense first of all we'd
*  get barbecued out of our fucking minds for half the time i didn't know what i was saying while
*  saying it was a real problem um you know we didn't take it seriously didn't think people
*  were listening it was a fun silly way to get really fucked up and talk with friends and no one was
*  thinking it was it was like comedy in the early days yeah no one was thinking as a career it's
*  almost like in a green room you're just talking it's just fun yeah i enjoy people i do i enjoy
*  talking to people i like hearing how people think i like hearing people's perspectives
*  and so in the beginning it was like a lot of that just hanging out and making each other laugh and
*  talking shit and saying silly things and then that one day i'll never forget how many people
*  listen to the podcast that roar and i got nervous i was like oh no like what is this like what's
*  happening here like then i started to think like oh this is like a major part of my life a major
*  part of my career and i wasn't even realizing it was so this is like four years in wow yeah and then
*  i started getting guests that's when i started getting guests on like somewhere around four
*  years in i started getting guests and then like all these different people would come on but then
*  i'd ask people to be on it and then people had heard about it and they'd be on some people still
*  like what is a podcast like what are you doing yeah like a radio show on the internet like who's
*  listening like yeah well not that many people and then it just became what it is now but it became
*  what it is now almost like it had a mind of its own man and i really think that sometimes i really
*  think that i know that sounds really stupid because for sure i keep showing up but for sure
*  i pay attention for sure i try hard and for sure i work at it but i think his thing is like it
*  wanted to be made it sounds crazy but no i get you i get you it needed it like i don't even know
*  if it needed it it's like there was a place there was a spot that was open and that spot was open
*  for like honest conversation open-minded conversation and and inquisitive conversation
*  and letting people explain things over long periods of time and then some of those people just like
*  brian green who was a physicist who i had on the other day i have to listen to his podcast two or
*  three times just to try to really grasp what he was saying that happens all the time talk to brilliant
*  people you know aubrey de greay was on yesterday who's a an expert in anti-aging technologies
*  so we're talking about all this stuff and i'm just thinking like here i am talking this guy who spends
*  his entire life trying to extend people's lifespan to 500 plus years and he's in the middle of this
*  right now and he's running this institute in northern california that's designed or designing
*  all these different specific methods of extending life and they're experimenting and doing all these
*  different things and raising money and i'm like this is such a weird path i've gotten on but does
*  he really think he can do it oh yeah he can do it 500 years yeah they're on they're on the road to
*  that yeah with stem cells and a bunch of the different biologics that they're experimenting
*  with and all sorts of different and as the technology increases and grows and then crisper
*  which is a gene editing tool and a lot of the other things that they're probably going to invent
*  over the next three or five three to five years he believes is going to be some giant breakthroughs
*  so it's legitimate so is it more of the the benefit is the generations like the like two
*  generations after us are going to benefit heavily no i think we're going to benefit from it you think
*  so it'll be yeah it's regenerative regenerative rather meaning you're literally going to not just
*  stop aging it's going to regenerate to the point where it's going to what your biological age even
*  though your physical age your calendar age is the same the same you're going to keep getting older
*  that way your but your biological age is going to go backwards yeah because what they're doing is
*  they're treating they're treating aging like a disease they're not okay they're not treating it
*  like an inevitable aspect of life they treat well they're like well what's causing aging well break
*  down of the body due to normal stresses and just overall use okay well what is the difference
*  between someone who's five or six versus someone who's 50 or 60 well the body's ability to regenerate
*  tissue the body's ability to recover you know all these different things that are going on
*  inside the cells and what what causes that like what is the mitochondria what it would how does
*  how do we get that to function that's kind of like the nad stuff 100 yeah 100 that's one aspect
*  of it that nad is one piece in a giant mandala of different different methodologies and they're
*  they're gonna they're gonna be able to come up look just think about what they can do now versus
*  what they could do 50 years ago 50 years ago if you blew your knee out you were fucked yeah you
*  were fucked my friend steve graham a good buddy of mine he used to be on the u.s ski team
*  and his knees are destroyed he was uh on a ski team in the 80s and they they cut him open like
*  a fish like giant scars up and down the sides of his legs and they had to stitch things together
*  and bolt things down and it's just a mess in there just a fat mess and nowadays i mean both of my
*  knees have been reconstructed yeah i have two reconstructed acls they work great you know there's
*  no issues i mean i can do literally everything i do yoga kickbox all these different things
*  with reconstruction knees and i mean have you seen the way i kick a heavy bag there's
*  a an enormous amount of force that's on those knees no problem at all and when you think about
*  what they're going to be able to do 50 years from now they're going to make you an 18 year old
*  you're going to be able to regenerate tissue all the things that are happening to people's discs
*  where they get disc degenerative disc disease which i have which your discs get smaller and
*  actually your your your spinal columns actually compacted more and you have to like try to
*  mitigate that with spinal decompression a bunch of different things they're going to be able to
*  inject stem cells into that it's going to re regrow well they're already doing that right yeah yeah
*  yeah we're we're on the verge but my point is like how the fuck did i wind up talking to these people
*  what how how does all how do you know i didn't really pay much attention in school how am i
*  talking to these people like how did this how did all this happen how are presidential candidates
*  coming to me trying to get on the podcast so i can help them spread their message like what the
*  fuck happened i mean i really feel like it sounds like wacky woo woo but like there was an opening
*  in the universe it was like an opening and somehow or another i was the one who stepped through that
*  opening and i didn't even know i was doing it while i was doing it and this thing the seeds
*  were planted and this thing just grew and then i became responsible for taking care of it
*  well i think because you did it started out organic too 100 you didn't start saying i'm
*  gonna do this no because i know ambition but zero that's also a big problem with other people that
*  are trying to start podcasts i got a conversation when john love it's about it's like you don't know
*  anyone's paying me any money to do it i go they're not going to pay you any money if they don't make
*  any money and he goes well they should just pay money that way they can do it it'll be good and
*  i was like okay i got stuck with him on a plane once and he was trying to he was telling me you
*  have a podcast network i go no i don't yes you do put me on your network john i don't have a network
*  i do not have a network i had explained to him but his his thing was that somebody wanted him
*  to do a podcast but they didn't want to pay him they didn't want to pay him what he felt he should
*  get paid for a podcast i'm like they're not going to make any money until it's successful
*  the only way it's going to be successful is if you do it yeah and 99 percent of them aren't
*  successful but yeah but there's so many of them yeah there's 900 000 podcasts there's 300 and what
*  30 40 50 million people so what does that mean that means like one out of every 300 people has
*  a podcast yeah is that real is it yeah that's crazy yeah sounds right that's crazy wait there's
*  900 000 podcasts yeah that's crazy maybe they're international ones too but yeah yeah for sure
*  that sounds pretty close to right that's if let's let's cut out let's cut it in half because of
*  international okay so let's say one out of every six six yeah at least 500 one out of 500 people
*  has it that sounds not crazy right now that's insane that is insane i know that is probably
*  accurate my wife's friends have podcasts i got stopped by a black lady at an airport 80 years
*  old she goes i saw you on the drone roger podcast it's just amazing the range yeah i'm like how do
*  you like i because you know me i'm expecting a certain person like i had this really old guy come
*  up to me in a restaurant and he looked like he was deep in his 80s and it was just i just really
*  want you to know i enjoy your program it's like a very thoughtful program you have an interesting
*  way of looking at things i was like you you watch it wow yeah yeah i want to ask you about
*  yeah this may be i'll talk about the dante wilder excuse he came out with yet today what he's
*  unfortunate do you do you think uh is there any validity to that if there's look i put a you know
*  what a um um it's called uh what is it called an atlas pack yes i put an atlas pack on my back all
*  the time and i put a 45 pound plate on so it's about 55 pounds and i go hiking through the hills
*  and after i could still do whatever the fuck i want like and i'm just joe rogan i'm not a dante
*  fucking wilder the idea that dante wilder with a 40 pound outfit on that it killed his legs walk
*  into the ring that's crazy talk i don't understand why he would say that i mean maybe it's true if
*  it's true he said he had it on like 20 minutes before or 15 minutes before he went out it's
*  possible look it's possible that that tired him out it's possible see i'm not i'm not like i'm
*  no fight expert or anything so i just don't know if there's validity in it well who the fuck would
*  let him put that on if that was that heavy that it was 40 pounds that it got to the point where
*  it actually wore his body out as he was walking to the ring well he tried it on the night before
*  they said and he liked it so he's like i'm aware well he's he makes the decisions it was his
*  you know that's a crazy decision um no that's not what happened though i mean it might have wore
*  i mean he just got beat up it might have wore him out but the the real big thing happened in the
*  third round when tyson fury he he put that jab in his face and hit him with that beautiful overhand
*  right right on the ear and dropped him equilibrium went off after that because as that calls equal
*  yeah 100 okay because he was he was bleeding out of his out of his ear so that's a significant
*  injury it could be a ruptured eardrum when you get hit on the ear like that like a lot of times
*  your eardrum ruptures happens all the time and when that happens you don't know how to stand
*  upright your your body's all wacky it's not moving correctly and that's what it looked like with him
*  and that's what i was saying when i was watching it i was like his equilibrium's off i go this is
*  what's going on then eventually the commentator said it as well but his um his legs weren't under
*  him um but also he was getting bombed on oh yeah he was getting bombed on and tyson fury was uh
*  hanging on him he would wrap his arm around his head and lean on him with that 270 pounds so he's
*  carrying all that shit too like and tyson fury did something that had never been done before and
*  then he bullied deonte wilder he got on and he came in heavy and a lot of people thought he came
*  in too heavy but i think one of the reasons why he came in heavy is this is part of the strategy
*  he went to what's up you got something did not have a broken eardrum apparently a minor laceration
*  to his ear uh wilder did not have a broken jaw someone speculate nor did he have a broken
*  eardrum he had a two centimeter cut on his ear that took seven stitches to close defeat to fury
*  was the first of wilder's professional career that's interesting so uh even though he didn't
*  have a ruptured eardrum he still took a significant shot to the ear which oftentimes fucks up your
*  equilibrium and uh any shot to the temple to the ear a lot of times that fucks up your balance um
*  but like he got bombed on oh yeah and he and tyson fury figured something out in the first fight
*  that in the 12th round uh deonte did not like it when he came after him he said he doesn't fight
*  well backing up he said he's awkward on his feet and so instead of letting deonte come to him and
*  he was boxing like he did for most of the first fight he fought the second fight the way he fought
*  him in the second in the 12th round he came after him just get glued to his face run right after him
*  hit him on the right hand and uh he he bullied the bully you know and you know i don't mean
*  deonte's a bully like in a bad way i mean he's like his style is he's very aggressive he's
*  got one of the most ruthless punching knockout artists in the history of the sport if not the
*  number one i mean the guy has 42 knockouts which is insane like his or maybe the tyson
*  maybe has 41 40 i think he's got 41 knockouts 42 wins one by decision and one draw now he has one
*  loss tyson had less tyson went to the decision with a lot of people okay you know he went to
*  the decision with mitch blood green he went to the decision with uh i mean you can go down the list
*  there was a lot of people tyson's obviously one of the greats and obviously a brutal knockout artist
*  but deonte wilder has that touch of death it's crazy i mean he dropped tyson fury twice in their
*  first fight and the 12th round it looked like he was fucked but do you think they should have stopped
*  it at the seven or earlier i think it's better for his life and his career that they stopped it he
*  wasn't going to come back i don't think he was going to come back he's getting fucked up and
*  tyson fury was going to not going to stop punching him in the head either he was going to keep doing
*  it tyson was pure and clean and literally unharmed and looked fantastic i mean he'd been hit a couple
*  of times but no problems yeah there was nothing that rocked him nothing that hurt him you know a
*  few punches bounced off of him but he was putting it on deonte wilder i mean he was putting it on
*  him yeah if that is true that he had it on for 20 minutes and that it really wore him out that's
*  that's exceptionally silly on the part of his management to allow that to happen that someone
*  didn't see that that his trainer didn't see that they didn't recognize that that was going to be a
*  big problem because i didn't calculate it well i think he just threw it on the night before and
*  goes oh it feels good didn't really think i'm gonna be in this thing for close to 35 minutes
*  before i get on oh right you know he has to be back there 20 minutes then the walk up is like
*  three or four minutes and then you walking into the ring you got to carry it around while you're
*  walking in the ring yeah yeah you know it's good point it had an effect i guarantee you would have
*  an effect but the question is would it have enough of an effect that it would fuck his legs up to
*  the point where he couldn't recover maybe maybe it's valid the only the only comparison i have
*  and like i said i know nothing about boxing but if i hold my son is 35 pounds if i hold him for like
*  10 minutes i'm tired right but i'm not a professional boxer your arms are tired would you be tired
*  no my kid my not 11 year old's 80 pounds i walk around disneyland with her on my shoulders
*  yeah i can you know i could see but then again i'm not fighting afterwards yeah
*  just walking around i could see it having an effect how much of an effect is the question
*  it's just silly that they let him do it i mean if i picked that thing up and i was his his trainer
*  i'd be hey hey hey feel this now think about how long you're gonna have this on fuck this let's
*  just go out there norm i mean guarantee you next time you see him he's gonna be dressed like tyson
*  yeah just come out in the trunk yeah just trunks of fucking small towel around his neck like tyson
*  used to do that was so that was so intimidating the way that dude just came in he just socks he
*  just came in like what let's do this and just stormed towards that rain you would see death
*  coming down that aisle like oh my god what have i signed up for it was so true what have i signed
*  up for and when i read uh tyson's book and i interviewed he was like man i was like so he was
*  scared yeah every time i walked in a ring he was petrified yeah didn't look like a man well once
*  he got in there he you know he put himself into the position that he's been in many many many times
*  he was the destroyer but all the lead-up to i mean it's like anticipation fucks with everybody's head
*  yeah i think diante would be better than ever for the next fight the question is if tyson fury fights
*  in that same way and stays on him can he beat that tyson fury because tyson fury was just boxing his
*  face off who if when this does happen who who would you pick out the gate on this one you have
*  to pick tyson fury yeah because i think he won the first fight um diante knocked him down twice but
*  not only did he knock him down in the 12th round but tyson fury came back and won the remainder of
*  that round so you could almost give that round a draw and then the other round when he knocked him
*  down you got to give to diante wilder the remaining 10 rounds are not in dispute the remaining 10
*  rounds went to tyson fury so if you just look at it on paper he should have won that fight although
*  most people weren't upset with the decision because diante almost had him out and it's like
*  it's exciting let's do a rematch no big deal but then in the rematch tyson fury just took the
*  judges out of the fucking equation just bombed on him it's really unfortunate that there is a question
*  of whether or not that big stupid suit was wearing his legs out because if that really is the case
*  that bums me out man that's what he said but like i didn't think of it i was thinking it was a joke
*  until you told me that it was like he wore it for 20 minutes then i was like oh yeah
*  well that would be different that's different that's real weight you know if you just put it on you
*  walked out there for 30 seconds you had this 40 pound thing on yeah i still wouldn't advise it
*  no yeah it's not good but he had it on for at least 30 minutes i would if i'm guessing from the
*  walk in he said he had it on 20 minutes before the fight he had to do the walk up he had to get in a
*  ring in it yeah and he said when he took it off he knew that was the game changer he you gotta think
*  diante wilder coming into that fight has flatlined every single opponent he's faced except for tyson
*  fury stevern he didn't flatline him in the first fight he just beat him by decision beat the shit
*  out of him but in the second fight he fucking murked him so he was probably thinking he he
*  could murk anybody he all he has to do is touch him the way he did with louis sorties yes same
*  thing in the first fight had a tough first fight with him second fight murks him with one punch
*  i think he just had this thing in his head that that's what he does and he's going to do that to
*  tyson fury too and he never believed that tyson fury was actually going to fight that way
*  he was going to jump on him but tyson said he was going to do i know but i told him the game plan
*  like diante literally said you don't believe a word you're saying that's what he said he believes it
*  now he believes it now i'm real excited i'm excited i'm excited for the third one well they
*  were talking about him fighting anthony joshua uh tyson fury fighting anthony joshua first um
*  and if that does happen i think he beats anthony joshua i think tyson fury is the best heavyweight
*  on earth i do and i think the only person that could beat him is probably wilder if wilder can
*  recreate the success of the first fight and catch him do you think fights are i remember like after
*  tyson stopped boxing or after you know he lost i kind of lost a lot of interest in it because i
*  grew up with like sugar ray uh tommy herns and marvelous marvin haggler and i felt like i don't
*  see fights like that anymore oh well they're they're possible today i mean but you used to
*  see them all the time manny pacquiao was an amazing fight anytime terrence crofford fights
*  i'm in i love that guy but don't you miss phenomenal back then it seemed like every
*  fight was a great fight or is that just getting old and reminiscent yeah okay just reminiscing
*  there's some great fighters now earl spence jr of vasily lomachenko i mean it's a great time
*  for boxing it's a really great time utsik is now a heavyweight it's a great time for boxing
*  and before your crowd jumps on me like i don't know anything about boxing so i'm not saying
*  anything because i well i'm not a boxing expert i know i know some stuff about boxing because i'm
*  a fan but it's not like mma like if someone wants to talk to me about mma i can give you very
*  educated you know opinions on things and i can dissect things with boxing i have some opinions
*  but you know there's other people that are better at it yeah yeah it's a good time though i like it
*  i'll get into it then i'll get into it again now i'll let you know when something big is happening
*  when there's a big one you know we do these fight companions for uh for ufc fights we should do some
*  of them for boxing we've only done it for glory for kickboxing that's all we've done you should
*  do a boxing one i know we should we should have done it for that fight we would have went crazy
*  we would have went fucking crazy that was a while we knocked him down the third round i screamed
*  everybody in my house was like what the fuck is going on i know it i i i think they should have
*  stopped it in the fifth or six they could have done that too yeah but just he's diante wilder
*  one punch you could have one swing in right hand and next thing you know tyson fury's got a
*  flashlight in his face and he can't believe it he's like what huh it's over what happened
*  that's what diante does to people when he hit louis ortiz and the spray of sweat flew off his face
*  and ortiz crumbled and he had this look in his eyes like what just happened that is hit by god
*  like lightning bolts that's true that a lightning bolt come out of the sky like people can't believe
*  how hard he hits but the key to tyson fury's victory is he didn't let him hit him just jumped
*  on him and tyson fury has a unique style like that big motherfucker he's six nine he's so big
*  so big and so long and he's such a good boxer man no one in the heavyweight division has that
*  kind of head movement i don't know he's such a character yeah he says he jerked off seven
*  times a day to build his testosterone did you see that no you see you say he's going i'm gonna
*  sell gypsy lube he's got his own lube his own brand of personal lube that he beats off with
*  he says beaten off seven times a day increases his testosterone i don't know i don't know if
*  there's facts behind that i don't know that might be conjecture hey where is that special that i saw
*  of you there's you have a special oh yeah yeah yeah it's on amazon prime blazian that's what
*  it's called it's called blazian and what's crazy is it came out probably about eight months last
*  time i was on here but they just released it on dvd so my mom thinks i made it like it got
*  like it got released uh last week on dvd at best buy and target and my mom saw that target that's
*  hilarious your mom still buys dvds yeah i was like who buys dvds and you know comedy dynamics was
*  like yeah a company wanted to put it out so i was like all right cool but what i but the main thing
*  is i'm gonna be in new york i got this new tour new material i'm exhausted that's what it's called
*  it talks about my two kids the family all the things going on in the world and i'm at gotham
*  comedy club march seventh and eighth look at that yeah it's the diapers in the bottles now man
*  is that march oh it's i think it's march seventh today i'll put the wrong date on there but march
*  seventh and eighth fix that shit i am i am you put the wrong date on the fucking banner
*  oh my goodness i'm an idiot and then on the largest podcast in the world
*  all this it's march seventh and eighth seventh and eighth gotham comedy gonna try
*  buy tickets for the six and they're like what maybe they can squeeze you on the six too
*  no no it's my son's birthday oh there you go i gotta be there that's probably why you subliminally
*  accidentally put that you're thinking about that number oh man i can't miss my son's birthday no
*  of course not so michael yodak comfort ticket beautiful so this um special that's on amazon like
*  why did they release it now on dvd they said comedy dynamics i guess there's a dvd company
*  that invests in a couple specials a year and for some reason they invested in mine and thought it
*  could do well so and i was like who buys dvds and they go oh it's about three billion dollars a year
*  still whoa yeah and i'm like okay i'm glad most of those like action movies and shit but who buys
*  people live i don't even have a dvd sucks yeah where's that though rural america who
*  even rural america has internet not if you have a satellite the people with satellite you can't
*  really stream netflix and stuff with satellite unless you have really good satellite like how
*  good is good satellite now there's still redbox and like oh we can get a dvd yeah those are those
*  are big yeah there's a couple other companies like it i'm not i'm not shitting on redbox but i man
*  should have told blockbuster to hang in there netflix still sends them that's like the original
*  business they do not definitely still do yeah do yeah no no they don't oh yeah they got rid of that
*  no no i guarantee you they got rid of it still it's still no they got rid of it i know people
*  that do it use it they got rid of it i get look at are you just guessing no i know i i thought i
*  read an article that said they got rid of that like five years like three or four years ago
*  they don't have why would look hey get the dvd get the dvd if you want but i just don't know one
*  person like my mom didn't even buy my dvd that movies delivered right to your mailbox free
*  shipping no late fees is that netflix yeah it's dvd.com but it's dvd.netflix.com wow
*  that's crazy so it makes hanging in there so the the two facts i said comedy dynamics it's about
*  three billion dollars a year and aquaman made 17 million dollars off of dvds whoa right really
*  yes a bunch of ladies finger blast themselves to jason mamoa that's what that is it's pausing it's
*  the most paused movie ever at our library they just pause it when he's flexing nobody ever
*  nobody ever finishes the movie yeah it's the most watched two movie with a vibrator
*  yeah have you had roughly 212 million dvd blu ray and rentals account for one point three point
*  one point three four percent of netflix revenue wow 2.7 million subscribers as of last year so
*  they made 212 million just from dvds last year and that's just netflix just wait renting that's
*  just renting that's not even owning that's running yeah yeah there's money you better hey joe you
*  better put out a dvd quick i don't know yeah middle america netflix i wonder if they put my
*  shit on dvd i'm sure you can triggered or strange times is on dvds i don't know yeah it's um people
*  are still doing it but i think well that's one thing that i am curious about though like what's
*  the best satellite downloads you can get like what do you mean what's a satellite download like
*  if you're in the middle of the country you can get satellite internet when the upload is terrible
*  but the download i think now everybody has good internet i don't i can't that's what elon's trying
*  to fix that problem with yeah he's filling the sky up with junk stuff's floating around up there
*  animal amateur astronomers getting pissed they think they're seeing ufos just elon satellites
*  what is um have you ever had a tesla or do you have a tesla yeah do you let it drive yourself
*  um on the highway i hit it but i keep my hand on the steering wheel okay i love it i heard it's
*  great no i i've no it's amazing but my friend was like yeah man i had a late show in san diego
*  and i just let it drive me home i had my hands on the wheel but i wasn't really paying attention i
*  was like that's crazy that's kind of crazy i pay attention but if you are kind of tired it's a good
*  way to just chill out put your hand on the wheel and just let the car do most of the work does a
*  lot of the work so it changes lanes oh yeah it'll change lanes it'll do everything
*  yeah you just put in your address and even when you get to the normal streets it'll turn and all
*  that stuff there's a thing that you can get that i got that i haven't used that's like some new
*  higher level version of auto drive i haven't done that and i don't necessarily know what that does
*  specifically different than what i had before but it was a new update and it was like four grand so
*  i was like all right let's see on show me what you haven't used it yet no first of all i told
*  elon i was going to buy one of those things because he came on the podcast he was telling
*  me about it i was like all right i'll get one i'll get one and i got it and he was right it's the
*  most amazing car i've ever driven most amazing car i've ever driven by far did you get the suv
*  or the car i got the car okay i got the model sp100 d which is like the top of the food chain
*  okay s series four doors the rims everything dude it's so fast it's so fast it doesn't even make
*  sense you you hit the gas it's like you you know there's no gas you hit the accelerator you hit
*  that electricity and you're gone you hit that juice and you hit the juice and you are on a
*  roller coaster ride it just pins you to your chair silent completely silent you're like holy
*  fuck there's a holy fuck moment where i take people in my car and i stomp on the gas i'm like you ready
*  i got took tim dylan i drove him from the improv the other night and he got my car you ready he
*  goes yeah i go he's like what what the fuck i go yeah what the fuck man is that that
*  one four seconds is that that boost it's called ludicrous mode ludicrous mode yeah 2.4 seconds
*  zero to 60 it is insanity it's so fast it's so fast but that's only part of the car the other
*  thing is the comfort it's beautiful it's so smooth and so easy to drive and the the dashboard once
*  you get used to having this fucking huge like bigger than any ipad yeah as you're seeing your
*  main navigation screen like navigation is way better and the voice prompts like you can say to
*  like say um you want to talk about a restaurant like uh like felix is my favorite restaurant
*  locks at los angeles in venice i'll say navigate to felix restaurant in venice and it'll just go
*  and it'll just show you on the thing and like all of a sudden it's there and we get so the voice
*  commands are so good and it'll just take you there and it'll take you on autopilot if you want
*  and it's it's fucking madness you're living in the future and one of those things i i my dad you know
*  he he's a nuclear physicist and he goes you will never see i mean you'll see the 30 the 44 years
*  i've lived the technology we've seen from not being around to being around yeah he goes they'll
*  improve it it'll get better but all the stuff that was made in that short amount of time that
*  you didn't have the internet yeah cell phones uh you know you'll never see that again in a while
*  but it'll be better it'll always get better like you now you have cars that drive themselves now
*  you new things new things yeah you know it's crazy man just to think about like because my dad
*  they had a car same type of car just went a little bit faster they added a cd or a
*  a track a little bit of breaks a little better break oh now it's a cd player yeah oh the tape
*  player you know yeah but still a car we go from that to oh the car's gonna drive itself yeah
*  well they have a new tesla coming out the tesla roadster that's 1.9 seconds zero to 60 top speed
*  of 250 miles an hour and the range is 600 miles so i can go 600 miles without getting recharged
*  and it looks dope as fuck it looks like a little spaceship like a little spaceship fuck the ferrari
*  that's what it looks like it's the dopest looking car on the road it's not on the road yet there's
*  yeah they're still developing it i want to like my thing is not speed like i i could care less
*  about speed like yesterday i was literally driving i was like wow i'm flying i was going 58 miles per
*  hour like i'm not about speed at all but but i am about like i don't ever want to go to the gas
*  station again so i'm thinking about it in the future to get a tesla or some type of car that
*  where i don't does your house have a little plug area where you can oh yeah yeah the house came
*  with it you know get one are you into the solar thing yet on the on the top of the roof yeah
*  where you've yeah well my my house right now the i was going to get tesla panels yeah but i can't
*  get tesla panels on my roof because the pitch of my roof but i'm getting them on the side of the
*  where the lawn is the so you want to go completely off the grid yes okay well what if the shit hits
*  the fan son i know you want to keep that refrigerator running you know you don't want to
*  have to fucking try to kill a squirrel in your neighborhoods and you know what it's not i mean
*  look it's a lot of money but it's not as much as you think no to do like my friend just did a roof
*  for like 50 grand you know and he'll never have to pay for electricity yeah and you actually
*  sometimes get money back from the grid it's a it's a unique time one of the things that tesla
*  or elon is doing that's really intriguing to me that i'm i have guarded skepticism not guarded
*  guarded optimism i should say is uh neurolink do you know about that i've heard i heard the podcast
*  when he was talking or i've heard something about him probably gonna drill holes in people's heads
*  and put wires in there yeah what no i'm not for that like what is that where's that gonna go
*  if that gets implemented and it will where is you know isn't it you're supposed to be able like
*  if you think about something it's almost like a computer you'll see it yes you'll be able to
*  download yes you'll be able to access information much quicker it'll increase your bandwidth to
*  access information i don't totally understand it i've had it explained to me multiple times but
*  i'm fucking stupid so it doesn't all get in there but what i'm thinking is go back to the iphone one
*  right and then think about how clunky that little piece of shit is and that was only 10 years ago
*  now look at your iphone whatever that is or this one this is the 11 yeah i got 11 too they're
*  fucking amazing yeah they're amazing but but but like it's not going to get any better there'll
*  be more features but it's not going to get any better well it's way better in terms of its ability
*  to download things yes like and then like a step a step better how about this the new samsung phones
*  there's a samsung galaxy s20 s 20 ultra that's just about to come out it has 5g so the speeds are
*  spectacular for the internet where 5g is available and it has a 108 108 megapixel camera that's
*  insane but why do you need that much a hundred times a hundred zoom hundred so that means like
*  you can see some shit that's a hundred times smaller than what you'd be able to see normally
*  okay but why do we need that why do you not need it grandpa but why do you need what you need cars
*  my horse is a good horse i feed them hay but what do you treat them well and we have a wonderful
*  relationship no ride them around no i'm not that dude what do you need that for what are you going
*  to take a picture of that you need to show that i can't see with one zoom damn i understand how
*  he doesn't get it like like like what you're spying on someone there no okay if you're an fbi
*  spy well if you're like how about you some shit is going down how about you're at the comic store
*  and you see a fistfight down the street and like these two people are beating the fuck out of each
*  other oh my god you zoom the shit in okay and you can film it okay from way way way far away
*  go get to go walk closer and get a good shot of that there's a reason why is the reason to have
*  as many megapixels you have now it's not one is fine it's not iphone one it's not no it's not now
*  see that picture that i have in the bathroom of the hooker with her her tit out no i've never been
*  to your bathroom oh there's a picture in the bathroom that i took when i had a flip phone
*  when i was filming fear factor we were in downtown la and this lady was walking by she was eating a
*  meatball sub she has a wig on and sunglasses and it's like i it's literally like i hired her
*  to pose for this picture because it's so perfect and she pulls her tit out she goes you want some
*  of this baby and i just snap a picture of it she smiled and she took off and then that picture
*  i put it online in text america which eventually became what instagram is today and then uh we
*  found it online got sent it to a printer had it blown up and now it's a framed picture and you
*  would swear i hired someone it's perfectly framed there's like a fucking 18 wheeler behind this lady
*  she's walking with a meatball sub with her tit out i took that out of the one megapixel camera
*  and it's perfect it's pretty good okay so why do you need a hundred of them this is better
*  this is a concept of the neurolink uh potential app i suppose oh it's an app that they they don't
*  really know i don't think this is just like a concept but what people linked on here is that
*  a little menu pops up and it says learn skills as though you're in the matrix oh jesus christ
*  maybe download a skill or upload a skill to your brain and now you can the problem with that is
*  everybody that's that's the problem that's the problem no that's the problem then everybody can
*  do things they don't put any work into you take the that's great no everybody can just
*  fucking fly across the country you don't even have to traverse though the place where i eat my sister
*  after she's died okay let me put it like this then anybody could do stand-up comedy no you can't well
*  if you have an ash for you ain't teaching people shit creatively or artistically good luck you
*  think you could teach people how to be dave chapelle no no chance no you can't with that
*  either but i just i'm gonna be able to do it that's gonna be good for us because out of all that
*  shit they still can't do that that's true good luck bitch gotta put in those numbers but what
*  that can do is help you download information i don't know what that is gonna be but i know elon musk
*  is way smarter than us well they have been in our lifetime yes i think so will you will you do it
*  i'm not gonna be an early adopter yeah it's like people that got the first fake tits those ladies
*  got cancer yeah you know i'm saying do you know girls are getting butt cancer now are they really
*  from fake butts i didn't know that yeah i know i know someone botched but cancer yeah yeah they
*  were the one i was watching a clip off a botched the other day this girl had a fake butt and they
*  were just trying to fix it and it's just this disaster this poor lady they it was just it's
*  just like the surface of the moon it was just all dented in fucked up and you know what it is it's
*  the cardassians man they ruined it it's well i i think it's i think it's every every uh generation
*  or or even century you can go back to the old days where the most of the the body that's hardest
*  to get is the most popular body kings were fat because they had a lot of food right peasants
*  weren't but they wanted to be fat right because it showed a sign of money yes and then it was i
*  believe the 50s it was all about rail thin no butt no boobs just rail and then because that was hard
*  to obtain you know because most people aren't born like that now the cardassians it takes money i
*  guess for a lot of women to achieve that and money and money the amount of money where you don't have
*  the disposable income to do it right so not a lot of people can do it so it seems like the most
*  popular body for women is the bodies the hardest to obtain it's never like a normal body is
*  beautiful it's always like no we need very large butts well it's also what you see in media right
*  100 that's why a lot of women thought that it would be really good to be rail thin because they
*  saw models because designers clothing clothing designers like models to be rail thin because
*  they're like a hanger like there's no weird big tits and big ass that makes their clothing
*  not stand out that it's just about the hanger but what changed because it's still like that
*  as far as my yeah with my clothing with clothing so what changed what changed is social media
*  yeah social media there's a lot of butt girls that are just online i had a proud moment the other
*  day my nine-year-old we're at a restaurant this lady walked by my nine-year-old she pulls at me
*  she goes daddy she's got diaper butt because that's what i call it i call it diaper butt when
*  those girls get fake butts because it looks like they're wearing a full diaper like it doesn't fit
*  your legs it doesn't look normal yeah but she goes daddy she's got diaper butt i was like yes
*  that's what it is it's diaper butt it looks like a diaper their legs are really skinny it's just
*  crazy like this giant dump in your diaper like you just shit your pants and just just walking
*  around waiting to get home it's a mess but you're right though it's unobtainable
*  unobtainable difficult to obtain yeah it's also completely exaggerated right like giant tits
*  small waist enormous ass giant lips yeah oh that's the saddest one because that doesn't work
*  no you look like a fish oh the lip one is such a bad move and you're you're ruining the thing you
*  kiss with it's like your fucking lips what is something that guys do though that i can't i
*  was thinking like imagine if guys did have like big dick implants they were all every guy would
*  do their dick stretched out guys can't have even toupees guys guys can't have like if a guy has
*  like fake eyebrows girls are like what a guy with fake lips imagine if a guy got his in the gay
*  community to do it though do it yeah yeah yeah there's certain silly gay guys that get their
*  lips done i've seen gay guys you're talking to them it's like super distracting like because
*  they're like this oh okay so they do with the okay lip injections yeah they're doing the same
*  thing that a lot of women are doing but the it's just the lips are weird because i think people
*  saw that the tits worked and no one cared like obviously you see a lot of girls with fake tits
*  and no one seems to mind and guys think it's kind of but it did they did mind the first like three
*  or four everybody would kind of make fun of them but now it's like it's so it's acceptable now what
*  are you playing music what are you doing well there's i was gonna bring up there's this video
*  that's been going around i was gonna ask if this is like a new thing or just just like the internet
*  got it but like it's a wigs for men but like it's gone viral online a few times over the last few
*  months oh have you seen like shaving a guy's head and then gluing on oh i have seen a wig do you
*  know how sweaty that must be oh i see so is it new though or is this sort of just being redone
*  i don't know i don't know i read a comment because i saw this it's not gonna stay
*  see the thing they're saying it does you replace it every six weeks or something like
*  but what happens at week five a girl tries to grab it your hair always hair looks like it looks that
*  good wow no it's like next level that's amazing damn see me next week not saying shit before what
*  did it say before what was that before well show it where it said before because before
*  where's before that's after before before that buddy there you go so there's his hair
*  keep it rolling and it says before oh so you had some hair oh there's ones that the person is
*  completely bald and it looks like that after they're done i've seen uh ones with black dudes i've
*  seen black dudes get that and it's real weird like they oh jesus yeah yeah look at that it's
*  a straight-up wig yeah oh my god how's it look so they shaved his head let that go let that play
*  stop stop moving around i want to see what the fuck there's like a highlight video that shows
*  lots of guys getting this done so you can see lots of but i want to see that part we were just
*  looking at go back to that part we were just looking at where they're working on the glue
*  is that happen that guy has one too yeah that's so weird oh my god so weird
*  and then they well the stem cell treatments that they have for uh hair loss are very interesting
*  that shit is actually working where they're actually growing hair back through stem but you
*  have to have the hair to grow back i believe that's that that's the misconception a lot of
*  people have about it if you don't if you've lost the hair it's all gone if it's all gone they can't
*  it doesn't come back if you have a little then it can yeah that's uh girls are not gonna like that
*  girls don't like guys that have fake shit i dated a girl when i first moved to la she had a shaved
*  head she wore wigs all the time i didn't give a fuck but imagine if i just started wearing wigs
*  everywhere my wife would be like what are you doing like it's just my new look i want to be like
*  tarzan there's some things like this that i've noticed have popped back up and gotten famous
*  again like they've already been around the 80s and 90s but like because people weren't online or
*  just didn't go viral in that way it's snuck back in and people are like oh look at this brand new
*  thing and it's like it's not new at all i didn't even know this before i didn't even know women
*  had fake hair till i moved to la oh like weaves the weaves i knew nothing about it so the first
*  time i hooked up with a girl out here when i first moved here i went out like you know she was in a
*  bed and i went out to the living room and i i thought it was an animal on my couch
*  it was her hair like i didn't know that they did that and then i started working for eat they had
*  a wall full of hair for all the girls a wall full of hair so they would like for different girls they
*  would have a color that matched their hair yeah each girl had their own like row a hair and when
*  you're like when you're from texas which is like in texas i never saw that and i was just shocked
*  that it went to that degree i didn't even know that happened well i think girls are doing that
*  in texas too they just didn't tell you well that's a common thing that we've with no i i don't think
*  it's well at that time i don't think no because i think it's more of a tv thing it's definitely
*  more of a tv because they're like oh we need your hair longer shorter thicker in texas they
*  wouldn't do that yeah maybe nah that was weird i wonder what's happening to people the people
*  are losing hair like we're evolving right if you go if you look at all the other primates
*  none of the other primates as they get older lose their hair but we have less hair than all the
*  primates right so our whole bodies are losing hair and we're the weird thing is like we definitely
*  came from them if you pay attention like we played this guy um put this guy on the the
*  images on the podcast before what is his name uh ruslan chev he's this russian wrestler who is a
*  gorilla he's a gorilla man and he's a fucking savage he just throws people around like ragdolls
*  but you're looking at me like oh well clearly this guy is in a different stage of evolution than some
*  of us you know he's like he's more more savage but as people evolve further and further i think
*  we're gonna look like aliens i think we're gonna lose all our hair and i think we're gonna grow big
*  ass heads because you don't need the hair you're gonna need the hair that elon musk neurolink is
*  going to change the way our brains function we're going to do everything with our brains we're going
*  to be communicating through those things the the 50th or 60th version of that you know just like
*  the iphone 1 versus the samsung galaxy s20 with 108 megapixel camera if you came out with that
*  camera and that phone 10 years ago they'd choose you of witchcraft yeah who the fuck are you what
*  is this how'd you do this in you know a thousand years we're probably all going to look like that
*  you know what i know you're big on aliens i just don't believe it i mean we talked about this last
*  time you don't believe it at all i believe there's other species life forms you just don't believe
*  they've been here i don't think they're coming here no i there's no reason to come here we are
*  offering nothing what are you talking about what are we offering joe well if you're that far in it
*  people travel to go study small mammals in the congo do you know that yes they spend giant chunks
*  of their life to go look at butterflies we found a new frog in south america and the national
*  geographic society will give them money we've we're going to document this frog people are curious
*  and anything that's going to be intelligent and innovative anything that's going to invent
*  technology the only reason why you invent technology is because you are curious and if you
*  are curious you're not going to stop being curious you're going to continue to be curious
*  and if you have a fucking whole planet filled with predatory apes that have thermonuclear weapons
*  and they want to control various patches of land that they've designated on maps with lines and
*  they put stupid fucking fences up and they nuke each other and they fucking fly planes and drop
*  bombs out and they have other planes that they fucking operate remotely with these little
*  joysticks and drop bombs on people we kill terrorists and some of the people that run the
*  country are terrorists and and then you have the stock market like what the fuck are these people
*  doing the stock markets what is that a bunch of numbers that are bouncing around they're trying
*  to speculate what's going to go this and it's based on confidence oh my god these people are crazy
*  and then they have the ability to send video through the air and it reaches their phone on
*  the other side of the world instantaneously like whoa this is really heavy stuff these fucking crazy
*  monkeys down on planet earth are weird we should study them of course they would study us there
*  we're we're sending rockets into space we're invading other other planets in our solar system
*  to try to colonize if they're coming here yeah that's basic to them all that stuff you just
*  mentioned is so basic who is who says you know to get here they have to have technology we haven't
*  even no they don't no they have to have technology that's slightly more advanced than us we will be
*  able to unquestionably travel to other planets within 100 years or 200 years let's say three
*  let's say 300 okay so it's comparing us to people that live in 1720 right that's not that long okay
*  so it's like we went back in time to visit people in the 1700s we'd be fascinated and we'd be very
*  interested if we found a planet somewhere 300 years from now that had people on that planet
*  that live like people lived here in the 1700s we would be blown away i just think it's the most
*  unique and interesting thing we've ever found ever in life i just don't know with everyone having a
*  cell phone can take footage why don't they have like real why don't multiple people have the same
*  footage of the same thing like it happens they do there are some sightings particularly the phoenix
*  lights that happened in the 90s that many many people captured they don't know exactly what they
*  are they don't know what but a lot of people captured these lights that are in the sky now
*  my take on the phoenix lights and a lot of these things is usually that there's some sort of a
*  military aircraft they're working on but here's the thing they don't have to visit all the time
*  if they only visited once or twice these unique experiences that have happened once or twice over
*  the course of human history or three times or ten times or a hundred times what are the odds that
*  anyone's going to capture it especially if they're smart about it especially they're smart about how
*  they come especially if they have some sort of cloaking apparatus or they have some ability to
*  understand when they're not they're being viewed or observed and know knowing how to hide or how
*  to camouflage the ships but of course they would be interested i know that's the least
*  plausible scenario that they wouldn't be interested in us the the thing that kind of
*  the thing that was interested in me when you interviewed snow his he's been through everything
*  and he found snowden he found no evidence but he hasn't been through everything first of all he's
*  only one man and he was only working there for a short amount of time okay it's not like he's
*  but he had access to a lot but it's not like he's working there for hundreds of years and deeply
*  diving into the subject of ufos and has access to and not only that like what does he have access
*  to his access to the nsa files and like everything's compartmentalized you know that's one of the big
*  problems with the military is that the nasa does not have access to what the navy has access to
*  which doesn't have access to what the army has access to like they don't always cooperate and
*  so for him to say that he didn't find anything about ufos that makes sense like he probably even
*  looked a little bit and didn't find anything about ufos that doesn't mean there's nothing about ufos
*  it just means that he didn't find anything okay okay there's a lot of information out there when
*  you think about one person that's going to scour all the government records i understand from the
*  1950s to present about what they've discovered and what they haven't so you so area 51 what do
*  you think is in there do you think now nothing now you think nothing now i think at one point
*  in time is what well it is for sure one point in time what they use to work on secret military
*  projects what aircrafts and that's where the blackbird came out of that's where the stealth
*  bomber came out of there was a lot of that stuff that a lot of people mistook for ufos i think the
*  real question lies in the very small percentage of unexplained sightings so if you look at ufo
*  sightings you take the pie of ufo sightings i would say there's not me they say what they're
*  talking about that's been solved is someone in the neighborhood of 95 of those 95 can be explained
*  by swamp gas ball lightning ball lightning is a phenomenon that comes when depending upon tectonic
*  pressure the earth can release this lightning out of the ground that travels in a ball shaped
*  pattern and zigs through the sky and then vanishes and disappears they don't totally
*  understand how it's being created but they do know it requires some pressure in the earth something
*  about tectonic plates and possibly different atmospheric conditions but it's a real observable
*  phenomenon that's actually occurred on planes before like it's flown down the the the passageway
*  of a jet at one point in time yeah people multiple people observed this ball lightning and they
*  thought they were being aborted by a fucking ufo or something it's a weird you've never seen it no
*  it's very weird phenomena see get get a video on we should probably wrap this up too it's three hours
*  and 30 minutes um um get that um get get a video on ball lightning because they have observed this
*  and filmed this it's really fascinating that's that's responsible for a lot of ufo sight but you
*  said there's that five percent that can't be explained maybe out of that five percent four
*  percent they just haven't figured out how to explain like let me see this see like that is
*  ball lightning okay hovered in the sky and sometimes they'll fly around sometimes not only do they
*  hover in place but they move around so lightning crackles and then this thing will hover in the sky
*  and then sometimes they actually come out of the ground you know this is a bad comparison probably
*  but it's almost like an ash you know when you this is a bad video see if there's um
*  um you know i understand but the problem is this all these other people talking in it
*  there's different videos of ball lightning that i've watched it's pretty interesting shit man
*  ball lightning is weird because it's uh it's see like like there it's okay it flies around and it
*  looks like a fucking ufo see and then it disappears so okay that's a weird one that's a weird one that
*  kind of looks like it would be an alien spacecraft and then they get videos of it and you know it
*  looks like a ball flying through the sky people like oh my god it's ufo but it's just a very rare
*  atmospheric uh occurrence huh yeah yeah but i think if i was an alien species 500 years more advanced
*  than we are i would be fucking fascinated by earth and that was that's all you need 500 years from
*  now with the exponential growth of technology like we're experiencing on earth 500 years from
*  now if we don't blow ourselves up or if they're different than us like maybe they evolve different
*  and they don't have the same battle for resources so they didn't develop the kind of territorial
*  behavior that us apes have if they develop something more complex and a different sort of
*  cooperative evolutionary mechanism they could be very different than us but still way more advanced
*  but interested in us okay all right will you ever see one in your lifetime i don't know man i don't
*  haven't yet i don't think you will i got something right here you want to see him no i don't what's in
*  there mushrooms oh you can eat aliens you just gotta take the right dose i always said i always
*  said if if i ever do smoke weed i'm gonna smoke weed my first time with joe robert how do you not
*  want to smoke weed huh aren't you curious oh of course what are you scared of nothing so why don't
*  you do it well i said if i ever smoke weed i'll smoke it for the first time with joe robert just
*  not on air i'm not elon musk or anything but i'm not scared of it at all well i just don't
*  i'm not interested not curious i mean it the curiosity does not like knock on the door every
*  day and go oh my god you guys we should just set a day to side three years from now think about it
*  for three years no i've already decided i'm gonna do it okay when huh next week it will be with you
*  camera off shut the camera off no we're not you gotta drive yeah i gotta drive home i don't want
*  another day 100 okay 100 maybe we'll do it and we'll meet aliens
*  aliens you're an alien man this whole alien thing aliens they're gonna visit you tonight
*  no they're not no you know what i'm i can guarantee you nobody's coming tonight that's they're gonna
*  get them now like this motherfucker needs a lesson oh humiliating you merely from space you see this
*  oh last question who's gonna win bernie sanders the trump you know how everybody thought that
*  donald trump's fucked and that hillary clinton was gonna beat him and that no one was concerned
*  yeah all these people like he doesn't have a chance hillary's gonna be the winner hillary's
*  gonna be the winner that same shit could be going on with bernie sanders and trump and people got
*  to be real careful about that these people that think that bernie sanders can't win i don't think
*  you understand what's going on in this country people are fed up with the system they're fed up
*  with this idea that they work so hard and they they give their money up to politicians and the
*  politicians don't really work for the people they don't they don't can i tell you the most annoying
*  thing a politician says uh well you know i speak for the american people i'm like no you don't
*  no no no you can't because there's not a single human that can speak for all the american people
*  i hate could look out for the interests of the american people and i think bernie sanders
*  definitely does do that i think he's looking out for the interests of the working people and i think
*  he wants people to have a better life and do better and i'm all for that and if that means i
*  have to pay more and tag like people think oh you're a socialist i've heard people say that oh you're
*  fucking socialist bro like first of all he's not even a socialist he's a democratic socialist it's
*  a different thing he's not necessary he's not like everyone should have the even amount of money and
*  we should all give up our money to the institution and then the institutions to decide how it gets
*  divided and you shouldn't be able to make more than x amount of dollars that's not what he's saying
*  what he's saying is it should work for the people and what he's saying is people should have health
*  care what he's saying is there's a lot of things that are already socialist ideals that we use we
*  just forgot about it like the fire department the fire department you don't have a private fire
*  department that puts out your fire we pay for the fire department it comes out of our taxes it pays
*  those those very brave men and women and then they come and they put out your fire that's a socialist
*  idea public schools are a socialist idea police are socialist idea fixing of the roads there's a
*  lot of things that your money goes to the idea that you we can't extend that and to have a better
*  life because of it and to have free health care and free college education and to eliminate student
*  debt i don't know that that's incorrect i don't know that he's wrong yeah i i just think it's a
*  thing where our government to me and i'm no expert but it seems like they throw so much money away
*  why not if you're gonna throw it away do something good with it you know and it seems like he has
*  throwing it away then exactly that would be actually doing something good with it yeah he's got
*  crazy ideas and if they're right it's revolutionary and that's what he thinks he thinks he can enact
*  revolutionary change but it's free health care revolutionary when pretty much the whole
*  is us yeah yeah because it's going to take out the drug companies and there's a lot of money a lot of
*  money that's a big problem yes that's one of our biggest problems is the amount of influence
*  that not just the drug companies have but a lot of industry has on the way politicians decide how
*  to spend your money yes and that's what he says but that's that's one of the things he's saying
*  that makes people scared and that's why the the democrats are scared of him too because they're
*  all getting paid as well yeah it's not like this is a republican thing only no listen this is a
*  fucking this is an established institution thing but it also proves that like with michael
*  bloomberg spending all this money that when he goes to super tuesday he's gonna get 13%
*  they're guesstimating about 13% it's just and he's gonna pass up a lot of people that have been
*  campaigning it shows you how much money you know even can play in in our politics by being on every
*  five minutes yeah you know he's not gonna win he's blowing all that cash no he's not gonna win
*  it's gonna be a tax write-off for him jamie what were you telling me about people getting paid
*  to say things for him more than i just like spending a lot of money on like uh the people
*  posting online like memes and making all sorts of accounts like they went after all of the i don't
*  know top but like uh instagram accounts like the influencers meme accounts really and they
*  really offered the money strategy yeah give them some money like hey what would you do to post this
*  and they all end up posting the conversation instead of what they're asking to post which that
*  was the strategy it's like these weird strategies they have think tanks spending millions of dollars
*  to get that done thinking it's going to create well i you know you know what i do like about
*  bernie sanders he's the exact now don't take this wrong the exact same energy and vibe that trump has
*  on it loud says it like it is to him whatever his thoughts are so really if they go against each
*  other it's almost the same person i'm not talking policies at all i'm just saying this
*  characteristics you know where bernie's not going to back down from trump and trump's not going to
*  back down against bernie and all these people going well i don't know if bernie's electable it's like
*  there are no rules anymore can we just say him not being electable ridiculous he's won three
*  primaries in a row that's what i'm saying yeah it's just it's just ridiculous i'm just i'm just
*  waiting to see how it plays out i'm the i'm the one where it's like you know let's just see i want
*  to see who the democratic person is and and then we all got a role with him if you're on that i think
*  it's bernie yeah i think it's going to be bernie unless he has a heart attack and the cia gets him
*  with that fucking injection well you know what you know what it is it's not about bernie it's if he
*  becomes president who's the vice president because bernie's old i'm not and i'm not wishing anything
*  ill but that vice president pick is very important especially after the heart thing yeah it's very
*  important and a lot of people are saying he should get elizabeth warren because you because his age
*  i think more dangerous than she is useful okay like i don't know that well don't trust her after
*  that whole pocahontas shit all the indian stuff which she said she was native american it turns
*  out she's like one one hundredth of a percent or whatever the fuck it is but is that in today's
*  it's also she was a republican for most of her career yeah and she churned over and became a
*  democrat man maybe maybe she would get the women on their side i think but she's also an established
*  democrat you know that that takes money i think be more likely that he would get someone that we
*  haven't heard of okay well it's very important whoever his vice president because i'm just saying
*  but you remember mike pence like nobody knew who the fuck mike pence was before donald trump made
*  him our vice president you go on street and ask people who the vice president is 99 percent of
*  them are gonna go oh i don't know most people don't know who mike pence is yeah all right i think the
*  real battle is bernie and trump that's the real battle no no i got you and i don't think the vice
*  president is going to move the election but i'm saying because he's old because he's old had the
*  heart problem yeah you know the vice president is more important than like an obama vice president
*  i think tulsi gabbard makes the most sense because she's also like him she doesn't accept money
*  it's the same same sort of uh renegade uh philosophy you know slightly different politics but
*  you know there's a i think he has a lot of options he's probably looking at him right now
*  especially if he keeps winning it's like that joe rogan let's bring him up no chance no well
*  when you do go to after he wins when you go to white house just just bring your boy right here
*  because i want to go to white house with you i don't think you'll have me after the last uh
*  brouhaha after he uh put that video up and everybody got upset oh he'll have you i think
*  what's gonna happen is we're gonna see that regular politics the way they've been practiced
*  for all these years in this country with like these two bullshit choices are gonna go away and
*  i think it's gonna be harder and harder for established people whether it's republican or
*  democrat to to to keep doing that song and dance and having people buy it and that's a good thing
*  that's a good thing it's a good thing let's wrap it up michael yo ladies and gentlemen on instagram
*  uh don't pay attention to his gotham because it's not six in the seventh it's actually
*  seven and the eighth yes um where else are you gonna be where people where people go
