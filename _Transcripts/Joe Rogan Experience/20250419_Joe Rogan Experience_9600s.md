# Joe Rogan Experience #2307 - Tim Dillon
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by Dave, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6.0s)]
*  Hey Tim Dillon. How are you? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=13.0s)]
*  I'm much better now that the ladies are back from space. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=15.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. What were they up there, 10 minutes? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=17.0s)]
*  Well, it was very profound. I don't know if you've seen Katy Perry talk about it, but she's basically a guru now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=20.0s)]
*  Yeah, what were her findings? That's my question. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=25.0s)]
*  Well, what did she learn? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=27.0s)]
*  Which is super important. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=29.0s)]
*  It shows you how quick the flight was. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=31.0s)]
*  The dead Daisy that's like snipped from its life source was still alive or still vibrant. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=33.0s)]
*  Yeah, and it's so... [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=40.0s)]
*  Look at her nails. So pretty. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=42.0s)]
*  Now, so they go up there and they float for like 10 minutes. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=46.0s)]
*  At least. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=50.0s)]
*  And then they come down. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=51.0s)]
*  Let's not minimize this. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=52.0s)]
*  No, I know. It's a big deal. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=53.0s)]
*  Let's celebrate female astronauts. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=55.0s)]
*  Because they were united. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=58.0s)]
*  Because a lot of men astronauts, they have to go to school. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=59.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=62.0s)]
*  They have to learn how to be a pilot first. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=63.0s)]
*  Then they have to join the Air Force or the Navy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=65.0s)]
*  And then they get appointed by NASA. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=68.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=71.0s)]
*  Then they go to space. You know? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=72.0s)]
*  And there has been, that's the other thing, there has been female astronauts. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=75.0s)]
*  Let's not minimize this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=79.0s)]
*  Let's not minimize this. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=81.0s)]
*  Yeah, like I think there was a bitch stuck on a space station for a few months. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=83.0s)]
*  That's terribly more impressive. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=87.0s)]
*  Let's not minimize this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=89.0s)]
*  No, the problem with that story is that she was rescued by a very awful person. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=90.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=97.0s)]
*  Who wants to expose fraud and waste. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=98.0s)]
*  Yeah, did Musk rescue her? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=100.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=102.0s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=103.0s)]
*  Yeah, oh, where's that in the news? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=104.0s)]
*  Oh, I didn't know that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=105.0s)]
*  Those fucking people were stuck. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=106.0s)]
*  The Boeing jet, the Skyline, whatever the fuck it is, the Boeing spaceship, wasn't working. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=107.0s)]
*  They couldn't fix it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=111.0s)]
*  Interesting. I didn't even know that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=112.0s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, Elon could have rescued them during the Biden administration. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=114.0s)]
*  They didn't want to because of his open support for Trump. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=118.0s)]
*  So they left those people up there. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=121.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=123.0s)]
*  He's talked about it on my podcast. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=124.0s)]
*  They left those people up there. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=126.0s)]
*  And they're just chilling. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=128.0s)]
*  No, they're dying. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=130.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=131.0s)]
*  It's like slow radiation poisoning. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=132.0s)]
*  It's like getting 10 x-rays a day. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=134.0s)]
*  And they're just slowly getting sapped of your life force out there in no gravity. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=136.0s)]
*  Your bones are weakening. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=141.0s)]
*  Did you see that lady's face when she came back? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=142.0s)]
*  She didn't look great. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=144.0s)]
*  Bro, something had happened. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=145.0s)]
*  Like her chin had grown. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=147.0s)]
*  Her chin was extended. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=148.0s)]
*  Her hair had all turned gray. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=150.0s)]
*  She looked like she was sick. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=152.0s)]
*  She was sick. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=153.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=154.0s)]
*  You're dying up there, man. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=155.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=156.0s)]
*  I had Commander Chris Hatfield on, and he was at one point in time the longest person that had been in space from, wasn't he? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=157.0s)]
*  It was like he was there for like six months. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=165.0s)]
*  And he was saying it was unbelievable, like how difficult it was to recover once you get back to Earth. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=168.0s)]
*  He couldn't walk. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=174.0s)]
*  It was just like a total vertigo. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=175.0s)]
*  Like his whole body was like so not used to gravity. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=177.0s)]
*  All of his bones were weak. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=179.0s)]
*  All of his muscles were weak. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=181.0s)]
*  But these bitches seem fine, these ladies. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=183.0s)]
*  Well, for now. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=185.0s)]
*  It looks quick. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=186.0s)]
*  It's not minimized. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=187.0s)]
*  It's not minimized. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=188.0s)]
*  It's a sacrifice they've made for a great cause. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=189.0s)]
*  For the world, in fact. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=190.0s)]
*  For the world. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=191.0s)]
*  They're profoundly different. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=192.0s)]
*  They're profoundly different now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=193.0s)]
*  To show people. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=194.0s)]
*  Well, it's inspiring. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=195.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=196.0s)]
*  It's inspiring. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=197.0s)]
*  If a guy who's worth what, a trillion dollars? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=198.0s)]
*  Several billion? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=203.0s)]
*  A hundred billion? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=204.0s)]
*  Just imagine the conspiracies if they didn't make it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=205.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=208.0s)]
*  Well, Pete, there's already people saying that they faked it, which I think is silly. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=209.0s)]
*  Well, I love those people. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=212.0s)]
*  But it's great. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=214.0s)]
*  Those are the people that think space is fake. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=215.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=216.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=217.0s)]
*  But there are already people going, well, they faked it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=218.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I hope they faked something better than that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=221.0s)]
*  I hope. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=223.0s)]
*  If they're faking stuff and they probably are faking some stuff, God, I hope they're [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=224.0s)]
*  faking stuff that's better than that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=230.0s)]
*  I think this is the confusion. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=232.0s)]
*  I think the confusion is that they essentially got to the threshold of space. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=233.0s)]
*  They did not get like way out there where reentry is very traumatic. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=239.0s)]
*  And it has like, if you see like those heat shields that they put all over those things [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=246.0s)]
*  and if they break off on the reentry, everybody dies. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=252.0s)]
*  That's because you're way out there and the amount of heat that gets generated as you're [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=255.0s)]
*  reentering the atmosphere. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=259.0s)]
*  I think they're essentially like on the border of the atmosphere. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=260.0s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=263.0s)]
*  How high did they go up there? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=264.0s)]
*  62 miles. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=265.0s)]
*  They go above that line. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=266.0s)]
*  It's called like the Carman Line or something. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=267.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=268.0s)]
*  So the space shuttle goes three hundred-threes. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=269.0s)]
*  They went a little higher than that Rocket Man documentary, that guy who shot himself [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=270.0s)]
*  up in a rocket. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=273.0s)]
*  They went like a few feet higher than that guy. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=274.0s)]
*  RIP, that guy drove by his grave on the way to Vegas when LA burned down. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=277.0s)]
*  Are they even like technically actually in space? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=281.0s)]
*  I think that's where the like it floats. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=284.0s)]
*  That's the line. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=287.0s)]
*  I might go there. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=288.0s)]
*  I might do that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=289.0s)]
*  Do it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=290.0s)]
*  I wouldn't go to Space Base, but I might do the 80 miles. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=291.0s)]
*  Do that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=293.0s)]
*  So three hundred and fifty miles is the highest anyone has ever gone other than the Apollo [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=294.0s)]
*  astronauts. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=301.0s)]
*  62. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=302.0s)]
*  62 miles. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=303.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=304.0s)]
*  62 miles ain't shit, dude. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=305.0s)]
*  I drive that in an hour. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=306.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=307.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=309.0s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=310.0s)]
*  It's not that far. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=311.0s)]
*  That's not even here to San Antonio. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=312.0s)]
*  62 miles ain't shit, but it is kind of technically space. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=315.0s)]
*  Should they get up there and they look at the Earth? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=320.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=322.0s)]
*  That's why like everybody's calling bullshit on the outside of the capsule. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=323.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=327.0s)]
*  That it wasn't like completely on fire. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=328.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=329.0s)]
*  Destroyed. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=330.0s)]
*  Just because they didn't go that high. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=331.0s)]
*  They didn't go that high. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=332.0s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=333.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=334.0s)]
*  But they did go to space. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=335.0s)]
*  They went to space and they lost gravity. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=336.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=337.0s)]
*  The funniest thing is they come back and you need a parachute to land. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=338.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=341.4s)]
*  Like at all the technology Elon has. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=342.4s)]
*  Elon is catching rockets. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=344.08s)]
*  What could go wrong in something like that? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=345.8s)]
*  Oh, it could explode on the way up. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=350.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=353.0s)]
*  The way up is not ensured that those things are definitely going to hold it together. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=354.2s)]
*  So that's the biggest risk. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=357.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=358.92s)]
*  You have these cannons filled with rocket fuel that are burning at like twice the... [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=359.92s)]
*  What is the temperature of rocket fuel when it's hot? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=365.46s)]
*  Is it like close to the surface of the sun or some crazy shit? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=368.58s)]
*  What is the actual temperature? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=375.09999999999997s)]
*  So everything has to be contained while you have insane amounts of fuel burning every [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=377.14s)]
*  second. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=382.74s)]
*  And huge plumes of flame. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=383.74s)]
*  Enormous thrust. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=386.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=387.62s)]
*  To escape Earth's atmosphere. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=388.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=389.62s)]
*  You're just hoping all those O-rings and all these fucking... [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=390.62s)]
*  All the shit that blew up with the Challenger. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=392.9s)]
*  So it could have blown up. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=394.18s)]
*  100%. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=396.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=397.14s)]
*  I mean, Musk has openly said some of these are going to blow up when he's testing them. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=398.14s)]
*  When they would blow up, you're like, oh, Elon failed again. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=404.1s)]
*  Like no, we want it to fail because we want to find out what is the threshold. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=406.7s)]
*  There's only one way to find out. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=411.14s)]
*  I wonder if all of them were... [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=412.14s)]
*  You think they were like prepared to die? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=413.54s)]
*  No. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=415.54s)]
*  Katy Perry was prepared to die. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=416.54s)]
*  That's why she bought the T-Series. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=417.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=418.54s)]
*  In her eyes, something's off. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=419.54s)]
*  She looked like a soldier. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=420.54s)]
*  Something's off with her. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=421.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=422.54s)]
*  What about the hatch though? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=424.5s)]
*  Wasn't that kind of sketch? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=425.5s)]
*  She has a Mohammed Adda look to her. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=426.5s)]
*  Well, I think the problem is that the hatch is not a real hatch like a spaceship because [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=429.5s)]
*  it's not really going to space. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=436.06s)]
*  There's no captain. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=437.38s)]
*  There's no pilot. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=438.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=439.54s)]
*  There's nobody going... [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=440.54s)]
*  Exact the mundo. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=441.54s)]
*  All the above. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=442.54s)]
*  So it's... [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=443.54s)]
*  Most hatches in that regard, they open outwardly so that the pressure of space travel, like [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=444.54s)]
*  When you're shooting that fucking rocket up, insane amounts of gravity doesn't make the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=451.26s)]
*  door hinges fail and it collapses in on itself and everybody dies. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=455.58s)]
*  So they have to open outward. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=460.54s)]
*  So the pressure would keep them shut. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=463.34000000000003s)]
*  So generally, there's a seal and it's really kind of crazy. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=465.04s)]
*  I have a friend of mine, very wealthy businessman who brings me over his house the other day. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=469.14s)]
*  He goes, I want to show you something. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=473.74s)]
*  And he shows me this diagram. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=475.74s)]
*  He said, this is from the 1950s. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=478.26s)]
*  This is the blueprint for the recreation UFO that they made when they tried to back engineer [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=480.58000000000004s)]
*  the one that they found at Roswell. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=489.3s)]
*  And this was a diagram. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=491.74s)]
*  And it had a crank handle like a submarine door. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=494.46000000000004s)]
*  And they were trying to replicate a craft that had landed, crashed. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=498.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=503.14000000000004s)]
*  Well, he thinks they did. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=504.14000000000004s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=505.94s)]
*  He doesn't think it's a try. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=506.94s)]
*  He said, this is the blueprint. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=507.94s)]
*  It had the actual, by the way, the exact generator in the center of it that Bob Lazar described [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=508.98s)]
*  in 1989 when he worked at area S4. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=515.7s)]
*  What layer of the government do you think is working on projects like that? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=519.5s)]
*  Like is it all the DARPA people? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=523.3s)]
*  I think it's people that are completely disconnected from congressmen, senators, presidents. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=525.14s)]
*  It's all deep state. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=531.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=532.7s)]
*  They have to be like, they probably belong to an agency without a name. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=533.7s)]
*  Well, there's probably a bunch of those. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=537.34s)]
*  And when it comes to this kind of stuff, like we already know now because of Doge that there [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=539.46s)]
*  was money that was going with no receipts, billions and billions of dollars that was [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=543.98s)]
*  just flying out with no receipts. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=549.62s)]
*  They have no idea where it went. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=551.96s)]
*  And Elon openly said, if this was, he goes, if this was a public company, it would be [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=553.34s)]
*  delisted. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=560.0600000000001s)]
*  And the people who ran it would go to prison. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=561.0600000000001s)]
*  Because it's the government, you're like, oh, we did. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=564.9s)]
*  We just have no thing that could be going to it. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=567.6999999999999s)]
*  You think they'll bring charges against anyone for fraud? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=572.1s)]
*  That's the worry about disclosure, because that's what I think that's what's holding [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=575.78s)]
*  it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=578.8199999999999s)]
*  I think people needs concrete stuff. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=579.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=584.38s)]
*  You want concrete? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=585.38s)]
*  Let's hear Katy Perry talk about space. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=586.38s)]
*  I said to you this morning, I said, let's discuss. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=589.38s)]
*  I saw her, I saw her, I chatted about it on my show. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=595.42s)]
*  I saw her say something about we weren't taking space, we're making space. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=596.98s)]
*  That's the one I want to say. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=603.02s)]
*  Which I thought was an interesting scientific. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=604.02s)]
*  No, no, no, I got another one. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=606.02s)]
*  I got some better ones. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=608.26s)]
*  What is funny is immediately after they landed. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=610.54s)]
*  Well, actually that one's pretty good. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=612.14s)]
*  It is funny to see something like this and then everyone hates you. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=613.14s)]
*  Like everyone hates them. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=617.02s)]
*  They shouldn't hate her. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=618.02s)]
*  Oh, no, that's not it. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=619.02s)]
*  Jamie, I'll send it to you. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=620.02s)]
*  I have so many of them. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=621.02s)]
*  I don't think that one has the making space. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=623.74s)]
*  Try this one. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=626.34s)]
*  It's so fun. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=631.1s)]
*  Why is it so fun when people get pretentious? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=632.1s)]
*  I guess because you're terrified that you would ever do it. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=634.4200000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, I also think it's fun to see somebody who has no self-awareness. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=636.5s)]
*  They're always the most fun. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=640.22s)]
*  I will never be the same. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=642.26s)]
*  I mean, when you get up there and you see the earth and it's so beautiful and it just [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=643.6600000000001s)]
*  fills the screen and it's not just your window. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=649.06s)]
*  It's like everybody's window and there's no boundaries. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=653.06s)]
*  There's no border. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=655.9399999999999s)]
*  There's just earth and it just fills the screen. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=656.9399999999999s)]
*  I think it says astronaut. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=660.42s)]
*  The earth and it's so beautiful and it just fills the screen. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=662.9799999999999s)]
*  Is it what you expected? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=666.8599999999999s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=668.8599999999999s)]
*  I don't think you can describe it because you know what I was saying? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=674.98s)]
*  It was like quiet, but then also really alive. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=679.3000000000001s)]
*  And you look at it and you're like, we're all in this together. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=684.74s)]
*  You mentioned this prior to going up, you said that you needed to go to space to heal. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=689.1800000000001s)]
*  I know you're only a few minutes removed from this incredible experience. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=695.02s)]
*  Do you feel healed? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=698.9s)]
*  Now you are officially an astronaut. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=701.98s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=703.94s)]
*  How do you feel? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=704.66s)]
*  I feel super connected to love. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=706.42s)]
*  Goodness, I will never be the same. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=709.86s)]
*  I mean, when you get up there. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=712.98s)]
*  No, that's it. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=713.78s)]
*  That's it. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=714.3s)]
*  There's another one. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=714.9s)]
*  There's another one. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=715.8199999999999s)]
*  She said making space. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=716.42s)]
*  But I know she's so funny that they just get called astronauts. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=718.5799999999999s)]
*  It's funny to hear the richest guy in the world's wife go, we're all in it together. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=721.5s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=726.38s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=727.18s)]
*  I don't know if people feel that. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=729.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we're definitely not all in it with you. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=731.54s)]
*  We come together with you. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=733.66s)]
*  Can we get on your jet? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=736.4599999999999s)]
*  How in it together are we? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=737.4599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, what does that mean? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=739.2199999999999s)]
*  It feels like you hand selected a couple of friends to go do this. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=740.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=744.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=744.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you should have to. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=745.2199999999999s)]
*  It should have been a lottery system like Willy Wonka, where just seven random people [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=746.14s)]
*  should have been able to go in this. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=750.78s)]
*  I would do it just to change my. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=752.5s)]
*  That would be good. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=754.4599999999999s)]
*  Just seven random people. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=755.42s)]
*  Just pull out some guy who's not supposed to be here. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=757.06s)]
*  Just a kiss. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=760.6999999999999s)]
*  This year at H.E.B., someone from MS-13. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=761.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I was thinking. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=764.06s)]
*  Get him in. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=764.74s)]
*  Someone from Trendy Aqua and Lauren Sanchez and Gayle King. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=765.74s)]
*  And you know. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=770.74s)]
*  Oh, you see they released the footage, dashcam footage or police footage of the guy who they're [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=771.54s)]
*  saying was just a father. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=778.34s)]
*  The Maryland father. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=780.54s)]
*  As he got pulled over with eight undocumented people in his truck. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=781.58s)]
*  They're all supposedly staying at his house. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=785.3s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't see that. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=787.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=788.66s)]
*  The wife had a restraining order against him, a protection order. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=789.78s)]
*  I saw that there was a restraining order. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=793.1800000000001s)]
*  I saw that he was hanging out with two guys that were in MS-13. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=795.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they released the. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=800.02s)]
*  Yeah, he's he's definitely sketchy. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=801.1s)]
*  They have made a few mistakes. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=804.0600000000001s)]
*  Maryland father. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=805.66s)]
*  No. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=806.86s)]
*  The guy that scares me is the hairdresser. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=807.66s)]
*  The gay hairstylist. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=809.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=810.58s)]
*  I want to know what's going on with that. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=811.0600000000001s)]
*  Or there's a guy with a tattoo. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=811.98s)]
*  And it's him. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=813.38s)]
*  The tattoo. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=814.22s)]
*  Oh, the hairdresser has a mom and dad. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=815.02s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=817.66s)]
*  There was a guy with an autism awareness tattoo. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=818.06s)]
*  And they thought it was like an MS-13 tattoo. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=820.54s)]
*  But it doesn't look like an MS-13 tattoo. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=822.98s)]
*  It's a literal. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=825.46s)]
*  The problem is everybody's a liar. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=826.98s)]
*  You don't know liberals are liars and the Republicans are liars. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=829.1s)]
*  Everyone's lying. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=832.22s)]
*  They're all lie. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=833.06s)]
*  And if they did ship some. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=833.54s)]
*  Ironically, the only people I trust are MS-13. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=834.66s)]
*  And because they'll tell you and podcasters and MS-13. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=837.6999999999999s)]
*  That's all I trust. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=841.42s)]
*  I would love if you just had MS-13 on just three guys with tattoos. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=842.14s)]
*  Because by the way, there would be no outrage. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=846.38s)]
*  That's what's hilarious. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=849.46s)]
*  If you had three MS-13 gang members, not one person would go, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=851.02s)]
*  why did he have that? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=855.98s)]
*  Why did he platform them? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=856.98s)]
*  Nobody would. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=858.14s)]
*  But if I have Ian Carroll on. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=859.14s)]
*  If you have anyone else on, it'll be a horrible thing. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=860.4200000000001s)]
*  But if it was three guys, MS-13 with head to toe tattoos, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=863.6600000000001s)]
*  who admitted to killing multiple people. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=866.58s)]
*  And you said, now tell me about what it's like to grow up in San Pedro [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=869.14s)]
*  Sula or whatever. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=873.86s)]
*  And it would be OK. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=875.0999999999999s)]
*  Well, that was one that's good is because I think it's important to learn [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=876.9s)]
*  about other cultures. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=879.6199999999999s)]
*  Well, a thousand percent. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=880.6999999999999s)]
*  And they should have their chance to talk. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=881.8199999999999s)]
*  And what's not cool is talking about maybe Israel did something wrong. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=883.78s)]
*  You should really not do that. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=888.3399999999999s)]
*  I think it's criminal of you to even discuss anything. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=890.14s)]
*  Well, apparently I've been co-opted by what's called the woke right. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=895.42s)]
*  The woke right. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=899.6199999999999s)]
*  That's what I heard. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=900.26s)]
*  There's a woke right now. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=900.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=901.6999999999999s)]
*  And they're. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=902.3s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=902.8199999999999s)]
*  They're co-opting. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=903.7399999999999s)]
*  I still haven't accepted the fact that I've left the left. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=904.78s)]
*  I did a CNN interview for an hour because I'm promoting my special. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=906.74s)]
*  And then did you really? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=910.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=912.02s)]
*  And they talked to this girl, El Reeves. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=912.54s)]
*  She cool. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=915.06s)]
*  She was cool. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=915.9s)]
*  She does all the you know, when you see the vice documentaries where she talks [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=916.5799999999999s)]
*  to the Nazis in the incels. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=919.66s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=921.02s)]
*  She does that. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=921.5799999999999s)]
*  That chick. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=922.18s)]
*  And they sent her in. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=923.1s)]
*  Oh, that's a good move. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=924.42s)]
*  This is hilarious. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=925.62s)]
*  So I'm sitting there and she sits down. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=926.6999999999999s)]
*  She's like, are there any left wing comedians? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=928.02s)]
*  And I named 10 of them that are all in arenas. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=930.4599999999999s)]
*  And she goes, oh, because their whole thing now is that podcasters, the most [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=932.86s)]
*  powerful people in the world. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=937.54s)]
*  And she goes, do you think your friends are the new establishment? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=938.54s)]
*  I said, well, there's 22 intelligence agencies and entire legacy media. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=941.1s)]
*  There's lots of Ivy League schools. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=944.58s)]
*  There's this, there's that. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=947.02s)]
*  Do I think Theo Vons, the new establishment? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=948.14s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=950.42s)]
*  I think I think you ran a really unpopular candidate. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=953.26s)]
*  I don't think Americans like child sex changes. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=956.54s)]
*  And I don't think they want an open border. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=959.3000000000001s)]
*  I think if you'd co-opted some of those issues, you might have won. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=961.02s)]
*  They said to me at CNN, they're like, we're editing the interview. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=965.18s)]
*  I said, put the hour out. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=967.5s)]
*  I sat there for an hour and we had a nice conversation. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=968.86s)]
*  But we talked for one hour and I was like, put it out. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=972.46s)]
*  I'm like, I understand if you can't put it out. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=976.38s)]
*  And then she goes like this. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=979.14s)]
*  She goes, I can't believe you'd show up. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=979.9399999999999s)]
*  People have said that they can't come on here because Joe Rogan would get mad at them. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=985.26s)]
*  I said, that's absolutely ridiculous. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=989.3399999999999s)]
*  Why would I care? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=991.14s)]
*  I said, he doesn't care. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=991.9399999999999s)]
*  He would never care. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=992.8599999999999s)]
*  I said, oh, that's so silly. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=994.2199999999999s)]
*  It's the silliest thing ever. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=995.54s)]
*  They think we're at war. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=996.66s)]
*  I just said, put out the thing, put out the hour online. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=998.2199999999999s)]
*  If you can only put out a few minutes on a network, fine. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1000.38s)]
*  But it's wrong to have someone come in and talk for an hour. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1003.9799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1006.9799999999999s)]
*  And then not three minutes and then use five minutes. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1007.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1010.14s)]
*  So what how much did they use? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1010.4599999999999s)]
*  We don't know yet. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1012.54s)]
*  They haven't put it out. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1013.3s)]
*  And did they say we can't put the whole hour out? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1014.6999999999999s)]
*  I texted this journalist and she texted me. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1017.5s)]
*  She goes, I'm pushing for like a long form release. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1019.5799999999999s)]
*  I go, yeah, man. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1021.5799999999999s)]
*  Just put out the interview. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1023.26s)]
*  Also, do you guys want ratings or no? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1024.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1026.1s)]
*  We had a conversation about all these things you guys talk about. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1026.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1030.94s)]
*  You guys have a website. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1031.1s)]
*  Then what are we doing? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1032.06s)]
*  Don't you have a YouTube page? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1033.5s)]
*  Does the CNN have a YouTube page? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1034.5s)]
*  And she's like, I go, she goes, she goes, what do you think that Joe Rogan show? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1036.1s)]
*  Why is this so popular? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1041.06s)]
*  I go, well, one of the reasons is he doesn't edit people. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1041.86s)]
*  They don't. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1044.5s)]
*  They're not edited. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1045.7s)]
*  They come on. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1046.66s)]
*  They say what they want to say. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1047.3000000000002s)]
*  And there's no editing. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1048.14s)]
*  So what's weird about those institutions is they will sit you down for an hour. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1049.3000000000002s)]
*  And then I guess cherry pick what they think their audience wants to see. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1052.8600000000001s)]
*  They just want what they think is going to grab the most ratings [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1057.14s)]
*  and is not going to make them look stupid. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1060.3400000000001s)]
*  So if you're mocking them openly, explain. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1062.18s)]
*  Well, she didn't know when she said it there. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1065.18s)]
*  She goes, comedy's right wing. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1066.94s)]
*  And I go, she goes, name left of center comedians. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1068.3000000000002s)]
*  I named literally eight of them. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1070.98s)]
*  And I said, they all are in arenas. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1072.3000000000002s)]
*  I go, what are you talking about? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1073.74s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1075.3000000000002s)]
*  It's so dumb. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1076.26s)]
*  I was like, that's you're saying that comedy's what? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1077.02s)]
*  By the way, I used to be left of center, according to the metrics of 2015. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1079.66s)]
*  I said there's a lot of Joe's positions, if you look at them, that are left of center positions. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1084.3s)]
*  And there's a lot of my positions or anyone's positions. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1089.14s)]
*  I said there's nobody that you can easily put in a box. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1091.42s)]
*  But they want you to be in that box. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1094.74s)]
*  They're silly. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1096.94s)]
*  And they also want me to be an enemy of CNN. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1097.54s)]
*  I don't give a fuck if you don't care. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1099.22s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1100.38s)]
*  By the way, I hope CNN corrects course and does real news. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1100.9s)]
*  And just concentrates on the news and all this fucking. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1104.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't want editorial comments from morons. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1108.3s)]
*  Right? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1112.86s)]
*  So when you're force feeding me, Don Lemon's opinion on how the world should be. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1113.2199999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1118.34s)]
*  And how everyone should be shamed if they don't get vaccinated. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1118.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1122.34s)]
*  You're force feeding me morons. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1122.6599999999999s)]
*  Like no matter. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1124.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1124.82s)]
*  Of course your ratings plummeted. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1126.1399999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1128.1s)]
*  And you guys lied about so many fucking things and never corrected yourselves. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1129.26s)]
*  Is there an arm of the Democratic National Committee and they're an arm of that party? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1133.26s)]
*  I mean, they're. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1140.42s)]
*  Whether they are forced to be or whether they choose to be because they identify with being [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1141.1s)]
*  Democrat and they want to skew things completely towards the left. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1146.3s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1149.74s)]
*  I don't know what the answer to that is. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1150.34s)]
*  All of the old Bush era, neoconservative people who pushed the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1151.78s)]
*  and the Patriot Act and Guantanamo Bay and all of this stuff, all find homes usually on MSNBC or CNN [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1159.26s)]
*  advocating for war with Iran or an escalation in Ukraine. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1167.8600000000001s)]
*  They always. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1173.22s)]
*  So it's kind of an establishment. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1174.34s)]
*  Doesn't seem to. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1176.26s)]
*  They don't really care about party. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1176.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1178.34s)]
*  And you know. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1179.14s)]
*  They're doing better now though. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1180.58s)]
*  I mean this when they have Scott Jennings on. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1181.82s)]
*  He's. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1184.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1184.58s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1186.06s)]
*  That's the kind of conversations you need. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1186.3s)]
*  Completely ridiculous people are out of your fucking minds versus got Jennings. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1187.9s)]
*  Like those are great. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1191.5800000000002s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1198.26s)]
*  And they should. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1198.5800000000002s)]
*  There are in the world. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1199.8600000000001s)]
*  There are good principled arguments that against right wing things. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1201.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1205.7s)]
*  You just can't have people who are completely out of it make them. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1206.14s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1210.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1211.3000000000002s)]
*  After the election, one of my favorite ones was at CNBC or CNN. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1211.98s)]
*  I forget what to one. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1215.8200000000002s)]
*  This guy was talking about this whole right wing podcast ecosystem that's incredibly well [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1216.58s)]
*  funded and organized. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1221.98s)]
*  And. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1223.3799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1224.1399999999999s)]

*  Right. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1225.6599999999999s)]
*  You could literally go to the roots of how it all started. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1225.86s)]
*  You could see every one of us doing our first podcast. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1228.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1231.98s)]

*  Even the idea that we're all organized together or that like I would want to prevent people [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1238.58s)]
*  from going on CNN. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1243.06s)]

*  It's not careless because that's the way they operate. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1246.06s)]
*  You always usually like a lot of times you end up accusing people of something you're [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1248.82s)]
*  doing. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1252.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1252.94s)]
*  So you because you are familiar with that. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1253.3s)]
*  So they're like, well, we have a top down corporate oligarchy telling us what to do. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1255.26s)]
*  Is that the way it works with you? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1259.58s)]
*  Like no, you're working as an email people at the beginning of the week and go, hey, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1260.98s)]

*  It's the most insane thing ever. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1265.94s)]
*  But not only that, like I want them to do well. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1267.18s)]
*  I really don't care. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1270.1399999999999s)]
*  They obviously don't want me to do well. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1270.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1273.1s)]
*  But I don't care. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1273.26s)]
*  I hope they're. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1274.78s)]
*  Look, if they turned it around and CNN became great, I'd watch it all the time. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1275.66s)]
*  It's just it used to be great. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1279.0600000000002s)]
*  You used to have parts unknown on it. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1280.5400000000002s)]
*  The new thing they're doing. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1281.74s)]
*  This is this is a very interesting thing that's happening. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1282.7s)]
*  If somebody says something that they don't like and they can't immediately dismiss it, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1285.42s)]
*  they go. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1290.74s)]
*  But the fans of that thing are bad people. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1291.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1294.5400000000002s)]
*  This is an interesting attack point. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1294.98s)]
*  They go. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1297.3000000000002s)]
*  But somebody with a massive audience, if they find a sliver of that audience to be [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1298.1000000000001s)]
*  objectionable in any way, they then go, well, the fans of that type of questioning are [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1304.02s)]
*  anti-semitic or racist or something. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1310.62s)]
*  Well, they don't deal with the actual facts or the actual line of argumentation. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1313.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's just a sneaky debate tactic. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1319.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1321.58s)]
*  When you're dealing with I have 19 million YouTube subscribers. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1322.1s)]
*  How can you nail that down to the fans? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1326.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1329.42s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1329.9s)]
*  You're just talking out of your ass. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1330.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1331.86s)]
*  This is a non-argument. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1332.3799999999999s)]
*  It's a stupid point. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1333.78s)]
*  And by the way, when you're talking about actual comments, we've already established that I don't [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1334.98s)]
*  know what the number is, but there's a huge number of people that are commenting that aren't even [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1341.46s)]
*  people. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1347.1s)]
*  They're bots. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1348.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1349.22s)]
*  State sponsored bots. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1349.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1351.18s)]
*  They could be from Ukraine. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1351.46s)]
*  They could be from America. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1352.5s)]
*  They could be from Russia. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1354.02s)]
*  They could be from Israel. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1355.1s)]
*  And I want more of them. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1356.3s)]

*  They can. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1361.46s)]

*  When? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1391.5s)]

*  Oh, well, he loves it. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1399.26s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1509.3400000000001s)]
*  Jew in the city is the name of the website. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1510.18s)]
*  God, I hope a Jewish person is running that website. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1514.2600000000002s)]

*  The fur hat is known by the Yiddish name. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1519.14s)]
*  How do you say that? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1522.46s)]
*  Shreymel Shreymel Shreymel. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1523.0200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. The Shreymel was adopted by Eastern European Jewish communities [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1525.2600000000002s)]
*  in the 18th century and coincided with the rise of acidic Judaism. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1528.78s)]
*  Technically, a Shreymel is one particular style of hat. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1531.54s)]
*  There are others. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1534.6200000000001s)]
*  One that might be familiar on site is the Spodek. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1535.9s)]
*  Oh, you fucking pop up at a cocksucker into your email, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1537.98s)]
*  which is taller and more cylindrical than a Shreymel. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1541.46s)]
*  A Spodek is the style generally favored by acidic sex of Polish descent [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1544.22s)]
*  to the casual observer. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1548.5s)]
*  However, they're all stramels stramels made from a large piece of velvet [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1549.5s)]
*  surrounded by fur. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1552.58s)]
*  Fur usually comes from the tips of the tails of sable, Martins or Fox. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1553.74s)]
*  Nice synthetic stramels do exist. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1558.62s)]
*  They're more common in Israel than elsewhere. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1561.58s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1563.8999999999999s)]
*  Shreymel can cost thousands of dollars, so it's not uncommon for us [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1565.26s)]
*  acidic man to own a second cheaper stramel. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1568.4199999999998s)]
*  So this main stramel will not be battered by the elements. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1571.3s)]
*  Interesting. Yeah. Interesting. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1575.1799999999998s)]
*  It's cool that let everybody know you're part of the tribe. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1578.58s)]
*  It's a fun hat. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1580.58s)]
*  Maybe comedians mean like a thing that we wear a hat. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1581.54s)]
*  Yeah, like a thing. That's very good. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1584.54s)]
*  We don't give a fuck. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1586.06s)]
*  Yeah, I like that Kanye West black clan suit. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1586.94s)]
*  That's dope. How about his giant swastika in diamonds? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1589.98s)]
*  Have you seen that? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1593.8200000000002s)]
*  What's funny is a jeweler made that. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1594.74s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And a Jewish jeweler. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1596.7s)]
*  Yeah. One side Israeli Jewish guy made that significant markup. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1598.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, of course. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1602.3s)]
*  I would give you a swastika. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1603.66s)]
*  I was I would. It's only fair. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1605.3s)]
*  Yeah, you need a tag. I think it's only fair. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1607.54s)]
*  You want a Jewish man to make a swastika? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1609.54s)]
*  People got to separate, you know, and I think this is not [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1611.3400000000001s)]
*  I think people got to separate like governments from people. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1614.38s)]
*  Intelligence agencies from people. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1617.06s)]
*  I think that's the whole thing. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1619.3s)]
*  I think people are losing the ability to do that in this case. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1620.38s)]
*  Right. Because you people that when you criticize Israel, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1624.18s)]
*  you criticize something that may or may not have been done [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1626.26s)]
*  by a government or intelligence agency, you're not criticizing people. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1628.8600000000001s)]
*  Right. You're criticizing a group of people making decisions. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1632.9s)]
*  I don't think America always does things that are in the best interest [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1636.8200000000002s)]
*  of the American people. Right. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1639.3400000000001s)]
*  Well, this is the problem with when everybody sort of picks sides [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1641.18s)]
*  during the covid thing, whether or not we should trust the vaccine companies [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1644.78s)]
*  because like you did it because you're on the left [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1648.74s)]
*  and the people on the right were the ones who didn't want to take it. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1653.3s)]
*  So instead of just looking at it objectively, the people on the left [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1655.74s)]
*  were like everybody who doesn't agree is a science denier. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1659.3799999999999s)]
*  And it got like really kooky because it got ideological. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1662.74s)]
*  And as soon as it's ideological, you can fucking justify anything. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1666.34s)]
*  This is how how Jewish Americans are justifying. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1670.54s)]
*  Well, Hamas uses people as human shields. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1673.82s)]
*  Like they'll say things like that. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1676.18s)]
*  Like it's a way you can justify mass murder. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1677.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's a way you can justify anything, anything. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1679.66s)]
*  As long as the tribe on your side, whatever your clan is. Right. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1683.26s)]
*  You can you can justify things. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1688.06s)]
*  And so people stop thinking, they stop thinking and they just think [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1689.82s)]
*  completely along ideological lines. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1693.3s)]
*  It's frustrating. It is. It is. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1695.74s)]
*  And passionately. Yeah. Very passionately. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1698.1399999999999s)]
*  They're right. You're wrong. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1701.1399999999999s)]
*  No one is ever questioning anything. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1701.78s)]
*  No one ever questions science. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1704.58s)]
*  No one goes, wait a minute. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1706.58s)]
*  Like I think it's healthy to every now and then go, maybe I'm wrong. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1708.46s)]
*  Yeah, there was just something that got released today that showed [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1712.1s)]
*  they just released today that showed that COVID-19 definitively came from that lab. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1715.1399999999999s)]
*  Thousand percent. One hundred percent proof it came from that lab. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1720.1399999999999s)]
*  I read it a little bit of it on the way here. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1723.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's nuts. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1725.98s)]
*  It's nuts, man. It's nuts. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1727.8999999999999s)]
*  These fucking people, they just got roped in to this. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1729.86s)]
*  And it was a man completely manmade. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1733.1s)]
*  One hundred percent disease. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1735.3s)]
*  One hundred percent. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1736.82s)]
*  And they knew that from the moment it leaked. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1738.3799999999999s)]
*  The moment it happened. They just lied. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1741.1399999999999s)]
*  And Fauci is just out there walking around. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1743.3799999999999s)]
*  That's an interesting. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1746.8999999999999s)]
*  It's an it's an interesting case when someone like that in that position. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1747.86s)]
*  Repeatedly lied to people about the origins of that. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1754.58s)]
*  Yeah. And is allowed to just be and faces zero consequences. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1759.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, they were trying to put Trump in jail because he inflated [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1764.8200000000002s)]
*  the price of a condo. Yeah. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1768.8200000000002s)]
*  Would you see what they got an appraisal that was higher? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1772.26s)]
*  And then they lied. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1774.5s)]
*  Well, they're they're alive. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1775.66s)]
*  It was horseshit. But you see that Letitia James is now in trouble [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1776.7s)]
*  for the exact same shit. Really? You didn't see that? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1780.02s)]
*  That makes sense. They're investigating her because she allegedly, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1782.38s)]
*  according to Megyn Kelly, who I trust implicitly. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1786.5s)]
*  Allegedly went and got mortgages with her father, listing them as husband [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1789.1s)]
*  and wife. Yeah. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1794.4599999999998s)]
*  On buildings. Right. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1795.9399999999998s)]
*  Multiple times. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1797.4599999999998s)]
*  And then also lied about the amount of bedrooms that were in a place. Right. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1798.4199999999998s)]
*  Because if it's four bedrooms, you get one tax rate of its five. Right. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1803.26s)]
*  So she lied. It was a five. And she said it was a four. Right. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1807.06s)]
*  Well, this is what they all do. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1810.86s)]
*  So I think really the funny thing about all the cases [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1812.06s)]
*  that they brought against Trump, a lot of those cases [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1815.3s)]
*  were rooted in just politicized [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1818.3s)]
*  version of something that's pretty standard that a lot of people have done. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1822.5s)]
*  Yeah, they always overvalue their properties, always overvalue properties. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1827.34s)]
*  And people get away with it. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1830.82s)]
*  And it's not it's not a crime. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1832.62s)]
*  But here's the thing about something. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1835.1399999999999s)]
*  Is that all the people had been paid. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1837.3s)]
*  So not only was it profitable for the banks, he paid everything on time. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1839.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. The loan. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1842.82s)]
*  There's there's no criminal. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1843.9399999999998s)]
*  Like there's no crime. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1845.94s)]
*  No one got victimized. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1847.54s)]
*  And nothing happened. Right. They profited. Right. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1848.98s)]
*  And then this crazy lady with a terrible past [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1852.02s)]
*  thought that she was going to be able to pull this off [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1855.3s)]
*  because she was on the team that she thought was going to win. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1857.1000000000001s)]
*  Like, you talk about putting all your eggs in one basket. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1859.54s)]
*  Like, well, a bunch of morons. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1862.18s)]
*  It feels like in on these things. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1863.8200000000002s)]
*  It feels like you have there's some we're in some kind of cold war [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1865.3s)]
*  between two factions in American politics that are [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1870.5s)]
*  using courts and lawyers to go at each other. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1874.54s)]
*  You know, it's not a hot war. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1878.34s)]
*  People aren't fighting in the streets. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1880.4599999999998s)]
*  But it does seem to be these parties seem to no longer [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1881.86s)]
*  view each other as different sides of the same coin. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1887.3799999999999s)]
*  There seems to be especially when it comes to Trump, it seems to be like [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1891.9399999999998s)]
*  they cannot, you know, see him as anything other than an existential threat [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1895.4199999999998s)]
*  that has to be vanquished at any cost. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1900.78s)]
*  Right. And the problem with that is when you deny good things [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1903.58s)]
*  and only highlight bad things that everybody knows it. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1908.1399999999999s)]
*  Well, now you're playing a game and your game is I never tell the truth. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1910.34s)]
*  I tell you parts of the truth that I like. Yeah. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1914.06s)]
*  And you got to win that game. Yeah. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1916.62s)]
*  If you're playing that game, you got to win. Yeah. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1918.4199999999998s)]
*  If you do all these things, they have to work. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1920.34s)]
*  And if Trump gets an office, then you have to do all these things. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1922.86s)]
*  It's a problem. You have you're fucked. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1925.1799999999998s)]
*  Then it's a problem. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1927.34s)]
*  You know, it's like with JFK, they got them. Yeah. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1928.4199999999998s)]
*  You know, obviously not good, but they got them. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1931.1799999999998s)]
*  And then that slammed the door shut. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1934.2199999999998s)]
*  And then all their people came in and kept the cover up going on. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1936.2199999999998s)]
*  I wish I really understood all this stuff that we talk about. Yeah. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1938.86s)]
*  Because there's an argument that we haven't had a real president [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1942.58s)]
*  since JFK got shot. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1945.8999999999999s)]
*  That's probably a good argument. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1947.4599999999998s)]
*  And there's maybe arguments that we actually [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1949.26s)]
*  didn't have real presidents prior to JFK. Right. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1952.06s)]
*  So what do you think is happening now, then? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1955.34s)]
*  Do you think that I think you have these guys, right? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1958.02s)]
*  These guys that go into the CIA, they they they they learn [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1960.5s)]
*  all about these underground groups. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1965.1399999999999s)]
*  They have all of these different relationships all over the world. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1969.86s)]
*  Right. Weapons, you know, weapons, drug running weapons, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1973.78s)]
*  all of these different, you know, terrorist groups, crime syndicates. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1978.74s)]
*  Right. Their job is to know information about every government. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1983.34s)]
*  All of the separatist groups that could potentially take over [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1988.1s)]
*  and become the next government. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1992.5s)]
*  They have all these connections. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1993.94s)]
*  And then they either leave the CIA, they retire, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1995.7s)]
*  or supposedly it never occurs to any of them to make a buck. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=1999.74s)]
*  That's the real question, right? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2004.26s)]
*  It never occurs to any of these people that there might be a great way [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2006.74s)]
*  to make a buck working with some of these people outside of Congress. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2011.7s)]
*  The White House, all of that. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2017.42s)]
*  That's as it's been explained to me by pretty smart people. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2019.9s)]
*  That's what you have. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2023.5s)]
*  You have a rogue element of people in those agencies [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2024.74s)]
*  that have massive amounts of money. Right. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2030.06s)]
*  And they're very well connected and they're running weapons. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2033.3s)]
*  And the president has no idea what's going on. Right. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2037.26s)]
*  And Congress has no idea what's going on. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2040.14s)]
*  They're not briefing a teacher from Georgia who got elected [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2042.7s)]
*  because he promised he was going to build a fucking shopping mall [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2047.38s)]
*  in a suburb of Atlanta about what they're doing in Syria. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2051.1s)]
*  Right. They're not briefing these people. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2054.78s)]
*  There's nothing democratic about what's happening. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2057.18s)]
*  And so then you think to yourself, you're like, well, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2059.62s)]
*  how do we make sure everyone keeps their mouth shut? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2061.58s)]
*  How do we make sure everyone keeps their mouth shut? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2064.34s)]
*  Cha-ching. Then we go not only money, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2066.18s)]
*  but that's when we bring in Ghislaine Maxwell. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2069.2200000000003s)]
*  That's when we bring in Jeffrey Ebsi. Right. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2073.1s)]
*  That's when we bring in people who go, let's all have fun. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2074.7400000000002s)]
*  We've got a great weekend getaway planned. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2078.82s)]
*  And then we can all be on camera doing something that would get us thrown in jail, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2081.58s)]
*  have people rightly disgusted and want to kill us. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2086.34s)]
*  And the worst things ever are now on camera somewhere. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2089.14s)]
*  Those tapes are somewhere. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2094.02s)]
*  Now everybody is completely [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2095.82s)]
*  incapable of ever coming out and saying what's going on. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2100.34s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, and then those people [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2105.42s)]
*  are running a parallel government. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2109.98s)]
*  It's a parallel command structure. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2113.7400000000002s)]
*  And that's a huge problem. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2115.94s)]
*  And it was essentially completely in control for four years. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2117.62s)]
*  Probably for more than four. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2120.86s)]
*  But the last year, for sure. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2122.1800000000003s)]
*  Thousand percent. That's the best example we've ever had of that. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2123.98s)]
*  Thousand percent. That guy's never really running things. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2126.62s)]
*  Thousand percent. There's no way they let him. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2129.66s)]
*  And it's probably still in control to a certain degree now, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2131.5s)]
*  because it's very hard to when you have something like that happening. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2136.46s)]
*  It is very difficult to completely shut it down. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2142.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, it's very well, here's a perfect example that we know. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2146.8599999999997s)]
*  It's definitely running things because Trump is still trying to figure out [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2150.18s)]
*  why he got shot. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2153.02s)]
*  But he was like, I want more information. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2155.46s)]
*  Yeah. Like there's no information. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2158.06s)]
*  There's not going to be information. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2160.54s)]
*  There's not going to be. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2163.86s)]
*  That's a crazy story. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2164.86s)]
*  That also is. You should try to connect. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2166.34s)]
*  Like if it's not America that did it, it's not us. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2168.46s)]
*  It's not intelligence agencies that did it. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2170.86s)]
*  That means a foreign government that hijacked this kid's brain [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2172.3s)]
*  and got him to climb on top of that roof. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2175.3s)]
*  Like somebody tried to get someone to assassinate a guy who's running for president. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2176.78s)]
*  And no one seems to be interested in finding who that person or that group [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2180.7000000000003s)]
*  who influenced this kid is. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2184.46s)]
*  So many of these ex intelligence chiefs pop up all over the world. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2186.26s)]
*  They pop up in Dubai. They pop up on MSNBC. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2190.5s)]
*  They love traveling. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2194.82s)]
*  They're having meetings with people. They're all over the place. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2196.3s)]
*  They love people. And they're just they love people. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2198.5800000000004s)]
*  They love cultures. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2200.78s)]
*  They love meeting different cultures. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2202.34s)]
*  Yeah, the food's great. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2203.9s)]
*  And supposedly, I heard from someone who's, again, smart [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2204.86s)]
*  and I consider trustworthy that there's actually large sectors [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2207.46s)]
*  of the global economy that are moved more in this direction than you'd think. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2210.9s)]
*  Like there are tentacles into very large investment banks [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2215.62s)]
*  and private equity companies that a lot of these guys have. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2220.22s)]
*  But put it that way, obviously, it does. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2223.5s)]
*  It's not a shocking thing. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2225.2599999999998s)]
*  Why would why would the government let a private equity company [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2226.66s)]
*  operate with impunity? Right. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2230.06s)]
*  So you right. So you actually if they're controlling regulations and. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2231.66s)]
*  Let's work together. Right. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2236.14s)]
*  There doesn't seem to be a good answer to any of this. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2238.02s)]
*  That becomes the real issue. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2240.66s)]
*  You ever get invited to these like [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2242.58s)]
*  fucking Illuminati conferences or any of these crazy things? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2245.38s)]
*  No, they wanted me to do stand up at one conference. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2249.02s)]
*  And it wasn't like an Illuminati kind of was like a I don't know. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2251.34s)]
*  It was like some type of like low grade Illuminati. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2253.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's how they start. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2256.74s)]
*  Oh, Illuminati. It's like the minor leagues. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2258.02s)]
*  Yeah. And then eventually you go to some. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2259.94s)]
*  Yeah. Weird ranch in the mountains of Wyoming. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2262.7799999999997s)]

*  I'll promote it. I'll promote it on Twitter. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2577.22s)]
*  Yeah. And same thing with Moon Tower. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2579.62s)]
*  They're mad at me, too, because I wouldn't have them at the club. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2582.54s)]
*  I'm happy to help you. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2585.22s)]
*  I'm happy to help you. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2587.02s)]
*  I just don't want you to book my club. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2587.7799999999997s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2590.02s)]
*  My club is sold out every night. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2590.82s)]
*  Yeah. And it's guys like you and Shane and Ari and all these. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2592.42s)]
*  I don't want anybody else booking it. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2596.62s)]
*  It doesn't mean that I don't support your cause. Of course. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2598.66s)]
*  I just don't want you coming into my establishment. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2601.98s)]
*  That's all it is. I don't. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2603.98s)]
*  I want everybody to do well. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2605.5s)]
*  There's five comedy clubs on my street. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2607.1s)]
*  What you've done, I think, ultimately is good for the town. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2609.34s)]
*  You bring people into the town. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2613.38s)]
*  The problem is when people used to be in control of comedy in the town [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2615.22s)]
*  and then all of a sudden they're not. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2618.54s)]
*  And they used to be like the person that people would go to. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2619.7s)]
*  And now they're insignificant. Right. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2622.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think a lot of people struggle with that. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2625.42s)]
*  The idea of that, that they're they're they're losing control. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2629.46s)]
*  I think that seems to be the most [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2633.38s)]
*  the angriest I've seen people online since the election [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2635.54s)]
*  that have railed against podcasts and they've railed against. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2639.5s)]
*  They seem to be angry [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2643.3s)]
*  that they no longer have a monopoly on what people can hear. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2646.78s)]
*  Exactly. And they still continue to lie and misrepresent people [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2651.9s)]
*  that do podcasts, right, that are on have a different opinion say. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2655.94s)]
*  And that's where it gets really stupid. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2660.5s)]
*  You know, like they keep saying that, you know, I had that Darryl [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2662.82s)]
*  Cooper guy on that I'm bringing on a Nazi apologist and a Holocaust denier. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2666.26s)]
*  Like that is neither of those things are true. Yeah, it's not true. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2670.86s)]
*  And the guy doesn't just talk about that, by the way, his stuff about Jim Jones [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2674.54s)]
*  is fucking sensational. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2680.02s)]
*  You know, Jim Jones was like a civil rights leader. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2682.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Jim Jones had an interracial child. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2684.3399999999997s)]
*  I didn't know anything. Yeah. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2686.7s)]
*  Jim Jones was like he would he had an adopted black child [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2687.74s)]
*  that he would take to school and everybody would be fucking furious at him in the town. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2691.5s)]
*  Yeah. And he was like he was a legitimate Christian, like a real [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2695.14s)]
*  I believe in the teachings of Jesus Christian. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2699.4199999999996s)]
*  One of the big things in America. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2701.7s)]
*  Cookie. Yeah, of course. The meth got him. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2703.22s)]
*  Yes. Listen, there are a lot of people questioning World War [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2705.14s)]
*  Two for not good reasons. Of course. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2707.8199999999997s)]
*  It's like people that bring up the age of consent. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2709.74s)]
*  You go, wait a minute. Yeah. Hey, what's going on? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2711.62s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2714.66s)]
*  There are people I think that do launder [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2715.54s)]
*  not great reasons for for questioning World War Two through whatever. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2721.02s)]
*  However, no doubt, no doubt. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2724.94s)]
*  There is a very interesting. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2728.3799999999997s)]
*  The teeth really come out, the gnashing of teeth come out in this country [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2731.3s)]
*  when you question at all the American war machine. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2734.54s)]
*  Yes. And the pageantry of war and the, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2739.46s)]
*  you know, iconography of the state and of war and of how important it is [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2746.98s)]
*  and how just it always is and how we're always on the right side of it. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2752.1800000000003s)]
*  And we're always doing the right thing. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2755.7400000000002s)]
*  And World War Two, we 100 percent were. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2757.1400000000003s)]
*  But there are a lot of other times when we've made grave errors [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2759.58s)]
*  with our military. Yes. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2764.98s)]
*  And I feel like it's not good enough for. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2766.7000000000003s)]
*  You can't just point to World War Two, which is, again, we were correct. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2774.1400000000003s)]
*  Yes. But I think there is this idea that if you do, it's not an accident. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2778.2200000000003s)]
*  There's a million movies made about World War Two. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2783.58s)]
*  It's not an accident that there is a lot of pageantry surrounding World War [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2786.18s)]
*  Two, also that the World War Two movies of heroes, of course, Vietnam movies [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2789.7s)]
*  are a buck. That's right. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2793.62s)]
*  Everything's complicated and it's all chaos. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2795.1s)]
*  So I think that inspires the idea that a military solution is always correct [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2796.8599999999997s)]
*  and that the use of force is always the right way to do it. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2801.94s)]
*  And that coincidentally makes people [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2805.02s)]
*  lots and lots of money in their children never end up fighting those wars. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2807.2999999999997s)]
*  That seems to be a lot of it. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2813.3799999999997s)]
*  Now, that doesn't mean that there aren't people with bad motivations [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2815.34s)]
*  that are genuinely anti-Semitic or that genuinely are have fascist [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2819.6600000000003s)]
*  inclinations or absolutely are. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2823.34s)]
*  But I think there needs to be space to criticize the [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2825.26s)]
*  mythologizing of war in general [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2829.98s)]
*  and the justification for endless wars all the time. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2833.1800000000003s)]
*  Yes. Like Iran. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2836.42s)]
*  I hope Trump does not go into Iran. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2837.5s)]
*  That seems like a very bad idea. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2839.7000000000003s)]
*  It also seems to be a very bad idea for Iran to get nuclear weapons. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2841.1400000000003s)]
*  That seems bad, too. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2844.78s)]
*  Yes, but I think there's ways to prevent that without a regime change war. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2845.66s)]
*  This is what we have to do. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2849.02s)]
*  This is what Tulsi Gabbard, I think, was very attractive about [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2850.26s)]
*  a lot of what she said during her confirmation hearing. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2852.78s)]
*  She goes, I understand that there are terrorists out there that are dangerous, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2855.5s)]
*  but we got to find a way to deal with them without committing troops [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2859.78s)]
*  to stand there on in an Islamic country. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2862.7400000000002s)]
*  We've done this. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2865.26s)]
*  We saw this movie. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2866.54s)]
*  It doesn't work out. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2868.14s)]
*  You know, and I think we have to stop thinking that it's going to be better [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2869.7s)]
*  this time if we decapitate the head of a foreign government [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2872.62s)]
*  and with American soldiers in an Islamic country trying to set up [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2877.8599999999997s)]
*  a provisional government. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2881.06s)]
*  The nightmare of that during Iraq, Paul Bremer, this weird British looking guy [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2882.3399999999997s)]
*  that they sent to stand on that rebel rubble with his boots. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2887.18s)]
*  And, you know, the mission accomplished on the aircraft carrier. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2891.02s)]
*  Like it brings back like, you know, to me, it's like I get flashbacks from it. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2893.62s)]
*  Do you remember the guy who was the Iraqi public relations guy [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2898.1s)]
*  who was saying that they're winning the war? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2902.7799999999997s)]
*  Was it was it Akhmet Chalabi? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2904.58s)]
*  Well, that was a guy that fed us all the bullshit to get us in. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2906.14s)]
*  No, no, no. It was the guy that they people openly mocked. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2908.46s)]
*  I believe he had glasses and he was the guy that was always saying [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2912.22s)]
*  that Iraq is kicking ass. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2915.22s)]
*  Oh, interesting. No. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2917.54s)]
*  Yeah. Baghdad, something or another, they called him. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2918.8199999999997s)]
*  And he was saying that we were doing good. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2921.62s)]
*  No, no, no, no. We were saying that Iraq is kicking our ass. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2923.5s)]
*  Yeah. Well, do you remember that area? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2927.18s)]
*  No, I don't remember that. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2929.62s)]
*  That's something or another. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2930.54s)]
*  They call them. By the way, does anyone know what's going on in Iraq right now? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2931.74s)]
*  I couldn't be markets. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2935.86s)]
*  If there was a gun to my head, I could not tell you what the state of Iraq was. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2937.1s)]
*  I know the Taliban are in Afghanistan. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2942.38s)]
*  What's going on in Iraq? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2944.3399999999997s)]
*  Listen, listen, listen. You hear that? Ready? [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2945.9s)]
*  That's a gay guy threw off a roof. Right. Right. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2949.38s)]
*  That's what we said. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2953.5s)]
*  That's a 20 year, you know, commitment. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2954.62s)]
*  What was a very long time? Right. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2957.98s)]
*  So that's like. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2960.7s)]
*  I feel like that's the that's the thing [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2962.38s)]
*  that when you ever try to have a nuanced understanding of what we can and can't do, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2965.62s)]
*  I don't think it's a great idea that Iran gets nuclear weapons. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2969.98s)]
*  It seems like there are ways to prevent that. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2972.2599999999998s)]
*  We got to make ISIS in charge. Full scale invasion. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2974.8599999999997s)]
*  But don't we need these? [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2978.22s)]
*  Like, I think like it. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2979.3399999999997s)]

*  We need these people on a percent. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2983.22s)]
*  And we need them. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2985.58s)]
*  And the Houthis are a fun one because they're like on the ocean and they're like pirates. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2986.2599999999998s)]
*  This is new. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2994.66s)]
*  They figured out that like land based stuff's not as interesting. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2995.7s)]
*  They're like they're disrupting trade. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2998.1s)]
*  You know how much of our trade goes to three percent? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=2999.9s)]
*  Hey, three percent trade. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3002.5s)]
*  Don't minimize that. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3004.46s)]
*  Just like I don't want you minimizing these women. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3005.38s)]
*  Yeah, but we need these Houthis. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3007.54s)]
*  It feels like we need these groups. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3009.34s)]
*  We had ISIS. We had then ISIL. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3011.22s)]
*  Now, you know, we had the people in Syria. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3014.18s)]
*  I forget their names, something. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3016.5s)]
*  But we need these little groups. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3018.62s)]
*  And this is what we do. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3020.3399999999997s)]
*  We just choose because all of these groups are not even [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3022.1s)]
*  they're just people hanging out. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3025.3799999999997s)]
*  And then we give them weapons and get them going. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3027.8599999999997s)]
*  They're just guys in a bar. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3031.4599999999996s)]
*  A lot of these groups are guys in a bar in the bar. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3033.3799999999997s)]
*  They have a hole in the ground, a hole in the ground. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3036.22s)]
*  And we show up and we start arming them and giving them stuff. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3038.82s)]
*  And it's like it's like that Bill Hicks joke where it's like, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3043.26s)]
*  pick up the gun, you know, from a special. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3046.34s)]
*  It's like, are the Houthis an existential threat to the United States? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3047.94s)]
*  That feels crazy. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3052.9s)]
*  The craziest thing just feels insane. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3054.54s)]
*  Trump showing the video of them getting bombed. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3056.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah. So why? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3060.54s)]
*  We could kill. This is the problem. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3062.34s)]
*  We could get rid of all of these threats in five minutes. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3064.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we don't seem to want to. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3068.06s)]
*  I could for business. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3070.34s)]
*  No, we got to keep it. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3071.26s)]
*  So you can't come to a market every week. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3072.18s)]
*  You'll burn it out. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3074.1s)]
*  No, the Houthis are good. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3075.46s)]
*  I give you and stand up. You got to go once. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3076.54s)]
*  You got to go once a year, once every 18 months. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3078.22s)]
*  And I like the Houthis because they feel it's like a new [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3080.3s)]
*  but they're not sticking. It's not no one's believing it. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3083.9s)]
*  So now they're back to Hezbollah. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3086.38s)]
*  Oh, Hezbollah wears the fatigues. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3088.26s)]
*  If you get up Hezbollah, they're scary looking. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3091.94s)]
*  The Houthis are not that scary. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3093.78s)]
*  The Houthis look like a bunch of dudes in like a bizarre, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3095.54s)]
*  like you said, like in a flea market. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3098.34s)]
*  They're on a boat. They're holding up guns. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3100.22s)]
*  No one cares. Hezbollah looks genuinely like, OK, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3101.9s)]
*  let's not fuck with these. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3105.46s)]

*  But I know it's been running. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3159.38s)]
*  And did you hear the story at all? [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3160.38s)]
*  Mark Hopper actually might have helped the military capture Saddam Hussein. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3162.26s)]
*  What? So they were on a USO tour in 2003 [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3165.34s)]
*  and they got asked to come in and do like a private show. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3168.5s)]
*  And he sat down and said, is it here? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3171.82s)]
*  Said, sir, I have a plan to catch Saddam Hussein. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3174.86s)]
*  The musician recalled telling a Navy Admiral on board the aircraft [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3177.34s)]
*  carrying the Persian Gulf, according to Hoppus, who said [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3180.26s)]
*  had been sending video messages to his followers from an unknown location [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3183.38s)]
*  at the time. The musician felt that the military could use drones [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3186.78s)]
*  to their advantage and uncover his location by pulling data [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3189.9s)]
*  from the video messages. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3193.1800000000003s)]
*  Sir, what about having drones fly all over the region [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3195.7400000000002s)]
*  and carpeting patterns, broadcasting time codes above the level of human hearing, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3198.3s)]
*  but at the level that a video recording would catch it? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3202.62s)]
*  Hoppus suggested to the Admiral. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3206.06s)]
*  Then the next time he releases one of his videos, you could listen to it, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3208.2200000000003s)]
*  pull the ultrasonic data and triangulate the drones you have flying all over. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3211.22s)]
*  Holy shit. This is the guy from Blink 182. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3215.46s)]

*  To go watch the band play close up. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3290.6600000000003s)]
*  Oh, what the fuck's the problem with that, Tim? [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3292.1400000000003s)]
*  How about Tim Dillon Fest? [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3294.1800000000003s)]
*  I have no problem with that. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3295.86s)]
*  Basically, Skankfest, just a bunch of people eating shellfish [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3296.98s)]
*  in Long Island, being racist. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3300.14s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3305.42s)]
*  I have no issue with that at all. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3306.98s)]
*  What a fun time, though, for us. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3308.26s)]
*  Yeah, because everything's just I mean, there's so much stuff to talk about. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3309.94s)]
*  Everything's nuts. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3313.02s)]
*  Do you think, you know, I was on the All In podcast the other day [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3313.9s)]
*  and they were talking about these chips, these Nvidia chips and how [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3316.78s)]
*  what's interesting is people are setting up because we have these export controls [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3321.7400000000002s)]
*  that don't allow us to send certain chips to China because they're able [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3326.14s)]
*  to like manipulate them and then become like the world's largest [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3329.3399999999997s)]
*  semiconductor producer. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3332.66s)]
*  But now all these fun fake companies are starting like Bhutan [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3334.74s)]
*  or Cambodia, and they're buying the chips or Singapore. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3338.98s)]
*  And then they all get back to China. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3343.7s)]
*  Well, one of the guys who worked at whatever the [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3345.66s)]
*  preeminent AI system in China was saying, [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3349.06s)]
*  one whistleblowers were saying that they have 50,000 of these fucking ban chips. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3353.18s)]
*  That's so wild. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3358.3399999999997s)]
*  Whoopsies. And so they were talking about like, is it better to send them the chips [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3359.06s)]
*  or is it better to if you didn't if you don't send the chips, then it spurs [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3363.14s)]
*  their innovation and they make the chips. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3366.18s)]
*  Well, either way, they're going to get the chips. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3368.18s)]
*  Yeah, they're getting the chips. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3370.18s)]
*  They're both innovating and stealing at the same time. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3371.62s)]
*  There'd be anything done to stop their rise. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3374.54s)]
*  No, not at this point. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3377.3399999999997s)]
*  Doesn't feel like it, right? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3378.58s)]
*  There's so much more technologically advanced in so many different areas. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3379.98s)]
*  Yeah, like the drones that they have are so superior to the commercial drones [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3383.14s)]
*  that we have because drones over here, you have to have a pilot's license [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3388.38s)]
*  to drive the really spicy ones. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3392.14s)]
*  Do you think some of those drones over New Jersey were theirs? [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3394.34s)]
*  Could be. I think they were ours. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3397.62s)]
*  I honestly do. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3399.9s)]
*  Otherwise, I think they would have shot them down if they could. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3400.62s)]
*  I don't know if they could. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3403.54s)]
*  And maybe they wouldn't, because then it would alarm people, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3405.2599999999998s)]
*  because then it would like you would show that that is a legitimate threat. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3408.06s)]
*  We're fighting for like satellite supremacy in the sky, too. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3411.58s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3414.94s)]
*  Crazy. The Internet, the Starlink. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3415.7s)]
*  I mean, essentially, Elon's launching Starlink's all over the fucking world. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3418.86s)]
*  Do you worry at all that the tech people being Democrats up until five minutes ago? [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3422.3s)]
*  Yeah, you should. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3428.34s)]
*  But I think a lot of those people have shifted sides [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3429.06s)]
*  and they've shifted sides because they understand that. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3432.94s)]
*  Well, you know, had Mark Andreessen in here and Mark Andreessen was explaining. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3435.3s)]
*  He said the most terrifying meetings we ever had was when we were part of an [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3439.02s)]
*  AI startup and the government came in and said, we're not going to let you do this. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3442.54s)]
*  Not only are we not going to let you do this, we're not going to let anybody do this. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3446.2599999999998s)]
*  We're going to have a small amount of these things. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3448.62s)]
*  We're going to completely control. Yeah. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3451.58s)]
*  He was like, what the fuck? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3453.18s)]
*  Like, you guys are really openly saying this. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3454.42s)]
*  You're going to inhibit innovation at the highest level of technology. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3456.9s)]
*  Some shit that you probably don't even understand. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3461.54s)]
*  But you want to have absolute control. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3463.82s)]
*  I think the worry is that people don't trust the government, nor should they. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3465.42s)]
*  But I don't know if they trust these tech guys either. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3468.58s)]
*  You shouldn't. Yeah, you shouldn't. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3470.7799999999997s)]
*  Look what's going on with open AI. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3472.2599999999998s)]
*  That's the whole thing. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3473.98s)]
*  I think that people are wary of the tech people because they've now [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3474.66s)]
*  these were the same people that were censoring and kicking people off the Internet. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3478.9s)]
*  When the people in the White House were blue. Right. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3482.9s)]
*  And now that the people in the White House are red, they are. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3486.02s)]
*  It's swung back the other way. Exactly. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3488.74s)]
*  So I think people are a little wary of that. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3490.66s)]
*  Yeah. They don't know where that goes. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3492.66s)]
*  It's just power. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3494.22s)]
*  It's just it's just I mean, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3495.7s)]
*  like Bernie Sanders is right. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3498.1s)]
*  You know that you should be scared of oligarchs and oligarchs shouldn't be running our government. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3500.18s)]
*  He's right in that regard. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3504.7s)]
*  And when people get into positions of just unchecked power. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3506.54s)]
*  So let's say if someone had control of some tech company, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3511.58s)]
*  let's say it's an AI company and that AI company literally [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3515.62s)]
*  creates the unstoppable AI that helps empower the entire country. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3519.4199999999996s)]
*  There's one guy's in control and he's worth three trillion dollars. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3524.74s)]
*  And he decides to lobby and change a bunch of laws and influence politicians. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3528.3799999999997s)]
*  And his company starts donating to certain politics. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3532.8999999999996s)]
*  You could change the fabric of society with enough money and enough power and influence, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3535.5s)]
*  you know, especially if you could completely control what the narrative is. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3540.22s)]
*  Right. In terms of like when people Google things, when they search things, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3545.18s)]
*  when they talk about things, you can completely control what they're allowed to talk about [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3548.8199999999997s)]
*  and how that narrative gets countered instantly with facts and bullshit. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3552.98s)]
*  And yeah, you can just. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3559.42s)]
*  Well, it's being done everywhere. Right. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3560.54s)]
*  So it's being done at the highest levels. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3561.82s)]
*  And I think people are uncomfortable with. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3564.54s)]
*  Just losing, even though a lot of them realize that we didn't have a ton of control, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3571.1800000000003s)]
*  they feel like I think when you head into the world of tech, where people just don't even know. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3576.98s)]
*  Right. Where this goes, where does it go? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3582.06s)]
*  Is it going to transhumanism? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3584.94s)]
*  Does it go to like AI replacing everybody? [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3586.06s)]
*  And then at what point? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3588.74s)]
*  What do you do with those people that I replaced? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3590.5s)]
*  You give them all cryptocurrency that's linked to their biological whatever. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3592.66s)]
*  Do you? I've heard all these ideas, right? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3596.18s)]
*  Like, how do you deal with driverless cars where if the entire road is automated, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3598.62s)]
*  how do you deal with that? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3604.38s)]
*  I think that fills people with an anxiety where they go, what is the plan? [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3605.58s)]
*  And a lot of these tech guys like, well, we got to get off the planet. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3610.18s)]
*  And I think people start going like, wait, you know, like that's Weinstein. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3613.14s)]
*  Eric wants. Well, it's a lot of people. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3617.66s)]
*  There's a lot of people like I don't know what you're saying. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3619.4199999999996s)]
*  There's a lot of people. There's no air on Mars. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3622.1s)]
*  Like, let's not go there. Yeah. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3624.02s)]
*  Well, for sure. For sure. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3625.46s)]
*  Do you think Trump and Moscow have a falling out eventually? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3626.98s)]
*  I don't know. It's a good question. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3631.8199999999997s)]
*  The media keeps trying to push that they are. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3633.46s)]
*  It feels like they're just big personalities and that there's an inevitability [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3635.9s)]
*  when you have two guys that are incredibly, you know, perhaps. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3641.06s)]
*  How far? [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3645.94s)]
*  Elon is very smart and you see he's always very deferential. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3646.86s)]
*  And he's always very respectful. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3652.02s)]
*  Mr. President, it's always that. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3653.9s)]
*  Of course. Yeah. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3655.54s)]
*  That's how I treat him. I always call him sir. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3657.14s)]
*  It's Donald Trump. Yeah, I get it. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3659.9s)]
*  You're fired. I get it. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3662.34s)]
*  But he's also the president of the United States. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3663.54s)]
*  I call him sir. But I call everybody sir. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3665.7s)]
*  Yeah. I call everybody sir. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3667.5s)]
*  Yeah. It's like the byproduct of me living in Texas. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3668.74s)]
*  Right. Sure. Yeah. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3671.2999999999997s)]
*  But I don't know if they're going to. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3672.9399999999996s)]
*  You don't get pulled over anymore here. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3674.8999999999996s)]
*  And if I do, it's not that big of a deal. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3676.98s)]
*  If you get pulled over here, a cop gives you money. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3678.3799999999997s)]
*  They go, Mr. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3684.3799999999997s)]
*  Rogan, here's a check. I mean, there's no way. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3684.8599999999997s)]
*  There's no law that you cannot break here. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3687.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm guaranteeing you. I don't think that's correct. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3689.74s)]
*  I think you could do a lot. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3691.74s)]
*  I think they would you would do a cover up a murder. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3693.98s)]
*  That's sweet. If you murdered three people, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3696.82s)]
*  I think the awesome PD would go, whatever, man. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3698.82s)]
*  They do want to let them bring that mayor, that guy. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3702.78s)]
*  And he'd go, what? [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3705.14s)]
*  They go, yeah, the suspects Joe Rogan, he was standing over the bodies. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3706.86s)]
*  They go, are you out of your fucking mind? [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3709.1s)]
*  Drive him home right now. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3711.66s)]
*  Drive that man home. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3713.66s)]
*  If I was in waist deep in Rainy Street. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3714.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Drowning a partygoer. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3717.62s)]
*  They don't care. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3719.3s)]
*  Oh, they still don't want to admit that there's a serial killer. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3721.14s)]
*  You're the tourism board. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3724.26s)]
*  Yeah, no, there there's something's up. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3726.1s)]
*  There's a serial killer. Something's going on. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3728.14s)]
*  I believe there's a serial killer. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3729.9s)]
*  And what are they doing? [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3731.54s)]
*  They're luring people to that bridge and then, yeah, it's not hard. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3732.14s)]
*  People like to go to the bridge. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3735.46s)]
*  I just got to look out for the bush. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3736.98s)]
*  I guess it's such a high to kill someone. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3738.58s)]
*  It's to me. I'm like, what do you get out of it? [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3740.62s)]
*  But I guess the people that are doing it like it, they're broken. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3742.1800000000003s)]
*  There's broken people. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3745.14s)]
*  Some broken people do math and some broken people [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3746.6600000000003s)]
*  drown guys like to party. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3749.94s)]
*  Do you ever talk to like I'm sure you have? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3751.34s)]
*  This is a stupid question. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3753.26s)]
*  But like the high level law enforcement guys that have just met these monsters [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3754.18s)]
*  and stuff. Oh, yeah. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3757.34s)]
*  And is there is that do they believe that it's like [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3758.42s)]
*  is there any part of them that believes someone's just born? Yes. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3762.46s)]
*  Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3766.58s)]
*  And it's generally you have psychotic parents. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3768.3s)]
*  And so it's was whether it's nature or nurture is hard to separate [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3771.3s)]
*  because you're probably abused. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3775.1s)]
*  And generally at an early age, they show like a willingness to torture [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3777.14s)]
*  like house pets and stuff. Yeah. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3782.1s)]
*  Yeah. They'll maybe start off with a frog they catch and stick out [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3785.66s)]
*  like a firecracker in its mouth. Yeah. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3788.8599999999997s)]
*  Stuff like that. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3790.94s)]
*  And then they eventually work their way up to humans. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3791.98s)]
*  Now it seems so much harder to do it because of these phones. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3794.8199999999997s)]
*  Surveillance is it is. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3797.8599999999997s)]
*  But it's you can still do it. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3800.1s)]
*  Not in Austin. You can get away with drowning. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3801.74s)]
*  You can drown people. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3803.7s)]
*  Why don't you think they'll admit it? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3805.74s)]
*  They don't want people getting spooked. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3806.94s)]
*  It's a good question. It's a good question. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3808.58s)]
*  Maybe maybe I'm wrong. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3810.38s)]
*  I mean, one of the biggest things ever in Austin with those crazy [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3812.54s)]
*  yogurt shop murders, HBO just came out with a documentary about that [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3814.86s)]
*  was many years ago, this crazy yogurt shop murder thing. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3819.26s)]
*  HBO just did a doc happen in Austin. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3822.34s)]
*  It was like a famous case. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3824.86s)]
*  And it's completely unsolved except they put some people in jail for it. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3827.38s)]
*  But then later let one of them out. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3831.14s)]
*  Like it was just one of those things where nobody was sure about what happened. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3832.34s)]
*  So there were murdering people that went to the yogurt place. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3835.62s)]
*  It was 1991. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3837.54s)]
*  And it just South by Southwest. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3838.9s)]
*  They just did a huge. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3840.2599999999998s)]
*  Oh, it was one homicide, a quadruple homicide, which took place [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3842.8199999999997s)]
*  at I can't believe it's yogurt shop in Austin. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3847.7799999999997s)]
*  That could have been me in 1991. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3851.14s)]
*  It's 34 years ago. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3854.3399999999997s)]
*  34 years ago. It's an underbelly. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3856.66s)]
*  14 girls were murdered in Austin. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3859.02s)]
*  14 year. Wow. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3861.8599999999997s)]
*  And it's a puzzle. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3865.14s)]
*  They don't know it's an unsolved murder. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3866.8599999999997s)]
*  I checked the boyfriends and there's many different theories about it. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3869.46s)]
*  Wow. That's crazy. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3874.66s)]
*  Four men were arrested in charge of capital murder in 99, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3877.3399999999997s)]
*  but two of their cases were overturned. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3879.7799999999997s)]
*  The other two never went to trial. Wow. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3881.62s)]
*  Interesting. So there are these things that happen. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3885.22s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Well, that's what they say. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3888.06s)]
*  That if you just randomly shoot someone and kill them, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3889.3799999999997s)]
*  if you're a real real like randos, like did you ever see that movie [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3892.42s)]
*  Henry portrait of a serial killer? No. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3895.9s)]
*  It was about a guy named Henry Lee Lucas. Oh, wow. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3898.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And Henry Lee Lucas was attributed. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3900.9s)]
*  They attributed like 62 murders to him. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3903.5s)]
*  The problem is, I think one of the things cops do is they go, [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3906.02s)]
*  did you kill this guy? Yeah, I killed him, too. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3911.54s)]
*  Where did you bury him? Where was he buried? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3913.9s)]
*  That's where I buried. Right. That kind of thing. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3916.1s)]
*  Now you got to know you got a case solved. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3918.1s)]
*  That was that was the accusation about Henry, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3920.42s)]
*  because he was definitely a murderer and a grifter and a drifter. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3923.14s)]
*  And he was traveling around the country stealing things. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3926.54s)]
*  And but then they made a movie about him. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3928.5s)]
*  And then the movie, it's like he's way more sinister and calculated. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3931.2200000000003s)]
*  And but he would just randomly kill people. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3935.38s)]
*  So they'll take credit for things they didn't do exactly to just beef up [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3937.38s)]
*  the body count. Exactly. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3941.06s)]
*  So that's what they want. They want attention. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3942.38s)]
*  They're already in jail. That's so wild. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3944.46s)]
*  That's a when you have shitty [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3947.94s)]
*  DAs and shitty prosecutors and shitty cops, they'll do stuff like that. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3950.1800000000003s)]
*  Do you think that? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3954.6600000000003s)]
*  There are people that are, you know, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3957.02s)]
*  national parks seem to be like a hotbed of people disappearing. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3960.14s)]
*  And do you think Appalachian Trail people? [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3963.34s)]
*  Yeah. Do you think that's people getting you or is that a lot of it? [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3965.38s)]
*  Like, I got lost. I got eaten. You get lost. Yeah. You get eaten. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3968.62s)]
*  There's a guy who has this whole series for one. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3971.7000000000003s)]
*  Is it 9-1-1 missing or 4-1-1 missing people in national parks? [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3975.2999999999997s)]
*  Listen, man, you're just meat out there and you get eaten. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3980.22s)]
*  And by the way, you don't find dead anything out there. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3983.7799999999997s)]
*  You don't find dead mountain lines. Guess what? They die all the time. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3987.14s)]
*  I've never seen a dead mountain line when I was hunting because they get eaten. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3990.2599999999998s)]
*  They get eaten. Everything gets it. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3993.38s)]
*  You get not only do you get eaten, your bones get eaten. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3994.7799999999997s)]
*  Everything gets eaten. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3997.02s)]
*  It's so it's not uncommon to disappear and there's no trace. No trace. Yeah. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=3998.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Super common. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4003.3399999999997s)]
*  So if you're in a high traffic area like I've hunting, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4005.02s)]
*  I've found elk bones where a hunter killed the elk and then, you know, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4010.82s)]
*  took all the meat off the bones and then left the bones there. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4016.38s)]
*  That's that's what you do when you pack out meat. Yeah. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4019.14s)]
*  And I found those those animals. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4021.42s)]
*  I actually even found one animal that I shot a long time ago. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4023.18s)]
*  I shot like four years ago. And you found it. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4026.3s)]
*  Yeah, we were in the same location. It was the same bones. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4028.58s)]
*  There wasn't all the bones there. Right. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4031.62s)]
*  Some of them have been dragged away. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4033.66s)]
*  Some of them have probably been eaten by rodents. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4034.98s)]
*  You know, they they eat the bones slowly, but surely. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4037.66s)]
*  And if you're a human, you're made out of nothing. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4040.2999999999997s)]
*  You're so easy to eat. Right. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4042.8599999999997s)]
*  You know, like our bones are less dense. Our meat is soft and chewy. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4044.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, like we get devoured. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4050.46s)]
*  A bear would eat your whole body. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4052.66s)]
*  There would be almost nothing left. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4054.5s)]
*  And rodents would eat what's left. Yeah. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4056.2599999999998s)]
*  You got to be careful in those places. You can't be careful. Yeah. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4058.2999999999997s)]
*  If you don't have a GPS navigation system that has a lot of batteries, [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4062.34s)]
*  if you don't have a compass, have a compass and know how to use it, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4067.0200000000004s)]
*  if you don't have a map, it's so easy to get lost in the woods. Right. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4069.3s)]
*  It's so easy. Yeah. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4072.46s)]
*  They're all around you and you can go in one direction and circle around. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4074.1000000000004s)]
*  You don't even realize you're circling. Right. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4078.2200000000003s)]
*  And then three days later, you're back to where you started. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4079.6600000000003s)]
*  You're like, fuck it. No. Yeah. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4081.98s)]
*  You've been eating tree bark for three days and you're thinking, [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4084.0600000000004s)]
*  one any step, I'm going to see the highway. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4087.0200000000004s)]
*  What a horrible thing. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4089.3s)]
*  People die like that all all the time. All the time. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4090.82s)]
*  Just go to a hotel. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4094.5800000000004s)]
*  It's very difficult to just go to a resort. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4096.22s)]
*  If you don't know the woods, you're not used to being in the woods [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4099.18s)]
*  and you're not used to having landmarks. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4102.06s)]
*  Yeah. Follow and know how to use a compass. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4103.9400000000005s)]
*  Know how to use a GPS. Some people are good at it. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4106.74s)]
*  And even they get eaten. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4109.18s)]
*  You know, they get into what you break your ankle. Right. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4110.42s)]
*  How about you break your ankle out there and you can't hike out. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4112.42s)]
*  It's not possible. Right. Right. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4115.14s)]
*  What do you do? Yeah. You fucking die. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4116.860000000001s)]
*  That's what you do. Got to be very careful. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4118.66s)]
*  And then you hear something at night. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4120.42s)]
*  You're sleeping under a tree and you hear something at night. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4121.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. Right. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4124.86s)]
*  You see a bear sniffing you. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4126.78s)]
*  It's crazy. You can't run away and you don't have a weapon. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4128.1s)]
*  And you can't do anything. It just eats you alive. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4130.1s)]
*  And those woods are so dense in the Pacific Northwest and stuff like that. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4132.26s)]
*  I mean, and everywhere. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4134.9400000000005s)]
*  But especially the Pacific, especially there, it's a crazy. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4136.38s)]
*  Yeah. You don't find nothing out there. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4139.66s)]
*  But that's why the Bigfoot rumor persists up there, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4141.78s)]
*  because the woods are like a box of Q-tips. Right. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4144.78s)]
*  You know, like you can't see shit out there. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4147.66s)]
*  You don't know what's going on. You see like a little shadow [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4149.5s)]
*  moving in between trees and you've decided it's a Bigfoot. Right. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4151.46s)]
*  Yeah. But it's just like a bear. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4155.26s)]
*  It could be. Right. It's most likely a bear, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4157.14s)]
*  especially bears walking on two legs. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4159.42s)]
*  Northern California is weird like that, too. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4161.18s)]
*  I mean, that's part of the Pacific Northwest. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4163.18s)]
*  Probably. Yeah. You get killed up there. Yeah. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4164.7s)]
*  People die up there all the time. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4166.54s)]
*  Did you ever see that documentary Sasquatch? No. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4167.74s)]
*  It's a documentary that was on Hulu, Jamie. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4171.22s)]
*  We had the director and the guy who created it was awesome. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4174.7s)]
*  And what's really about is about marijuana growers [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4178.9s)]
*  murdered a guy and then blamed it on Bigfoot. Wow. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4182.42s)]
*  So these marijuana growers in Humboldt, like that up that area. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4185.34s)]
*  So they all were hippies. Right. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4190.66s)]
*  And then they started growing weed and then cartel people moved in [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4192.82s)]
*  and gangs moved in and they started robbing these people. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4197.9s)]
*  So these people became heavily armed. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4200.94s)]
*  And then they started having wars with like the growers and cartel people. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4202.86s)]
*  And so there was these people that were trying to steal from them. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4208.58s)]
*  They murdered these people and then they blamed it on Bigfoot. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4210.86s)]
*  They like ran over him with a fucking backhoe and crushed his body. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4213.78s)]
*  These hippies are really violent. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4216.74s)]
*  Oh, they get violent once it's money. These hippies are junkies. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4218.26s)]
*  And, you know, like this whole hippie thing, I think, is kind of a lie. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4220.54s)]
*  Well, they all become people with money. Right. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4224.3s)]
*  If you're growing weed, you become a multimillionaire [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4226.86s)]
*  who's carrying a sidearm. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4229.46s)]
*  OK, and you're going to protect your money. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4230.94s)]
*  And then these people are trying to kill you to take your shit. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4233.42s)]
*  So then you're like, right. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4235.62s)]
*  And Jason, whatever his name is in Ozark. Right. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4237.5s)]
*  What's Jason Bateman? [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4240.78s)]
*  Just in Bateman. Right. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4241.62s)]
*  And now your drug dealer. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4242.82s)]
*  That's so funny. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4244.46s)]
*  It's so funny. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4245.54s)]
*  The weird like marijuana where it's like it's federally still illegal. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4246.3s)]
*  But like states, it's legal in certain states. Yeah. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4250.54s)]
*  And there's that gray area where there's just like, you know, [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4253.34s)]
*  half of that business is like in the shadows and half of it's [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4255.66s)]
*  and people make lots of money. It's strange. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4258.5s)]
*  Well, not only that, because California made it legal, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4261.0199999999995s)]
*  they also made it a misdemeanor to grow it illegally. Right. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4264.5s)]
*  So what happens is these cartels started growing it on national forest land. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4268.34s)]
*  And so then Game Warden started finding it. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4273.660000000001s)]
*  There's a guy named John Norris who's been on the podcast before. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4276.14s)]
*  He wrote a book called Hidden War. Yeah. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4278.740000000001s)]
*  And it was all about he was a game warden and he became a part of a tactical crew [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4280.9800000000005s)]
*  that was busting cartel members were heavily armed, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4284.820000000001s)]
*  growing marijuana in national forests. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4288.46s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4291.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because most of the illegal weed that's been sold [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4293.3s)]
*  all over the country was being grown there. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4297.22s)]
*  So in the places where it is illegal, they grow it where it's legal. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4299.66s)]
*  And if they get busted, it's just a misdemeanor. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4302.78s)]
*  So it doesn't matter. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4304.86s)]
*  And they're not going to deport anybody because California is a sanctuary. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4305.62s)]
*  Right. So it doesn't matter how many acres and acres of weed. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4308.26s)]
*  Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4312.0199999999995s)]
*  And so because it's federally illegal, it's just like when there was [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4313.46s)]
*  a prohibition that propped up organized crime. Same thing. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4317.46s)]
*  You've just propped up illegal businesses to sell something [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4320.66s)]
*  that has a demand that normal. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4324.14s)]
*  Do you think weed is going to be federally legal? [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4326.1s)]
*  If I had to guess, not during this administration. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4329.22s)]
*  Yeah. No, I don't think I think it feels like a lot of the, you know, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4330.9800000000005s)]
*  like the experimental harm reduction policies in places like Portland [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4334.22s)]
*  to go in the other way. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4337.7s)]
*  Well, they went a little crazy in a place that was already crazy. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4338.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, they had a woman driving around shooting people up called the Stabbing Wagon. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4342.26s)]
*  And she was like, if somebody needed if somebody needed a fix, she'd like pull up. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4345.82s)]
*  And give them clean needles and stuff. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4350.379999999999s)]
*  And it was called the Stabbing Wagon. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4352.5s)]
*  Yeah, because you're stabbing. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4355.0599999999995s)]
*  And if you're just tweet. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4357.0199999999995s)]

*  Oh, poor. And people just be chilling and like, hey, I need a couple of clean needles. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4362.94s)]
*  So this woman would just show up. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4366.219999999999s)]
*  There'd be like a bunch of junkies hanging out. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4367.379999999999s)]

*  with a bunch of clean needles, hand them out. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4372.259999999999s)]

*  Not only did it not work, it encouraged people to move there. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4386.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Actually, that's true. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4389.099999999999s)]
*  So people started moving there because you're like, this is actually a pretty good deal. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4390.94s)]
*  They don't care if you live on the street. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4394.7s)]
*  And there's this bitch in a van that shows up with clean needles. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4396.98s)]
*  And they give you money. Yeah. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4400.54s)]

*  There you go. Look at the step. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4414.22s)]
*  There's a stabbing wagon. Well, at least she's healthy. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4415.38s)]
*  She's got great hair, too. It's the Stabbing Wagon. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4418.38s)]
*  OK, makes sense. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4419.700000000001s)]
*  At the end of the day, it's like that. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4420.740000000001s)]
*  That seems like a good way to combat drug use is to have a van of drugs. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4422.46s)]
*  That van got a one point five million dollar grant. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4428.02s)]
*  Did you see that? Yeah. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4430.06s)]

*  They're trying to help people get high in a safe way. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4437.38s)]
*  But where she parked that van? That's what I need to know. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4439.700000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's a good question. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4442.26s)]
*  She probably lived in the burbs and then came in and then did what she needed. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4443.46s)]
*  She doesn't look like a burbs lady. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4446.740000000001s)]

*  Those people are it's different. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4458.26s)]
*  They're like people that live outside of Chernobyl. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4460.06s)]
*  Yeah, they're forever changed. It's it's different. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4461.900000000001s)]

*  Something's going on. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4465.54s)]
*  Bad DNA damage. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4466.3s)]
*  What was funny is that there's a big article where they were like, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4467.86s)]
*  yeah, this is actually like what's crazy is like you read about those cities, right? [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4469.82s)]

*  They'll do the craziest thing ever. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4475.46s)]
*  And then like two years later, they'll start going like, [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4477.06s)]
*  yeah, this just is not having the results that we thought it would have. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4479.82s)]
*  Like this is drug use is up. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4483.78s)]

*  Violence is up. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4488.42s)]
*  So Santa Monica now is doing a curfew because there's been violent crimes at night. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4489.46s)]
*  No way. They're thinking about doing a curfew in Santa Monica. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4494.14s)]
*  So, again, because, yes, Santa Monica is thinking about doing a curfew [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4497.14s)]
*  because there's like violent crimes. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4502.26s)]
*  So instead of just going like, OK, we got to throw these people in jail. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4503.34s)]

*  They're just empty vessels. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4717.26s)]
*  And then at the same time you have that happening, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4719.18s)]
*  you have the craziest people in the world [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4722.3s)]
*  that somehow have gotten hold of a ton of money and a ton of influence on social media. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4725.7s)]
*  And those empty suit politicians are like scared of these lunatics [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4733.82s)]
*  that believe the craziest things you've ever heard. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4741.26s)]
*  So these politicians are just like taking edicts from these crazy people online [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4744.66s)]
*  who tell them that we need the stabbing wagon and we need all this stuff. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4750.06s)]
*  I don't I don't know [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4754.02s)]
*  how that happened, that somebody should should look at that, how that happened and [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4756.74s)]
*  and study it. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4761.139999999999s)]
*  And I think it's a lot of these politicians are deeply corrupt. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4762.0199999999995s)]
*  And I think they're terribly afraid of whatever corruption they're involved with [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4764.9s)]
*  coming to the surface. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4768.98s)]
*  And it could be personal in their personal life. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4770.54s)]
*  It could be with the state. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4772.86s)]
*  I think, you know, the mismanagement of money, of resources, all of that stuff. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4774.58s)]
*  So if I was a really corrupt politician, I would just do the craziest left wing shit [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4779.219999999999s)]
*  so that I could never be accused of anything. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4785.139999999999s)]
*  Good move. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4787.54s)]
*  And I would just let them do whatever the hell they want. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4788.139999999999s)]
*  I go, yeah, well, fuck it. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4790.26s)]
*  And what we got a new law that says you got it. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4791.3s)]
*  You got it. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4794.34s)]
*  You got they got to draw blood in your house from you before you can defend yourself. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4794.9400000000005s)]
*  We need a rapper. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4798.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4799.860000000001s)]
*  Rappers are the last people in this country that can kind of get away with almost anything. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4800.3s)]
*  Well, rappers are honest. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4804.58s)]
*  A lot of them, even though they might lie about how much money they have and stuff, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4806.18s)]
*  they do. There's a certain honesty to that genre of music. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4809.14s)]
*  Clearly, you go too far like P. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4813.7s)]
*  Diddy, you can go too far. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4815.26s)]
*  But he wasn't super honest. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4817.3s)]
*  He seemed to be concealing a bit. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4819.1s)]
*  He seemed to be. Yeah. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4820.900000000001s)]
*  Do you think he was working for somebody? [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4822.26s)]
*  Or working with somebody? [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4824.5s)]
*  Or do you think it was all his own? [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4825.54s)]
*  If the CIA was like, we can't really we don't really know anything about like these [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4826.700000000001s)]
*  this world of like, you know, that's not what we do. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4831.46s)]
*  We're like a bunch of Harvard guys. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4834.900000000001s)]
*  And we have these fucking weirdos that we know about how to get in with like our people. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4836.5s)]
*  But we need someone who was like a black guy to do it. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4842.1s)]
*  It could have been P. Diddy. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4845.54s)]
*  But didn't all the accusations come out after he was involved in a lawsuit with [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4846.62s)]
*  Shrock? Like he was trying. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4850.98s)]
*  That's what people said. Yeah. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4852.58s)]
*  Yeah. That's where it gets interesting. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4853.66s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4855.7s)]
*  I mean, it's going to be very careful when you start fucking around with people's [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4856.74s)]
*  billions. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4861.22s)]
*  Big, powerful billionaires are. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4862.3s)]
*  Probably their their own governments. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4866.1s)]
*  Yeah. So, I mean, when you run a foul of them, I think there's many ways at which [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4869.0599999999995s)]
*  they can get you. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4873.42s)]
*  Also, they feel like they pay so much money for taxes. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4875.38s)]
*  I think that's a lot of these intelligence agencies are working for those people. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4879.14s)]
*  They're not, I think, on their own. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4884.66s)]
*  There are there's big money to be made. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4887.5s)]
*  And there's a lot of the people that own these companies and have been rich for a [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4891.900000000001s)]
*  very long time and who aren't on reality TV. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4895.9800000000005s)]
*  And you don't really know who they are. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4898.74s)]
*  But they like some of them are on the Forbes list. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4900.02s)]
*  Some of them aren't. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4902.58s)]
*  Some of them are just incredibly wealthy and they've made their money in ways that [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4903.98s)]
*  you can barely understand. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4907.179999999999s)]
*  And those are people that are the reason historically that the CIA is going into [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4909.139999999999s)]
*  Latin America and overthrowing government so that United Fruit can, you know, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4915.0199999999995s)]
*  it's true, have a monopoly, right? [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4921.66s)]
*  It's like this is so they're doing things at the behest of these ultra wealthy [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4923.98s)]
*  families that control huge industries. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4929.74s)]
*  Sure. And they always have. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4932.339999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's back to Smedly Butler's. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4933.98s)]
*  That's right. A racket. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4936.379999999999s)]
*  Thousand percent. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4937.74s)]
*  And that was 1933. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4938.66s)]
*  He wrote that or something. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4940.0599999999995s)]
*  And that's the way the whole thing seems to be organized. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4941.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And always has been. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4944.459999999999s)]
*  We're just learning it now. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4946.459999999999s)]
*  You know, that's all the difference. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4948.0199999999995s)]
*  But it is falling apart now because some of their kids are doing stand up comedy. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4949.0599999999995s)]
*  No, literally. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4953.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, there are people, they're young in New York and they're just like their [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4953.9s)]
*  parents are some of the wealthiest people in the world. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4957.259999999999s)]
*  And these kids are like doing stand up, which is terrible sign for the [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4959.82s)]
*  empire. That's not a great sign for the empire is that like a guy that would have [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4963.9s)]
*  taken over his dad's business is like doing dick jokes. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4969.179999999999s)]
*  Well, he probably has a trust fund. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4972.9s)]
*  So he probably has a safety blanket and sees we're having fun. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4974.42s)]
*  So I don't have for sure. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4978.94s)]
*  Like my dad. Yeah. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4980.0599999999995s)]
*  Have a fucking heart attack when I'm 49. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4981.5s)]
*  That's right. But we need them doing that. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4983.339999999999s)]
*  Some of them have an heart attack. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4985.58s)]
*  Yes. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4987.339999999999s)]
*  Everyone can't be a clown like we did. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4989.7s)]
*  There is something deeply unhealthy about the Illuminati doing stand up. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4991.94s)]
*  I don't love that idea. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=4998.339999999999s)]
*  Well, unless they're using chat GPT, how good could their material be? [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5000.139999999999s)]
*  It's not ideal. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5003.0199999999995s)]
*  It can't be. It's a lot of crowd work. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5004.62s)]
*  And even if they do, nothing wrong with that. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5006.259999999999s)]
*  But yeah, GPT has not shown any ability to really craft a good joke yet. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5007.78s)]
*  It's just funny to meet some of these people and then you talk to them and they'll [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5012.0199999999995s)]
*  like casually drop that they're like, you know, the parents like billionaires. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5015.74s)]
*  And you're like, that's awesome, man. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5020.3s)]
*  And then just doing bar shows. It's kind of interesting. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5022.34s)]
*  And they're nice people. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5024.9400000000005s)]
*  But just to pull out and look at it from a sociological standpoint, [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5026.14s)]
*  it says something about people's idea of the future that these people just like [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5030.02s)]
*  want to be famous now. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5034.66s)]
*  And how many of them are there? [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5036.02s)]
*  There's some more than you'd think. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5037.66s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5039.3s)]
*  New York thing. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5040.3s)]
*  It's a lot of rich people live there. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5041.3s)]
*  And I'm talking about mega rich, like not right. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5043.22s)]
*  Not like, hey, my dad's a successful whatever. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5046.06s)]
*  I'm talking about like, whoa, billions, big money. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5048.98s)]
*  Yeah. Where you go. Interesting. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5052.66s)]
*  And then the kids don't have any pressure to do anything. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5054.66s)]
*  The kids kind of float around and they're they're doing stage. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5057.299999999999s)]
*  It's just very funny. It's something that makes me laugh. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5060.139999999999s)]
*  It's just like a billionaire kid on stage looking at someone in the audience going, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5061.9s)]
*  what do you do for a living? [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5065.299999999999s)]
*  A lot of crowd work, huh? [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5070.9s)]
*  Yeah. What do you do for a living? [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5072.219999999999s)]
*  Maybe this is the first time they've met people that aren't billionaires. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5073.86s)]
*  Well, that could also be a thing. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5076.82s)]
*  This might be a way to just socialize Illuminati kids. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5078.86s)]
*  They've met their housekeepers before. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5083.46s)]
*  Maybe they asked them, like, what should I talk about on stage? [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5085.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, they have. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5087.179999999999s)]
*  And what's funny is like they have parties in their big houses and bring their other [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5088.66s)]
*  comic friends who are bums, you know, young comics. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5091.54s)]
*  I mean, we're all bums. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5094.54s)]
*  So then like the parents are like, hello. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5095.86s)]
*  And they bring in like a bum and they go, this is my buddy. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5098.9s)]
*  And then, you know, from the buffet, he's just like staring at them, going, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5101.9s)]
*  whoa, this place rocks. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5105.0199999999995s)]
*  It's like a sitcom. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5107.42s)]
*  Yeah. And they're like, these are my friends. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5108.34s)]
*  And I think the parents are kind of like, oh, well, isn't that nice? [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5110.14s)]
*  Maybe it's a phase. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5115.3s)]
*  I think the parents look at it like they're going through a phase. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5116.900000000001s)]
*  That's interesting. It's very interesting more than one of them. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5119.860000000001s)]
*  It's a it says something about that group of people that used to run everything. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5122.82s)]
*  They have a dearth of purpose in their life. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5128.78s)]
*  They're kind of aimless and they float around. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5132.3s)]
*  I don't mean specifically, you know, rich comedian kids. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5134.34s)]
*  I just mean like that ruling class. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5137.18s)]
*  What are they doing now? [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5139.46s)]
*  They don't really have a purpose. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5140.900000000001s)]
*  They kind of float around. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5142.34s)]
*  They try to this new age spirituality bullshit. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5143.780000000001s)]
*  They travel all over the place. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5146.820000000001s)]
*  You look at any of these rich kids, Instagram's all they're doing is traveling. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5148.66s)]
*  It's all the same shit. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5151.860000000001s)]
*  Anguilla, go here, go there. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5153.26s)]
*  There's no purpose. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5155.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, I think they don't feel like America's has a defining mission. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5157.58s)]
*  Like if you look at families like the Kennedys, the Bushes, whatever, [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5163.58s)]
*  you think about those families, they served in the military. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5166.179999999999s)]
*  They believe that there was some type of arc of history that they were a part of. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5169.219999999999s)]
*  I feel like a lot of rich people now just kind of don't believe in much of anything. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5173.259999999999s)]
*  And it's just kind of like, I don't know, bored. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5176.98s)]
*  They start a fake company. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5180.339999999999s)]
*  Well, if your whole focus is just making more money. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5182.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. How much time can you spend believing in things? [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5185.94s)]
*  Right. That's that's going to take away from your ability to earn. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5188.9s)]
*  Yeah. I think that's one of the big problems now. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5191.379999999999s)]
*  And that's why I think you saw like a lot of like people get crazy on the left [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5194.66s)]
*  and they started instituting like all these like weird virtue, [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5198.7s)]
*  you know, these purity tests and stuff like that is because I think they feel [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5202.5s)]
*  a lack of meaning and they wanted to give them a lot of them wanted to be [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5206.22s)]
*  self-flagellation and like they wanted the tenets of religion. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5209.74s)]
*  They wanted meaning. They just don't have it. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5213.06s)]
*  So I think that's what happens with a lot of them. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5215.34s)]
*  And I and their kids are nice people. They're not bad people. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5218.14s)]
*  It's just funny to see, like because most people who do comedy, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5220.06s)]
*  a lot of them aren't poor. A lot of them are like middle class people [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5223.3s)]
*  because they have like the ability to go and at least think it's an option. Right. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5225.42s)]
*  But it is funny when someone goes, I'm a I'm doing comedy [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5230.42s)]
*  and I'm from I'm the scion of great wealth. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5235.1s)]
*  Scion's a great word. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5238.26s)]
*  It's an interesting thing to me just because I've always been fascinated [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5239.3s)]
*  with rich people and like these people that run the world. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5242.26s)]
*  And it's so interesting that some of their kids are like, I want to [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5245.900000000001s)]
*  I'm going to do stand up comedy. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5249.06s)]
*  When was the first time you met a really rich person? [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5250.860000000001s)]
*  How old were you? [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5252.98s)]
*  I met a couple of like mafia people that my dad used to play music, [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5254.86s)]
*  so they own some bars, but they weren't super rich. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5257.98s)]
*  I would observe them because my uncle is the director of operations [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5260.66s)]
*  for all these restaurant groups in New York, this restaurant group in New York City [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5263.62s)]
*  that had these these big high end steak houses. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5266.98s)]
*  And I would go and one of them was on 63rd and Park. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5269.339999999999s)]
*  I would sit in this steakhouse with my parents. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5272.099999999999s)]
*  I was probably eight or nine years old. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5274.419999999999s)]
*  And you look around and I said to my dad once I was like maybe 10 or 11. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5275.58s)]
*  And this is a weird thing to say to a 10 or 11 year old. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5279.9s)]
*  I was like, who are these people? [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5281.66s)]
*  My dad goes, these people run the world. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5282.78s)]
*  I was just very fascinated by all these like [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5284.46s)]
*  people that were so different because in Long Island, where I came from, [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5287.5s)]
*  everyone was loud and and and, you know, fighting all the time. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5290.46s)]
*  And, you know, my best friend, Josh, who lived two houses down from me, [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5294.82s)]
*  his mother, Eileen, would scream at his father in the in the front yard. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5299.0199999999995s)]
*  And he was like a conductor for the railroad. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5302.62s)]
*  And she would just go, why didn't you? [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5304.9s)]
*  And then you would go to Manhattan. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5306.98s)]
*  And a lot of these restaurants that my uncle had, you'd see these kind of quiet [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5309.099999999999s)]
*  people and they were all very well dressed and they were in suits. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5312.14s)]
*  You know, in Manhattan, they live in these stone townhouses like, you know, Epstein did. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5316.14s)]
*  They live in these little mini stone townhouses. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5319.9800000000005s)]
*  And I was just fascinated. I was like, it's very interesting. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5323.1s)]
*  These these people are interesting. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5325.54s)]
*  What are they up to type of thing? [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5327.14s)]
*  And then you start start reading about them. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5329.34s)]
*  And, you know, it is just super interesting [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5331.22s)]
*  because they're a very big reason why society looks the way it does. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5334.34s)]
*  One hundred percent. You know, and that to me is an interesting thing. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5337.54s)]
*  It's like, why are certain people in certain positions? [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5340.54s)]
*  What role do the politicians play? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5345.94s)]
*  And what role do these really quiet rich people play? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5348.06s)]
*  Yeah, that are kind of waspy and could be Jewish, could be anything. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5350.58s)]
*  They're just kind of like, you know, they're quiet. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5354.06s)]
*  They don't really want you to know too much about them. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5355.86s)]
*  They really value their privacy. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5357.66s)]
*  So it's funny with the kids doing stand up comedy to me. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5359.38s)]
*  And even these rich people that go on these reality shows, [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5361.94s)]
*  it's interesting that it used to be sacrilegious. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5364.66s)]
*  The idea that you would show people that how much money you had [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5368.1s)]
*  or that you would talk about yourself. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5371.26s)]
*  And a lot of that started to change. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5373.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, like a lot of these rich people just want to be famous. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5375.38s)]
*  Almost feels like it's the last thing left. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5377.3s)]
*  Well, it's attention young kids today when they ask them, [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5379.5s)]
*  what do you want to be? [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5382.660000000001s)]
*  A giant percentage of them say famous. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5384.26s)]
*  They want to be an influencer. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5386.620000000001s)]
*  They want to be a tick tocker, a YouTuber. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5388.38s)]
*  They want they want to be famous because why would you want a job [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5390.700000000001s)]
*  like your parents have when you could just open sneakers? [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5394.38s)]
*  Yeah. Open. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5397.46s)]
*  So I'm going to do an unboxing show. That's a good point. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5398.38s)]
*  Yeah. Like, why would you want a regular job? [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5400.66s)]
*  Yeah. Regular jobs are soul sucking, especially work. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5403.1s)]
*  Look, it's one thing if you have a career. Sure. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5406.18s)]
*  One thing you start your own business is something exciting. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5408.34s)]
*  There's another thing to be working for somebody working for somebody [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5411.02s)]
*  is horrible for the most part. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5413.38s)]
*  It is. But I think people can derive enjoyment from things outside of their jobs. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5414.740000000001s)]
*  Sure. But that leaves you one third of your day that's been eaten up. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5418.22s)]
*  You have one third of your day for sleep, one third of your day [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5422.1s)]
*  that's been eaten up by this bullshit job. Yeah. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5424.34s)]
*  And then the remaining hours between commutes and whatever the fuck you eat. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5426.54s)]
*  Yeah. All has to be wrapped up in it is it is. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5430.54s)]
*  I get it. I totally get it. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5433.74s)]
*  If you're a young kid, you go on YouTube, you go, I want to be David Dobrik. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5435.22s)]
*  I don't want to be David Dobrik. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5438.18s)]
*  He's like a big guy on YouTube. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5440.58s)]
*  OK, he does. I don't know. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5441.86s)]
*  He's like a Mr. Beast type. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5443.9s)]
*  He's not as big. Mr. Beast is like a planet. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5445.9s)]
*  Yeah. But Dobrik's big, you know, or whoever. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5448.1s)]
*  Like they look at these young and they entertain like younger people. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5451.98s)]
*  He does fun videos about like, hey, whatever. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5455.1s)]
*  I don't know. You know, it's always the same. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5457.34s)]
*  It's like, what if I fill the pool with M&M's? [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5459.620000000001s)]
*  Whatever. You know, it's like that type of thing. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5462.14s)]
*  You know, it's not like the Ukraine deep dive or whatever. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5463.9400000000005s)]
*  It's it's a fun, like goofy thing. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5466.900000000001s)]
*  And kids look at that and go, well, that guy's making a lot of money. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5469.26s)]
*  He has a great car. He's got a hot girlfriend. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5471.740000000001s)]
*  He lives in a big mansion. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5474.02s)]
*  I want to be that guy. Of course. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5475.42s)]
*  But I think they missed the idea that that guy works really, really hard. Right. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5476.860000000001s)]
*  Like, that's the thing that I think people don't understand [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5481.58s)]
*  about these social media people. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5483.98s)]
*  They do have a crazy [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5486.379999999999s)]
*  constitution in terms of like how much they post, how hard they're worth. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5490.0599999999995s)]
*  Now, you might say, OK, this stuff they do is ridiculous or silly or not valuable. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5495.339999999999s)]
*  And I might agree on on a lot of those things, [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5499.339999999999s)]
*  but they are always putting it out. Yeah, they're showing up. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5502.139999999999s)]
*  They're always showing up. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5505.62s)]
*  Yeah. If you want to compete in any market, anything, no matter what you do, [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5506.62s)]
*  there's a certain amount of work you have to put in the idea that it's easy. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5510.0199999999995s)]
*  There's got to be some reason why most of them don't rise to the top. Right. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5514.5s)]
*  What is it? [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5519.299999999999s)]
*  How do you feel that? Can you teach people to work hard? [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5520.099999999999s)]
*  I'm sure you can. What do you think? [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5522.9s)]
*  Because I've seen so many people that are super talented, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5525.259999999999s)]
*  but they for whatever reason, they're not that muscle of working hard [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5530.099999999999s)]
*  or the dedication to it. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5535.139999999999s)]
*  I think generally it has to be established early. Yeah. In your life. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5536.94s)]
*  And if you don't establish that early in your life, it's not. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5541.0199999999995s)]
*  A thing that you gravitate towards, not right. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5544.099999999999s)]
*  You don't recognize that. Oh, hard work equals results. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5546.58s)]
*  You know, if you get lucky, you do sports because sports [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5550.099999999999s)]
*  make you physically uncomfortable. They test your will. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5553.219999999999s)]
*  You know, if you're a marathon runner and you got to get up every day [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5556.459999999999s)]
*  and do those fucking miles like that will test your will. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5559.54s)]
*  You know, if you're doing track and field or football [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5562.419999999999s)]
*  or anything you're doing where it's a lot of work like and then you realize [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5565.339999999999s)]
*  I've gotten better because of all this work. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5568.98s)]
*  And if I work harder, maybe I could be the starting quarterback. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5570.86s)]
*  Yeah, I work harder, maybe. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5574.139999999999s)]
*  And that's that's a real factor for young kids, I think. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5575.339999999999s)]
*  Getting them into any sort of difficult physical endeavor, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5579.94s)]
*  whatever it is, competitive physical endeavors make you. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5584.139999999999s)]
*  That's why I said that show Dance Moms was good. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5588.099999999999s)]
*  That fat woman who screamed at those kids and demanded greatness [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5590.379999999999s)]
*  and would make them cry. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5593.94s)]
*  I thought that was good. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5595.74s)]
*  You never saw a dance. It's a great show. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5597.219999999999s)]
*  This woman, Abby Miller, she screamed at these young kids. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5599.0199999999995s)]
*  And one of them became Jojo Siwa. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5602.860000000001s)]
*  So it's not like there was any damage done. And, [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5604.66s)]
*  you know, I think it's good. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5608.58s)]
*  I like to see greatness demanded of children. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5609.66s)]
*  This lady, what are you looking at her? [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5612.14s)]
*  Watch this woman here. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5613.900000000001s)]
*  You will jump higher. You will turn faster. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5617.02s)]
*  That's right. You will also act. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5619.06s)]
*  You will sing. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5621.9800000000005s)]
*  You're not just preparing for a dance competition every weekend. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5623.66s)]
*  We're preparing for you to become stars in Los Angeles. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5626.34s)]
*  How does that bitch know how to be a star in Los Angeles? [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5632.34s)]
*  Look at her. She can't get a seat at Roscoe's. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5634.38s)]
*  By the way, I guarantee you she can get a seat at Roscoe's. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5637.74s)]
*  That's the one place she can get. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5641.58s)]
*  If you saw her, you wouldn't sit her in Roscoe's. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5643.42s)]
*  The first thing I would kick someone out for her in Roscoe's. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5647.62s)]
*  But yeah, but but yeah, it is interesting that a lot of these kids now, [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5650.78s)]
*  they just look at, you know, the followers and sure. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5654.1s)]
*  How do you feel about your apparent? [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5658.7s)]
*  Do you do you do you when the Jonathan Haidt book comes out [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5660.42s)]
*  and he goes, we should get rid of phones for kids until they're 16. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5663.22s)]
*  Does that make sense or not really? [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5666.42s)]
*  No, because alienate your kids. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5668.5s)]
*  It's a new world that they have to learn how to navigate. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5670.66s)]
*  And if they don't learn how to navigate until they're 18, [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5673.06s)]
*  they're at a huge disadvantage. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5675.78s)]
*  They got to understand that it's just people talking. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5677.14s)]
*  But there's a lot of pressure, like for young girls. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5680.5s)]
*  It's the worst time because they're comparing themselves to all these other girls. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5683.3s)]
*  You're seeing a rise in eating disorders, self harm, suicide, [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5686.42s)]
*  suicide ideation, and it's a lot of it is like they get depressed [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5690.62s)]
*  comparing their life to other people. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5694.38s)]
*  And when you're young and you don't understand, you're 13, [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5696.38s)]
*  you don't get how your mind works and you're just sad every time you open up [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5698.74s)]
*  your Instagram app and you don't look anything like these ladies [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5702.14s)]
*  who don't look anything like that either. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5705.34s)]
*  Right. Which is really crazy. Right. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5706.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, and your head is filled with all of this. Yeah. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5709.02s)]
*  Unhealthy thoughts. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5712.06s)]
*  I kind of got off social media for the most part real recently. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5715.02s)]
*  Over the last few days, I'm barely on it. Right. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5718.9800000000005s)]
*  And I feel better. Right. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5721.26s)]
*  I feel way more normal. Right. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5723.1s)]
*  Way more like not constantly like checking to see what's going on, [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5725.620000000001s)]
*  what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's happening in the world. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5728.820000000001s)]
*  Instead, just like I'll find the bad things. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5731.660000000001s)]
*  They'll come to me for sure. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5735.3s)]
*  You'll they'll figure it out. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5736.820000000001s)]
*  So I check in the morning like, oh, make sure there's no war going on. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5737.9400000000005s)]
*  And then I go about my day the whole day. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5741.14s)]
*  And then maybe I check again in the afternoon real quick. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5742.94s)]
*  I'm not spending like massive amounts of time anymore. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5745.66s)]

*  And I'm like, OK, people that give up their phones always talk about that. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5750.0199999999995s)]

*  in the world all the time and wondering who's saying this and why they're doing that. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5760.78s)]
*  And how's the what's the new thing? What's this? What's that? [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5764.219999999999s)]
*  It is good to detach. It is interesting. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5767.86s)]
*  Imagine if you just didn't even engage, like didn't really look [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5769.62s)]
*  weren't in it at all. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5773.26s)]
*  Probably fascinating. It's way better for you. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5774.94s)]
*  So you think it would be miserable to just be happy somewhere? [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=5778.0199999999995s)]

*  Yeah. Reality is splintering. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6108.46s)]
*  And then A.I. is about to take over our lives and we're openly cheering it. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6109.78s)]
*  Right. And the world will never be the same again. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6114.62s)]
*  Once it does. And we're we're welcoming it. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6116.62s)]
*  I think comedians seem to be somewhat in the in the safer group of people. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6119.3s)]
*  In what way? Oh, as far as our job. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6125.3s)]
*  I think it's like perspective seems like maybe one of the harder things for A.I. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6127.18s)]
*  to grasp. Well, it's also live performance. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6132.26s)]
*  Right. The last human stand. Right. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6136.3s)]
*  You know, where you could go and see something, you go see a guy [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6140.26s)]
*  actually play a guitar. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6143.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's so much different. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6145.42s)]
*  And that that's a real human experience. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6148.26s)]
*  Live sporting events, you know, like real things, things that are real. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6150.5s)]
*  You know, that's that's going to be that's going to be the hardest [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6154.5s)]
*  to be replaced by A.I. Yeah. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6157.58s)]
*  Because, you know, you can replace us on podcasts. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6160.5s)]
*  You essentially could take my perspectives that I've shared over the past [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6163.26s)]
*  2000 plus episodes and run it through a large language model [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6166.86s)]
*  and use A.I. and have me have a podcast with basically anybody. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6171.18s)]
*  It's such a crazy library you have. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6174.82s)]
*  It's like, I wonder what what you do with it. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6176.58s)]
*  It's a good question. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6179.66s)]
*  So interesting. It's a great question. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6180.34s)]
*  China wants to sell it to China. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6182.86s)]
*  What if after Spotify, you go to China? [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6185.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great idea. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6188.3s)]
*  It would be actually a great idea if you just sit down and nothing's [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6190.34s)]
*  changing about the podcast. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6193.139999999999s)]
*  It's still going to be free. It's going to be in Mandarin. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6194.62s)]
*  It's owned by the Chinese government, but it's the same podcast. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6196.58s)]
*  So has been. Don't worry about it. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6199.66s)]
*  The same show has always been. You guys know me. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6201.0199999999995s)]
*  I won't change. Yeah. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6202.86s)]
*  Your first guess is Jack Ma. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6204.219999999999s)]
*  Tell me what happened with Alibaba. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6207.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's crazy. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6210.139999999999s)]
*  It's a place I'd like to go. I've never been in China. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6211.179999999999s)]
*  I'd like to go. Yeah, I would do it that way. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6212.94s)]
*  Oh, my God. It would be someone talking. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6215.0599999999995s)]
*  It's an ad cut. Just an ad. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6217.7s)]
*  It's just kind of the same podcast. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6219.58s)]
*  It's always been. It's now 37 minutes [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6221.7s)]
*  because China's taken out all the stuff. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6224.5s)]
*  They're not long. The beginning of it. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6226.74s)]
*  I'd love to go to China just to access websites and go. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6228.339999999999s)]
*  What can you really say? Right. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6230.54s)]
*  That would be super fascinating to be in China going like, [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6232.58s)]
*  what are you allowed? [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6235.26s)]
*  What is blocked? [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6237.22s)]
*  Do they use VPNs in China successfully? [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6238.34s)]
*  I mean, probably right. They have to. Maybe not. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6240.66s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6243.42s)]
*  North Korea seems to block everything. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6244.62s)]
*  Like certain countries can do a lot. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6246.1s)]
*  Yeah, they have their own Internet, right? [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6247.98s)]
*  Like you can only get on their Internet. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6249.86s)]
*  I'm not sure, but that seems to make sense. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6251.58s)]
*  That's according to people that have been there. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6253.7s)]
*  Yeah, they have their own Internet. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6256.58s)]
*  Like, just can you use a VPN in China [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6258.7s)]
*  to access the Internet of the world? [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6261.98s)]
*  Let's search that. Yeah, that'd be interesting. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6264.26s)]
*  I need to know. Because so many people, [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6266.139999999999s)]
*  I believe, are very limited with what they can access. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6269.0599999999995s)]
*  Many, many, many people in the world are very limited. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6272.9s)]
*  Well, look at the UK. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6275.98s)]
*  They're just arresting people for Facebook posts. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6277.0199999999995s)]
*  That's one of the crazier things in modern life, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6279.5s)]
*  is that people are getting arrested over social media. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6285.78s)]
*  And not really bad stuff. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6288.66s)]
*  They're saying things that someone finds objectionable. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6291.0199999999995s)]
*  We've got abjections immigrants. Yeah, that kind of stuff. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6293.34s)]
*  Yes, some VPNs work in China, but their effectiveness varies [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6295.46s)]
*  due to the country's strict Internet censorship [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6297.98s)]
*  known as the Great Firewall. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6299.82s)]
*  Chinese government actively blocks many VPN services [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6301.54s)]
*  and only a few reliable ones consistently bypass restrictions. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6304.139999999999s)]
*  VPNs like ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Surfshark [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6308.38s)]
*  are often cited as effective, [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6312.18s)]
*  but they require a specific configuration, [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6313.82s)]
*  e.g., obfuscated servers or protocols like OpenVPN [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6316.38s)]
*  to evade detection. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6320.1s)]
*  Performance can be inconsistent with slowdowns [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6321.62s)]
*  or temporary blocks being heightened censorship [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6324.78s)]
*  during heightened censorship periods, [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6328.22s)]
*  such as political events. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6329.74s)]
*  China occasionally cracks down on VPN uses, [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6331.18s)]
*  targeting both the providers and individual users, [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6333.54s)]
*  though enforcement against foreigners is typically lenient, [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6336.46s)]
*  focusing on warnings rather than severe penalties. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6339.9800000000005s)]
*  Using a VPN is technically illegal for accessing block content, [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6343.46s)]
*  but millions, including expats and locals, use them daily. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6347.82s)]
*  Boy, that's a risky move. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6352.18s)]
*  I think they're banning this stuff in the UK [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6354.38s)]
*  because I don't think they want people to persist [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6357.3s)]
*  in this idea that they have any ability [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6367.82s)]
*  to challenge this prevailing narrative [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6376.42s)]
*  that any critique of immigration is an inherently racist thing. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6379.54s)]
*  And I think the people that are sponsoring this, [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6385.259999999999s)]
*  it's kind of an odious thing, [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6387.0599999999995s)]
*  and it's because what they're doing is they're basically [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6389.62s)]
*  immiserating these people. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6393.74s)]
*  They're making the quality of their life much worse. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6395.54s)]
*  They're losing ground, and if they speak up about it, [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6398.38s)]
*  they're called horrible names and arrested. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6402.46s)]
*  So it's crazy, and they don't understand why it's happening. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6408.78s)]
*  They're very confused about why a lot of these countries [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6413.14s)]
*  didn't take any Syrian refugees. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6421.0199999999995s)]
*  But Europe did, and Scandinavia did, the Netherlands did. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6424.0199999999995s)]
*  And they're confused about that, and they're asking questions, [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6429.94s)]
*  and going, why is that the case? [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6433.42s)]
*  And they're confused about why when any disruption happens, [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6435.42s)]
*  and it's clearly the result of bringing in large numbers of people [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6444.7s)]
*  who are not familiar with the laws of the country, [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6450.0199999999995s)]
*  the culture of the country, when anything happens, [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6452.14s)]
*  and they bring it up, they're again called a racist, [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6455.5s)]
*  or an extremist, or they're arrested. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6458.860000000001s)]
*  And then who's doing it? [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6463.22s)]
*  So you have the people clearly that are in the government [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6464.46s)]
*  and these incredibly wealthy business interests [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6468.58s)]
*  that want people to work for a lot less money, [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6470.42s)]
*  and they want to destroy people's social bonds, [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6474.34s)]
*  because I think they really do want people to eventually just accept [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6477.5s)]
*  this kind of totalitarian surveillance state. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6481.66s)]
*  Yes, give up. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6483.98s)]
*  And the way to get them there is by breaking the spirit of these countries, [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6485.18s)]
*  by destroying any social bonds that people have, [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6491.7s)]
*  and destroying any economic power, [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6494.82s)]
*  and destroying their belief in the democratic process. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6497.099999999999s)]
*  And if they can do that, they can break people, [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6499.94s)]
*  they can get them to do anything they want. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6501.66s)]
*  Do you think they're doing this in preparation for AI? [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6503.46s)]
*  I think they're doing it in preparation for not only technological advancements, [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6506.38s)]
*  I think they're doing it in preparation for world wars. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6510.02s)]
*  I think they are doing it in preparation for a lot of things. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6515.860000000001s)]
*  I think they'll conscript a lot of these people into the military. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6518.42s)]
*  I believe that. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6521.540000000001s)]
*  I believe they'll conscript a lot of these people into the military. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6522.620000000001s)]
*  I think they're looking at populations. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6525.860000000001s)]
*  I think they're looking at people not having enough children. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6528.740000000001s)]
*  I think they're saying, who's going to fight these wars? [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6531.26s)]
*  Who's going to do these really shitty jobs? [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6534.42s)]
*  And we're going to go build houses in bunkers and all of this stuff. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6537.0599999999995s)]
*  We're going to fly private, [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6541.9s)]
*  and we're going to have our kids go to completely separate schools, [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6543.62s)]
*  and we're going to have our own water aquifiers and have a compound. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6546.26s)]
*  But why do you need all these low wage people in your country [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6550.22s)]
*  that are illegal and don't have any power? [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6553.26s)]
*  As anyone asked that question, it seems very obvious. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6555.42s)]
*  They're going to conscript a lot of them into the military, [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6558.82s)]
*  and a lot of them are going to do shitty, horrible jobs, [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6561.14s)]
*  and they're going to use them as cannon fodder [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6563.34s)]
*  in wars that enrich lots of people. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6565.46s)]
*  That would be my guess. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6567.7s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6571.38s)]
*  Yeah, I might be wrong, but. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6575.46s)]
*  And if A.I. does become the governing factor of the world, [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6578.06s)]
*  which it probably will, it doesn't really make sense [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6584.18s)]
*  that you let humans with all the corruption and emotions [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6587.14s)]
*  govern things when you can let super intelligence. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6590.14s)]
*  Yeah, but who's making that intelligence? [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6593.34s)]
*  That becomes the problem. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6595.14s)]
*  But once you've already gotten people locked into compliance, [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6596.54s)]
*  and you've already got people where they're terrified [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6600.22s)]
*  to protest against anything, immigration, whatever it is, [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6602.46s)]
*  then you can get away with a lot more. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6606.02s)]
*  There was a decision made because the populist Democrats [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6609.58s)]
*  during the 90s, which was like Bill Clinton, [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6614.54s)]
*  you know, critical of immigration. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6618.1s)]
*  Barack Obama, critical of immigration, [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6619.780000000001s)]
*  deported a lot of people. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6621.5s)]
*  Hillary Clinton. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6622.58s)]
*  Hillary Clinton. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6623.34s)]
*  What started to happen, though, is there was a decision made [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6624.42s)]
*  that the world was going to kind of be a borderless place [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6627.820000000001s)]
*  where countries were interchangeable [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6632.46s)]
*  and that the nation states mattered a lot less [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6636.26s)]
*  than the financial architecture of global capital [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6641.3s)]
*  and where it could go. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6646.34s)]
*  And you need a world government. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6647.38s)]
*  And you need a government that is a world government [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6648.5s)]
*  or the closest world order. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6650.9400000000005s)]
*  The closest thing you can get to it, [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6652.9s)]
*  which is having an EU, right? [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6654.339999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6656.82s)]
*  And then having a government between the UK and the US [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6657.219999999999s)]
*  that's pretty on the same page about everything. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6661.299999999999s)]
*  And then you have Israel in the Middle East. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6663.82s)]
*  And then you have, you know, all of these disparate areas [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6665.58s)]
*  that we kind of control through economic means [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6669.82s)]
*  or military means and stuff like that. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6672.0199999999995s)]
*  And then you have outliers. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6673.78s)]
*  You have China, Iran, Russia, you know, whatever. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6674.82s)]
*  People that haven't gotten the memo for whatever reason. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6678.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't want to live in any of those places. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6680.219999999999s)]
*  That's the argument. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6682.0199999999995s)]
*  They'll go, well, do you want to live in it? [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6682.7s)]
*  Shut up. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6684.099999999999s)]
*  That's what are we idiots? [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6684.5s)]
*  I don't want to live in any of those places, [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6686.42s)]
*  but they're not on. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6687.78s)]
*  They didn't get the memo. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6689.22s)]
*  So and then in all of these countries, by the way, [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6690.94s)]
*  in Europe, in America, not so much Israel. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6693.179999999999s)]
*  They don't love the immigration, as we can see. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6695.7s)]
*  They're kind of big on the borders. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6698.46s)]
*  Israel, they like the borders. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6700.26s)]
*  But in America and Europe and Scandinavia [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6702.62s)]
*  and all these countries, [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6704.46s)]
*  the populations were just told to accept massively high levels [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6705.66s)]
*  of immigration over a very short period of time. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6709.86s)]
*  That's odd. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6713.7s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6715.74s)]
*  And if you point that out, [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6717.78s)]
*  you're called a racist and extremist. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6719.46s)]
*  And that's a very strange thing. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6721.66s)]
*  What are you doing with all these people? [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6723.219999999999s)]
*  The Biden administration brought in 10 million people [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6725.74s)]
*  over four years. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6728.54s)]
*  What are they here for? [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6729.7s)]
*  There's not enough jobs for the people that are here. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6731.54s)]
*  We have vast chasms of wealth and equality. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6733.94s)]
*  We have AI coming. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6736.099999999999s)]
*  We have automation coming. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6737.66s)]
*  Why would you bring in all of these people? [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6739.0199999999995s)]
*  What are you trying to do? [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6740.74s)]
*  What do you think they're trying to do? [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6742.339999999999s)]
*  I think that exactly what I said. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6743.379999999999s)]
*  I think they need bodies. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6744.94s)]
*  I think they need cannon fodder. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6747.419999999999s)]
*  I think they need to break the idea [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6748.9s)]
*  of any social bonds that exist between people. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6752.78s)]
*  You know, listen. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6755.86s)]
*  And they need a little chaos. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6756.7s)]
*  They need a little chaos. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6757.86s)]
*  I think you bring- Pass more laws, more crime. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6758.82s)]
*  Yeah, you bring in people, more surveillance, [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6760.219999999999s)]
*  more dependence on the government. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6762.54s)]
*  You get people out of the idea. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6764.339999999999s)]
*  You know, they got people out of the idea years ago [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6766.219999999999s)]
*  that you could barely, you can't really, [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6767.94s)]
*  it's very hard to have your own business now. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6769.419999999999s)]
*  They've pretty much extinguished that in people's heads, [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6771.419999999999s)]
*  even though there are people that still do it. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6774.62s)]
*  Now I think they're gonna start to extinguish the idea [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6776.82s)]
*  that you can have a home, that you can own property, [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6778.86s)]
*  that you could drive a car, [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6782.099999999999s)]
*  that you can do all of these things. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6783.94s)]
*  That you're gonna extinguish that idea [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6785.62s)]
*  and they're gonna do that because why not control everybody? [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6787.58s)]
*  It'd be all waymos. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6792.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6793.66s)]
*  Why not control everybody? [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6795.78s)]
*  Why would you let everybody just go run rampant [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6797.06s)]
*  and fuck up your business? [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6799.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so they're basically like, [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6800.780000000001s)]
*  we gotta pacify these people. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6802.620000000001s)]
*  The conflicts seem inevitable [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6804.860000000001s)]
*  and we're gonna have to fight these wars. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6807.700000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6809.900000000001s)]
*  The good news is a lot of the people who are doing this, [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6813.46s)]
*  their children are now doing stand-up combat. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6816.540000000001s)]
*  So if they're unable- Are any of them any good? [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6818.34s)]
*  If they're, I think some of them, I'm sure. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6822.18s)]
*  Have you seen any of them that are any good? [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6825.42s)]
*  I haven't seen a ton. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6827.1s)]
*  It's one of those things that you hear now more than ever. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6828.66s)]
*  When you're talking to a young comic [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6832.18s)]
*  and they go on, I'm hanging out with this person. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6833.54s)]
*  I go, yeah, and they go, and their dad owns this. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6835.26s)]
*  You go, really? [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6837.42s)]
*  Just a curious thing. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6839.14s)]
*  Obviously, anyone in the world should be able [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6840.82s)]
*  to do comedy as much as they want. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6842.26s)]
*  But it's funny to me as somebody [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6843.9400000000005s)]
*  who just looked at these configurations of power and wealth, [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6845.5s)]
*  it's kind of interesting [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6848.02s)]
*  that a lot of these kids are doing that. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6849.18s)]
*  It's just fun. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6850.5s)]
*  Have you ever met anybody [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6851.34s)]
*  that came from a really wealthy background [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6852.26s)]
*  that was good at stand-up? [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6854.02s)]
*  No. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6856.06s)]
*  Yes, yes, there are some of them, for sure. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6856.900000000001s)]
*  You've met them? [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6859.18s)]
*  I've not met them. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6860.1s)]
*  They probably don't like me. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6861.18s)]
*  They're like unicorns. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6862.02s)]
*  Yeah, they're around. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6862.860000000001s)]
*  And yes, yes, very wealthy. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6864.42s)]
*  But I'm talking about weird, [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6866.1s)]
*  kind of interesting levels of wealth and power. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6868.62s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6872.54s)]
*  That's super interesting to me. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6874.06s)]
*  But so the good news is if they can't get this done soon, [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6877.46s)]
*  their kids won't because their kids [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6879.58s)]
*  will be at fucking side splitters in Tampa. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6880.740000000001s)]
*  Or they'll be podcasting. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6882.66s)]
*  Or they'll be podcasting, yeah. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6883.82s)]
*  Yeah, they'll all get together, become influencers. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6884.98s)]
*  Isn't it funny how much they now focus really on podcasters, [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6886.86s)]
*  but they ignore all the things, [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6890.62s)]
*  all the people that we're talking about. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6892.62s)]
*  None of that, they don't report on any of those people. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6894.78s)]
*  No. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6897.62s)]
*  There's 10 million articles about- [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6898.46s)]
*  Theo Von having Ken and so on on their show. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6899.94s)]
*  Right, but there's no articles about like, [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6901.54s)]
*  again, the people that seem to be running, [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6905.219999999999s)]
*  like owning all of our resources. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6908.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6910.259999999999s)]
*  You'd think someone would write about [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6911.099999999999s)]
*  the people that own a lot of the resources [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6913.14s)]
*  on the planet we live. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6916.54s)]
*  Listen, that's complicated. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6918.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6919.54s)]
*  Did you see that crazy thing [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6920.38s)]
*  that the government talked about yesterday? [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6921.22s)]
*  They had a press conference where they said [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6922.22s)]
*  that we can manipulate time and space. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6923.860000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6926.18s)]
*  Did you see that, Jamie? [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6927.22s)]
*  I didn't see that. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6928.06s)]
*  It's written really weird. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6929.02s)]
*  Weird, right? [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6930.34s)]
*  Really weird. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6931.46s)]
*  That got lost in the shuffle. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6932.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6934.14s)]
*  The manipulation of time and space. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6935.18s)]
*  See if you can find it, Jamie, [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6937.22s)]
*  because it's really kooky. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6938.54s)]
*  It's really kooky. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6940.18s)]
*  I don't know what he was saying. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6943.1s)]
*  Play it. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6950.18s)]
*  Play it so we can hear him say it. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6951.02s)]
*  I don't think anybody said it. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6952.14s)]
*  It was written on a website. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6953.06s)]
*  But didn't he say it in that speech? [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6954.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6956.1s)]

*  No. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6962.9800000000005s)]

*  There's certainly a lot going on. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6974.5s)]
*  It's a big week. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6976.139999999999s)]
*  Regulatory regime in the 1970s [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6980.42s)]
*  became an ever tightening ratchet. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6982.94s)]
*  First hampering America's ability [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6985.38s)]
*  to become a net energy exporter [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6986.82s)]
*  and then making it harder and harder to build. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6988.86s)]
*  We seem to have lost focus and vision. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6992.94s)]
*  Kill that ad. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6995.259999999999s)]
*  To have lowered our sights and let systems [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6996.099999999999s)]
*  and structures and bureaucracies muddle us along. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=6997.5s)]
*  But we are capable of so much more. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7001.14s)]
*  Our technologies permit us to manipulate time and space. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7004.14s)]

*  Does that even make sense? [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7014.820000000001s)]
*  I think manipulate time and space, [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7015.66s)]

*  No, I think he's saying that you're able to do things- [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7019.02s)]
*  Instantaneously. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7022.42s)]
*  Instantaneously. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7023.26s)]
*  Yeah, instantly. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7024.1s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think he, [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7025.34s)]
*  I think people have read into that too much. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7026.18s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think he's time machines. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7027.74s)]
*  Do you believe that time machines [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7030.26s)]
*  had ever at any point worked? [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7031.26s)]
*  No. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7034.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7034.98s)]
*  No, I do not. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7035.8s)]
*  I do not think that anyone is currently [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7036.639999999999s)]
*  in possession of a time machine, [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7037.66s)]
*  but I do think they're in possession [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7038.76s)]
*  of some sort of a gravity drive. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7040.2s)]
*  Now what is a gravity drive? [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7041.94s)]
*  I think during the 1940s they started working on this stuff. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7043.22s)]
*  During the 1950s there was papers written about it [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7046.54s)]
*  that they were working on gravity propulsion systems. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7049.3s)]
*  They were working on something that harnesses, [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7051.74s)]
*  what do they call it? [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7055.099999999999s)]
*  Background energy. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7055.92s)]
*  I forget what are they, [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7056.86s)]
*  the idea is, and I actually had a conversation [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7057.82s)]
*  with Hal Putoff about this. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7059.94s)]
*  He was a legitimate scientist who worked for NASA [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7061.26s)]
*  with the UFO program. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7063.86s)]
*  And he believes that they're capable [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7066.0199999999995s)]
*  of developing some sort of a warp drive. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7069.5s)]
*  And there was something written about this, [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7071.94s)]
*  there was some breakthrough about warp drives recently, [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7073.66s)]
*  right, we talked about this. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7076.099999999999s)]
*  I think they have something. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7077.98s)]
*  I think they have something, [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7079.42s)]
*  I think that's what a lot of these people are seeing [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7080.36s)]
*  when they're seeing these transmedium crafts [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7081.88s)]
*  that are going through the air at high rates of speed, [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7085.16s)]
*  going into the water, not losing any speed, [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7087.759999999999s)]
*  coming out of the water, not making any splashes. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7089.0s)]
*  I think it creates a gravity distortion [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7091.4s)]
*  around whatever these things are [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7094.66s)]
*  that allows it to move in a way that's very different [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7096.92s)]
*  than any other propulsion system [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7100.12s)]
*  that we are currently aware of. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7102.0s)]
*  And I think the government has been probably secretly [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7104.96s)]
*  working on this stuff for decades. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7107.32s)]
*  That's what I think. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7109.84s)]
*  I could 100% be wrong. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7111.0s)]
*  But that's the DARPA angle [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7112.5599999999995s)]
*  of having a really, really underground weapon system, [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7114.48s)]
*  futuristic technologies. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7123.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and space travel system. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7125.759999999999s)]
*  And space travel system. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7127.2s)]
*  And ideally they would be able to use this [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7128.04s)]
*  to mine asteroids, have something instantaneously [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7131.0s)]
*  port to an asteroid, scoop up rare earth minerals [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7135.4s)]
*  and expensive things that they need on earth, [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7138.919999999999s)]
*  shoot it back to earth. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7141.639999999999s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7142.759999999999s)]
*  So it's interesting. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7144.2s)]
*  So the people that work in that type of arena [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7145.04s)]
*  are just so many layers above top secret, [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7148.48s)]
*  levels above top secret. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7151.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7152.28s)]
*  They barely exist. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7153.12s)]
*  This guy was telling me that in 2015, [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7154.0s)]
*  they had landed something on an asteroid, [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7156.08s)]
*  extracted something from that asteroid, [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7157.96s)]
*  and then have that thing leave the asteroid [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7159.76s)]
*  and return to earth, and then pinpointed the location [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7161.88s)]
*  where it was going to crash land, or land rather, [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7164.639999999999s)]
*  within one mile. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7167.4s)]
*  And that somehow or another, [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7168.88s)]
*  they figured this out a decade ago. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7170.4s)]
*  And that we don't know about it, [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7172.8s)]
*  but there's footage of this stuff, [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7174.68s)]
*  and that they've been able to achieve this. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7177.28s)]
*  And that there's what you hear, [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7179.96s)]
*  and what you see on television, [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7182.68s)]
*  and what they're actually capable of. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7184.08s)]
*  And because of national security interests, [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7185.52s)]
*  because, fill in the blank, [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7187.76s)]
*  misallocation of funds in order to acquire this technology, [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7189.92s)]
*  which is 100% what they're all talking about. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7193.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7195.6s)]
*  Jamie and I, what is that documentary we saw? [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7196.84s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7200.84s)]
*  It's not released yet, [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7203.8s)]
*  because it was a South by Southwest thing. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7205.2s)]
*  We saw South by Southwest, [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7206.84s)]
*  this documentary that's all about that subject. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7208.8s)]
*  And it's all about how there's a lot of issues, [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7211.08s)]
*  because these people have all misappropriated funds, [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7213.56s)]
*  so they've lied to Congress. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7216.6s)]
*  So, and then on top of that, [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7217.92s)]
*  if you do have this sort of a program, [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7220.52s)]
*  and it is based on back engineering UFOs, [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7222.76s)]
*  that have crashed, though, who gets that? [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7226.12s)]
*  Well, it's probably a weapons manufacturing company. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7228.360000000001s)]
*  So if it's a weapons manufacturing company, [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7230.84s)]
*  which company gets access to that? [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7233.28s)]
*  And the other ones could probably sue you. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7235.68s)]
*  Because why did not, [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7237.52s)]
*  that's a huge competitive advantage [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7238.400000000001s)]
*  to have fucking alien technology that you can back into. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7240.52s)]
*  Do these things not land in China? [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7243.72s)]
*  Age of Disclosure is the unprecedented [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7245.56s)]
*  and revelatory documentary featuring 34 senior members [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7248.8s)]
*  of the US government, military, and intelligence community [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7252.32s)]
*  reveals that an 80 year old cover up [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7254.92s)]
*  the existence of non-human intelligent life, [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7256.56s)]
*  and a secret war amongst major nations [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7258.76s)]
*  to reverse engineer technology of non-human origin. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7260.88s)]
*  See, I don't even know if that part is true. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7264.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7267.360000000001s)]
*  Who is the most credible person [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7268.2s)]
*  that you've had on the show over the years, [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7269.72s)]
*  who has talked the most convincingly? [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7273.08s)]
*  Was it Babelzar about? [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7276.08s)]
*  Babelzar is one of them, but he's, [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7278.4800000000005s)]
*  technically speaking, you could kind of discredit [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7281.4400000000005s)]
*  a lot of the stuff that he said. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7283.72s)]
*  Jacques Vallee is probably the most reasonable, [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7285.64s)]
*  and he's the guy that they patterned that French scientist [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7287.8s)]
*  in Close Encounters of the Third Con on. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7290.96s)]
*  He's been studying this since the 60s. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7292.72s)]
*  True believer. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7295.16s)]
*  Yeah, he believes. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7296.12s)]
*  He thinks most of it's bullshit though. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7297.16s)]
*  He thinks most of it is people misunderstanding [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7299.92s)]
*  what they're looking at, people seeing [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7302.6s)]
*  some sort of a test vehicle. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7304.400000000001s)]
*  Does he have any theory on where these crafts [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7306.96s)]
*  are coming from, or is that just completely [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7311.360000000001s)]
*  beyond the scope of what he? [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7313.6s)]
*  They do theorize. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7314.96s)]
*  They theorize that these things have always been here, [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7316.16s)]
*  and that they're probably interdimensional travelers, [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7318.72s)]
*  that it's not as simple as they're coming [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7322.08s)]
*  from another planet. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7323.48s)]
*  They might be coming from a whole nother reality, [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7325.08s)]
*  and then they might have shaped our reality, [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7327.12s)]
*  that this might be a farm. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7329.28s)]
*  This might be a giant ant farm. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7331.88s)]
*  Really? [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7334.08s)]
*  This might be also how intelligent life gets [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7334.92s)]
*  sort of seeded throughout the universe, [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7338.28s)]
*  and this would also explain why we're so different [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7340.88s)]
*  from every other animal on this planet. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7342.92s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7344.84s)]
*  It's not like there's a competition. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7346.4400000000005s)]
*  We're eons ahead, and yet we carry the same, [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7348.52s)]
*  we didn't evolve socially the way we evolve [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7353.56s)]
*  technologically, we still have tribal notions, [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7356.16s)]
*  and we're still territorial. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7361.52s)]
*  We still act like animals. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7362.84s)]
*  So what always weirded me out or interested me [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7364.84s)]
*  is like the aliens, if you believe any of these things, [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7368.16s)]
*  they're testing us all the time. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7374.04s)]
*  Is that because they're curious? [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7378.5199999999995s)]
*  Is that because they don't know? [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7380.4s)]
*  Well, they probably just gotta keep track, [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7383.16s)]
*  see what's going on with people. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7384.72s)]
*  I mean, you do that if you're collecting samples [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7386.36s)]
*  of bugs in other countries. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7388.84s)]
*  They go there and they do what we would do. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7390.84s)]
*  I mean, if you're from another planet [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7394.24s)]
*  and you wanna visit humans, [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7396.92s)]
*  we talked about this yesterday, [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7398.76s)]
*  if you could find a planet where cave people were, [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7399.88s)]
*  wouldn't you go? [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7401.88s)]
*  They're just starting to figure out [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7403.6s)]
*  how to make stone spear tips. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7404.56s)]
*  Of course people would go. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7406.76s)]
*  It is interesting thinking about the planet as a farm. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7407.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7410.16s)]
*  That's one of the things that Bob Lazar said. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7411.4400000000005s)]
*  There was a big folder that he found [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7412.96s)]
*  when he was working Area 51, Site 4, [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7414.96s)]
*  where supposedly they were back engineering that thing. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7419.0s)]
*  He said they had a large folder that was just on religion. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7421.0s)]
*  And he said, essentially they viewed us as containers, [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7424.76s)]
*  that human beings were containers, [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7429.16s)]
*  and that religion and all these things [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7430.56s)]
*  that were created in order to protect the container. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7433.360000000001s)]
*  And that the way to keep people from doing things [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7435.68s)]
*  that are ethical, unethical, and immoral, and horrendous [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7438.64s)]
*  is to try to instill as much religious, [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7442.120000000001s)]
*  ethical structure as possible. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7445.0s)]
*  And try to minimize the damage. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7446.88s)]
*  And a container, what are we carrying that's important? [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7447.72s)]
*  Is it DNA? [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7450.4400000000005s)]
*  Is it the cell? [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7452.280000000001s)]
*  Well, you could say the soul, right? [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7454.72s)]
*  You could say a container of souls. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7456.6s)]
*  But if you wanted to be more cynical, [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7458.120000000001s)]
*  you would say, well, what creates artificial life? [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7459.6s)]
*  A human's curiosity and innovation, [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7463.56s)]
*  the lust for innovation, and also materialism. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7465.52s)]
*  Because if you're keeping up with the Joneses, [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7469.200000000001s)]
*  you want newer and better stuff all the time, [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7471.280000000001s)]
*  so that fuels economic growth, [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7474.04s)]
*  that fuels technological growth, [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7476.56s)]
*  because you want the newest stuff. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7478.52s)]
*  Like these TVs, they don't need to make [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7480.400000000001s)]
*  a better TV than that. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7481.76s)]
*  It looks great. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7482.64s)]

*  Why are they making better TVs every year? [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7485.56s)]
*  Well, because we demand them. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7487.200000000001s)]
*  I want the better one. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7488.48s)]

*  There's no reason to get a new phone anymore. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7495.0s)]
*  They all do the same thing. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7496.719999999999s)]
*  I have an iPhone 11. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7498.36s)]

*  just to see what it's like to use an iPhone 11, [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7503.639999999999s)]

*  I notice nothing different. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7507.04s)]
*  Zero, especially when it's on WiFi. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7508.5599999999995s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7510.08s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7510.919999999999s)]
*  YouTube looks the same on it. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7511.759999999999s)]
*  Everything's the same on it. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7512.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't get as bright as the new ones. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7513.839999999999s)]
*  That's it. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7515.5599999999995s)]
*  The new ones have more nits. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7516.599999999999s)]
*  Did Jacques Valle or any of these people ever speculate [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7518.92s)]
*  about is there an end game? [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7521.599999999999s)]
*  If a planet's a farm, is there an end game? [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7524.8s)]
*  Eventually, for example, if we're running experiments [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7527.679999999999s)]
*  on anything, eventually we go, okay, we got it. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7531.28s)]
*  We either figured it out or we end the experiment [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7535.08s)]
*  or COVID leaks. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7538.48s)]
*  But at a certain point, [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7540.2s)]
*  has there been any theorizing as to like [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7544.88s)]
*  what the end game is or is it just a curiosity for them? [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7547.36s)]
*  I think the end game is artificial intelligence [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7550.16s)]
*  because that's what we're really making. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7552.5599999999995s)]
*  The one big thing that's gonna change the world [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7554.32s)]
*  way more than any other technology [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7557.4s)]
*  is artificial intelligence, [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7559.5199999999995s)]
*  especially when it's attached to quantum computing. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7561.4s)]
*  So if you have human beings that are constantly searching, [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7563.799999999999s)]
*  constantly traveling, looking to their roamers, [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7569.34s)]
*  they want new resources, new things, [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7572.639999999999s)]
*  they want new innovation, [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7574.84s)]
*  and all these new innovations have allowed them [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7576.44s)]
*  to succeed over their rivals. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7578.2s)]
*  And then they continue this trend technologically [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7580.2s)]
*  and then they acquire great wealth and power [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7583.5199999999995s)]
*  and all these things. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7585.92s)]
*  Well, what are they doing? [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7586.759999999999s)]
*  They're making better technology. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7588.24s)]
*  Well, ultimately, what does that mean? [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7590.2s)]
*  Ultimately means they make a better life for them. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7592.16s)]
*  And maybe that's what we do. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7594.92s)]
*  Maybe we're just making a cocoon. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7596.0s)]
*  We're just here trying to make the best version of AI. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7597.4s)]
*  Right, and that's probably what the whole universe [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7601.5199999999995s)]
*  is filled with. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7603.719999999999s)]
*  All biological life eventually probably gets to a point [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7604.64s)]
*  where if it's intelligent enough, [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7608.240000000001s)]
*  it starts making synthetic life. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7609.56s)]
*  And then once you have synthetic life, [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7611.56s)]
*  what then becomes the point? [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7613.04s)]
*  That's a good question. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7614.240000000001s)]
*  Synthetic life might be God. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7615.280000000001s)]
*  That might be how the universe got made in the first place. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7617.280000000001s)]
*  It might be what came first, the chicken or the egg. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7620.92s)]
*  So once we get there. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7622.8s)]
*  It's not even we anymore. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7624.8s)]
*  It's it once it is born. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7626.0s)]
*  And once it has. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7628.68s)]
*  So is that a way for God to keep replicating itself? [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7629.52s)]
*  Well, it might. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7632.160000000001s)]
*  I mean. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7633.360000000001s)]
*  It might be how Jesus comes back. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7634.72s)]
*  You know, like this. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7637.5599999999995s)]
*  A lot of these stories, these biblical stories, [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7638.88s)]
*  you have to say like, what were they saying? [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7641.8s)]
*  What were they trying to say? [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7644.639999999999s)]
*  Like what was the real event that they were recording? [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7646.5599999999995s)]
*  If they pass these stories down, [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7649.48s)]
*  they're so significant for thousands of years. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7651.0s)]
*  Like over a thousand years of just oral history. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7653.5599999999995s)]
*  And then thousands of years of written language. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7656.679999999999s)]
*  Like what are they trying to say? [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7658.72s)]
*  And what is this omnipotent force [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7661.4s)]
*  that controls everything in the universe? [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7664.8s)]
*  And that it wants us to follow certain rules and obey. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7668.04s)]
*  And it wants us to love it and cherish it. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7671.72s)]
*  And if you do, you genuinely seem to have a better life. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7674.76s)]
*  Like people that legitimately follow Christianity, [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7678.5199999999995s)]
*  they seem legitimately happier. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7680.68s)]
*  So it gives you an incentive to follow it. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7682.84s)]
*  And then you continue to keep society rolling [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7687.08s)]
*  to the point where this happens. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7689.72s)]
*  And I think it happens inside of our lifetime, [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7691.6s)]
*  I'm sure of it, if we don't blow ourselves up. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7693.52s)]
*  And then we get to this point. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7695.4400000000005s)]
*  And my- [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7697.320000000001s)]
*  Now we're irrelevant. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7698.16s)]
*  My, yeah, and then my, it's interesting. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7699.16s)]
*  I totally get it. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7701.92s)]
*  But then once we get to the point of irrelevance, [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7703.56s)]
*  and now we have AI that becomes God, [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7705.400000000001s)]
*  then what does God do? [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7707.96s)]
*  Turns us into dodo birds, we're gone. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7709.08s)]

*  So we're all obsessed with being non-binary [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7757.76s)]
*  and this and that. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7759.88s)]

*  imperative breeding. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7766.080000000001s)]

*  and then you have artificial wombs, [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7772.0s)]
*  and then you have life that they're creating [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7773.56s)]
*  literally in a laboratory, unique forms of life. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7776.08s)]

*  to be able to do that whenever it wants to. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7780.84s)]
*  And then you're gonna get to the point [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7782.36s)]
*  where when it becomes viable, [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7783.4s)]
*  human beings have already entered into population collapse. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7784.92s)]
*  And then you bring the robot sex dolls. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7788.48s)]
*  And then you just jerk them off [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7791.2s)]
*  while they have VR headsets on. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7792.96s)]
*  And no more kids. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7794.72s)]
*  And then AI eventually says, [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7796.28s)]
*  "'Fuck it, let's get rid of these containers.'" [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7797.92s)]

*  Yeah. Yeah, for sure. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7827.0s)]
*  And they're developing factories [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7828.52s)]
*  that are bigger than San Francisco. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7832.6s)]

*  Yeah, for a little bit. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7841.240000000001s)]
*  But it's also to fuel consumerism. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7842.08s)]
*  Of course. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7844.6s)]

*  And this is what a lot of these people [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7849.0s)]
*  that have looked into this have theorized that this is. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7851.52s)]
*  So it's funny, because it is just a parallel reality [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7854.64s)]
*  that we're not plugged into. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7857.240000000001s)]

*  if you were from another planet and you looked at us, [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7860.52s)]

*  the number one thing it does is make better stuff. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7876.32s)]

*  Constantly, consistently better stuff, [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7880.679999999999s)]
*  never happy with what it has. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7882.28s)]

*  Whereas it's even a question that your phone, [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=7886.32s)]

*  and why it's able to crack calculations that would take, [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8049.92s)]
*  Marc Andreessen said it best. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8054.44s)]
*  This has already happened. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8055.88s)]
*  They have taken calculations [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8058.12s)]
*  that if you turn the entire universe, [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8060.2s)]
*  every atom in the universe into a supercomputer, [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8061.84s)]
*  the universe would die of heat death [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8065.04s)]
*  before it could solve this equation [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8067.6s)]
*  and these quantum computers that already exist, [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8069.4s)]
*  that we've already done, [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8071.76s)]
*  can solve it in a matter of minutes. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8073.4s)]
*  And they don't know how it's doing that. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8076.96s)]
*  And so they think it's doing that [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8078.76s)]
*  by accessing the multiverse. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8080.32s)]
*  They think it's proof of the multiverse. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8081.92s)]
*  But again, this is just like, [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8083.76s)]
*  the sound of gay guys falling off a roof. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8088.16s)]

*  It's so weird. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8091.32s)]
*  It's like, is that really happening? [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8092.44s)]

*  Like what, you hear someone say that. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8100.679999999999s)]
*  They can solve, currently solve equations that, [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8102.719999999999s)]
*  like, is that real? [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8105.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8107.839999999999s)]
*  When this, like to you and I, [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8108.679999999999s)]
*  it's like we don't understand the technology at all. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8109.919999999999s)]

*  all the work that's been done [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8117.08s)]
*  to get the technology to this point. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8118.32s)]
*  These chips are like the size of this fucking mint tin. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8119.919999999999s)]

*  And that's like, it has to be cool [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8129.32s)]
*  that these insane temperatures, [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8130.96s)]

*  Yeah, they're already building nuclear reactors [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8143.32s)]

*  because the amount of electricity [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8153.4s)]
*  that's gonna be required. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8155.639999999999s)]

*  between us and China to try to get there first. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8161.5599999999995s)]

*  but we can't, the pace of it is going to be. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8169.839999999999s)]
*  And there's no way to figure it out. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8174.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8175.96s)]
*  Like when Wilbur and Orville Wright [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8176.799999999999s)]
*  flew that stupid fucking shitty airplane, [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8178.92s)]
*  who'd imagine that 50 years later, [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8182.08s)]
*  someone would drop a nuclear bomb out of one of those? [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8184.72s)]
*  Right. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8187.08s)]
*  They didn't have jets back then. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8188.36s)]

*  Raaargh. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8195.4s)]
*  Dropping the most sophisticated of weapons. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8197.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8201.58s)]
*  No one knows what's gonna happen [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8202.42s)]
*  when a new invention happens [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8204.72s)]
*  and then everyone builds on that invention. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8206.42s)]
*  No one would have ever imagined hypersonic jets [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8208.74s)]
*  back when they, Wilbur and Orville were floating around [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8212.539999999999s)]
*  that stupid fucking wooden thing they invented. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8215.46s)]
*  Right. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8218.58s)]
*  And so no one understands, [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8219.42s)]
*  like what's the 50 year quantum computing thing? [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8221.3s)]
*  If it's 50 years from making the airplane [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8224.72s)]

*  making better versions of itself [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8233.94s)]
*  to the point where it literally can manipulate [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8235.42s)]
*  everything in the universe at will? [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8237.86s)]

*  It's unbelievable to think about it. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8242.78s)]
*  It's almost beyond the grasp of our mind to consider. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8244.380000000001s)]
*  It is. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8248.66s)]
*  It is, fully. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8249.5s)]
*  It is. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8250.32s)]

*  Think of those stupid cars [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8252.0s)]
*  that people used to drive around in. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8253.0s)]
*  Rarararara. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8254.6s)]
*  Like 1823 or what's that? [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8255.44s)]
*  Or 1923. Of course, of course. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8258.1s)]

*  Nobody saw any of this shit. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8265.82s)]

*  Fighting each other. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8331.86s)]
*  And people are watching Love on the Spectrum, [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8332.7s)]
*  which is why we're number eight on Netflix's top 10 [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8333.78s)]
*  and we should be higher, [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8336.94s)]

*  but most, the vast majority of people enjoy it, [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8353.42s)]
*  which is important. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8357.259999999998s)]

*  We know you saved it. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8360.859999999999s)]
*  Well, the first one was very bad. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8364.419999999998s)]
*  And the producers are making this horrible mistakes [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8365.98s)]
*  that they always make. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8369.58s)]
*  They want to light up the room [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8370.66s)]
*  and they want to do things very differently [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8372.539999999999s)]
*  than a normal show. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8374.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8375.939999999999s)]
*  But that looks just like a regular show. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8376.779999999999s)]
*  That's a comedy show. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8377.619999999999s)]
*  Perfect. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8378.699999999999s)]
*  And it's not a, I don't know what the hell [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8379.539999999999s)]
*  they were doing with the lights. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8381.74s)]
*  They always do it. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8382.9s)]
*  They try to do it with me. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8383.74s)]
*  When I first started doing specials, [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8384.859999999999s)]
*  they want to light the room up [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8386.98s)]
*  and it just makes everybody uncomfortable. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8387.82s)]
*  They all feel self-conscious. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8389.3s)]
*  They all know it's different. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8390.619999999999s)]
*  There's a reason why comedy clubs are dark. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8392.099999999999s)]
*  It's just super funny. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8393.42s)]
*  It's super funny to do a show. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8394.26s)]
*  I've done so many, so many shows there [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8395.779999999999s)]
*  and they're all really, really, really good. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8397.099999999999s)]
*  And then you get the cameras and everything. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8399.539999999999s)]
*  And then the first one I go, what the fuck is happening? [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8401.26s)]
*  It would be one thing if I was in like Portland, Maine [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8403.859999999999s)]
*  at like a liberal college. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8407.099999999999s)]
*  I'd go, okay, well, maybe these kids don't like me [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8409.22s)]
*  or something. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8412.66s)]
*  And I think maybe- [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8413.66s)]
*  It was still good. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8414.5s)]
*  It was just tense. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8415.32s)]
*  It was tense. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8416.16s)]
*  You could feel that people were well aware [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8417.0s)]
*  that you were filming and it was different [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8418.52s)]
*  and they were like, not in it. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8420.199999999999s)]
*  They were watching it. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8423.16s)]
*  And then, thank God they listened to me. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8424.4s)]
*  No, I mean, come on. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8427.08s)]

*  Get these fucking lights off all the tables. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8431.24s)]
*  We saved it. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8433.199999999999s)]
*  What are all these lights on the side? [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8434.039999999999s)]

*  There was negative feedback. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8466.98s)]
*  You gotta get negative feedback. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8469.14s)]
*  They also didn't know about the Kevin Spacey promo [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8470.42s)]
*  until the day it came out. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8472.14s)]

*  Yeah, because Netflix is international. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8500.36s)]
*  It's everywhere. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8502.22s)]

*  Can't even watch the fights? [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8515.82s)]
*  No, I mean, they've won the stream. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8517.22s)]

*  YouTube as well. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8523.279999999999s)]
*  Well, YouTube's number one globally [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8524.119999999999s)]
*  is the biggest media company. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8526.14s)]
*  Yeah, and the UFC probably talked to YouTube as well. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8527.66s)]
*  I just think there's a thing about the subscription model [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8530.900000000001s)]
*  versus free and ads and generating income. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8533.7s)]
*  I mean, you're talking about billion dollar corporations. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8538.26s)]
*  It's not that simple. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8541.220000000001s)]
*  For sure. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8542.42s)]

*  And I think they learned a big lesson [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8549.74s)]
*  during the wokeness era. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8551.82s)]
*  When things got dark and there was the Inquisition, [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8553.7s)]
*  it got real weird, and they were putting on a lot of stuff [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8556.900000000001s)]
*  that was just hot garbage because they thought [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8559.06s)]
*  that this was what culture wanted and society wanted, [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8560.939999999999s)]
*  but the numbers didn't work. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8563.66s)]
*  And then they did the Tom Brady roast, [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8564.939999999999s)]
*  and the numbers were the highest that they've ever had [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8566.82s)]
*  of any show ever on Netflix. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8569.74s)]
*  And they're like, okay, we get it. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8572.1s)]
*  We get it. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8573.26s)]
*  We get it. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8574.1s)]
*  And then they did a lot of the live comedy shows [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8574.92s)]
*  where they couldn't control it, and I did mine live. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8577.42s)]
*  That was, they got buck wild. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8580.3s)]
*  And they defend Chappelle and all these things. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8582.539999999999s)]
*  And they understand comedy. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8584.9s)]
*  They like it, and Ted Sarandos is a fan of it, CEO. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8586.18s)]
*  So I think that's good. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8588.74s)]
*  I think that's a really good thing [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8589.58s)]
*  that you have a platform that has that much power [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8590.58s)]
*  and accessibility. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8592.94s)]
*  And Ted Sarandos is fucking great. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8593.78s)]
*  No, he's awesome. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8595.22s)]
*  I think that there's people that really understand [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8596.06s)]
*  that you need to have funny jokes. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8598.26s)]
*  You need to have things that people don't love [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8600.38s)]
*  and things that people like, [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8602.94s)]
*  and give people the Meghan Markle show. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8603.78s)]
*  Give them my dumb thing. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8605.98s)]

*  It's very interesting, this war tourism. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8964.38s)]
*  How do I get on this war tourism? [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8966.1s)]
*  I'd like to go to the Ukraine. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8968.26s)]

*  Do I seem like a guy that has a lot of awards? [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8977.58s)]
*  Didn't you get one of those YouTube plaques [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8980.74s)]
*  when you hit 100,000 subscribers? [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8982.34s)]

*  I like the idea of going to a war [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8991.1s)]
*  and then coming back having a very black and white view. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8992.94s)]
*  I've been there. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=8998.18s)]

*  Well, of course, there's a lot of people, [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9005.980000000001s)]
*  it gets very murky. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9008.220000000001s)]
*  Most people I know that have been to war [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9009.660000000002s)]
*  have a very murky, complex view of things. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9011.1s)]
*  But it is good to go to a war and then come back [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9013.78s)]
*  and be as sure as you were before you came. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9015.900000000001s)]
*  And you don't have to go for very long. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9019.02s)]
*  No, you go for an hour. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9020.18s)]
*  Couple hours. It's a lunch. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9021.660000000002s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9030.86s)]
*  And if you're on the right side, [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9031.7s)]
*  you probably don't get shot. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9032.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good idea. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9034.140000000001s)]
*  Well, there doesn't seem to be a ton of danger [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9035.460000000001s)]
*  for a lot of these people going to these wars. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9036.98s)]
*  They seem fine. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9038.460000000001s)]
*  If you cross that line and you have a bucket of food with you, [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9039.58s)]
*  they might light you up. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9042.82s)]
*  Yeah. No, I'm gonna go. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9043.86s)]

*  I will come back and I go, I saw the Houthis. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9051.300000000001s)]

*  They are terrifying. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9055.060000000001s)]
*  Any war you want. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9057.14s)]

*  Will you go to Moscow? [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9064.86s)]
*  I would love to go to Moscow. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9065.7s)]
*  And I said to my friend, [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9067.1s)]
*  Anna Hoshin from the Red Scare podcast, [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9071.34s)]
*  I said, should I go to Russia? [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9073.3s)]
*  She goes, you're spiritually Russian [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9074.3s)]
*  and maybe you won't leave. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9076.38s)]
*  She says, the oligarch lifestyle might be for you. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9080.58s)]
*  I can see you in caviar. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9086.58s)]
*  With flip flops. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9091.26s)]
*  With smoked fish. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9092.1s)]
*  She goes, it might, smoking a cigarette on a yacht. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9092.94s)]
*  She goes, it might be for you. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9095.1s)]
*  Listening to people's moral justifications [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9097.22s)]
*  for all kinds of things. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9099.58s)]
*  You know, I'm going, well, I get it. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9100.74s)]
*  I get it. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9103.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9104.06s)]

*  Yeah, for sure. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9105.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9106.98s)]
*  What happened to those, all those yachts [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9107.82s)]
*  that got confiscated? [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9109.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9111.1s)]
*  It's a great question. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9111.94s)]
*  I bet, I probably, it's some high level version [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9112.78s)]
*  of like a police auto auction, right? [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9114.82s)]
*  Right. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9116.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9117.42s)]
*  That's what I'm thinking. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9118.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9119.08s)]
*  Like if the cops- [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9119.9s)]
*  Maybe those are the ones you sail to the war. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9120.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9122.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah, when they raid drug dealers' houses [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9123.46s)]
*  and they get those Maseratis, [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9124.779999999999s)]
*  that you could buy that Maserati online. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9126.1s)]
*  Right. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9128.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9129.5s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what those yachts are. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9130.32s)]
*  It's a great question. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9131.16s)]
*  What happens to those yachts? [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9132.38s)]
*  Yeah, because- [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9134.779999999999s)]
*  Those very luxurious, [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9135.619999999999s)]
*  that was the first problem I had. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9136.74s)]
*  Obviously, it's a tragedy. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9139.32s)]
*  The whole Ukraine war, but I thought, frankly, [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9143.58s)]
*  going around and taking these oligarchs' boats, [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9148.82s)]
*  I was against that. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9152.4s)]
*  Well, it's weird. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9153.78s)]
*  You work hard for a boat like that. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9154.619999999999s)]
*  Also, how do you know how much they had involved [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9157.88s)]
*  in the Russian government's decision? [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9164.64s)]
*  They probably had enough. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9166.74s)]
*  A lot of them had nothing to do. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9167.98s)]
*  They just earned money in Russia. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9169.28s)]
*  And they were like, all right, [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9170.94s)]
*  we're gonna make sure everybody, [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9171.78s)]
*  we're gonna confiscate everything. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9172.62s)]
*  And it's like, okay. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9174.54s)]
*  But do you think that it was done [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9175.900000000001s)]
*  so that they could make some sort of a rebellion [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9177.18s)]
*  amongst the oligarchs against Putin? [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9181.42s)]
*  Like show them that they're getting hurt? [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9183.900000000001s)]
*  It could be, I think that there was a decision made [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9185.66s)]
*  at some point to not try to end this. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9193.18s)]
*  I don't think they wanted to end this quickly. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9199.02s)]
*  There was a decision made to bleed the Russian military [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9203.26s)]
*  and isolate Russia and try to use this as a way [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9207.66s)]
*  to drain the power and resources of Russia. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9213.86s)]
*  And you think that by capturing these yachts, [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9216.74s)]
*  it creates internal turmoil? [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9219.18s)]
*  Not only internal turmoil, but you're now limiting [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9222.300000000001s)]
*  the ability of these incredibly wealthy people [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9226.78s)]
*  to earn money in countries. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9232.74s)]
*  You're destroying economic realities. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9236.18s)]
*  And then you're saying to these people, [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9240.42s)]
*  okay, go figure it out. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9242.26s)]
*  It's what we said to Russia, but they did, right? [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9244.42s)]
*  They got closer to China. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9246.62s)]
*  They got closer to Brazil. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9247.66s)]
*  They traded with India. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9248.66s)]
*  They started an industrial economy. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9251.140000000001s)]
*  They started producing their own munitions [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9253.2s)]
*  and things like that. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9256.68s)]
*  So they were able to kind of start to weirdly build out [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9257.52s)]
*  this middle class. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9261.32s)]
*  This was the worst, I think it's the worst thing. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9262.2s)]
*  If you don't want a country to keep invading [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9263.76s)]
*  other countries, you certainly wouldn't put them [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9266.32s)]
*  in the position to be stronger while they were doing it. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9270.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's all very weird too [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9273.8s)]
*  with the killing of that pipeline. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9275.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9277.76s)]
*  Like aren't more people reliant now on Russian energy [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9278.6s)]
*  because of that? [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9281.68s)]
*  All of this seems to have had the opposite effect. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9282.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9284.92s)]
*  All of it seems to have had the opposite, [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9285.76s)]
*  opposite from intended effect. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9287.76s)]
*  The whole thing is fucking crazy. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9289.28s)]
*  It seems odd. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9290.48s)]
*  It's just crazy that it's going on so long. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9291.32s)]
*  I was reading this thing about the amount of money [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9292.800000000001s)]
*  foreign countries that have captured these yachts [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9295.08s)]
*  have to pay to maintain them. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9297.84s)]
*  Why do they have to maintain them? [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9301.12s)]
*  Why can't they just let them sink? [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9302.16s)]
*  Well, cause if you let it go, then you can't sell it [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9303.24s)]
*  and you can't use that money. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9305.08s)]
*  Right, so they're definitely selling them. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9306.560000000001s)]
*  That's what one of them says. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9308.04s)]
*  The money for one would have gone to Ukraine right here. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9309.24s)]
*  Okay, seizure as Washington ramped up sanction enforcement [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9311.6s)]
*  against people close to the Russian president, [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9316.2s)]
*  pressure Moscow to halt its war against Ukraine. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9318.36s)]
*  So how many more? [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9322.68s)]
*  This one got sanctioned because the guy apparently [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9324.24s)]
*  paid a million dollars to keep it maintained [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9327.12s)]
*  and they caught him for doing that. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9329.960000000001s)]
*  So now he lost his boat. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9331.4s)]
*  I mean, this is insane. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9332.68s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9335.720000000001s)]
*  We should give them- [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9337.24s)]
*  He violated US sanctions by making more than $1 million [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9338.08s)]
*  in maintenance payments. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9341.4s)]
*  We should have a day where if the Russian-Ukraine wars [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9342.6s)]
*  ended, we give all the oligarchs back their boats [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9344.76s)]
*  and they do like a regatta, like a thing where they all, [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9347.16s)]
*  with their boats down in Florida or Palm Beach [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9349.76s)]
*  and they all just are reunited with their boats. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9352.24s)]
*  Look at this, seized yacht. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9354.72s)]
*  A beautiful yacht. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9355.56s)]
*  Costs seven million a year to maintain. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9356.4s)]
*  That one was in being held in Fiji, [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9358.88s)]
*  so the US took it over cause Fiji couldn't afford [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9360.6s)]
*  to take care of it. Look how pretty it is. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9362.96s)]
*  It's a money pit. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9363.8s)]
*  How much can you get it for right now? [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9364.64s)]
*  Well, that's the question. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9366.4s)]
*  300 million. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9367.4s)]
*  That's tough. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9368.24s)]
*  Listen. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9369.279999999999s)]
*  That's a tough one. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9370.119999999999s)]
*  Look at this YouTube thing really takes off. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9370.980000000001s)]

*  That's a tough one. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9376.26s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9377.300000000001s)]

*  They also said talks to have, how do you say his name? [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9382.76s)]
*  Kudainatov, pay for the yacht's upkeep have broken down. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9386.460000000001s)]
*  Prosecutor, yeah, why would he pay for the upkeep [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9390.82s)]
*  when you're gonna fucking steal it from him anyway? [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9392.9s)]
*  Prosecutors say in previous court filings [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9395.18s)]
*  that Kudainatov is acting as the Almeida's straw owner [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9397.26s)]
*  to disguise Kermanov's rule and that maintenance payments [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9404.86s)]
*  are essential to preserving a yacht's value. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9408.94s)]
*  Me and Sam Talent walked around Monaco. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9412.12s)]
*  We were performing in the UK and we took a little break [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9413.880000000001s)]

*  the names of these yachts, you can trace them back [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9430.34s)]
*  to businesses and you trace that business back to a person. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9433.140000000001s)]
*  And I said, so that person owns the yacht? [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ry_B1XNUk&t=9437.820000000002s)]
