# Joe Rogan Experience #1434 - Trevor Thompson
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 28, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3nSqQhlCmA)
*  Jimmy three two one boom and we're live. What's up, Trevor? How are you brother? Damn? Good? How are you man?
*  I'm good, man. You're a coffee snob
*  Coffee addict. Ah, what's the difference when you become a snob? Like when you go I went you get Starbucks
*  Hmm, maybe when you can tell the difference between all the kinds coffee Ken. Oh, yeah, right if you get all this is an Ethiopian
*  This is this I guess they're all Ethiopian, right? Thanks. You're originally I
*  Learned that from Peter Giuliani does name Giuliano or Giuliani. I
*  Had a real coffee expert on here once who dropped the science on me cheers, sir
*  Yeah, he dropped some coffee science on us
*  Shout out the black rifle coffee
*  Yeah, good stuff. So what's up, man? How are you went to you did the full comedy store? I did on it last night
*  I figured like, you know
*  There's a chance he's gonna be there. Let me look it up. Take my buddies. Yeah. Yeah, we're there all the time
*  That's like I was saying it's like the gym, you know, that's where
*  It's where we train, you know, and you can see it and it's rad to see
*  It's fun to see that kind of training
*  Going on with that kind of creative art that you need other people to respond to yeah
*  It's a weird art like that. Yeah, you really can't do it in a vacuum
*  No, I mean then you're just talking yourself have you how many have you been to comedy shows before a few
*  Actually, I went to your show. Oh, that was in San Diego, right from right right right at Temecula, right?
*  Yeah, I think is the Pachanga. Is that what it is?
*  That's a good fucking casino. Yeah, it gets a bad rap. It's like people I think it's just because it comes off as silly
*  Pachanga because the name probably it's a good spot
*  So last night was fun man, and we almost had like a mini podcast in the back bar of the comedy
*  So I'm like damn we got to remember all this cool shit. We talked about
*  You know, I was trying to think like all the different things that we talked about that we have to remember
*  But one of them is a shout out to our buddy Andy Andy stump who basically
*  We were talking last night about one of the things that happened
*  There was a there was an event while you were
*  Serving where a helicopter was shot down and then you were the you were the replacement group
*  Yeah
*  So I was augmenting the group that ended up replacing the guys who passed away during extortion 17 and that was a huge event
*  Right enormous huge loss to the special operations community as a whole, you know
*  I was listening to Andy's podcast with cam hands. It's out right now. That's cleared hot and he was saying that
*  They were flying
*  towards fires
*  And or you know, actually this is a different story
*  This is a different story, but he was saying that it got hit by an RPG at night, which is rare
*  Yeah, like apparently those things are not easy to aim
*  No, they're I mean, it's just a it's a rocket propelled grenade. It's you know shoulder fired and you just point and aim
*  So the thing isn't that accurate? Hmm. So you did they have a scope on them a rudimentary one and depending on which one you're using
*  Yeah, that's you just kind of sort of just getting a sight picture through that Kentucky. When did you okay?
*  and
*  so that was a
*  That was a thing that Andy could have been in that group. Absolutely could have
*  Which is very tough
*  For guys that aren't there that could have been there
*  To know that that's a possibility with so many dudes that spent so much time together
*  Like him with those guys
*  Yeah, one of the things that we talked about last night was the difference in perception
*  Between what war is actually like versus what civilians?
*  Think war is like and how much of that stuff is sort of polluted by media by
*  movies and television shows where they paint this picture of it and
*  Then the only people that know what it's like are you you guys you're the only ones who know the people that were actually there
*  Yeah, and it's I
*  Think it's cool
*  What you're doing and what guys like Jaco were doing where they're allowing guys to paint that picture for everybody
*  to see how
*  It really can be from everybody's individual perspective
*  Because all of us get a different sliver of what's going on, you know, we all see a slightly different
*  Reality when we're there. Yeah, each person is different, but I think it's important that
*  Everybody gets to relate that to the US especially because of how long this has been going on
*  You know, it's been 20 years of sustained
*  fighting for a small amount of Americans
*  That's really insane if you stop and think about it because remember when we used to think about World War two or Vietnam
*  Like Vietnam dragged on forever was nothing compared to this. It wasn't 20 years. Yeah
*  It's wild. It is really crazy because it seems perpetual
*  It seems like there are guys that are serving now with their fathers Jesus Christ, it's a real thing
*  Wow. Yeah
*  Right that makes sense
*  Fuck yeah
*  You know when we were talking about last night, I was saying what it like
*  Does is it frustrating to you and you see media depictions of it and you see in films about war like that?
*  Like when you see something that's really woefully inaccurate
*  Yeah
*  It's only really frustrating when you can see that there that whomever put that together is doing it for their own profit and gain
*  mmm, like they're misconstruing something to push an agenda, whatever it is if it's
*  Political economic who cares right that that's just unfortunate, especially when they're portraying things that are going on now
*  Yeah with dudes that are really alive
*  still
*  Right
*  That's that's tough to see
*  yeah, um, I'm friends with Marcus Luttrell and
*  he's gonna come on and talk soon and
*  That's gotta be the weirdest one. You're watching Marky Mark play you in a movie
*  You know, no disrespect. I think Mark Robb is a great actor. Yeah, he's a he's a beast
*  He's a he's a pretty inspirational dude
*  I mean, I like Mark Wahlberg a lot but to see that guy from Marky Mark and the funky bunch
*  Like you've seen him. Yeah, like you see yeah seen you in whitey-tatties. What's going on?
*  I've seen you in the Calvin Klein's ads and now you're playing me like that is good for Marcus
*  That's gotta be so weird super weird just like some guy and probably saying a bunch of shit
*  You never really said oh, yeah, and the other guy is what Bradley Cooper was his buddy in the movie. Who was the other guy?
*  Oh, yeah, wasn't it?
*  That's right. That's gotta be totally are so bizarre
*  This horrific event in your life that probably I mean, I don't want to speak for Marcus
*  But it's got to still be in his head every day. Absolutely all day long. That stuff doesn't go away. Yeah, you know you
*  We we all individually think oh, yeah, you know
*  Maybe it does kind of fade but that's only cuz you're not the one who lived it exactly with everything
*  Yeah with everything with everything. Yeah, we're very insensitive to the way other people feel about
*  Traumatic events or chaos or things that we can't understand. Yeah, it's part of who you are. Yeah, I
*  Don't think there's a thing that you can't understand more than war if you haven't experienced it
*  I mean I I haven't obviously I obviously haven't experienced it
*  But when I think about it, I'm like, I don't even know if I should be thinking about like what it's like. I have zero
*  Knowledge. Yeah, but it's almost it's it's very similar to like hunting is right if you're not part of it
*  Your distorted view of whatever is going on is so odd
*  Because you're essentially fantasizing and trying to build this image up in your head of oh, that's what that must be like. Mm-hmm
*  with no
*  Ability to actually say that that's really how that's like because you haven't touched it
*  Yeah, I would imagine hunting is not nearly as intense. No, no, but it's it's something else
*  That's so many people just don't they get it wrong get to do and they get it wrong like being up on stage
*  Mm-hmm, you know or performing in front of thousands millions of people. Yeah, people don't understand what that's like
*  Unless you're up there, right doing the thing, right?
*  Yeah
*  But the the thing about war that's more
*  It's more crazy than any of those things. It's crazier than any of those things
*  Yeah, is that you're taking 17 18 year old kids and
*  Subjecting to that while they're they're really still just figuring out life
*  Like really in the beginning stages of figuring out life like not even allowed to drink. Yeah, that is really crazy
*  You can't drink but you can shoot people
*  Thanks for voting. No alcohol for you
*  Get your ass over there. Get on in there. It's that's a weird one, right? Good luck dog
*  Yeah, but the thing is if you made it the same age like if you first of all don't make voting 18
*  No, it's terrible idea all these fucking people that are saying voting should be 16. Fuck you
*  Wasn't Nancy Pelosi said that I think so. I think she said 16
*  But when I was 16, I was a champ
*  I really was I was one of the dumbest fucking human beings on the planet if you allowed me to have any say whatsoever
*  And how the world is processed just think of the shit you thought was cool
*  Oh, yeah. Oh no. Well, I thought a lot of the same shit was cool. That's what's really sad
*  comic books
*  Into loud noises and loud cars. I was into like most of this shiny shit. Yeah shiny shit like this chimp
*  Fucking most of the things I'm not into me. I'm wasn't into yoga or jujitsu back then
*  Other than that or or hunting or bow hunting other than that pretty fucking similar
*  Yeah, but just dumb as shit
*  Still dumb as shit, but really really dumb as shit back then
*  Extra dumb extra dumb 16 year old dumb is fucking ridiculous young and dumb. Yeah, you don't even have the experience
*  Not only that you've only been getting boners for three years. So you're baffled by life, right?
*  Everything turns you on
*  Yeah, dude
*  You remember those days those were so confusing to go from being like an 11 year old a 12 year old to being a 13 and
*  a 14 year old like what is happening in my pants?
*  The fuck is this you're going from Legos and Lincoln logs to
*  Exactly, she looks good girls are experiencing it too. And so it's like this weird like you're playing like an adult
*  You play relationships. Yeah, get it, right? Yeah that people the idea that those people can vote is like fuck you
*  That's so ridiculous
*  Yes, they shouldn't be able to do heroin yet. They shouldn't be able to drink. They definitely shouldn't be able to vote
*  Absolutely, but you can send them to war. Oh, yeah, it's just you can go to war on a waiver. Yeah, 17
*  Well, that's what Andy did. He signed up when he was 17 and pre 9-eleven more power to him. Yeah, that's wild
*  How old were you when you enlisted?
*  What was you insane what's really crazy is you're a fucking super talented artist we'll show these people this
*  This
*  Trevor made this this is you say it's red cloud Sun. Yeah, Jack read class. You see that can people see that
*  It's fucking great, man. You're really talented. So you went to school for art
*  I did so I went to the Chicago Art Institute for a year
*  before I joined the Navy and
*  My entire family has a lot of art background
*  My mom studied at college. My dad does bronzes and he actually does a sports cartoon for the LA Times
*  Whoa. Yeah, so it's been something I've seen growing up and
*  I was playing music a lot and doing art and picked art because that was what I was most passionate about
*  That was what 2006 and about three months into college. I'm like fuck this place
*  No part of this. What was it? I just didn't feel like I was doing anything with with with so much shit going on
*  You know six. Oh, okay. Yeah
*  And like both my granddad served and great granddad served and we've had a lot of military history
*  So I think that subconsciously I felt a little bit of an impetus to do that. Mm-hmm like hey
*  Maybe I should just give it a go and if I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do the hardest thing I can figure out
*  thought about it I'm like
*  Yeah, mom and dad, so I'm dropping out of school. I'm gonna go be a Navy SEAL and I
*  Can only imagine the other side of that phone like what the fuck is going on how high is he?
*  So you made a phone call from college, oh, yeah Wow, where were you going to school Chicago Art Institute
*  And your family lives in LA. Oh Jesus. Yeah in Westlake Wow. Yeah
*  How'd they handle it? Um
*  Pretty well, yeah way quieter than I expected. I think they thought that I would just like wash it out of my system
*  before I really did it and so I
*  Think they were a little extra surprised when I told them like a week or so later that I put a leave of absence in
*  Like yeah. Yeah, I'm really not coming back to school
*  Wow, I come home and train for this
*  Fuck
*  Yeah, yeah, I can only imagine and my my friend cam Haynes his son is a Ranger now
*  Oh, that's right. He just recently deployed and it's for him. It's a is really
*  Crazy struggle, you know in in his head it's like for one he's proud of his son
*  Yeah, and and honored and and you know, there's that expression if not my son who's yeah and but on the other hand
*  It's like wow
*  His son is deploying he's going overseas and he's involved in operations
*  It's for real for real for real for real, you know, and I coming from a family that we have had a lot of
*  Family members have seen combat like it's for real for real
*  You know and they got it and I saw that
*  I mean once I graduated I could really see that I could see how it was affecting them and
*  it's tough to see but I really wanted to do that thing and
*  You know, you're just a kid like yeah
*  I thought I understood I was getting into and how that was gonna affect my family and you know
*  I mean I barely now get it like I barely now see and how old you know 32. Yeah
*  I
*  Could only imagine yeah, I mean that we're only talking about 13 years ago. Yeah. Yeah
*  That
*  so what we're talking about was the difference between the way the media depicts it and
*  The way it is. Is there anybody that's got it? Right? Is there any movie that you watch you know, that's pretty goddamn close. I
*  Don't know they're all
*  They're all close ish, you know, but a lot of them are very Hollywoodized they have to be I get it right
*  You know, I understand they're telling a story right, you know, unless they're doing a documentary
*  it's just a story but like I I
*  Can say that Saving Private Ryan was super close. Hmm. Not obviously I wasn't for that
*  But my dad's dad said he had to step out of the theater
*  When he went to go see that well because he could smell diesel
*  He remembered it. It was that strong of a memory for him. Yeah
*  So was he at Normandy? No, he he did comment landings in the South Pacific with the Marine Corps
*  That fucking opening scene when they yeah on the beach. It's it's it's tough fucking nuts, man
*  The idea that that was the only way that they could handle that situation that they had to do it that way
*  Yeah, imagine being one of those guys that has to get off those boats. That was there. That was their good better best scenario
*  Yeah, yeah, this is this is how this has to happen
*  How many people died that day
*  Thousands I'm not positive on that but it was thousands of people perish that day
*  There was something that someone did to commemorate the
*  Anniversary of the event and they did something that represented every body of everyone who died
*  They did it like on the beach like with a number here it goes
*  Four hundred and twenty five thousand allied and German troops were killed wounded or went missing during the Battle of Normandy
*  209 Allied casualties Jesus Christ
*  It's fucking insane. That's fucking insane
*  I mean, I remember my granddad has and I knew he had told me these things before I joined about
*  Storming a beach in the South Pacific and everybody left right front and back of him dying
*  Going up the sand
*  You know, so but that those are the kinds of things that it's tough to yeah, that's fucking insane
*  That's the thing. It's a they did it all over the sand and it represents all the different people that died
*  And it's just everywhere everywhere you look so that if you were a person
*  Who really had this abstract idea that this war went down there that gives you a visual representation of what it must have looked like
*  Yeah, you can kind of almost get it in your head like it makes it more visceral
*  Yeah, just look and see that many fucking bodies and that was the best-case scenario for these guys. Yeah, that's the best-case scenario
*  That's why they did it that way. Yeah, it's terrifying. God damn, you know
*  And it's it's stuff like that or like a month before I went to Afghanistan. It's about a month is when extortion 17 happened
*  I'm like
*  fuck
*  I'm going there
*  To replace those guys
*  It makes it really really like
*  Some some things sound home really well and some things don't and for me that did
*  What was your first appointment like so my first one was with a team out in Hawaii where we were doing
*  submersible work, so I drove like a
*  22 foot mini sub for
*  Five years really. Oh, yeah, and we were doing some like waterborne activities
*  How deep does it go?
*  That's classified. Oh really? But yeah, it can go really deep. Yeah, but it's a it's a wet submarine
*  So we're on we're on scuba. It's all like you're you're in the water not just underwater
*  Oh really? Yeah, so you're wearing scuba gear while you're piloting this thing. So the water gets in there. Yep. Whoa, it's like a
*  You can probably pull up a picture of it, bro. That's a mind fuck on top of a mind fuck SDV
*  Just being in a scuba is crazy, but being in a scuba gear inside of a fucking submarine with the door shut. Oh
*  So how much are you gotten there enough?
*  That's nuts that's the boat oh so it's like a convertible it no no so
*  Behind those dudes. Yeah, those doors sliders
*  So you shut them so because it can drive relatively fast where like if you had them open like shit
*  It'd be like so that looks like something from a fucking James Bond movie
*  That is it is like something from a fucking James Bond movie. I'm like crazy. We train in the daytime
*  It is bananas. It is wild to drive that thing. I can only imagine cuz you're landing on the back of a submarine
*  It's 22 feet long ish I I mean that's what I recall fucking a that you can see it looks fake
*  Like if I saw that in the movie, I'm like they don't have one of those. Yeah, that's bullshit
*  It does doesn't it. It's like a human torpedo. Yeah, that's what it looks like. It looks like a fucking missile
*  It is fucking it's pretty cool Wow
*  so
*  That is wild. There's a ton of those things that other countries have like they've been using submersibles since the First World War
*  No, you know, so the first invent submarines
*  I think I think the Revolutionary War there was a guy that like
*  paddles ass around in a in like a
*  I've seen like a barrel. It's like an oak barrel. Yeah, it's like crazy looking Wow
*  I'm just gonna go we imagine that first gangster to fucking climb into a metal dick and slide it in the ocean
*  Look, I got this even the guys that went the deepest did it like in the 30s or 40s and no one's been able to do
*  That again why it didn't sound like weird. Yeah, really and they had a window
*  It was like four inches across in I think it cracked when they got to the bottom
*  Oh my god, you mentioned what because nobody did it before so it's all just calculations
*  Yeah time you actually get down there and then you think like back to your question. How much hair do we got?
*  Oh my god, I guess we have enough. Oh my god
*  Yeah, that to me freaks me out about more than anything in the water as a submarine
*  the idea of being in one of them tubes and
*  Sliding around and not being able to see using sonar and you think like what's in the water?
*  There's some big ass animals in the water big ass big ass animals
*  All they have to do is bump you and create a little stress fracture
*  I've seen whales and sharks and dolphins and all sorts of crazy shit down there. What kind of crazy shit?
*  man, we were on the bottom once and we saw this like
*  Scorpion crab looking thing like walking around on the ground. It was like this tall like so you're making a like like a Great Dane
*  Yeah, real but like a crab a crab like Great Dane
*  Underwater underwater is ridiculous. I don't know what it was, but it was terrifying
*  Is it that's is that an undocumented animal? I'm sure it's documented
*  There's a bunch of those weird like spider crab looking things that walk around fuck
*  Well, they don't know what everything is in the ocean. They're constantly pulling up new shit like look at this thing
*  It's like the size of a car like
*  Well, what's really weird is those really really old ones at the bottom that people have they only come up when you get like a tsunami
*  Washington shore have you ever seen those websites dedicated to like the stuff that was in the Thailand tsunami
*  I go way down the rabbit hole on some of that crap
*  those things don't even look real and they've pulled like I think they recently got a
*  whale
*  That had a spear tip in it from like 200 years ago
*  Or 150 years ago like so it's a currently living whale. Yeah. Whoa. Yeah
*  So 150 years ago during the Moby Dick days someone harpooned it. Yeah
*  And it lived. I'm I think that I I have heard this recently. Yeah
*  Wow, these animals are crazy. I mean those Greenland sharks live to be like 300 or something
*  No shit. Yeah, that's what they isn't that what they think that one
*  That's one of the theories about the Loch Ness monster that it might be some sort of a landlocked Greenland shark. Yeah, you know
*  Or just people full shit. I'm going with number two. I'm going with number two like how you feel about Sasquatch
*  That's how I feel about that shit. I'm like there's enough scary shit out there
*  Yeah, we don't need to make up a Loch Ness monster. It doesn't make any sense
*  No, I just think that people see things in the water and then they exaggerate the size of them and the next thing
*  You know, they're telling a story. There's probably some shit in there with some eels
*  I'm sure or maybe a sturgeon or something like that. Sturgeon are huge the size of this desk
*  They're so big and if you saw one from a distance at night
*  You would assume that that was a monster or an alligator gar alligator gar. Yeah. Oh, here it is
*  Scroll down, please. Just like I see the title the hell survives harpoon attack
*  130 years ago to become the world's oldest mammal. Look at that harpoon head. Well, I'm glad I wasn't full shit
*  embedded in his neck
*  Wow, is that not insane? It was caught off Alaska. So how'd they catch it?
*  It's a biologist claim the fine helps prove the bowhead is the oldest living man on earth says a 13 centimeter arrow
*  Shaped fragment dates back to around 1880 Wow
*  Meaning the 50 ton whale had been coasting around with this freezing art Arctic waters since the Victorian times
*  That's nuts man wild and since they never took calves
*  They estimated the bowhead was several years old when it was first shot and about 130 when it died last month
*  I'll say it died
*  God damn and it probably died because they caught it. I
*  Mean I can't be good for it
*  Yeah, it's just weird how many different things they used to do with the whales these two tournament the lamps
*  They still lamp oil and shit. They used to eat them. Yeah, they still do in
*  I think parts of the frozen north Faroe Islands, too. Yeah
*  Was it say Jamie?
*  fired from a heavy shoulder gun the harpoon was attached to a small metal cylinder filled with explosives and
*  Fitted with a time fuse so it explodes seconds after shot into the whale
*  Jesus Christ, that's so dark
*  The weapons manufactured to a New England factory about 1880 and said it was rendered obsolete by a less bulky
*  Darting gun a few years later
*  So they'd shoot into it and said even though the device probably exploded the bowhead was protected by a one foot thick layer of
*  blubber and thick bones used to protect
*  Used to break through the ice
*  One foot thick to breathe out of the surface imagine that fucking thing can break through a foot thick of ice
*  That's insane. That's in South Stan
*  I was ice fishing on four inches of ice just a couple months out on that stuff
*  Yeah, and it's breaking through with its head
*  For such bitches, oh, yeah compared to whales and you got to think they only invented that explosive arrow tip after a couple
*  You know Moby Dick misadventures. Yeah. Oh you got dragged under
*  Oh
*  Yeah, yeah row out there. Yeah. Yeah, just like poke it. We got you
*  Yeah, how did they kill it before they had big boats?
*  They must have had to have a shit ton of boats and surrounded and everybody throw one in there and just keep doing it
*  I'll take I'll take none of that
*  It's just it's a there's certain animals that you just feel real bad when they die and whales are one of them
*  Yeah, they're just too smart. They're too smart. They're too big and they're too majestic
*  And how much do you need a lamp? Is there other ways to make a lamp or lipstick?
*  They use them for like lipstick just like reading the daytime. Yeah, relax
*  Well, apparently shark's liver is something that a lot of makeup and moisturizers and stuff have in it
*  No shit
*  Yeah
*  They did they did this DNA test on certain makeups and they found out that shark liver for whatever reasons like this excellent moisturizer
*  How good do you think that makes vegetarians feel like? Yeah, you're just wiping some shark liver all over your face
*  No big deal. Yeah vegan makeup sucks. I'm sure I was looking for some of the
*  Animals from the tsunamis and I found an interesting I hadn't heard yet. Oh, yeah
*  Sea creatures still arriving in the US on plastic debris from the Japanese tsunami eight years ago. Whoa, perfect
*  Marine biologists don't know how long different species can survive a drift in the open ocean and some may become
*  Invasive when they reach new shores Wow something like 300 different kinds of animals have made it over to the shore
*  That's like a it's like a star by Oregon take out cup. Yeah, I think that's like a you know, one of those
*  Pictures they use all the time. Yeah
*  So the tsunami washed boats plastic docks. Oh, I know that they did in San Francisco. They would find stuff
*  Yeah, that was like Japanese writing on it like some stuff that had drifted across
*  But the fucking weird animals the weird animals that they found at the bottom of the ocean
*  They're weird heartless looking fucks
*  Yeah, like half of them are blind and see-through. Yeah. Yeah, and they they're luminescent like they they have
*  color light
*  That comes out of their body. What is this one? I see bioluminescent. Yeah, that's where it is
*  All the weird stuff they found
*  Yeah, so when you were under that thing like you did you come in contact with any animals
*  Did anything bump the the no, I think the closest the closest we ever came was
*  Some dolphins were close and then did they get curious they do that's and you can hear them you can hear them
*  Oh when you're under there looking oh, yeah
*  Well and whales too we were in Maui doing some training and we heard some some whales as they were migrating
*  Yeah, I've seen them Maui a bunch of ours close
*  Yeah, we did a boat thing where you go out and try to find the whales fucking cool. It's wild man
*  Did you don't realize how big they are until you're right next to them? Yeah, you're up next to it
*  You're like, oh, that's a school bus. Yeah with a brain
*  Yeah, and a smart school bus. Yeah, and then orcas. Those are the freakiest. Those are just giant dolphins
*  Yeah, but they eat dolphins. Yeah, I want no I want no part of that either
*  They're really nice to people though. That's what's really weird
*  They're really nice to people though
*  That's what's really interesting to me about orcas is that in in captivity is the only place that they've like
*  Documented that they've actually hurt people. That's right kill people in the ocean
*  They actually help people sometimes like people fall in the water
*  They like help them up onto the boat like I don't know why they would do that
*  Like why do they like us but they're fucked dolphins up?
*  Maybe they're so smart but the ones out there are like don't take me don't take me
*  I'm just gonna help you out like pick another right?
*  Maybe they're small so smart that they're like listen these motherfuckers have guns
*  They have planes and they can shoot guns out of planes. We don't have thumbs. Yeah, let's just help them back on the boat
*  Yeah, be a friend get him out of here. Yeah this um
*  The fact that we're still here in 2020 and they have SeaWorld where they make those fucking things do tricks for fish
*  Oh, man, that shit is dark. It's super dark. It's dark that might as well be slavery
*  It's like a different animal. I mean a different kind of human
*  Intelligent creature that you're yeah keeping in a fucking swimming pool
*  I feel so bad for all of them in not just like not just the
*  aquariums, but like zoos to
*  It kills me like you go somewhere and yeah, like oh, there's polar bear. That's really cool. They painted the whole
*  Place like it's snow. Yeah, meanwhile, it's fuck 65 degrees. Yeah, it's like come on
*  Yeah, I understand they're doing a lot of good work in the back end
*  But yeah, do we really need to put them on display like I know it's weird like a gift shop
*  I went to this wolf connection recently
*  which is like a wolf sanctuary out near Palmdale and
*  These people are doing great work. They're really nice people. They're taking care of these wolves and
*  It's mostly like people get wolves and try to keep them as pets and they realize they can't they can't control like
*  A wolf or eighth wolf type of animals some of them but most of them like a seven eighths wolf
*  Okay, there's a lot of wolf and a lot of them one of them was like all wolf
*  Oh my god couple of more all wolf
*  But you feel bad when you're out there because you want those fucking things to be free
*  Yeah, like you see him and you're like, I love the fact that you're taking care of him
*  I love the fact that you care but but I wish they were just out there running around like you don't belong in here
*  Yeah, you belong somewhere in Montana and they castrate them
*  They fix them they don't want to make them babies isn't it isn't it weird how we kind of whitewash that statement
*  Yeah, it's it's a fixed animal. Yeah
*  Yeah, you knew it up. No, you cuz balls off. Yeah, just say it say what you did and everybody does that and it's it's a weird
*  Thing man, like I went to a vet once with my old dog Johnny cash and when I brought him in the the vet goes
*  She she touches his balls. She was why is he still have these I?
*  Go cuz that they make testosterone and that's what keeps him healthy. Like what are you talking about?
*  He was born with those. I'm not there for a reason. I'm not gonna let him fuck dogs in heat and make babies
*  He's with me all the time
*  He's not gonna disappear
*  Yeah, it's not like he's gonna fucking get out make a bunch of babies
*  Like this is a well cared for dog in a nice yard. Like he's good. Trust me
*  Yeah, he doesn't have to get his balls chopped off and my vet that I had a vet
*  Who's a good friend one of dying and a drunk driving? I some fucking asshole slammed in
*  But he told me he goes it's not necessary he goes and it does affect the dogs energy level
*  It does affect the dogs hormonal growth like whether if you do it when a dog's really young they never grow to full maturity
*  They sort of stay like a puppy for a long time
*  Yeah, and I had a dog like that that we got it was a rescue dog
*  Well, actually wasn't a rescue dog
*  We got him from a pet store and he had been castrated really young pet store. So you did rescue him. Yes, I guess I did
*  Yeah, it wasn't my idea my wife got him, but he was a bitch
*  He was just hated every other dog hated, you know
*  You growl at you growl at kids and he just was always insecure cuz like he never grew up with testosterone
*  Like when he was little he was a good owner. Yeah, I mean when we got him was like six months old. He was already clipped
*  And it's really just us as humans being lazy as an animal owner
*  Yeah, right, right not you don't want to control it. You don't want to train it was just castrated
*  So it can't make this already do it. Yeah, and we want make it that that's the standard spaying new to your pets
*  Bob Barker says yeah. Yeah, I mean you don't have to spay and new to your pet
*  Like females is different because they will bleed all over your house and they go and heat and it's a different animal
*  I mean, I understand it but still but still like yeah
*  Come on, right. Yeah, it's your choice to own that thing, right? Yeah or to partner with it really unless it's a cat
*  Oh, yeah, cuz that motherfucker will spray all over your house. If you have a male cat you better cut his balls off
*  I had a male cat that did it. Anyway, he was a wild cat
*  I caught use feral and he would piss all over my fucking house man
*  He just lift his tail up and spray like right in front of you. It was a little fuck
*  That's when I had to get him fixed. I had him get him fixed. It was like I guess he was probably
*  Six or seven months old when I finally had to get him fixed and I could pet him
*  But I could only pet him if I moved towards him slowly like we had a weird relationship me and that cat I mean
*  It's it's basically a lion. It's just so it's only five pounds. Yeah, it would fuck you up. Oh, dude
*  He tried to yeah, he was feral. I mean it was really feral like when I got him
*  He was a baby and my friend actually found him
*  Her and her boyfriend were staying at this apartment and below the apartment
*  There was like this opening and like those like a you know little
*  Crawl space area in this cat had a bunch of kittens
*  So her and her boyfriend rescued these kittens and then she started giving them away to people and I'm a sucker
*  So I'm like, I'll take one of these and I got a home and it was like
*  Pissing at me and I had to lock myself in a room with this cat for like two or three days
*  I just brought books. I put a litter box in there. I brought books and I put a bed in there and
*  Just me and this fucking cat in this guest room of my house. We're gonna be together for days, dude
*  It was crazy like I'd pet him. He'd be like
*  He would purr so loud when I pet him. He was so happy and then as soon as I let him go he'd be like
*  Yes, try to fucking climb up the curtains. I'm like, oh my god, this is never gonna work out
*  I was like, what have I got myself into?
*  volunteer and then my other cat was outside and she was like dad
*  What the fuck are you doing in there with this cat? This is crazy because I couldn't
*  Have her
*  but once that helped when I let her in after like a day or two and
*  She would come right up to me start purring. I pet her and the cows like oh, okay. He's not eating her
*  Hmm, maybe he's not gonna eat me either
*  And but by the time he was getting older and developing, you know, he was getting ready to breed
*  He just starts spraying all over my house. So I had to capture him and bring him to the vet
*  I'm sure that was entertaining dude. It was a battle
*  I mean a fucking battle just me and him locked down in this bathroom and I was trying I wound up
*  Throwing a robe over him
*  Wrapping him up in towels and then stuffing him in a hamper and then taping the top of the hamper
*  Oh my god, and then bringing him to my friend. Dr. Craig and go bro
*  I got a fucking wild cat that I need to stay and he just looked like what are you talking about?
*  And it's like
*  That has balls removed
*  Bro this has to end yeah, it's weird what we do with animals man
*  But but you can't really let look feral cats wild cats in particular outdoor cats are responsible for
*  billions of deaths
*  Billions. Yeah, you're seeing the numbers. It's crazy like small birds small birds and rodents
*  It's in the billions. I mean is this and that's just in North America. They don't call them mousers for nothing
*  Yeah, it's a stunning number. Yeah, but you can learn from those little fuckers like like you want good spot and stock tactics
*  Oh, if you're a bow hunter watch watch the way a cat moves like the way they like have their front paw
*  They don't even put it down yet. Like yeah
*  And they have it get from the jump get lower nobody has to teach it shit
*  I mean from the jump they have these instincts pretty and that and that's a house cat. Yeah a
*  House cat. Yeah, it's not a mountain lion. It's not a tiger
*  That's a house cat. Have you ever encountered a mountain lion? Didn't we talk about those? We did
*  Yeah, talk about it. So I saw one when I was all that video is one of my favorite videos play that Jamie
*  This video is this fucking deer going to a drinking I'll just have a little drink of water here
*  Look at the eyes. I'm safe here comes the eyes
*  That's a wrap sign boom like a fucking super athlete
*  Mouth first. Yeah into the throat. Yeah, I got you bitch
*  And then the claws just grab a hold so they can get a good clamp down on the throat big cats are scary, dude
*  there's a well, that's what I was telling you to hone ranch they have a
*  Camera trap over a waterhole and in that one pond they found 16 different cats
*  16 different
*  Poundage predatory cats. Yeah, they're everywhere eating a deer day or whatever they do. Yeah, probably one a week for sure. Oh, yeah, you know
*  That's why California doesn't have any deer
*  California this is the fact this it's very hard to find deer out here. They should be everywhere, right?
*  Yeah, you think about the fact that no one's hunting them like where are all the deer?
*  Coyotes and mountain lions. Well, that's where all the deer and it's a trickle down thing, right?
*  Like there used to be grizzly bears there used to be a lot of other predators
*  Yeah, they would push those things around because they keep those numbers down
*  Like they're not gonna cats aren't gonna breed like that if there's if there's grizz or wolves that are also feeding on the same food source
*  Yeah, but there's none of that. So the cats are like let's fucking do this
*  Yeah, it's so weird it's weird that people don't recognize that's not good to keep them in high numbers around people
*  Yeah, you know they wind up killing them, but they don't it's all done under cover of darkness
*  It's all done by state, you know
*  Regular but then they don't sell the tax for that so they don't make any money off of it which they could yeah
*  They're great back into conservation. Well, it's it's the craziest thing to say I've said it to people and they like there's no way
*  Mountain lion supposedly is one of the best tasting meats you can eat
*  I've heard they say it's like a superior pork and this is not just from one person
*  Superior pork and this is not just from one person
*  Green tree told me that Adam Green tree told me that Steve Rinella told me that fucking everybody tells me it they say it's delicious
*  I've heard yeah Ryan Callahan said he did like a slow
*  I think he slow cooked a mountain lion quarter on the Traeger. He said it was spectacular. What a cool thing to tell
*  Yeah, like house guests. Oh, yeah. Yeah, so we're gonna have some slow-cooked mountain lion. Yeah
*  That's a weird one though. You kill a mountain lion. You better not put that shit on social media
*  Oh my god, you're gonna have that. Yeah
*  Yeah, people already get upset about like pigs and those are tearing up the bears are a big universe
*  Oh, yeah bear and also because they don't understand that you eat bear and the bear delicious
*  Yeah, and that you have to kill them. It's like that's an animal that you actually have to kill
*  I have bears in my freezer. Yeah, me too. It's good. Yeah, they're good. Yeah
*  Yeah, it's and that was your first hunt right with the boys. Yeah
*  That was a hilarious phone call. Well, you had only been doing archery for how long?
*  zero
*  I've been doing archery for a grand total of no time really. Oh, yeah, so you learned on the fly. So, um
*  Andy gives me a ring and he's like, hey man, somebody dropped out of this hunt. Do you want to go like yeah
*  No questions asked. Okay, he goes. All right. Here's some shit you got to do
*  Like you have to book a ticket to Kansas Mike
*  When he goes next Wednesday?
*  So essentially I like I think it was like a week or two I
*  Flew out to meet dud and Andy and Chad Mendez was out there
*  Oh, they were doing a turkey hunt and I was just there to like watch and observe and learn how to shoot the bow from dud
*  So you flew out? Mm-hmm never shot a bow before never touched one never touched a bow before
*  John motherfucking Dudley the Yoda is coaching you. Oh, yeah, Kansas. Yep in a bar in a barn. Yeah Wow
*  Do that guy so selfless with his time I
*  Have told so many people I've never met somebody if that kind of station in life that gives away more of their time
*  No, he's crazy incredible. He's a real evangelist for archery. Yeah, you know, thank you John. Yeah. No, he's he's awesome. Yeah, he's a
*  Like he's changed the way so many people approach archery to like oh, yeah from a technical standpoint
*  He's changing the game. Yeah 100% it's such a well, this is another thing
*  We're talking about last night too that it's such a therapeutic thing for veterans. Yeah, it's so because you know
*  It's such an intense
*  Activity and it's such a an over what there's such a deep learning curve. There's so much to get from it
*  It's a forever sport. Yeah
*  You will never be
*  Perfect at archery
*  Yeah, never and if you think you ever will be just look at duds
*  Social media channels and that fucker shoots every damn day. Yeah, and
*  Every day he's like, yeah, I could be better and you can always make a bad shot. Absolutely
*  You can everybody can screw up. Yeah. Yeah
*  Archery is a weird thing and but the success that you do get from it
*  It's so like I've I've hunted with a rifle before and it's very satisfying like it's great to eat that meat
*  It's I have to it's great
*  I mean it really is the best meat in the world and any way you can get it is great
*  You know through ethical means yes, but the difference between the way it feels when I'm cooking an elk steak
*  That's from a bow hunt versus something that I shot with a rifle. It's not even comparable
*  Yeah, it's uh, it's something special to
*  Because you're so close to those animals too like yeah, what's a bomber shot with a boat a hundred yards?
*  I've never even attempted something like that. But that's what I mean. Yeah, like that would be ridiculous. That's an offhand shot with a rifle
*  Barely. Yeah, you could probably do it with irons pretty reasonably right a decent rifle shot. Yeah
*  Yeah, if you could line the side people are shooting shit at a thousand yards like yeah
*  It's something special when you close in on an animal and you can hear it eating
*  Right, right. Yeah, you hear it breathing
*  You can hear your heartbeat in your ears
*  And you see its ears twitch when yeah the jar the bow gets drawn back and you're doing that
*  and you're like
*  Yeah, like doing the okay
*  So your first hunt you go on an archery black bear hunt
*  Yeah, so you had zero time Dudley out does he fit in the bow weeks?
*  Yeah, so well, he had me go to Bob's place to Fromm's okay
*  So hats off to Bob from performance for measuring me for that in San Diego and he knew that I was going in there
*  To get measured for dead. So like I let him know ahead of time
*  So he took a lot of time out of the day to help me fit and feel and like this is what this is gonna be like
*  And you know more than happy to help it was great. I show up
*  Dad opens up a case and he's like here it is arrows built bows built. Wow. Oh my god
*  super cool
*  Teaches me how to shoot and then he's like, alright, dude
*  You got four weeks
*  Every day and I'm gonna need to see videos the first whole week
*  That's such a crash course to go from just shooting a bow to four weeks later
*  You're doing a fair chase wild bear hunt. Yeah, that's so crazy and you know what?
*  100% it was duds doing but I
*  Hit both of those bears right in the Boilermaker. Mmm. I saw that I saw that
*  Yeah, I saw the video of it and when you when you were eating those bears, how weird did that feel?
*  It was it was incredible. I so I didn't grow up in a family that hunted
*  Not out of moral or ethical we just you know, I grew up in LA so
*  What am I gonna hunt house cats, right? There's not a lot out here. Yeah pigeons
*  So it felt really cool and for me
*  I immediately fell in love with the entire process
*  The amount of practice it takes how difficult it is what it's like to share that meat with other people. Mmm
*  That's a good question
*  Mmm
*  That's a big one. I i've been giving away so much meat and i'm more than happy to
*  I I really enjoy it
*  Yeah, I do too
*  I try to explain that to people like some of my best enjoyable moments when I get like
*  A text message from someone like my friend. Michael. Yo, I gave him a bunch of meat and he's like dude
*  This is fucking delicious or my friend tom poppa will send me photos of these uh, like elk roast that he cooks
*  Yeah, it's nice. It's phenomenal. Yeah, so to be able to do that that feeling is
*  So hard to describe to somebody with something that
*  Start to finish you're responsible for the entire thing. Yeah
*  Yeah, being a provider. That's a very
*  Underappreciated thing like being able to provide for people and give them something that's like
*  It's it's very intimate when you give someone like a package of meat from something that you shot yourself like hey
*  This is coming to you from montana
*  Like cook it up. Well, yeah, thank you
*  Send me pictures
*  It feels so cool to do it. Yeah, but that's not why i'm i'm just happy that they look at me like this tastes so good
*  Yeah, I know. Yeah, you should do it too. It's something cool about cooking for people too. If you could do that
*  I love I love doing that. I do too
*  It's like cooking for people like you cook a meal like I I do a lot of cooking in my house
*  most of it, I think probably my wife would agree but uh
*  Cooking for like a group of friends and like laying out especially if it's like cooking something that you've killed yourself. It's amazing
*  Yep
*  I've done it a ton of time. You went carnivore for a while, right? You did that carnivore diet about two years ago
*  How long did you do it for? Um, so you were an early adopter almost nine weeks. Yeah
*  Yeah, when did you what what made you bail out of it variety?
*  Uh, not really variety. So I started doing some
*  What what is essentially middle-ish longer distances like marathon length?
*  and I was starting to
*  come back into doing
*  Strength stuff like a lot of dead lifting and some power activities. Mm-hmm. And I just really I wasn't feeling
*  All there like I felt like I could get almost a fifth gear, but it just wasn't in it
*  Right like you needed carbs. Yeah, like a little and i'm talking like apples or something
*  Yeah
*  So I essentially started putting a little bit of carbs in and I still only eat like maybe 100 grams of carbs a day
*  Which is on the bottom end of very little and what kind of carbs you taking in?
*  Uh for the most part so when i'm at home eating how I want to eat, it's mostly white rice
*  Because it's easy to digest super easy to digest. Yeah. Yeah and like whatever is in the vegetables that i'm eating which are mostly root vegetables
*  Mm. Yeah, do you know who uh, zach bitter is I do yeah
*  so zach who holds the world record for the fastest 24 hour run
*  Is uh, he's mostly meat based. Yep. It's mostly what he eats
*  It's really interesting because he he freaks the plant based people out. They get so upset like how?
*  What he's eating their portion too. Yeah, you don't eat it. Oh, he did
*  It's like you're supposed to be getting all these diseases and how you're supposed to be dead supposed to be sick
*  It's it's such a dumb idea that meat is what's causing all these people to be sick. Meanwhile, 97 percent of people eat meat
*  Like or something 95 and the healthiest the healthiest genetic populations are mostly animal protein based
*  Well, there's a few that are not there's a few of these blue zones like in uh, I think it's your belinda
*  There's a it's the seventh day adventists that live out there that only eat uh vegetables
*  That that sounds right. I think that's where the vegan vegetarian
*  Yeah crossover started happening right the thing about those people though is they're also like really active and fit and they don't drink
*  You know, they're so they're their whole lifestyle is very healthy. So it's not just that they're there's a lot of credence to that too
*  Oh, yeah, man
*  I had this guy aubrey de greyanne and he's a a biologist that's working on life extension
*  and uh
*  one of the things that we talked about where
*  It's sort of um underappreciated is community friendship
*  And a lack of stress and people that even when they encounter stress, they don't give a fuck like that
*  There's a real there's a real benefit to not giving a fuck and I think you habituate it too, right?
*  Like you create these habits of oh that stresses me out. Ah, fuck that guy. Oh man. Oh, man
*  Oh man, and you're just piling it up on you know the shelves in your head
*  As opposed to like i'm relatively even cute about a lot of things
*  Yeah, but it took a long time for me to have the ah, whatever that doesn't affect me. Mm-hmm
*  Yeah, it's it's a learned skill. Fuck. Yeah, you gotta practice it too. Yeah, you have to be on top of it all the time
*  Yeah, you really do
*  I mean I would imagine
*  dealing with uh anti-war people
*  has got to be one of the more difficult things to
*  To leave alone like people that I mean
*  I don't know if you've encountered rude people that insult you for your service or that kind of shit
*  I haven't had that specifically online
*  Not really really that's amazing
*  Maybe it's maybe it's just because I try I actively try and avoid that kind of stuff
*  Yeah, because there's there's just no benefit there right like that that person isn't trying to have a discussion
*  They're trying to tell me how it is
*  Yeah
*  Doesn't matter and they're trying to rile you up damn, right? Yeah, and that's gonna make them feel good to rile me up
*  Yeah, i'm already riled up like I don't need that
*  That's fine. I've seen people go at it with people online
*  Like i've seen dakota dakota meyer seen him go at it with people online
*  And I just want to tell him like bro, just get out get out of there. Everybody's brave online
*  Yeah, like it's so easy to tell somebody
*  Like hey, you're a pussy when you're not three feet from you're talking to a guy who killed somebody with a rock
*  Yeah, you know precisely. Yeah, just shut the fuck up. Just seriously
*  You have no idea what you're talking about call that guy a pussy is one of the dumbest things a person could say
*  on this earth in your life
*  he's uh
*  He's such an interesting guy and one of the things that we talked about was that I do my best to try to get guys on
*  That are veterans that have these stories just to try to let just gives people at least another
*  Little piece to the puzzle this never-ending puzzle of what these people are experiencing what people like you and him and all these different people
*  Andy and andy and jaco and everybody else that i've had on that's served and I was saying last night. I'm like
*  I appreciate it like you know
*  It's a thank you from all of us for letting those stories get out
*  And having the kind of open discussion that it allows it's the least I can do it's a fucking great format for it
*  I appreciate you guys so much. Yeah, it's and it's um, I don't think
*  I don't think he gets talked about enough
*  I don't think these stories get out and I mean jaco obviously has him on his podcast quite a bit where he discusses
*  um
*  Different operations and different things that went down and what it's like and loss and you know
*  Yeah, and andy does as well and and there's a there's a shit ton of podcasts now from veterans, which is nice
*  but um, it's just one of those
*  It's it's a necessary part of our culture and our society in order to keep us safe
*  And for whatever reason it doesn't get respected the way it should and it's been part of human history since you know
*  We could throw rocks at each other. Yeah
*  and one of the things that drives me crazy more than anything was um
*  We were doing this benefit when the ufc did a bunch
*  We've done a bunch of fight for the troops events on bases
*  And we did it for the intrepid center for excellence that treats people with traumatic brain injury and we were raising money for them
*  and
*  It was so hard for me during the broadcast
*  To not just start swearing and screaming like how the fuck are we not raising the money?
*  How is this not a thing?
*  Yeah
*  How is this a thing you have to ask for money from people to donate?
*  Yeah, like why you know, I want to find out where the budget is more important than taking care of the veterans when they come home
*  What what's more important who you know, who's getting who's getting all that money?
*  Like where's that money going to where's it being allocated and wasted where it's not being spent on these guys
*  Coming back home dealing with traumatic injuries from serving their country and it's not as if there's a ton of us, right?
*  They're fucking aren't
*  Like there's not that many guys, right? Overall and yeah
*  Regular compared to the what 350 plus million people in the united states is it that many now?
*  We're trying to figure it out. What's the current population? Is it 350?
*  I feel like it was 320 just like a couple of years ago census gets done this year. So they're not counting mexicans
*  So it's no idea
*  It's a semi-census. There's no idea and this is my mexican friend
*  Like like in the like in baseball my mexican friends out there. I don't mean any disrespect
*  I'm with you sneak in do what you got to do. Don't get me wrong live your life
*  But the reality is there's a lot more you motherfuckers here
*  There's a lot more you motherfuckers here than they're they're gonna count especially illegals. They don't they're just guessing
*  Yeah, how many illegal mexicans are here? They gotta be guessing
*  guessing
*  The mexicans probably look at the number like 12. What do you think it is? What do you think it is? Oh, yeah, that's it
*  Eight million in the whole country. Oh, yeah
*  It might be a little less
*  There's 20 million people in the greater los angeles area and there's probably another eight eight million mexicans
*  Like I mean mexican citizens that are here illegal. Yeah. Yeah, probably more
*  There's a lot. I mean you're guessing i'm guessing i'm just guessing i'm just guessing and again
*  Don't get testy if you're mexican. I'm not this is no disrespect
*  I would fucking sneak over here. Tell you that right now if I was living in guadalajara fuck. Yeah, fuck
*  Yeah, dude, fuck some of that stuff going on over the hill. I'd rather be a landscaper
*  Fucking drink beer at eight o'clock fine. I'm good days over kick back relax. No, i'm not being shot at by the cartel
*  Yes, i'm in yeah, i'll take it scariest thing. I got to deal with is like filling my truck up got it
*  Yeah, exactly
*  Yeah, dude. I mean, I I know quite a few people that have made it over here. Yeah through hook or by crook
*  It's gotta be weird to be in mexico and just look over there like damn over there. I could do whatever the fuck I want
*  I'm on this side of the river. I gotta hang out. This is so crazy
*  Damn it. It's weird when there's like a fucking
*  Just a spot and if you get to that other spot things are better, dude
*  and some of it's really crazy like
*  I recently watched a movie called queen of the desert
*  What is that which is about a woman early early 1900s? She was in saudi arabia and kuwait and iraq
*  ended up being
*  friends with uh laurence of arabia
*  And she essentially helped carve out what is now
*  iraq syria
*  Lebanon just like you know, you gotta think after world war one
*  They they picked up a map of the middle east and they're like
*  Um
*  Iraq yeah, okay, they just made lines on a map. Yeah now they they they tried to like
*  Put some of the people groups that were all like, oh, yeah, here's where the south's are here's you know
*  They tried to put all the people groups in the right spot, but a lot of those
*  nations
*  They kind of created
*  at the end of that conflict
*  What's the weirdest place that you here it is right there queen of the desert nicole kidman james franco
*  Robert patinson. Oh
*  Werner hers log movie
*  Who's he's he's the director of my all-time favorite comedy grizzly man
*  It's an accidental comedy. Have you seen that movie?
*  No, you haven't seen grizzly man. I don't think dude is one of the I can't recall one of the best movies
*  I've ever seen is it it's fucking great. It's about timothy treadwell
*  Oh, I know this guy. I know it is like i'm out here saving these bears like bitch. You ain't saving shit. That's an 1800
*  Pound enormous wild dog. You're not saving that thing. He's gonna eat you
*  He's gonna eventually eat you and it was suicide by bear. Yep. That guy was so weird
*  That that movie is really funny, man. It's really fun. I'll have to pull it up. I'm gonna watch it
*  Yeah, dude spark a joint up and watch that movie
*  You you'll be like what the fuck is this guy doing that thing's looking at him right now like look at this snack
*  It just doesn't know that it can eat him. That's all it is. She's figuring it out
*  Yeah, it just doesn't know what it is now. How weird is that? I'm sure i'm sure you've seen it bears
*  In places that have probably not seen humans. Yeah, like the younger ones that look at you like
*  Yeah, what is that weird thing over there?
*  Well, you said you said that you ran into one right we ran into a yeah like a jet black grizzly bear
*  That's so weird. There's black ones. Oh, yeah
*  I've never seen a black one pull a picture of a jet black grizzly bear. They're a thing. Oh, yeah
*  They're they're really light blonde sometimes. Oh, yeah, they're terrifying looking
*  I can imagine it's like a werewolf
*  Yeah, bigger than a werewolf easily. They're so big man. Grizzlies are so big. It's bigger than a horse
*  I was telling you that I only saw one once in the wild
*  Uh that looked at me and it was a small one. It was only like a six foot bear
*  Yeah, but the way that motherfucker looked at me just looked at me like just thinking do I bust a move my
*  It was just hungry and trying to figure out what it's gonna eat just looking through your soul
*  It just lets you know like when you lock eyes with that like right away. It lets you know
*  Like okay. This is what it's like to be a deer. I'm part of the food system
*  Yeah, like that all that thing is doing is looking for someone slipping. Yeah, who's slipping out here? Who's slipping?
*  Is that deer limping? What's that deer about to give birth to a calf? Yep. Oh shit. Let me get close to that fawn
*  Let me pull that moose calf out
*  Yeah, but they're fine. They bears up there eat 50 percent of all the calves and fawns. That's insane
*  Yeah, 50 percent. So if a deer has two babies a bear eats one and then oh my god
*  Yeah crazy and they eat black bears. Yes, they eat other bears
*  Yeah, I was telling you that that my friend Jonathan up there John and my friend John and Jen the rivets
*  They have this place up in Alberta and their son Jonathan
*  Was there when a bear a male bear killed a cub and then the female
*  The mother chased him off the dead cub after he killed it and then she ate it
*  She ate her own cub
*  I mean just meat at that point a little hungry. So but no hesitation. She just ate it dude. They're terrifying. They're terrifying
*  But that's a weird animal that people associate with
*  Cuddliness and warmness and this man little teddy bear dude. How could you kill a bear and they are
*  Fucking tough and terrifying. Yeah, I shot a big bore this last spring and when we got up to that thing
*  He had scars all over his face
*  And bruises when we skinned him. I'm like dude this fucker was just an he just fought another bear
*  Yeah, they went to war. Yeah like a war
*  They're terrifying. Did you find a photo of a black grizzly bear?
*  It's very hard for google to understand what i'm looking for looking for it just wants to give me black bear over
*  The american black bear looks like a grizzly bear, but
*  Okay, I mean I'll show you what i'm finding but they do maybe color phase grizzly bear
*  It was just a black bear. Yeah, did you see that black bear that they shot in new jersey that was 700 pounds last week?
*  What? Yeah. Yeah
*  700 pounds
*  Yeah, the world record but it might not have been last week
*  But the last week was in the in the stories they were talking about this guy they've established
*  It's a world record world record black bear taken with a bow in new jersey
*  New jersey apparently is the highest population of black bears in the entire country in the entire north america
*  Well, there's nothing to jack with them. Yeah. Well, it's not that it is that definitely that but it's also like
*  They're so silly with hunting there. They're so they're weird with their restrictions and they've now changed it
*  The governor stepped in i'm gonna stop the bear hunt. That's good. Let him breed you fucking idiot
*  We need more of those. Yeah, you need let him breed everywhere you dummy. That's what that's what we need
*  It's like a 700 pound raccoon. Look at the pumpkin head on that motherfucker. Oh my god, 700 pounds
*  He shot it with a bow. There's there's photos of him. Jamie where it's him standing next to the thing
*  That's a well, it's on the ground. It's enormous. That's a big the biggest
*  Black bear ever
*  It's the biggest black bear anybody's ever shot with a bow good for you, dude
*  That's a that's a crazy place new jersey because it's really close to new york
*  But it's also like really rural a lot of new jersey
*  It's like forests and woods a lot of the northeast is a kid got killed a couple years back at rutgers
*  By a bear
*  Him and his buddies went. Um, how scary would that be? Yeah, I know you're in college
*  Yeah, like i'm just gonna go with my friends. We're gonna go for a little hike love nature
*  Oh my lord, oh the size of that fucking holy shit. It literally is like a it's like a grizzly the mitt on that thing. Yeah
*  700 pounds is so large. I've never even seen i've seen one that's 500
*  That board that I shot we think was somewhere in the mid-low threes
*  And he was huge. There it is. There's a photo of it. Holy shit. Yeah, it's like a grizzly. Yeah
*  That's so big man. What are like the main differences like the face size and yeah face size and shape
*  Uh, great behave gris has like a big hump on their shoulders and they're pissed off at the universe
*  Yeah
*  Like when you always when you see them apparently and I said like I said i've only seen one live
*  In the in the woods and it was about six feet so it wasn't that big
*  For it was probably a baby really probably only a couple years old
*  but
*  My friend john says that what happens is like the black bears come in real slow and gentle
*  And they're looking around and they want to make sure there's no grizzlies around the grizzlies coming
*  They just start knocking shit down and making they make all the noise in the fucking world
*  They don't give a shit that bear that we saw that was tracking us while we were tracking that black bear
*  Did exactly that the second I looked over because he like made a tiny tiny bit in the tiniest bit of noise
*  And we were you know tracking this other bear so we're listening real close
*  And I hear this thing and I look over and it does exactly that see as we see it
*  Stomps on the ground and just starts knocking shit over and pounds off making a shit ton of noise
*  Dude, how big was it? It was wasn't big
*  Probably like, you know six seven like it was not a huge but it's the thing about it's a grizzly bear attitude
*  Dude, the thing was pissed off. We saw it
*  Wasn't even it was just pissed. We saw it
*  Yeah, they don't eat, you know
*  They don't they don't eat if they don't get aggressive like they have to he's gotta be the king
*  And also he's probably trying to eat your bear, right? Oh he did he did eat it. Oh, yeah left it
*  Yeah, we left it. We we abandoned the search
*  Because that's not worth the guy more power to it like ashley. I've hunted with him now a couple times
*  He's like, yeah, um, I think that he got that bear we went back until dud
*  he's like you really think you got it real good and that's when we ended up seeing the bear it was when we
*  went back the second time to
*  And he's like, I don't know man. Like yeah, this isn't worth it. You have your 7mm with four rounds and I have my bow
*  Yeah, let's not play this game in a bunch of deadfall with a grizzly bear
*  Yeah, make sure you definitely kill it how fast are you dog? Oh god
*  Oh my god, I saw a video once of a bear charging this guy
*  Yeah, and he literally shoots it at the tip of the rifle. Oh my god
*  The head is where you are and he shoots it like this boom
*  And it brains it and it goes face plants and slides in towards him
*  So I asked ashley i'm like what are we gonna do if we run into this thing and he goes well
*  It'll probably bluff charge us
*  And then it'll really charge us maybe oh my god
*  So well, when do we shoot it and he goes well if the ears are pinned back that means it's for real
*  Don't miss
*  Like oh my fucking lord. Jesus christ. Yeah, but
*  As part of the whole like hunting experience and you know providing the meat and doing the whole thing. It's part of the thing. Yeah, it's
*  damn terrifying
*  but it's part of the process where you're like
*  No, we really are just
*  You know walking jelly donuts
*  That are out here
*  Hunting other things. Yeah. Yeah, we're walking water balloons. I just have sharp sticks like yeah real cool
*  Especially when you see a grizzly bear. Oh god, it's just it's with the the cool thing about it is
*  I mean you definitely don't want them to not be there same with wolves and with mountain lions
*  It's hard for people to understand like the cool thing is
*  It there's part of it being in that country. Yeah, that's part of what's exciting about it
*  When you're in montana part of what's exciting is you might run into a grizzly bear. You might see a wolf
*  I don't know, you know, it's like woo to say it but it does feel like your genetics are lit off
*  Yes, you know when you see that stuff or like I was
*  I was mushing dogs with a buddy of mine up in alaska last month
*  And oh normal shit just much
*  He's he's
*  Wild he and I were in buzz together. So he has like a real sled for real. Yeah, he races
*  Whoa, he's a cool dude. Wow, jeff at frozen trident
*  Wow, that's crazy. Um
*  We've heard dogs out while mushing
*  Wolves howling and it lights off your genetics like you're out there mushing dogs in the snow and you hear these howls and you're like, okay
*  I've heard wolves in bc. It's wild right i've heard them in the distance never heard them up close, but in the distance you're
*  Yeah
*  That's a weird sound
*  I want to hear it real loud. You know, i'd love to hear it real loud up close. Yeah, it's
*  They're all amazing grizzly bears mountain lions all those apex predators, yeah
*  So your first one was in bc your first hunt was in bc with dudley. Yeah, how far was the shot 22 yards?
*  Oh, that's nice. Yeah, that's good to keep it tight
*  Yeah, I mean it took us a couple days and then I stocked up on one. Um, I actually ended up taking a shot from my knees
*  Because there was like a gap in the in the bush that the bear was on the other side of
*  Yeah
*  Bear did not know I was there. Did you guys cook the bear that night? Um
*  I think we might have had some that night. I think we had some like uh fajitas or something that night
*  Oh, wow bear fajita. Yeah dudley
*  Shot, I don't know if it was the same year, but he told me that they shot some bears that were eating onions
*  And that was that year was it? Yeah, he cooked it with wild onions. We went up and picked a crap ton of onions
*  Why are there onions up there? I don't know. It's a whole hill covered in like wild onions
*  They're like this size
*  I think there was something that he was saying that someone actually planted them there at one point in time then they became wild
*  Huh? That would make sense. Yeah, like a homesteader
*  so what the the experience of you going up there and
*  Doing a spot in stock, which is one of the hardest kind of hunts to do
*  Like we were and while you were doing this you're like what the fuck is happening like four weeks ago
*  I never even had a bow now here I am
*  In the woods with a couple hundred pound predatory animal. Yeah on the other end of a sharp stick
*  Yeah
*  it was uh
*  It was super intense
*  And I loved every second of it like
*  it was lighting off all the pieces of shit that I
*  felt that was going on when I was a team guy
*  And it was lighting off things that I didn't think were getting lit off in my brain, you know, like way deep down
*  The consequences and
*  The experience all of it
*  You know you you can hear your heartbeat
*  It's fucking wild. Yeah, and for a bear to be the first thing i'm taking with a bow
*  I'm like, I cannot jack this up. Yeah
*  There is no missing here. There's some severe consequences. Yeah
*  Let alone I would feel like dogshit if I right wounded this thing
*  Because I chose to practice
*  As much as I did which was a shit ton
*  And still screw it up, right? You know, I was
*  Elated when I hammered that thing and ashley's like all right, man. Let's let's wait a little bit and like make sure it expires
*  Did you hear the death bone? No, no
*  Because we went into the bush like 15 20 minutes after to let it expire
*  He's like, all right. Yeah, let's go track this thing and he pushes through the bushes. He's like never mind. It's right there
*  I went right through the heart like double long end heart. So it didn't even there's nothing there
*  Oh, wow, it made it when I shot it because it was exhaling already
*  Oh, so there was nothing for it to moan
*  The death one's weird. I heard the boar this year do it. It's weird. Oh, man
*  Yeah, it makes you realize how real it is
*  Yeah, because it's that predators have a different response to being hit than a prey animal does. Yeah, they don't they don't run off
*  Yeah, trying to freak out right they're not trying to get away
*  No, they're trying to attack whatever bit them trying to maneuver. Yeah, they're maneuvering on you
*  Yeah, they're rolling and trying to get to the arrow trying to figure out what's happening
*  And then and then they're like fighting it off as they die. Yeah
*  When you first ate it so you shoot it and then there you are eating it. Did you guys eat it camp?
*  Yeah, yeah, they're at bear camp. What were you like? Holy shit. What am I doing here? This is wild
*  Pretty wild
*  I feel like holy shit. What am I doing here? This is wild pretty much
*  And then knowing I still have another bear tag. Yeah. Well, they have to shoot as many as they can up there, right?
*  It's out of control. There's so many pairs. Yeah bc's crazy like that and then they've outlawed the grizzly season
*  Yeah
*  Some strange reason the people that I know that live up there like my friend mike hawkridge. He lives up there
*  It's like he'll tell you like there are so many grizzlies up there. It's scary and the fact that they can't hunt them now
*  It's like these people in the city that have no idea what it's like. They've never been to the bush
*  Yeah, and then you know, they think big brown cuddly. Yeah. Yeah. Well, these are amazing majestic animals
*  Yeah that eat their own babies. They are they're that and anything else inside. It's a garbage disposal
*  The cleanup crew. Yeah, cleanup crew
*  So that was your first hunt. Yep. So how hooked were you hunt all in immediate like beyond immediately hooked?
*  And how many hunts you're planning a year now as many as I can reasonably think that I can eat the meat and do
*  Dude, you shot one of the biggest moose i've ever seen in my life
*  And the fact you did that like what a year and a half into bow hunting
*  Yeah, I ended up shooting that moose with a rifle
*  Oh, did you we were bow hunting and we were so the story ends up being kind of neat
*  Because of the size of that damn thing. It's the only reason it had to be with a rifle because it was so big
*  That so we called him in and called him in and called him in for like 40 minutes and the guide ashley again
*  He's like, you know, I can hear it can hear it and moose make the fucking weirdest noise
*  I'm like, yeah, okay. I can hear that and we got to the edge of a little lake
*  It was about 200 yards wide but it was like a quarter mile long
*  With a bog all the way around the whole thing
*  We get down to this lake. He's calling he's doing it
*  Like the horny female
*  And this fucker comes out of the bush like three or four hundred yards away from us on the other side of the lake
*  Ashley's got his binos up and he goes jesus christ. It's the biggest moose i've ever seen
*  I'm like, oh thanks. Okay. Yeah
*  And I see him and he gets to the edge of the lake and we called him for like a half an hour
*  He just kept waving his antlers at us
*  Doing the yeah bitch come over here, right bitch come over here. Also. It's probably met a person or two by then
*  At that size, yeah, he was huge and they think he was about 10
*  Um, so he kept doing that kept doing that kept doing that and i'm like dude
*  I really want to get him with a bow
*  Can we please try and get him to swim across because there's no way we're gonna be able to get around right for him
*  And me to get a shot just wasn't gonna happen in that bog
*  And we never would have seen that guy again. It had already been three and a half days of hunting
*  Had only seen one animal
*  And he's like hey man, you can use the rifle if you want to do it and
*  Credit to the amount of training that we go through
*  I grabbed that thing and i'm like, all right, dude. Well if that moose hops in the water
*  I'm handing you this damn rifle and i'm gonna shoot it with bow
*  But if he turns broadside and tries to walk around the lake, it's gonna take till night time, which it was getting towards twilight
*  I'm gonna hammer him
*  And that thing turned broadside to walk around the lake and I hammered him
*  Yeah, that's the move you have to it's
*  I really wanted the meat. Yeah, I badly I he could have had no pot like he could have had the tiniest little paddles wouldn't have cared
*  It was just bonus and everybody there was like, I can't believe he's only been hunting for a year you asshole. It's pretty crazy
*  What let me uh go to uh thompson was it thompson underscore parasports? I meant so I changed
*  Trevor dot p dot thompson. Oh you train when did you change it? Uh recently. Oh, it's like, you know
*  I'm just gonna flatten this out and then does all the old followers follow with you?
*  How did you do that? How do you do that? Just change the name you can just edit your name. Mm-hmm
*  Yeah, you just have to find out if it's available. Is that what it is? And then you keep all the same. Yep
*  Oh, wow, I was like, yeah, that is I didn't know that so
*  You have a photo of that thing up there, right? I believe i'm on jamesy
*  Dudley definitely has it dudley definitely got this beautiful grid set up on instagram. So
*  These aren't really individual photos
*  What's that? He's got this cool. Oh, you're doing this that crazy thing. Yeah. Yeah. How do you do that?
*  It's got upload multiple. Yeah, though. There's an app that does that you gotta keep the way
*  You got upload three every time now though. Oh, so you gotta keep it gets a little silly. Oh, that's pretty cool
*  Man looks really good
*  So if you scroll down jamie, they wanted me cutting up that moose meat like the tomahawk steaks
*  See that
*  Dude, you have like an artist's instagram page. This is not like a okay done keep going
*  Others
*  Yep
*  Right over here. Oh, i'll keep going just a little bit right there. So hit that one and then scroll over
*  And there he is. Wow
*  That thing is so big. How much do you think that thing weighed? So they they guessed he was like 1500
*  1500 because I pulled so I butchered the whole thing and I pulled about 500 pounds of meat off of him
*  Damn
*  God damn you guys must have ate that the entire time we were there
*  We killed we killed what three meals three four mousse
*  Wow, so we had a lot of moose in camp fucking delicious though. Oh my god
*  It's so delicious the most incredible meat jamie go back to the the the photo grid
*  And scroll back up
*  Hold on. Stop scroll down again. What did I want to say? Keep going. Keep going. Keep going
*  Yeah, that's the start of it there. All right, we'll go back up then there was something that I
*  God damn, I don't remember. I wanted to ask you a question about something
*  No, no forget it it's too hard when someone's scrolling you like stop
*  Go back. No back up. Yeah, I forget what it was
*  So when you when when you guys were there like how deep in the woods were you?
*  um
*  Miles and miles from the nearest real road. Did you guys get in with rangers or did you yeah, uh,
*  So I can they called sidekicks, right? Yeah
*  And so how did you get how'd you get all the meat out on those things? Oh man, that was an adventure
*  so
*  We get we get around the lake which totally solidified me being happy about shooting him with a rifle
*  Um because it took us almost an hour to get around the lake
*  To where he was dead and that was us just hoofing it like hard
*  Not worried about anything that's out there
*  And uh, we got him gutted and then we ended up leaving him overnight because it was about to be dark and it was cold
*  out real cold
*  Came back the next day
*  cut him in half
*  Went and got a canoe
*  Canoed each half across the lake
*  Individually, wow and then drug him up the hill with the help of a atv
*  and dudley and dusty
*  And ashley
*  It was like a 14-hour day of recovering that moose and john's mousse. Jesus christ. It was insane
*  There's such big animals. You don't
*  It's hard to understand how big they are until you get one
*  Quartered and it's still 150 to 200 pounds. Yeah, when you see it on the ground, that's when you realize like, whoa
*  I could crawl inside the thing like a tonton
*  And did you get a commercial freezer so you could yeah keep 14 cubic footer
*  Oh, okay. Yeah, big ass one. Oh, yeah. Yeah, just filled them up. So that's mostly what you eat
*  Just moose right now moose elk white tail javelina. I have all sorts of stuff in there
*  Do you feel different when you eat that kind of food? Absolutely. I've never felt better in my life
*  There's something to that right? It's not just psychological. It's not just voodoo
*  No, if it's the you are what you eat type of thing
*  that is an athlete that is the product of other athletes that have survived being eaten killed and
*  Destroyed by weather and you get to kill it and eat it and it's so fresh
*  and if you're choosing to eat really well
*  Along with it like white rice and and root vegetables or however, you're doing it
*  Man, do you feel good eating that? It's an athlete
*  Yeah, that's how I always refer to it. I say it's like eating a giant lebron james like a super athlete
*  Yeah, it is a super athlete
*  Yeah
*  like if if an animal was a predator of human beings looking for the best human beings to eat it would probably want to eat like
*  Giant nfl players or a ufc fighter or you know what I mean?
*  They'd want to eat brock lesnar like look at that fucking delish. It looks delicious. Look at him. Look at his neck
*  Maybe that's why that grizzly bear was looking at you so hard probably
*  You look good get a snack out of that motherfucker
*  Yeah, it's um
*  It's hard to describe to people it's hard to describe to people what it feels like to
*  Just dip your foot into the food chain for a little bit and come back with something and then to think about it all the time
*  Like andy said it best he's like it's like I have a pin
*  In every september they're like there's a pin on september like get ready for september because here it comes
*  And when that when that month comes around for us the big one's elk hunting and when that comes around you're in the mountains
*  It's hard to contain your excitement. You're like, holy shit. It's happening again
*  Yeah, there's all these different emotions like make sure you do it right make sure you play the wind right make sure you don't get
*  Busted gear checks. Yeah, make sure your your arrows are shooting. Well, make sure you're you're thinking about your release perfectly
*  You're doing it and you're using a silverback, right? I am that's the only thing i've ever hunted with
*  They're great, dude. Yeah, they're legit. Yeah, I shot um
*  Everything over the last two years i've shot with a silverback
*  Yeah, no reason not to right well, it's just the best way it's it eliminates a whole idea of like not punching the trigger
*  And not thinking about it. You don't have to think about it doesn't doesn't exist just pull you just go through your sequence
*  Yeah, like we were talking about last night. You just do your steps say your mantra
*  Do you have a mantra that you uh say when you draw back your bow? Not really but I I do
*  I do walk myself through the steps how i've described them to myself after duds described them, you know, like
*  Okay, the hands at the stop sign get a nice relaxed arm a little slight bend in the elbow, you know
*  Like your shoulder down. Okay pull back and pull the tension feel the tension. There's a wall
*  Let it center let it flow pull pull boom right. Yeah
*  Uh, I was telling you about this guy joel turner who does this. Uh, it's um
*  It's I think his website he changed it. It used to be iron mine hunting and now it's like shot iq
*  Um, and he just he's a guy who trained people he trained, uh swat team members
*  And a big part of being able to keep your shit together when things get western is that you have to be able to
*  Keep your system
*  In in a conscious state. Yeah, don't don't let instincts happen and everything just go wild
*  You want to I always forget this is it open loop or closed loop? I think a closed closed loop
*  is
*  when
*  You're thinking about it and you have control over it versus an open loop
*  Is when it's like swinging a baseball bat does that make sense sounds right? I don't want I want to make sure that i'm right
*  See if you can google that but they teach us the same stuff in the teams. Yeah, like shooting
*  I've taught combat shooting
*  In the past too closed loop thinking versus open looper sees the immediate result and upon achieving the result wanders off to find something else
*  Closed looper sees not only the result but the effect on oh, this is different
*  now, um
*  But like i've taught combat rifle and pistol go to us
*  Shot iq.com
*  You've caught you say that again i've taught that combat rifle and pistol along with other people and
*  It is exactly like that. That's the kind of stuff we teach. What do you teach?
*  Like what is the the process of keeping your shit together it's different for every weapon system
*  But it's the exact same as like you just said with a bow or I just said with a bow you talk yourself through
*  The steps out loud and it doesn't let all the outside
*  bullshit
*  Get in the way of pulling the trigger the right way, right?
*  Yeah, that if you can
*  Actually have a communication line with yourself while it's happening. Yeah, it keeps you in the present moment
*  You're utilizing the equipment it's not
*  In charge of you. Yes. Yes
*  It's weird how all that fucking goes wild on you. Oh my god. You see people do some wazoo shit
*  Oh, yeah, they lose control. They lose control. It's hard to keep control
*  you know to to be able to
*  Maintain the discipline to keep that mantra in your head and not just go on instinct too. It's very important
*  it's hard to expect people to do that though, you know, like
*  I say that when I've helped people learn how to base jump like
*  You need to be focused on what you're doing
*  Because you're in charge of all the actions like this isn't happening to you
*  You've chosen to let this happen
*  Right. It's the same thing with shooting a gun
*  throwing a bow
*  They're all very similar or like you were saying like doing a kick, right? Yeah and not letting rogue elements become part of the process
*  Mm. Yeah
*  Yeah, it's um
*  It's a weird thing that your mind does where your mind just wants to spaz out like it's yeah
*  It's a weird reaction to stress and adrenaline and all these different things
*  All these different factors. Are you trying to calculate all at once go full on bananas people lose their shit
*  I can only imagine what it's like in combat
*  Yeah, that's a different level beyond yeah
*  It is so what are you telling them to think of when you're telling them like when you're teaching combat
*  Pistols and you're teaching them how to utilize a pistol. Mm-hmm. What do you what?
*  What is the process of like I try and break stuff down as simple as possible so that it's
*  easy steps for people to talk through to create a habit so that you're
*  Using it as a subconscious effort, right?
*  Subconscious effort right like I want you to be able to draw and fire that pistol or shoulder and fire the rifle
*  um
*  In a way that you're almost not thinking through
*  Once you become very proficient at the shooting
*  So that your brain can stay open to all the other pertinent shit that's going on all the scary crap that's happening out there
*  Right, so it becomes an automatic movement. You want it to be like that. You want it to be an automatic movement
*  And there's guys out there with a shit ton more combat time and a shit ton
*  More teaching experience that say the exact same thing and they say it because it works
*  Because there's not time to screw around
*  with having to think through the process
*  It's similar to how you're drawing a bow and hunting right? Do you have time to really think through it all?
*  Not with an animal walking out in front of you. No, you have to have had that stuff. It's got to be down
*  Yeah, yeah super dialed
*  so
*  With pistol and rifle it's the same way like i'm gonna break that down so simple
*  And we can only handle so much information
*  So i'll break it down real simple and then feed you
*  more pieces
*  Individually as they come up
*  Now how much in the military?
*  How much time do they spend?
*  Instructing or coaching people on how to how to think
*  During intense and stressful situations. So they like combat. They started to do more of that when I was in buds
*  So it's a fairly recent thing relatively recent
*  And I know they do more now and what they're trying to do is get people to make sure that they can
*  Understand what they're doing
*  And perform under the pressure, right?
*  And a lot of the a lot of the training and a lot of the selection weeds out people that can't
*  Put stress and information into the same
*  Lane of traffic. Mm-hmm. Right. All right. Okay, so that's what a lot of what buds is. Yeah
*  Yeah, a lot of buds and sqt and then further on in the teams like every day you're earning your trident is what they say
*  You can always lose it
*  so
*  What they're what they're saying is like it's all a process but they've been they're weeding people out that can't handle that sort of shit
*  Yeah
*  And so is this something that they've written books on are there manuals on this and like or is this just something that's understood and known?
*  I don't remember there being manuals on this
*  For me when I was in like psychological stuff. Mm-hmm. We did have some guys come in and talk to us
*  um
*  And then what kind of advice would they give you?
*  Oh god
*  You know, I don't particularly remember exactly what the advice was like word for word
*  But I do remember it being like follow your training, you know, we're training you the right way
*  And it's not the do as you're told it's do what you know how to do right and you'll do it well
*  And is
*  a lot of being able to perform in combat in these situations that are
*  Insanely stressful and to be able to manage information and stress at the same time is a lot of that just learned by experience
*  I think so
*  What was it like for you
*  Being overseas or the whole process? Yeah
*  Well, I was
*  One of the youngest guys there because I was augmenting meaning I was an extra person
*  Um, I volunteered to go
*  Asked to go
*  so I was
*  open ears open eyes and closed mouth
*  For four months
*  Like these dudes that are over there have been had been doing it for a long time at that point
*  Because I was there in 2011
*  and 12
*  And it's all
*  A process that is fatally
*  consequential
*  And I knew that so you're like i'm just gonna shut up and fucking listen
*  Or shut up and watch that's wise
*  It's fucking terrifying is why it's not necessarily being wise like you're just I don't want to die
*  Yeah, like that dude's stepping over there for a reason, you know, he's not leaning against that wall for a reason
*  He's doing this for a reason. He's got his gear set up like that for
*  It's not for fun. You know, they're not over there airsofting
*  It's fucking for real
*  so
*  You ask questions
*  and the best thing that i've
*  Been able to get from the teams
*  Which was super evident there is you learn how to learn?
*  You know you learn how to be a student a good one
*  Because if you're not
*  There's a good chance you could die
*  A lot of guys have died overseas
*  And a lot of guys have died in training
*  Still doing the right thing
*  Yeah, we were talking last night about a guy who died in training
*  Yeah, we're saying the guy who drowned and they never found his body. Yeah, matt leathers. So that anniversary was actually on the 19th
*  seven years
*  I think people need to understand how difficult that training is that people get lost doing that all the time. Yeah
*  Or are lost are lost
*  We had diving injuries at the team and there was no negligence
*  You know, we weren't we weren't doing things incorrectly
*  It's just stuff that's we're doing very dangerous shit. Yeah
*  very dangerous
*  from skydiving with gear
*  To diving really deep for a long time
*  to shooting exercises
*  Now you compound that and put them all together and do it overseas with somebody else out there that's hunting you
*  How do they mitigate when you go overseas the effect of being over there too long
*  Because I would I would imagine that the stress
*  of constant combat first
*  So this is my ignorance of it
*  But this is what I would think was that what happens first is probably like you get better at being
*  Calm and more accustomed to it, but after a while the pressure
*  Eventually starts to crack you that it did just many many many months over there dealing with it
*  You have to you have to decompress you do
*  And they have like decompression windows at the end of
*  Deployments how much would it look like a typical deployment? How long does it last?
*  So I was over there for four months, and they do everything from or they've done everything from three months to 13 plus
*  For special operations guys
*  And the reason being they do the shorter ones is because of the operation tempo
*  You're doing so much and you're doing it so quickly and they want you to be fresh and they want you to be good at it
*  Because they don't want that stress to happen, right?
*  What is that like this the stress like what how does it affect people because I mean I would assume it affects everyone differently
*  Oh, yeah, the but the process of being in harm's way consistently for a long term
*  I I joke about it making everybody professionally paranoid
*  Hmm, like you're always like i'm not always wound up, but i'm always on some sort of alert for
*  Things yeah, you know i'm always like i'm always thinking about stuff. I'm always keyed on to
*  What's that guy doing? Why is he doing that? Right?
*  In a way that I don't I I don't know why that's there
*  I mean, I know why but I don't know what part of my brain is saying what the fuck is that guy doing?
*  Is that hard to let go in civilian life or is it just there forever now? I think it's there
*  Well, I think it's there forever. I can't I don't know. It's still there. Do you ever see jocos video?
*  He does that. He did a video recently where uh, he's like people were saying why you looking over your shoulder doctor?
*  He goes i'm being tactical
*  Because i'm checking my flanks
*  Yeah, he's like why are you always in the dark and he goes so the enemy can't see me
*  How can we not smile? I don't want them to see my teeth
*  That guy yeah is hilarious. He's the best he is I love that guy to death dude. He's so great
*  He's such an important person too because he's both articulate and savage. He's both
*  a brilliant guy who is wise and humble and but also
*  A fucking gorilla. He's a legit savage. Yeah, uh, I had the chance to
*  Roll a little bit with him. Oh, don't do that. I would tell you how to do that. It was with andy and dud
*  Uh-huh and uh, was that when he broke dud's neck? Yeah
*  Yeah, terrifying broke a bone in his neck
*  John thought he had throat cancer. He did went to the doctor didn't want to tell anybody like yeah
*  What happened to you? I'm like, oh, it's fucking gorillas put me in a guillotine snap my neck big white gorilla
*  Was I don't think he actually did a guillotine. I think he actually was he had his knuckle
*  In in john's throat doing something
*  I think I want to say john that sounds right. I think john had him in full guard
*  That didn't know how to tap exactly. He just was like going. Yeah, I think john had him in full guard
*  I might be fucking this up and jaco
*  Put his knuckles into john's neck and was like using a neck crank
*  Compressing his neck from like either the guard or maybe even side control and then had a knuckle in the throat
*  I remember I think popped a bone. I think it was from the guard
*  Yeah, I think I was about like from me to you to this going on. He broke a bone in his neck
*  Well, he's a gorilla yeah big hairless gorilla. Yeah, you can't how much do you weigh 165? You can't roll with that guy
*  It's not don't do that. What was it like but I can run away from him. Yes, just wait for me
*  He doesn't run at all. No
*  It's terrifying he'll just march after it was uh, it was like I was
*  Wrestling around with a sweaty piece of mahogany
*  Yeah, big guys that are skilled that's so humiliating
*  Yeah, a big guy that's skillful
*  Oh god, i've and i've had that happen once in the past like the I think i'm cool
*  And then you find out you're not because i'm not a big dude, right like a buddy of mine played uh,
*  Played I think o line at stanford and I came home from a deployment and I'm like I got a little blitzed
*  I was like screwing around. I'm like ha ha ha ha at the time. I was like 175 and he picked me up from under the arms
*  And he's like you're real strong for your size and puts me down. I'm like, oh god
*  I feel so emasculated
*  You're real strong for your size. Is it your fucking weird compliment? He was like he's like 300 pounds
*  Yeah, you know like six five. I'm like, oh crap. Those are huge humans. That's giant. I want you to do jiu-jitsu
*  I don't you don't so you just did that one time with him did it the one time with him. Well, that's ridiculous
*  He's a fucking multiple year black belt. Hey, thanks. Andy. Yeah, and he's crazy
*  And he's obsessed he does jiu-jitsu five days a week now. That's when we were teaching uh, the sky dive
*  Oh, jesus christ, everybody's trying to die
*  You're trying to get interesting old
*  Totally trying to get his neck broken. You guys are skydiving. Why is it that so many?
*  Team guys wind up getting into skydiving base jumping
*  Parasuits, what is that? Is that what it is? I fucking love it. Is it there's a thing? I mean
*  I don't want to speak for you, but
*  Some men have
*  the the the highs and the thrills of that stuff of base jumping and
*  What is it that's so attractive about that? I don't know as much of if it's the thrill
*  As the thrill combined with the enormous amount of mental effort
*  And cognitive load that's going on
*  And focus because you know the consequences fuck. Yeah. Mm
*  Like if you're on the edge of a cliff in a wingsuit
*  There's so much shit that can go wrong between the second you push off that thing and you can't turn around
*  To the 60-ish seconds that it takes to get to the ground
*  That has killed a lot of people a lot of people a lot of people
*  Yeah, how many times you wingsuit jump a couple hundred base jumps and I have about 700 base jumps. Whoa
*  Oh
*  Is that a good thing for
*  Veterans when they come back as well just to give them something that
*  Allows them to feel that edge again. I would never
*  Suggest somebody learned a base jump really fuck. No, I don't even call it a sport. I call it a life choice
*  So you only want people to do it that are drawn to it
*  Yeah
*  If you're a person that is so willing to do that thing that you will do anything it takes to make it happen and go around
*  Me to learn how to do it
*  Okay
*  That okay
*  But i'm not gonna be like this is a great choice for you. Yeah. Oh don't go to therapy. You should jump off the cliff
*  How much can therapy help veterans? I always feel like
*  I always feel like
*  You either have the ability to handle shit
*  Or you don't and then they can help you if you have the ability to handle shit. I agree
*  Does that make is that it does it's a it's a our
*  Arrogant assumption on my part from no experience. But the way i'm thinking of it. It's like
*  the amount of
*  Wrestling that must be done in your mind going from combat deployment to regular society
*  And seeing the the petty bullshit that people think of
*  As being like life or death or real real issues that need screaming and fighting and you're like you fucking babies
*  yeah, no and you see that a lot with guys that come back is they're just like
*  The fuck is wrong with you. Yeah, is this really worth it? Right?
*  And but I do think that therapy of some type
*  archery
*  technical shooting
*  base jumping
*  jujitsu
*  There are things that you can take up that I think help guys unpack a ties
*  Like undo all of the shit that's in their head. Mm-hmm
*  You don't have to go to a therapist and talk
*  It doesn't happen. That's not necessarily the best thing for everybody
*  There's a weird thing about the mind right where it has to be active. Yeah, you have to give your mind tasks. Oh, yeah
*  like
*  Even meditating isn't being taskless, right? Right, right. You're focusing on focusing. Yes. There's something there
*  There's something going on. Yeah that gray matter is doing some work
*  You got to get the engine turning
*  Yeah, it's
*  And also it's like for people that have experienced
*  Combat deployments and then they come back to regular life
*  It's almost like your body's accustomed to a certain level of stress and now it's not there anymore
*  So it might start creating it on its own or looking for it when it's not there
*  Oh, yeah
*  And I think and he's joked about it. I have no idea. I haven't been tested nor has he if I know but
*  You know, so many of us are like adrenal fatigued
*  Because we're just wound the fuck up. Yeah at fifth gear for years, right?
*  Is that real adrenal fatigue? I think so
*  Yeah, you know what? I mean a lot of guys are very just like meh about so much
*  Right, and I don't think that that's because they don't care. I think it's because their their hormones are out of whack
*  That makes sense. Well, there's also a lot of guys whose hormones are out of whack, you know from ieds and from oh man
*  blowing down doors
*  I've been thumped enough where like I've felt my teeth, you know
*  I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to be able to feel your teeth. Yeah
*  Jesus christ
*  Well, so many guys who get back have hormone issues too because
*  pituitary gland damage from chronic brain trauma
*  I'm not surprised. Yeah, and that stuff that really needs to be addressed and that's the kind of stuff like you were saying for the charity for
*  the
*  Traumatic brain injury. Mm-hmm. That's shit that needs to get looked at. Yeah, we need to be doing preventative work
*  Yes, like ahead of time. Yes, and then monitoring people
*  Making sure that they're okay because that stuff is degenerative and people need to know that that's out there
*  And it can be helped. Is it hard sometimes for uh veterans to ask for help?
*  I think so because they just feel like maybe asking shows a weakness or maybe they're just
*  It's just too difficult to reach out
*  I think I think it's too difficult to reach out and I don't want to be the problem or there must be guys that
*  Are worse than me. I think it's usually that it's not necessarily the the fully inflated ego of i'm just gonna be a hard ass about this
*  Which there is you know, that's out there, but I think it's a lot of guys that are like
*  Now there's probably somebody worse than me. Right? So if you come home and you're not
*  Traumatically injured right? We didn't have legs blown off or arm blowing off. You feel like you're lucky. So you feel
*  Maybe like you shouldn't be asking for help other people need help more like I don't need that seat at the table
*  Let me go find somebody else for it
*  That the lack of support when veterans return is really disturbing like the idea that there's so much emphasis put into training
*  There's so much emphasis put into arming and making sure that everybody's geared up. You're a multi-million dollar machine
*  Yeah, but then when you get back they don't have a use for anymore. You're a used tire
*  Fuck
*  Now it's getting better and a lot of the outside groups do a really good job
*  But it's tough to realize that there's outside groups that are doing that job
*  Yes, well a lot of it's guys like what's the fed doing right? Right? Thanks guys
*  It's almost like there's no pressure on them to to resolve some of these issues or to help
*  Help
*  When you come back is there any coaching do they they give you any sort of they do I didn't end up
*  Going to any of that
*  And they always tell you hey if you need to talk to somebody there are people to talk to
*  And are the people that you talk to are they psychologists or are they combat veterans as well? They're psychologists
*  Which I think is a good thing. It's a good thing to talk to psychologists. I think so are any of those guys veterans themselves? They're
*  From my recollection. They're all in the military. They're all in the military, but are they all did they experience action? I'm not sure
*  I don't want to say out like offhand without knowing for certain
*  Um, I didn't end up talking to any of them. So, I don't know
*  Do you like is this something that you discuss with team leaders or like guys who've been who have deployed never turned?
*  Is this like a common thing where you go? Hey, um, you know, what's it like when you get back?
*  Is it how how hard is it to transition to normal everyday life and keep your shit together?
*  And what are the tools that you use to try to maintain? I think unfortunately, that's the stuff that's getting talked about now
*  Just now. Yeah. Yeah, and more recently
*  because so many I mean it makes sense
*  Are you gonna like
*  Like with fighters, right? Do they ask each other? How do you recover after a fight now? It's
*  How do you prep for it? Yeah, make sure you win, right? Because that's all we care about we're looking at front end, right?
*  Front end and action front end action front end action. How do I train? How do I mitigate all the risk?
*  How do I make sure that my buddy isn't the one that's killed because I fuck up
*  Right, right. Yeah, so
*  If that's what we're concerned about nobody gives two crap about what's going on in the back end
*  Because you're just gonna rinse wash repeat that cycle
*  Right until you're done. Do you see hurt locker? I i've seen parts of it. What did you think about it?
*  It's a little dramatic. Is it a little fake a little fake damn
*  It seems good a little fake a little fake a little bit
*  But the idea that someone could be addicted to the action when they want to return
*  Even when they they think they're done and they're they're drawn to go back again
*  Yeah, I think there's action junkies not necessarily combat junkies
*  But like stress junkies. Yeah, I mean I see it in base jumping too. Oh, i'm sure you know, and you see it in skydiving
*  People that are just addicted to the feeling of the entire experience
*  Of the entire experience not the adrenaline because I don't
*  I don't get a huge adrenaline dump from base jumping. Do you keep it calm pretty calm?
*  Because if the adrenaline dump is happening, you're probably fucked
*  Yeah, yeah, because you're gonna do you're gonna be swinging the baseball bat around. That's what alex honnold said about um,
*  Uh free solo climbing. Yeah, he's like it's very mellow. It is he's like when
*  If i'm if my heart is beating fast i'm already fucked. Yep
*  You're you are so far down the train of you jacked this up. Yeah, it's the same thing with base jumping
*  Or with being overseas, right?
*  Where it's like if you're at the point where you're freaking out
*  Something's gone terribly wrong. Yeah
*  Do they give you techniques to calm yourself when you are freaking out? Is there like breathing techniques?
*  we've done some breathing techniques like the
*  Like three seconds in
*  Hold seven seconds out type of thing
*  Do that three or four times in a row like they have I remember getting taught that in buds
*  Um specifically for the underwater swim stuff
*  Which can terrify the shit out of people
*  Hold your breath swim 50 meters
*  That's a long way it's always 50 meters a long way. Yeah
*  People like oh, that's not that far bitch. Go do it a long way go do it
*  Yeah, like you think about a pool. What's the average pool 25 yards across? Yeah
*  So let's go up and back
*  twice
*  Oh one there and back there and back and the way we do it is we uh stand on the edge of the pool jump
*  In do a front flip and then swim without touching that first step first side
*  It's a dead start. You can't push off. Yeah
*  You push off the other side. Yeah, which you're already 25 meters down away. You're gonna need that. Yeah. Yeah
*  There's so much so much
*  of
*  So much mental management involved in that that's why when guys like jaco come along and they can take that
*  understanding of leadership and mental management and and then
*  Teach it to other people. Yeah, teach it to
*  Corporations and teach it to groups and yeah law enforcement and people that need that sort of understanding that's coming from a guy like him
*  With the immense amount of experience that he has in a couple different genres that allow him to then
*  teach that in a way that is
*  comprehendable
*  And super efficient. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  It seems to me that that would be one of the most important parts
*  Of that of that job of how to handle deployment how to handle coming back and the the mental aspect of it
*  Yeah, do you learn it from other guys like
*  I think I think it's just a I honestly think a lot of it is that process weeds out so many dudes that
*  Would be the the ticking time bomb or the guy that can't handle it, right that by the time we're training for this stuff
*  And it's super stressful
*  Everybody's pretty much on on their shit
*  Mm-hmm, you know and then there's like little stuff that you learn while you're doing shooting that you can transfer to all of it
*  The breathing techniques, right? And then by and large
*  We are so well trained and know that we're so well trained that you're just doing your damn job
*  Like just do your job and do it the best you can
*  Because i'm not thinking about me necessarily as much as i'm thinking about everybody else also
*  That's fascinating too that the training is so ruthless and brutal that it weeds out people who can't handle shit it fucking works
*  They've been doing it basically the same way since the 60s, but hasn't there been some chit chat about
*  Alleviating the standards to let women pass through i've heard of it
*  I've heard that they want to put females through the program but not to change the standards
*  How many women have gone through buds zero?
*  Don't say that women are gonna feel like you're a sexist you should lie
*  I'm not sure
*  Can I gray area if how many women have tried me? Uh, I did you not see g.i jane because she went made it through
*  Well, yeah, but she's she didn't ring that bell bro special
*  Um
*  Really no women have ever made it through buds. None. Well, and that's that's a two-part equation
*  There is one there. They weren't allowed to the entire time
*  I was in like no females in that when they start allowing them, so
*  I am not sure but I think that they're trying to make that a thing now
*  Trying I wonder how many women have attempted to go through buds. Jamie. See if you can google
*  How many women have attempted to go through buds?
*  Ladies listening to this, please don't get uncomfortable. We're not shitting on you. I'm just trying to figure it out
*  Yeah, first woman made it through in december. Oh, there you go. What was it screening screening screening?
*  So that's a pre-screening process. Oh, so she only made it through the screening. How far how long does that take?
*  I don't know because we don't
*  Do the same stuff that they're doing for that. They're probably making sure she can make it through the program
*  Oh, so they want to make sure that physically she can it's probably a pre-screen screen
*  Oh jesus a pre-screen they do that they do that for officers too. Do they really? Yeah, they want those well think about it
*  Buds is shitty enough now. You're in charge of a bunch of fucking idiots, right?
*  You're gonna get shit on pretty bad, right? So they want to make sure those dudes are on their game
*  Yeah, yeah
*  So where's the pressure to make women do this?
*  Is it coming from women that want to do it or is it coming from politicians that want to sort of
*  Show that they have a diverse lineup politicians
*  100 because here's the deal i've met more than enough females that are apache pilots fighter pilots
*  Bad ass eod chicks, which is explosive ordinance like hurt locker, right? Mm-hmm. There's some bad women in the military. Yes
*  They want no part of that job
*  I haven't met one that's like I wish I could be a navy seal
*  And that's not it's not shitting on them. They just don't want that job. Why is that?
*  I you'd have to ask them but the thing about navy seals is that it's like recognized
*  That these are the best of the best
*  These are the most savage human beings that we can create
*  Yeah
*  The most efficient the most effective the ones that could handle the most the ones that can get the job done
*  When the shit is as hairy as it gets. Yeah
*  And but why change the program just to diversify the lineup?
*  There's a thing that they want to show right they want to show that
*  They're
*  Not sexist this it's equal opportunity that and the people that want to prove it are the ones that aren't in the ring
*  Yeah, that's the problem, right? You're not getting this from
*  the
*  The actual team itself. They're not saying you know what we need is chicks. You're not getting pretty in this place up. Yeah
*  You know, I think it'd be great if we could just have like uh, some women running around you guys are pretty ugly. Yeah
*  It's probably going to be really weird when a woman actually does make it through i'm sure
*  You know, i'm sure it's the same like
*  I feel for those women. Yeah, because they're gonna take a lot of shit. Oh my god
*  Yeah, but doesn't everybody take shit. Yeah
*  So like but it's extra shit extra shit. Yeah for sure, especially if you're the first woman damn right
*  They're gonna be like, oh, well, you didn't do it the same as everybody else, which who knows right?
*  So when you do return
*  Um
*  How you how long did you serve for nine years nine years and when you made the decision to get out
*  What was what was that decision based on? So?
*  I never really wanted to do the navy as a full-time career my entire life
*  You know do 20 years and get out and collect the pension
*  The war was starting to at the time slow down-ish for op tempo
*  Like how quickly you guys are going overseas and the amount of action they're seeing
*  The way I saw it was it's like training for a fight that you never do
*  I didn't want that to be my life and I was 28
*  You know, i'm like, you know what?
*  Let me make some phone calls and see how guys are feeling about stuff overseas and because I was on the jump team at the time
*  Right, so I had like I didn't quite have my finger on the pulse of what was happening at the team
*  So I made some calls and those guys are like, yeah, man
*  If there's nothing really tying you down like a like a kid or you know a huge amount of debt or you know
*  A lifelong dream of this being your navy seal for 20 years
*  You know and you want to do other stuff with your life
*  It might be a good time to do it, dude
*  And i'm happy I did
*  you know, I got out with all my fingers and toes
*  and
*  I'm glad that I was able to leave
*  On really good terms and feel really happy about what I did
*  Because I feel like we were making a difference
*  When you say that like what what made you feel like you were making a difference
*  The things I know that we got to participate in
*  The places we were and the guys that we were moved from the battle space
*  captured or killed
*  We're fucking shitheads
*  That were using women and children as targets and were causing terror
*  When you say terrorist people have this disassociated view of that now, right? Yeah, just thrown across the newspapers
*  They were causing terror
*  I don't think people quite
*  You know the coronavirus stuff is coming out now or
*  When a bomb goes off somewhere or there's a mass shooting imagine if that's your your entire life
*  Yeah, you're walking around town and that's what's going on every damn day
*  It's not your fault it's just some guy that's deciding that's their their job in life is to ruin yours
*  And we were removing them
*  So I feel like we were doing a good thing
*  And what did you do when you came back?
*  When you got off when you were done?
*  so
*  I took some time off and did a ton of skydiving and base jumping because I love those things
*  I was teaching a little bit of combat shooting and then uh,
*  Basically about a year and a half after I got out of the military
*  And he calls me up and he's like, hey dude, you want to go on a bear hunt?
*  So that's so it was like really fresh out really fresh. So when I met you in san diego
*  You probably had only been out for
*  A little more than a year
*  Hmm. Yeah, and that's when you were just learning. Had you already gone on that bear hunt by then?
*  Yeah, because that was summer. I think we came we went did that spring. Yep
*  It was a spring hunt and I think that was summer in that's right san diego. Yeah
*  Super fresh, which is probably why I was like all sorts of piss and vinegar
*  I'm sure is it
*  So you're happy with your decision to get out but is it um
*  Does it feel strange? Does it feel like you?
*  Yeah, um
*  And I miss I miss some of the the structure
*  And I miss being able to ask people to do things and be certain they're gonna do them
*  Right you're dealing with a different caliber human being on a regular basis consistently, right?
*  Is that believe me that's kind of be like a lot of seals that find each other and hang out with each other
*  Oh, yeah outside of it. You should have seen this out here earlier. I'm sure bullshitting like gorillas
*  Yeah, i'm sure
*  I'm sure
*  Yeah, what do you want to do now? So right now i'm actually working for evan at black rifle. Oh, are you really taking pictures?
*  Yeah, oh no shit. Yeah, so i'm a photographer for black rifle. Oh, that's cool. It's super fun. I love those guys
*  Dude, I love those dudes their facility in salt lake is fucking dope too, dude that crazy giant
*  Roaster thing that they've got how they got bought that and pieced it together
*  Did evan tell you the whole story about how they know that?
*  It got a little weird where you know, they might have had to uh threaten people
*  People are trying to rip them off, but it's um, this crazy
*  Old school roaster like they do all the roasting in house. What's it called? A d-drick or something? I think
*  I think that's right. Yeah, it's fucking really it's giant. It's bigger than this room. It's like a dump truck upside down
*  Yeah, yeah, and that's how they roast coffee. It's so cool. It's such a crazy story too how he uh outfitted his humvee
*  So that he could roast while he was being deployed
*  It's so ridiculous to be that into coffee. You asked if I was a coffee stop
*  Evan haver coffee stop. Yeah, evan is a real coffee stop, but I mean that's his living now
*  I mean he gives a shit about it. You can tell he cares. It's so cool. Yeah, well we went there
*  He he made us all these different coffees and like this is an ethiopian this and this is a
*  Peruvian organic and yeah, this is from ethiopia and no cream
*  Everyone's drinking everything black. You get used to drinking black coffee. Good luck finding creamer there
*  I know that weird but when they open up they're gonna open up a bunch of brick and mortar coffee shops
*  They are they just uh partnered with bass pro. Oh, did they really they did?
*  So that's huge. We're gonna be uh, the company will be selling coffee at bass pro
*  Wow, like immediately so it'll be inside of all the bass pros
*  I think I select them out
*  But I think it's like in the triple digit range and then are they going to do some brick and mortar places outside of that as well
*  I believe so and they've already done. Um, they've already done one in texas, dude
*  If they can get people to stop putting cream in coffee, that would be fucking miracle
*  That would be that would literally be a miracle. It would actually be a miracle
*  Yeah, because most people just put cream in it automatically. I do they do think it's a mindless action
*  When I get my coffee open it up and pour the cream exactly when I go to starbucks
*  I get my coffee. I open the lid
*  I pour a little bit of it in the garbage can so I can get some cream in there
*  Their garbage cans will be fucking half filled with coffee like yeah 50 pound bag
*  Yeah, when they say room for cream I go yeah, but like give me real room. No, they give you like a pensworth
*  Yeah, well, that's not enough room for cream. It's just gonna spill anyways. This is ridiculous
*  But when you drink their coffee drink like starbucks coffee and then you drink black black rifle coffee black you go
*  Oh, okay. Well this he actually can drink black. This actually tastes good. Yeah, and every day like I go
*  I live in salt lake city now and i'm down there hanging out with evan all the time and he's constantly
*  roasting beans and cupping coffee and he's trying to better the experience for the user and what's really cool is that guy has
*  found a passion outside of being a
*  You know like a badass green beret or whatever, you know military like he's found an identity outside of that
*  And driven so hard towards it and he he gives so many shits about the user base and the consumer he really does
*  Well, it's also the culture that that company has sort of created
*  It's you know very uh supportive of veteran causes first responder causes military police all that stuff
*  They give a ton of charity. Yeah, they really care and he tries to hire so many vets all the time
*  Yeah, and I believe they've because they're buy a bag give a bag
*  I think they've given over 30 000 pounds of coffee for free to guys overseas. How badass is that? It's amazing
*  Yeah, it's a really good company man and good people. Yeah, they care about their employees and they care about their customers
*  And evan's a coffee snob. Yeah, and the coffee is legit because there's a lot of places like all these mass produced places
*  What if you go like there's a friend of mine who works for the ufc
*  Who's a real coffee nerd who owns his own coffee company and he was explaining to me that the stuff that they buy
*  If you're a starbucks or you're one of these you're just buying bulk
*  Yeah, and there's stuff that his company buys you're buying like really small batches of coffee
*  There's not enough available for all these people dude evan is in guatemala right now at a coffee farm
*  Whoa, physically they're inspecting coffee
*  The guy gives a shit
*  I said such a strange thing to be focused on
*  A little bit like a little a little cherry fruit looking thing. Yeah, that's weird
*  You have to put on a roaster and yeah, have you ever had that copi luwak coffee? I have
*  Okay, so someone hit a bag of it and uh, I can't remember where I was
*  Uh, and they're like, yeah, so this is some of that stuff and like we're not really sure if you want to try it
*  I'm like fuck it. I've eaten scorpions. Let's let's make this happen. Yeah, turn it into coffee
*  Yeah, it's just washed off after it's gone through its butt. It tastes just like coffee. It's but it's a weird kind of coffee, right?
*  It's got it's a smoothness to it. I don't particularly recall
*  You know, I just I don't remember it being like extra fancy. Yeah, it's okay
*  Is that it right there? Jamie? That's what it looks like when it comes out their asshole
*  It's a civet
*  If you people don't know what we're talking about, there's a kind of coffee called copi luwak
*  There's an animal that looks like a rat, but it's actually I believe it's in the cat family
*  It's like a deranged rat. It's but it's I think it's a I think it's a feline like look at its claws
*  Yeah, yeah, see its claws. It's weird looking. I think it's a civet
*  But I think that's in the cat family and it eats these berries that are the coffee beans and it shits out
*  the beans and then people clean the shit it out beans because it the
*  Stomach acids break down the outside of the bean whose poor job is that? Yeah, I'm a shit cleaner. Yeah, I clean out cat shit
*  See, I think it's a kind of a cat. See if that's true. Is this civet in the cat family?
*  Like a cat that eats berries man fucking weird bingo just just put up civet
*  Civet in the cat
*  What does it say? I figured I'd just be able to click it right there. Oh come up. You're like hyperlink me
*  Come on Wikipedia cat family. Just look. I don't think Wikipedia's gonna give you the nocturnal to say. Oh
*  The SARS virus say some sort of feeling or wouldn't it?
*  Maybe taxonomy is that what it is? Yeah. Yeah, just yeah, just
*  Okay
*  a
*  small to medium sized mammals
*  Maybe that's my fornia over under
*  scientific classification
*  Okay, was it say
*  I'll retry your search
*  Scientific yeah, just say is a civet in the cat family is a civet a cat like a moron
*  In the cat family is a civet like a moron don't be going through all them scientific journals
*  In the cat family break it down barney style civet called a civet cat. There we go
*  Any number of long-bodied short-legged carnivores the family viva verde civets found. Okay, so you get confirmation bias
*  Yeah
*  I'm just saying like you'll put it right the answer to my question. We'll find the answer somewhere this way
*  That's a good point someone might have just written it says it's rather cat like in appearance
*  Hmm but it's not a cat
*  Really are they related to are not cats. They're commonly called civet cats. They're not cats
*  In fact, they're more closely related to mongooses
*  Than the art of cats fuckers are mean don't they attack cobras and shit fuck cobras up
*  There's a bunch of great videos online cobras can't fuck with them
*  They don't know what to do with the mongoose mongooses trail around
*  It's like a skinny little honey badger occasionally they get jacked though
*  I've seen uh, it's mongoose cobra fights online and the cobra gets the mongoose you see the mongoose like sit down like oh no
*  He got me. This is how it happens. That's how it goes down. That's is that it the banded mongoose
*  I guess that's a banded. Yeah, that's a freaky looking motherfucker. He is that looks like a tasmanian tiger
*  Yeah, a little bean a little bit so, uh my friend uh forest forest galant is it galant or galante?
*  I would go with that a gonna go on that. Yeah
*  Um, he is actually going on a mission. Oh my god to look for the thylacine. There's been enough
*  sightings of it in certain places
*  Uh in the world and he's I don't know how much I can say about this
*  So I don't want to give out the location but they have an area where
*  Um, there's a guy who apparently had a captive one and it died
*  So he has the thylacine skull and they're gonna examine this skull and they see them on a regular basis
*  They see them enough to think that there's a an actual breeding population
*  How cool would it be to be a guy that un-extincts a thing?
*  Yeah to find the thylacine right? Yeah, that's a crazy animal man
*  You ever see when them when their mouths were wide open dude like a coyote like a huge it does look like a coyote
*  A lot like a crazy looking. Yeah tiger stripe coyote
*  Yeah, that mongoose is a freaky animal too
*  Like there's so many little weird freaky mammals like wolverines and i've never seen a wolverine in the wild
*  But that's that's a wild little animal badgers and wolverines. Wolverines are like
*  I had a wolverine described to me by dusty
*  Dud's friend up there. He's like
*  Wolverines, they're like grizzly bears. They got born into that body. That's why they're so pissed off
*  Fucking how dare you make me this size. Yeah, they're not scared of shit, dude
*  Would you be if you were that angry? I just a weird little animal
*  I mean, it's what do they weigh like 50 pounds? Maybe? I don't know they see red all the time
*  They scare bears off of kills. They scare bears off of kills. They scare wolves off of kills
*  They must have just like insanely thick fur
*  And it's not very bright
*  They're not smart. I mean, would you be that smart if you're scaring a bear off a kill? I don't know if it's a
*  I got this shit. An intelligence thing. I think it's just a fearlessness. Yeah, it's you know
*  nature has this very strange but
*  Logical sort of chain of events that take place, right?
*  Between like small tiny animals to the animals that eat them to the animals that eat them
*  Like this whole huge ecosystem when you see it laid out and then you see individual players like that mongoose by themselves
*  Like what part do you have in this crazy play? Yeah, you know
*  What did you get assigned because this doesn't make sense
*  Well for something like a grizzly bear to exist like there's got to be a need for it
*  Yeah, like for something to be this fucking enormous
*  Predatory bear thing that's you know, 11 feet long
*  1800 pounds like what is that swims runs as fast as a horse, right?
*  Like why do you need to be there like what's oh because there's too many of these fucking mammals
*  Yeah, like if you don't have something like that that cleans up they're gonna breed like whitetail do in the south
*  And then there will be literally no vegetables. There will be no plants everything we get eaten. Yep
*  Yeah, whitetails in the south or whitetails around where dudley lives. Oh my god
*  You gotta drive three miles an hour everywhere. You know, they just bounce especially during the rut out of control
*  Oh, it's crazy up there, dude. His place is great though. His place is amazing. Yeah, have you hunted his place yet?
*  No, I've been there. I spent some time there, but you gotta get a tag
*  Try to get a tag for whitetail season with that guy out of control
*  Well, he's the master like he's he'll sit in the same spot for a month
*  Like just waiting for like one buck. Dude that guy it's insane
*  People people think like I have patience and uh, watch watch duds social media
*  Like stream during whitetail season, right? Watch his instagram feed his his instagram live feed. Yeah
*  Oh my god. Yeah, he just sits in a tree stand all day. I'm here again
*  Yeah, I just saw a buck
*  Yeah, he's got like a one target buck that he's after for like a month
*  I don't have that kind of time. I don't have that kind of patience
*  Like that whitetail patience is a different. I mean obviously dudley does everything right?
*  Oh, yeah, but that whitetail patience to be that guy that sits in that fucking ladder stand
*  In November. Do you want to have a kill crook? Yeah, sure
*  Um, yeah in november it's freezing in iowa
*  I mean that's why he lives there he moved to a spot so that he could hunt deer and bought a giant farm
*  So he can hunt deer and then sits out there all the time so he can hunt deer. I mean
*  If you love it
*  Go to where it is
*  Like I moved from san diego because I was sick of the traffic
*  And sick of how california was you moved from san diego to salt lake because of that
*  Yeah, but san diego ain't shit compared to up here. So there's a traffic. Oh my god. This is like like triple
*  Yeah, this is like singapore or something
*  This place is nuts. Hey, at least there's not everybody on scooters
*  There's a lot of people on scooters. You've never seen this motherfucker whipping down the street
*  I was driving yesterday on the way home and he was
*  Next to me on the sidewalk going as fast as I was ridiculous. Oh man
*  I have a fast one. He has a really fast one
*  But dude, I was thinking if jamie if you wipe on that thing like you're going down hard
*  It's a daily risk but calculated i'm not going that far
*  Yeah, I have a nice little path. No one's in my way. You don't wear a helmet though, huh?
*  Well again, i'm not going very far reckless motherfucker going 30 miles an hour. No helmet. It's like a god. How fast does it go 25?
*  Dude, if you wipe at 25 miles an hour, that's fast. Hey, dude
*  I've wiped on a bicycle standing upright and it fucking hurt. Yeah, it's gonna hurt
*  But you're fine. You'd be good. I'm also i'm not gonna wear a super tight helmet like a dork. Did you ever take the hit?
*  Take the hit. Hey, you know, I don't know if you're gonna recover from a hit from concrete
*  Yeah, you might be a different guy. You might be google searching all the wrong things
*  I meant that in the way like some people wear a helmet, but they don't put it on correctly
*  I have a helmet on but like you have to wear it tight
*  You have to have it on strapped tight like it has to be good. So your brain doesn't rattle around like yeah
*  Best case scenario i'm wearing a motorcycle helmet so that i'm safe. I'm not doing that
*  You can't be like a peewee footballer where you've got like a helmet that's six sizes too big
*  You should wear a motorcycle helmet and football shoulder pads and then hand pads deontay wilder's outfit on to go and that's be safe
*  Yeah, sure
*  Do you know what he's talking about with deontay wilder's outfit?
*  He got knocked out by tyson fury and he blamed uh some of it on the fact that his legs were worn out because he was
*  Carrying around this crazy outfit. I saw it weighed 40 pounds. I think I saw a meme with that
*  I didn't know what it was about. I'm like the hell is this at first. I thought it was a ridiculous thing
*  Yeah, that's what I saw yeah i'm like why is skeletor fighting like what is going on here at first
*  I thought it was ridiculous that he would say that but then I thought about it and when we were talking about it yesterday
*  Michael yo was saying that he had to wear that thing for 40 minutes and I was like, oh
*  Really?
*  Okay, that's different. So if he really did have that thing on for 30 minutes or whatever it was
*  That's a lot of weight to be carrying for that long
*  That seems kind of ridiculous that they let him do that
*  Why is he wearing that because he wants to look dope he also walked off very slow
*  Of course he did have that whole song to play 40 fucking like tyson fury carried out
*  You know, yeah, yeah carried out like on a chariot. Yeah
*  Like a fair own. Yeah. Oh see I didn't even watch that. I fast forward to all that bullshit
*  Like burn zero calories. I don't want to hear any fucking national anthems either
*  I think i'm happy that the ufc doesn't do that. They play the english national anthem and american that like come on
*  We know where we are do that shit at the beginning of the night. You want to start the fights off?
*  Yeah one time do it at the beginning very first fight before the first fight. Let's play the national anthem fine beautiful. Perfect
*  Let's do it. Don't do it right before the main event you cock tease. Well, you got these guys in the ring dancing around
*  Getting ready and now they have to wait for three minutes
*  I think that company also said they've made other outfits for other fighters who have then gone in to knock people out
*  So that that excuse wasn't great either
*  Well
*  He's looking for an excuse. Yeah
*  The bottom line is tyson fury beat the shit out of him
*  If he had won, right he would have been like it's because of my it's because of my outfit right I scared him, right?
*  Well, he did say that like putting on that mask makes him transform
*  He has this thought that look at him. He does like has he had his head hit
*  Oh my god
*  That is a crazy god. It's like a mix of sauron and skeletor from like he man. It's pretty fucking dope. It's too bad
*  It's so heavy. Oh my god
*  I wonder if he does it again. Imagine if he wears it again next time
*  It's like you know what fuck it fuck fuck my excuse ever saw the old ones look at this one
*  Oh, wow pass fight using it in training. Dude. That one looks better. Yeah, I like the white
*  That's a lot lighter though. That looks like you actually walk around in it. What doesn't have the lights lights are nice little touch. I guess
*  LEDs makes it look like a mercedes
*  Yes
*  He's a king on a throne it's so amazing girls were carrying them girls were carrying I think so. Oh my that's a risky move
*  I wonder if they had to wear heels. What were the girls wearing? I don't
*  Did you see the fight no, dude, it was amazing. I heard it was it was amazing. I just didn't say shock the world
*  Yeah, nobody thought that was happening
*  Tyson fury just ran after him and started beating the fuck out of him and everybody's like what where's it?
*  Let's go bro. He fought completely different than every fight he's ever fought
*  He just chased him down chased him down got in his face, but he still used good boxing
*  That's what's cool. Yeah, like i'm gonna change my shit up so much that your camp meant meh
*  Watch this shit
*  How much martial arts do they go over in the team very little?
*  Do you think that's good? Yeah
*  You don't need to I I think I was actually talking to somebody about this recently
*  um
*  I think it's better for guys
*  That have to put hands on people that aren't given as many options as we are to end the fight before that
*  With some other means right?
*  Um, like police officers, right? I think that those guys really need that kind of training
*  Yes, because they have to put hands on people they're there to serve and protect other citizens. Yeah
*  I ain't serving and protecting any of our citizens, right? None of us are right?
*  We have a totally different job, right?
*  I mean, it's just reality. Yeah, um guys get into it because it's it's definitely helpful
*  But I don't think it's in the scheme of things that are necessary to do the job
*  Well, because there's so many variables already that you need to control adding that to it
*  It's just kind of probably watered down the training for the other things
*  Why add all the cognitive load of becoming good enough at jiu-jitsu so that it's second like totally secondhand? Yeah
*  Totally a subconscious action. Why why get that much out of the way?
*  Of time to train to shoot but you are a crazy gymnast, right? Don't you have like crazy gymnastic skills?
*  Uh, no, not particularly not particularly don't lie
*  You do that could do some things you do some things
*  Yeah
*  That kind of ability that physical ability to move your body that kind of dexterity would translate perfectly to jiu-jitsu
*  You know like some of the best jiu-jitsu guys, um, they come from break dancing
*  That makes sense. Yeah richie martinez
*  Uh my friend boogie. He's uh, uh 10th planet san diego and he's um
*  He just actually just had a submission match against jake shields who was
*  Like a really super respected veteran and tapped him and richie started out and same as his brother geo
*  They started out as break dancers
*  And when they first came to the school eddie was like dude, there's something going on with break dancing
*  Like if you think about the ability that you have to like maneuver your body stand on one hand spin around the circle
*  Like do one hand hand stands and you know like the physicality combined with knowing where your body is in space
*  Exactly, like I understand that i'm like sort of cockeyed sideways on my left elbow
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  But gymnastics is very similar
*  A lot of gymnasts can translate direct and george saint pierre actually to improve his uh, overall game
*  Started getting into gymnastics and he said it had a significant impact
*  Dude that that guy'd be terrifying to watch do gymnastics. Yeah, well just his ability to use his body
*  He's like well if I could do all these things that other guys do like back handsprings and flips and all these different things like
*  That would be very beneficial just just to understand how to use your body
*  It's like a a more advanced form of plyometrics in a lot of way. Yeah, oh for sure. Yeah
*  How did you get into that?
*  Doing gymnastics weird gymnastics stuff pure curiosity really? Yeah
*  So you didn't like take
*  Wasn't something you took up in high school or college or no, I was a like cross country and track and field guy
*  Did like long jump triple jump and then cross country races?
*  um, and then i've always enjoyed rock climbing and
*  Did a little bit of surfing and i've tried my hand at all the goofy sports
*  And
*  From there i'm like well, what's the best way to get really good physically?
*  You know so
*  Start learning how to do some of the gymnastic stuff and a few of those things like I have no damn clue how those guys end up
*  doing an iron cross or right a planche or
*  I'm about as good as like a you know, a seven-year-old girl
*  That's pretty good some seven-year-old girls are fucking impressive, you know what I mean like, uh
*  My daughter does that yet. It's just such a crazy thing to see someone utilize their body like that
*  It's impressive. Yeah, the amount of proprioceptive knowledge that's going on there
*  Mind-blowing. Yeah, I mean there's so much coordination and you're going head over heels. You're literally like flying through the air
*  Yeah, more than once. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but i've done i've done some like wind tunnel flying. That's kind of air gymnastics
*  Wind tunnel flying what's that? Yeah, like a it's a tube of air
*  Uh-huh that you get in and it blows like one of those things where you wear a suit
*  Yeah, i've seen that
*  How fun is that? It's the fucking best really? Oh man, it's so fun. So is it like skydiving would you don't die?
*  Yeah skydiving no stress
*  Right, you should come do it. I would love to isn't there a place in universal?
*  Yeah, yeah, you should go to san diego the one there's real good. Oh, it's better. It's worth it worth the drive
*  Next time I have a gig down there. Is this it in san diego?
*  That's not san diego, but this is it they're actually that person's upside down. Hmm
*  Seems like you could just build one of those you could you know for like a cool five mil
*  That's how much it costs. I i've been told it's like five to ten or something bro. Look at that
*  That's insane. It's so fun. So that's all a fan. Yep. And so you're wearing a mask so your lips don't fly off very much
*  Wow, that's incredible. It's so cool, man
*  and
*  So you when you're going straight up and down like when you're when you're flat so if you're parallel to the ground
*  Yep, then you can float well
*  But then when you go straight up and down
*  Then the wind can't really carry your weight so you drop which is why you start turning
*  Going in circles because you're generating lift
*  Ah does that make sense? So this is an unusually large one. This is not the same size
*  This is like an average size one. So the one in universals like this
*  Uh, no, that one's a I believe that the one there is a an oval
*  And is slightly smaller. Oh the one in san diego is about that size though
*  Is that something that actually has a purpose in terms of training guys? Oh, yeah, we actually they use it. Um
*  We used it on the jump team a ton
*  And then they use it. Yeah, this is it. I fly there you go, dude
*  If you are a super ball, you should have that shit in your backyard
*  Well, the prince does in dubai does he oh, yeah, i'm sure he does. Yeah
*  He's got like falcons and ferraris and shit, yeah, of course, he's got a wind tunnel
*  What a weird I mean, how often do you think he uses it?
*  I don't know. Uh, I had I had some buddies that used to be there and they used it every day really
*  Oh, yeah, what are these guys doing? They're teaching people how to do this. Oh, yeah, that's basically I did that once
*  it's very basic but like it's
*  how different is like that flying up version versus this like
*  level of
*  Expertise I guess because it seems like it's a lot. It's a lot like
*  hundreds of hours of time flying
*  Really? Oh, yeah
*  It's a lot of time to learn how to like do what they're doing right there
*  Yeah, I would imagine you try that and you face first right into the fucking wall and feel like an idiot
*  Yeah, there's a lot of uh, i'm thinking looking at that. I'm like, hmm, i'm not buying this
*  There's a lot of wind tunnel linebacker shit going on. Yeah. Oh, yeah
*  But it's uh, it's a really cool thing and it's a lot like gymnastics or dancing but in the sky
*  It's really cool now you're into all this stuff and you did try some jujitsu with jaco. Are you interested in doing that at all?
*  Absolutely
*  Why don't you do it like salt lake's great place page of sour is a great place there
*  There's a lot of jujitsu in salt lake. I'm absolutely going to and like I was literally talking to andy about this
*  Uh at shot show because we went out with henry akins and john cabana. Oh perfect. So um, we were bullshitting with them and
*  They were you know, they were poking me and it was like the last straw like all right. All right. Okay. Yes
*  Yeah, yeah, because I'm gonna do it a guy like you would get addicted to it immediately just like andy sure I will
*  Yeah, and he's all in it's part of the terror though like hobby creep. I got crap. I need to yeah hobby creep
*  I get another one. That's a great way to put it man. I got that from uh, sean evangelista from like andy's buddy
*  30 seconds out. He's like I can't learn how to bow hunt like what why he goes. It's hobby creep
*  I don't need another expensive hobby man. Yeah, I already have enough
*  Bow hunting is the ultimate hobby creep though. It's helped me so much though
*  It is hobby creep for sure and it does take up a lot of my time
*  But man, I how much do you love it? I just love being able to use my range here and just shoot. It's so
*  Relaxing. Yeah, I wish more people would have the opportunity to do archery. It's brain scrubbing
*  Yeah, you know because you're focusing on that task so completely that it just kind of cleans out the whole system
*  It's it's meditation. It's just like it's moving meditation
*  That's a funny way to put it because that's exactly the term that a lot of people use for martial arts
*  That's what it is
*  Yeah
*  A lot of people use that term moving meditation for martial arts a lot of people use it for running too
*  Which is another thing that you really got into right? Yeah, um, actually i'm doing a couple mountain races
*  Or like sky running races this summer don't hang out with cam haines
*  No, I don't know if i'm interested in doing like ultras that motherfucker will have you doing stupid shit 10 10 to 20 milers
*  It's about where i'm at. He does a mile. He does a marathon a day. Yeah, i'm good. No, thanks
*  It works an eight-hour job. It does a marathon a day. He just released a video
*  Um that uh, the cam haines story and you watch it and you go wait a minute. How
*  How are you doing this? What is he powered by a nuclear reactor? Dude? He's a freak. He doesn't even get hurt
*  that's what I don't understand like since i've been friends with him he's been hurt a couple of times like you had a like a
*  Injury to his foot. He thought was a stress fracture. By the way, I kept running never stopped running the entire time
*  I'm thinking my foot's broken. Let me just bang out. Why stop miles today?
*  I'll do a short one today, but he gets up at 2 30 in the morning
*  Okay, 2 30 in the morning sometimes and he'll run 18 20 miles and then he'll go to work
*  And then during lunchtime he'll hammer out another eight and you got to fit in, you know, a little bit of archery
*  Yeah, and then afterwards he goes and shoots for hours and then he goes to this crazy fucking
*  Pimped out man cave that he's got
*  And he lifts weights at night there he is, I mean
*  I just don't there's certain people that I mean I get it though
*  Like we were operating in a similar way when I was in the seal teams like
*  Like your whole life is centered around these things
*  Like i'm just gonna be really good at all of it
*  Well, his whole life is centered around bow hunting believe it or not
*  All the other stuff that he does is really to get himself in shape for bow hunting and then to challenge himself
*  So that he understands that his body is in perfect tune and he could do it
*  It's dude hanging out with him in the mountains is so goddamn humbling because he he runs up these mountains like it's nothing
*  You're i'm dying and i've been running
*  Yeah, i've been running i see it. I've been doing it but I still I try to keep up with that motherfucker
*  I'm like, Jesus christ. You just gotta like pull one of the minor tricks and like stick a little rock in the back
*  This is not gonna help
*  He'll ignore it. He won't even notice it's it's it's
*  Weird when someone is that dedicated to something and you're friends with them. It's weird and a little terrifying, right?
*  But it's also really cool
*  Does he stop using it or does he still do I think that's an old one. Yeah, that's 2013
*  I don't think he used that rock anymore. He had 130 pound rock that he would put in his backpack and carry everywhere
*  Dude, that's a lot of weight. Yeah, he's a ridiculous person
*  That's a lot of weight someone gave him a rock as a present recently and he fucking put it on his shoulder
*  And uh took it with him up to the top of the mountain off
*  Yeah, he was like thanks for the rock like gave him a big fucking rock like a 75 pound rock
*  But he didn't even bother putting it in a bag
*  He's carrying it around up the mountain on his shoulder and the switches to make it difficult what a gorilla to make it more suck
*  Yeah
*  He's a fucking strange person
*  I mean I get it. I mean i've done a lot of rock runs and stuff. Yeah just for kind of fun
*  It's training it's humbling being friends with that guy though. He's so inspirational
*  I mean like I don't know. I mean he is I know I don't know anybody who's more driven than him. It's crazy
*  It's like even Goggins like when Goggins and him were running like Goggins has to keep up with camp
*  like and Goggins is the fucking man, I mean he is the
*  Endurance king, you know, it's cool
*  To be around people like that because it makes you question whether you're doing enough right yourself. You're like man
*  Am I just a little bitch like exactly like i've thought I wasn't but i'm definitely a little bit
*  But am I a little bitch?
*  I've answered that question hanging out with cam a bunch of times like well definitely a little bitch
*  It's just he's got this weird drive to uh constantly push his limits like here's
*  This is him, right?
*  My fucking dog, uh, we put a uh, a toy hammer
*  My dog's got a toy hammer and so he's got this toy hammer in his mouth and uh as a quote
*  My wife wrote this down she wrote, uh, what are we hammering and how long are we supposed to keep doing this?
*  And then I sent it to cam and he sends me a text message. It says tell marshal we keep hammering until we're dead
*  Even your dog's not pushing it enough
*  That's so funny, but the fucking that is the most cam haines answer ever tell marshal
*  We keep hammering until we're dead and you know, he's serious
*  Oh, yeah, and he got up at 2 30 that morning to run a fucking marathon before he went to work
*  There's no ha ha ha before that message. He's like no, this is what we do even if there's a ha ha ha he means it
*  He means every fucking word of it
*  That's awesome when people say they do a lot, you know, oh man, he gets a lot done. Like does he really yeah
*  Are you really burning the candle at both ends? Do you understand what this motherfucker is doing?
*  He's running a goddamn marathon every day. They tell you like there's certain physiologists tell you well when you run a marathon
*  You need six months to recover. Do you really are you sure? Maybe you just need 12 hours
*  Yeah, maybe maybe you don't know what the fuck you're talking about, man
*  I'm not sure everybody really has this dialed in like what's possible. Well think about where we come from like we're
*  We're the result
*  Of successful hunter gatherers. Yeah for hundreds of thousands of years, right? Yeah
*  So we should be really good at this shit. We should be the best at it. Yeah
*  No, instead we're we're water balloons and jelly donuts walking around
*  well, it's
*  When you find out what's really possible from the human body when you see people that accomplish incredible feats of endurance
*  Did you see that former marine who was I guess you're never a former marine 62 year old
*  Uh dude who like my granddad not a former. Yeah, he he won the world record, uh for holding a plank
*  He held a plank for 62 held a plank for eight hours and I think it was like 13 minutes something preposterous
*  What yeah like for a work day phone and he's like on the doing a plank look at this guy
*  He does not look former us marine again. There's no such thing. Well, no just look at that eight hour plank record
*  Yeah, look at him
*  He's a uh personal trainer. He's fucking what the shredded shit. Look at him holding that plate. That guy looks terrifying
*  Eight hours and 15 minutes and 15 seconds. That's crazy
*  But that's one of those things looking at him playing on his phone. That's one of those things that you think
*  Look at the fucking veins
*  well
*  That and to keep that for eight hours is like a lot of people have a hard time planking for a minute
*  At all and a shit first set the record in
*  2013 but then he lost it
*  Head to head with another guy, but now he's back. So now he broke the record
*  That was fucking bananas and holding on to his phone. It's hilarious
*  I guess maybe he needs a timer in front of him. Maybe that's what it is
*  Or just get I mean eight hours wouldn't you just get bored?
*  You definitely get bored. But the the amount of mental fortitude
*  That you have to have to be able to do that and hold that position for eight hours and 15 minutes
*  What did he say he was doing it for jamie? There was like something in that video for mental health awareness
*  Yeah, you're crazy bro. You should be doing it for mental health awareness for people to be aware of your mental health
*  Yeah, people be aware of how fucking crazy you are if that guy's coming after you that is like dude
*  He ain't gonna he ain't gonna stop no
*  no
*  There's people that their mind is just fucking stronger. He's got a p-tube hooked up a p-tube
*  Jesus christ, dude, that's something how patient are you? Well, i'm eight hours in a plank patient
*  Yeah, oh he does have p-tube. But what happens if he has to take a shit? Hey
*  Hey
*  Wonder what he ate before he did this or if he ate during it
*  Can you eat like a banana while you're planking?
*  Or maybe like it's uh, yeah like running where you're doing like liquid diet stuff
*  Yeah
*  Some gel that was the toughest part about the real long dives that we did like every time stuff went into the nine ten
*  Hour range. It's like you're not eating anything. Right? Right you come out and you're
*  Haggard no, I can imagine man. Yeah, that's got to be fucking hard
*  Just when I do the ufc and I don't really eat for like six or seven hours, it's hard it fucks with you. Yeah
*  Your your brain is just your brain's like hey man, this is not working
*  Well, like we need some extra stuff something's messing what's missing and she eats something occasionally
*  I'll get a hot dog or something when i'm doing those but um, that's just that that's just sitting there talking
*  Yeah, which you know, what's incredible how much burns off energy is playing chess
*  They did these uh, they had these world-class chess players in these world championship events and they found out they were burning
*  Thousands of calories just sitting there playing chess because they were all losing weight and they're trying to figure out
*  Why are these guys losing weight like what's happening over the course of this tournament?
*  You know of a couple of there, but their brain is firing. Look at that. Six thousand calories
*  Robert sopolsky our guy that's insane
*  The stanford professor who we've had on the podcast who studies stress and primates at stanford university says that a chess player
*  Can burn up to six thousand calories a day while playing in a tournament three times what an average person consumes in a day
*  Damn, yeah
*  So they've they've figured this out fairly recently because a lot of these guys are losing shit loads of weight
*  That's wild. Yeah your brain. I wonder like
*  I don't think commentary burns off anything near what a chess player burns up
*  But I wonder what it does because you you are thinking all day while you're watching the fights
*  I wonder how much i'm burning because dude when I get out of there I eat like a fucking wolf
*  Could you take your whoop strap? Do you have it on usually? Yes, I do but it's your heart rate isn't going up
*  Well, also the whoop strap is measuring. Yeah, it's measuring your heart rate and it's also I mean it's
*  Based on your activity
*  Yeah
*  I don't I don't think it's gonna know like mental
*  Like because I don't think their heart rate is jacked if they're they're burning six thousand calories a day just sitting
*  Yeah, it's gonna get measured calories burned off of your physical activity. Yes, right not like right activity. Yeah, right
*  It's an additional thing. Well, that's also like
*  different
*  Exercises that are physically taxing and also mentally taxing. Yeah, they have to be consuming more calories. Oh, yeah, like
*  um, like I was saying about the dives like I've done dives that are six to twelve hours long and
*  You get out of the water and like I'm sitting there. I'm thinking like I'm using my brain a lot
*  Yeah, but it's also cool to fuck
*  And i've come out of the water a couple times and lost eight plus pounds
*  Wow in the water in the water
*  Dude, that's nuts. It yeah, where's it going?
*  So i'll be coming a part of the ocean. I guess I don't know right. I mean i'm yeah
*  You're pissing out a lot of liquid losing water to the ocean while you're in the water. Oh, yeah
*  You could get dehydrated while immersed in water. Yep
*  this is that polar that company that uh
*  Polar straps. There's like it's a popular one, too. Um, they tracked a chess champion 21 years old in october
*  He burned 560 calories in two hours of sitting and playing chess which is
*  About the same amount as roger federoid would burn in an hour of singles tennis
*  Really? What? That's an hour of working out i've done i've that's about what I do like an hour of an elliptical is about
*  560 600 but I would feel like federer just hopping around all that plyos
*  Jumping down every 20 seconds. Yeah, that's true. He's hyper efficient right like bernard hopkins when he used to box
*  Yeah, you know super efficient
*  Yeah
*  Elevate sustained elevated blood pressure
*  I wonder if chess is the pinnacle of things that you do that aren't physical in terms of movement but are
*  incredibly calorie taxing
*  I wonder if that's the number of me. That's a very complex game. Oh my god
*  I would that and maybe like go brain surgery go you're barely moving but you're like
*  Concentrating so hard for hours and hours at a time. Yeah. Yeah
*  Well, there's certain things that you do though after it's over
*  You're just fucking exhausted and starving to death like when I do two shows a night after it's over
*  I'm so hungry and that has to be something like do two hour 10 hour 15 minute sets
*  Because you're thinking and you're managing it while you're doing it as a giant audience there
*  You got to be fucking on my cat
*  Yeah, that's uh, but I think the ufc makes me more hungry, but it's also like six hours seven hours in a day
*  And you're probably moving around a lot. Yeah
*  Hunting does it bro when you're when you're going through the mountains and the intensity of hunting and then the concentration all those things
*  That's incredibly calorie consuming it all comes up right at the end
*  Like you finish a day hunting out there like spotting and stalking and even if you don't kill something, right?
*  If you don't get an animal you come back at the end of the day and all of a sudden you're like, holy shit
*  I'm really hungry and yeah, oh my god. I'm weak. What was I doing all day?
*  And then when you wake up in the morning, it literally is like you trained like the day before you're like, whoa
*  Oh, yeah
*  100 percent
*  And it just fried when you get to like a six seven day hunt when you get to like day six day seven
*  bro, you have put in some fucking work dude that fourth day of that moose hunt i'm like
*  Okay, here we go again because you're getting up like it's like elk hunting you're getting a pre-dawn
*  And getting out there that is something that is so missing from videos
*  There's something about hunting videos like people just don't understand how miserable it can be
*  Not just that like they understand why you're happy like why are you happy at the end?
*  Yeah, you just killed an animal like if you had any idea how hard this is
*  And then how difficult it is to execute a good shot
*  How nervous how nervous I was that I was gonna jack this up
*  Yeah, and then when it's over and the animal's down, it's more of a relief
*  And the success is nice. It's everything all together. It's like an alleviation of pressure success happiness
*  but
*  It's you don't the the the longer and harder the hunt is the more you appreciate that though
*  Oh, yeah, it's all in how much you're putting in and i've heard that from guys where they're like
*  Yeah, if you punch your ticket the first day you're gonna you're just gonna feel like oh
*  What am I here for? They can all eat shit. I punch my ticket every chance I can I i've heard that argument
*  I'm like look, i'm not i'm not buying into that nonsense
*  Like there was steve ronella on one of his shows
*  He had this elk and it was like the first day of the hunt and it was a great elk
*  He was about to shoot it and he's like i'm not ready to end my hunt
*  I want to keep hunting and then he wound up not getting an elk because that's how it works karma, bitch
*  Yeah, well, it's like
*  He explained that he had just gotten back from another episode because he's filming and then the episode previously
*  Just last week. He'd shot an elk
*  Okay, so he was he like had meat in the freezer and he's doing it for this show
*  So he just didn't want to like shoot it right there and then and also there's probably the pressure of you have to have
*  A narrative for the television show, you know, the narrative can't be yeah, I got my shit together and now he's dead
*  Do you ever think you'd be interested in filming stuff and putting content on it?
*  Because I know you're a photographer you're into taking pictures. Not really
*  I I like taking pictures of other people doing that stuff. Like it's fun for me to go out and do these hunts with andy and dud
*  Because I get to take pictures. Mm-hmm. I really enjoy photographing
*  how people go through processes and
*  I really enjoyed taking pictures. It's it's been a really
*  Meditative process for me and a creative thing for me to do coming from art school now
*  I have an outlet for that. Mm-hmm, and I really like being able to do it. I don't think I would want to
*  videotape or take pictures of myself doing it
*  but participating in the circle
*  And being part of that process and able to document it
*  In a from my point of view I enjoy it. That's what I like
*  But you're not interested in someone filming you while you go out and do it. I don't think so
*  I wouldn't say no
*  Right, but i'm not gonna that's not something i'm seeking out right now
*  That is a thing that a lot of people get into when they get into hunting
*  especially if they have a good social media profile like you do like
*  they start thinking like maybe they should like film hunts and that could be like
*  It's a weird thing right because it becomes a part of what you're doing to sort of
*  Expand your social media profile. Yeah, so then it feels weird. It does it's like what's your agenda?
*  Right, like my agenda is meet in the freezer, right?
*  Enjoying the process and man I get to spend some really cool time with some really really really good friends
*  Yeah
*  And that I don't I don't think I could
*  give that up for
*  Pushing the I want to be famous too
*  But only because i'm filming these hunts and then also the filming thing
*  The real problem is that person filming you is also in the way. Yeah, like there's an extra body moving
*  There's extra smells there's extra sounds
*  They have to move to get this the shot and sometimes like you're drawing on an animal and they don't have the shot
*  So they move in order to get a better angle the animal's like what the fuck is that?
*  Yeah, and the animal sees him and takes off that's and more power to guys like dud they're able to do it successfully
*  Uh-huh. It's phenomenal. Yeah, but it also takes a special amount of skill and a desire to do it and he's really
*  He's really able to show people
*  Hunting in a great way, right?
*  And pass on a lot of skills and a lot of the enjoyment of the process
*  Yeah, is there any hunts that you're like really interested in doing that you haven't done yet?
*  I really want to do a spot and stalk mountain lion hunt. Oh Jesus. Oh, yeah
*  You want to spot and stalk the thing that spots and stalks? Yes
*  Where are you gonna do that? I don't know. So I think in the dakotas and in oregon
*  Um, there's a decent chance for it
*  So there's a decent chance because the population density population density
*  And then I think oregon and I want to say south dakota don't allow dog hunts. Oh
*  so
*  Oregon's weird. That's dense. Oregon's a weird place. That's dense foot. I mean foliage. Yeah. Yeah, that would be hard
*  I think it'd be hard. You know what though?
*  I I want that kind of challenge. Those are the things that really get me like way deep inside
*  Yeah, we were talking about this last night. You're gonna give yourself what like three weeks like i'm thinking in my head
*  I need a couple weeks to make it happen. Wow, and i'm gonna look i'm a new hunter
*  But i'm doing as much research as possible talking to all the right people and when it happens it happens
*  So but I really want to make it happen
*  What's the process for that? You get a tag you go into the backcountry and are you gonna bivy sack?
*  Are you gonna just sleep in the woods? That'd be my that would be what I kind of want to do
*  Is solo bivy solo or maybe one other guy?
*  I think more than that. You're gonna have so much presence in those woods. You're never gonna see a cat. Yeah
*  So how the fuck do you find a cat when you're by yourself? I think you gotta cut a track or find a kill. Mm-hmm
*  So your plan is to get yourself in an area where they're at
*  Mm-hmm
*  A lot of stars got to line up. Yeah, but that's part of the
*  It's part of the cool part about hunting. It's not just killing right? Right?
*  That's a that's probably one of the most difficult hunts you can go on damn, right?
*  Which and for me like growing up in southern california having seen a mountain lion when I was younger
*  I've just had a
*  A like a real deep feeling about mountain lions. I think they're incredible animals
*  And I think it would be a really really special thing to pit
*  my training and brain
*  with a bow
*  Against a cat
*  Like and eat it. Yes, that's gonna be weird eat it sitting down there eating a cat that you killed with a bow and arrow
*  It's gonna be really cool
*  Yeah, if it's if i'm able to make it happen at some point
*  But you want I mean you're gonna get a lot of meals out of that cat. I think they're huge
*  That's huge a little cat like the ones down down here they're like 110 120 pounds
*  The ones up in bc are like 200. Do they really get that big? Yeah 200. Yeah
*  That's a big cat
*  Yeah, it's a weird animal that just sort of coexists with us you've seen that photo that I have out there
*  Of the ones by the how cool is hollywood sign. That's a real photo. Yeah, that's a pet. It does it looks fake
*  It's so cool. It looks fake, but that's from a camera trap
*  That is a giant cat that lives in griffiths park right by the hollywood sign dude cats are cats are wild
*  That is a I mean that is a crazy place for it to live though because it's
*  Literally on top of people. Oh, yeah, and good luck finding a deer up there for that reason
*  That motherfucker is jacking them all eating everything and dogs and cats and probably kids
*  Some kid fucks up and goes off and you get off the leash. Yeah, I mean so
*  It's just a weird animal to coexist with people in these sort of semi-urban settings like griffith park
*  But it's only weird because of the setting and because we're not used to it. Like we've coexisted with these things for so long
*  And now it's weird because we've separated the last few generations so how deeply how far away are you from planning this out?
*  Probably a couple of years if i'm guessing correctly
*  I think i'm probably
*  How's that work because it's hard to get a tag or no because I want to make sure that my skills and my ability are
*  Up to snuff where i'm comfortable doing that and pulling it off. So it's right now just a thought
*  Like like a plan. Absolutely put on the books for 2023 or something like that. Yeah
*  Something like that
*  What about in between then?
*  More elk i'd love to do another moose hunt
*  I'm gonna start helping to guide with col kramer up in kodiak. Oh really i'm in alaska. Yeah, he's a buddy of mine
*  Oh, no shit. I was up there. You knew him before all this. No. Oh you met him. We met through all this
*  Oh, um, and last year I went up and assisted him on a mountain goat mountain goat, uh hunt
*  That's a crazy hunt. Super cool. That's crazy terrain, right? So I was up there pack mealing
*  Really? Yeah, and did you do that for the experience just to see what it's like? Yeah
*  And really enjoyed it and I told him man
*  I really want to come back and help you guide with brown bear and with uh
*  With sicka blacktails and mountain goat again. So this year i'm gonna be up there doing something dude. You're balls deep
*  Yeah, I mean you're all in that's my like that's just my
*  I fucking love it. Like I love getting that deep into shit
*  Like you give me a pool i'm gonna find the bottom
*  Yeah, well this is it's a really interesting thing to get all in with too because it is such a
*  Part of our dna and then it is the source of your your nutrition now
*  Yeah, which is really interesting like that a hobby actually feeds you my hobby
*  Has allowed me not not to purchase red meat at a store in years
*  Isn't that crazy? That's incredible and then I get to share it with people. Yeah
*  No, it really is incredible
*  Yeah, and it really is the best meat you can buy and it really it's you know
*  We beat that beat it like a dead horse
*  But it really does make it seem different when you're eating that food your feelings are different
*  It's just it's hard to describe for people
*  I I would like people to experience it somewhat and I think you can get kind of the shadow of it when you catch a fish
*  And you eat that fish. Yeah, you get a shadow of it. You get a touch you get a little glimmer
*  Yeah, but you don't get the real elk steak
*  Feeling no, you don't get the elbow deep and yeah pulling that thing apart
*  So this is like your life now like absolutely. Wow, which black rifle has really allowed me to to do that because I get to take
*  A fair amount of their lifestyle and environmental shoots
*  and pictures so
*  I'm able to go on hunts with evan and dud and andy
*  And make it happen and take pictures along the way. Don't they have a crazy ranch down in texas, too
*  Yeah, I was down there last year how was that it was incredible I heard I heard it's really awesome
*  Oh, yeah, texas is such a strange place. It's I always say describe texas is that's how the rest of the world sees america
*  Absolutely
*  I totally agree with that 100 percent. They're like america and you're like you mean texas. Yeah, it's okay
*  I mean, it's america for sure
*  But it's like it's sort of like there's places in america that are so clearly what like california is one of those places
*  So clearly california. Yeah, it does it's very different than a lot of the rest of the country
*  Yeah, and but texas is the most extreme version of that. Yeah. Well now make sure you know
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, they'll tell you they'll let you know. Yeah, it's it's one of those things and it's
*  For hunting opportunities like texas is incredible. I mean, there's absolutely
*  Exotics and all kinds of weird animals from other places that they've
*  Transplanted there. Yeah, I mean you can win some probably guy and you probably find a dinosaur if you you know, ask the right people
*  They'd be in some backyard in texas some guy'd have a t-rex ranch
*  I got a dream for a lot of people to do the ted newjit thing
*  Ted new jit just he has a house on a ranch in texas and he hunts literally on his land
*  Oh, and he hunts basically every day because he has so many exotics the way exotics work in texas
*  They're basically private property. Yeah, so you don't have to abide by hunting seasons
*  You do it by whenever you feel like doing it
*  So anytime he wants to step out of his you know backyard and go shoot at Oryx for dinner it's kudu day
*  Yeah, it's kudu day get some yeah, there's kudu
*  Right. How weird is that? Well, the weird thing is like what if they get out of texas?
*  Like does anybody have a fucking plan for that all of a sudden there's no Marco Polo sheep in, Nevada, bro
*  They have zebras. Yeah, there's free-range zebras in Texas like that's not bullshit. It's awesome. It's crazy. It's hilarious
*  They're so nuts
*  It's such a it's such a fucking nutty part of the country that there's you know
*  There's more tigers in captivity in Texas and there are on all the wild of the world. It's a cartoon version of the United States
*  Yeah, yeah
*  bunched into one state
*  So are you planning on just traveling around and hunting now like that's like a giant part of your lifestyle
*  Absolutely, have you have it planned out like is some of them?
*  I know I'm waiting on finding out from dad about spring bear
*  So you're just gonna work for black rifle and then do your hunts absolutely and keep crazy
*  Oh something can so quickly become a giant part of your life. Yeah, I fucking love it
