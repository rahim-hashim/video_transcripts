# Joe Rogan Experience #2168 - Tyler Fischer
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgG0arz96nc)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  Oh, hey Joe Rogan. What's going on?
*  Is there a left or right here or does it matter?
*  No, it's all mono. What's cracking, brother?
*  Oh, yeah. Let me just get a little confidence here.
*  I'm so small, this is like a large coffee to me.
*  They'll make you pee. That's one thing Nespresso's doing.
*  I'm peeing right now, dude. I'm just gonna do the Biden, just let it out.
*  Ari peed in that seat three or four times yesterday.
*  Yesterday?
*  Yeah, he pissed into Bud Light cans. He's so disgusting.
*  Ari Shaffir?
*  Oh, yeah. Every time he's here, he pees into things.
*  I'm trying to get him to move here.
*  He's not going to. He's a New York rat.
*  But he's here all the time. He might as well live here.
*  He's here like four or five times a year.
*  Yeah, just good enough.
*  He should move here.
*  He's so funny, man. I love watching him at the Comedy Cellar.
*  Because he's one of the guys that just fucking goes for it.
*  Yeah, he definitely goes for it. It's gotten him in a lot of trouble.
*  It all comes down the wash though, right?
*  Well, if you're talented, yeah. And he's definitely talented. He's just a wild boy.
*  I watch the crowd when he's on.
*  Because I like to see the crowd just slowly kind of...
*  He's working through stuff. He gets messy. I like that.
*  They put me and him on at the late, late shows now.
*  In the Cellar?
*  Yeah.
*  What is New York scene like these days?
*  Well, I'm here now. We'll say that.
*  With an American flag out on it.
*  This is what it does to you, man.
*  Dude, before I moved here, I was a 60-year-old Jamaican woman.
*  Look what Texas does to you.
*  It gets you in its bones. It's just a fun thing to be. It's fun to be a Texan.
*  Someone the other day on the street said, you look like Kid Rock fuck Zach Elefantakis.
*  I was like, that works.
*  Yeah, that tracks.
*  How long have you been out here now?
*  Oh, like two weeks.
*  Wow.
*  It's like a dream. This has been a weird dream. Including this, it's all a weird dream.
*  How long have you been doing stand-up now?
*  I mean, I got on stage when I was 17 or 18 in high school.
*  Started doing improv and stand-up on stage. That's almost 20 years.
*  Oh, wow. High school.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I was failing on a high school.
*  I needed like a B to pass.
*  And I was friends with the acting teacher. We would drink together.
*  What? In high school?
*  Public school, brother. Public school.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah. We would drink together and smoke.
*  And I thought if I take his class, he's got to give me an A or I can get him sent to jail probably
*  for all this bad behavior.
*  And so I took this acting class and I got on stage and he pulls me aside.
*  Like day one he goes, this is what you need to do with your life.
*  Wow.
*  And I go, okay, okay. Stop drinking, stop smoking.
*  I was like in a gang. I was growing wheat. Yeah, I was a nightmare kid.
*  People think I'm just this nice little guy. I was a fucking monster.
*  And getting on stage and I got all that energy out.
*  And it's what I've been doing every day since.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  That's cool that someone recognized that because most of the time they don't.
*  It takes one person. It's insane.
*  It takes one person and that one person literally can change your life because you're in this part of your life where you're not, you don't know what the fuck you're going to do.
*  No.
*  And then someone gives you a direction and they say, hey, you're really good at this.
*  This is your thing.
*  That's it.
*  Oh my God, I found my thing.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you go home and you're like, I found my thing.
*  Yeah, he had us first class. We had to dance on stage.
*  He was like, he goes, you're going to fuck. Oh, he was wild, dude.
*  He was a playwright. He'd take the Metro North and from Connecticut, New Haven to put on little plays.
*  And I just thought I just thought it was the sexiest thing.
*  It was like this guy was like living in the 1920s or something.
*  Like a real artist.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  And he goes, he goes, we're going to humiliate ourselves. Day one.
*  He goes, it's going to be so bad. So everything you do after this is going to be a breeze.
*  And I've still used that to this day with stand up. You got to get messy.
*  You got to. So he said, we're going to go do the silliest dances.
*  I went home, I was practicing in the bathroom, just sweating, turn around.
*  I've never performed. And I get on stage and be like sillier, weirder, weirder until you just had a mental breakdown.
*  And then after that, doing a little Shakespeare was fine.
*  Oh, that's an interesting strategy. Yeah.
*  That makes sense.
*  Break you down and go, you're allowed to fuck up. You're allowed to get messy.
*  Yeah. And that's that's why I got a place here because I went to your club and I saw Brian Holtzman and I go, wait a minute.
*  You're allowed to do this.
*  There's a place where you're allowed to say whatever you want.
*  Well, Brian Holtzman was like a hero of comedians in Los Angeles, but he didn't get good spots.
*  Unfortunately, they put him on really late at the end of the show.
*  And it was a wild thing to watch. You know, you watch like 20, 30 people in the audience.
*  This guy's saying the most hilarious, but yet horrific things.
*  And he just never got the respect that he deserves.
*  I've known Brian for I guess around 30 years now.
*  When we first started at the store, we were like young hotshots.
*  He was like this young, dark haired, slick back, like really interesting guy, like really like same style that he has now.
*  He had back then.
*  I can't imagine him with any more energy than he has now, though.
*  It was the same guy.
*  Oh, his energy has not waned at all, which is why he's so good.
*  You know, like some people slow down. It sucks. It sucks to see.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, because they slow down, you're like, you don't want to say anything to them.
*  You know, like, hey, man, you got to pick it up.
*  Yeah.
*  Whatever the fuck you used to be, you got to bring that back.
*  Turn it up a little bit.
*  Yeah, you're a little too casual up there.
*  I don't want to say lazy, but you're too tired.
*  Yeah.
*  You got to fire the fuck up.
*  Holtzman never lost that kind of fucking cream when he gets crazy.
*  But he didn't have a show, like a real showcase.
*  He didn't have like a real, you know, like a real awesome spot where he could perform in front of crowds that weren't tired and hadn't seen three hours of comedy.
*  But so now we've got him headlining.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, and people come to see him. They know who he is.
*  They get excited. People have seen him multiple times.
*  He's got a cult following here. It's great.
*  He definitely does. Yeah.
*  So that was it. I saw him once and then I was like, oh yeah, I went to like the open mic or whatever, you know.
*  I was in town doing the Vulcan, I think.
*  And then I go, I'm going to try to get an audition.
*  Adam wasn't here. Flew back, got the audition, then did a couple spots, then did a guest spot on Holtzman's show.
*  And then I was in the car in New York. I pull over. I'm just looking at apartments in Texas.
*  I just call the guy, go, hey, can I move there?
*  I made him an offer.
*  I made him an offer that was like insane. I'm renting.
*  He literally goes, are you fucking with me, dude?
*  And the next day he goes, they took your offer. And that was it.
*  Wow.
*  And it was like, I know Ron White calls it comedy camp. It feels like that.
*  When I'm landing here, it feels like Camp David or something.
*  Yeah, Ari said it yesterday. He said, you made a festival here every week. It's like a festival.
*  It's a festival. Yeah.
*  I wasn't sure if I'd made the right move. And then I'm on the plane and it's Roseanne Barr, the next row back, Sebastian Maniscalco, and I'm right behind him.
*  And I was losing my fucking mind.
*  I was like, this is it.
*  Yeah. Well, whenever you don't know if you should do something and you want to do something, but then you have that little, oh, I don't know, is this right?
*  You got to always go for it.
*  You got to do it. You got to go for it.
*  And you get better at that as you age. You know, it's like you have to, you got to fuck up a lot. And they go, oh, fuck up a little less this time.
*  Yeah, the fuck up thing. But it's also just like taking chances, going for things. It's very important.
*  Every time I've ever done it, it's been good. My whole life. Every single time. Whether it's first time going on stage, you know, even this, even like moving here.
*  Sure.
*  I have a family and I had a business, you know, like this podcast that requires guests.
*  And yeah, I had all these people that already lived in L.A.
*  I had this built in, you know, group of people that I would have on.
*  It's just like coming out here was but I was like, this is this is the move.
*  And then opening the club is like, this is the move. Yeah. And it's going to be fucking annoying.
*  It's going to be a lot of energy, a lot of stuff going on, a lot of things to pay attention to.
*  But that's what really needs to happen.
*  You have to practice your hour a couple of times a week and the road comes to you.
*  That's great. That definitely helps a lot. It's just like you see so much healthier. It's crazy how much better you feel when you don't travel every week.
*  It's nuts. I just started touring this year. It wears you. Holy shit.
*  Yeah, it gets it's like getting drunk. Yeah, it's like getting drunk.
*  And then you have a show that night and then you have another show and then you fly home and you get drunk flying home because it feels like when you land,
*  like you're hung over. Yeah. You just like, oh, why am I so worn the fuck out with the heat here, man? Yeah.
*  You get used to that kind of why I understand Biden a little more.
*  I've been walking around just like where am I? Where's your shit in my pants?
*  Ha, silly boy. Did you say I was telling you before this this mayoral race in San Francisco?
*  This might be the end. This this might be like San Francisco is a failed city.
*  I mean, it really is. But this there's no better indication of how failed it is than listening to this debate.
*  Listening to these people argue about what's important in San Francisco.
*  This was on the Jesse Water show. You got to listen to this. How many drag queens do you know?
*  You were at the debate last week and couldn't name any drag queens on your own.
*  I was wondering if you could have this as an opportunity to redeem yourself.
*  And if you could name three LGBTQ advisors for your campaign and three drag queens in San Francisco, San Francisco, just imagine the fuck.
*  And that was the thing she was going to sit down on. This is the actual current mayor of San Francisco, London Breed.
*  That's her right. Yeah. And she's like, can you name three drag queens?
*  Can you name three mentally ill men who address up like the most TARDIS caricatures like famous or just like Pixie that does the you know, the story hour down at the library?
*  Lexis down at the club just does the burlesque show. What the fuck are you talking about?
*  Yeah. No, sit back and enjoy. This is sit back and enjoy the show when woke woke ism just takes on this energy and it gets crazier and crazier.
*  I mean, look at the the sexuality acronym. It used to be gay and lesbian.
*  It is watching politicians have to recite that. Oh, it's so it's like a gun to their head. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Trudeau has them all down. But my favorite is to a plus plus two s plus is like everybody's in this gang.
*  That's not a white male. Like it's like you mean the American flag.
*  That would be a great flag to represent a racial people of color.
*  Like there's so many different things. Indigenous. There's two spirit two spirits in there, which is my favorite.
*  Yeah, I'm a two spirit. Yeah. What the fuck are you? Why not three? Why not four? Why not forty five?
*  You're limiting yourself. And then a which is a hilarious too, because how do they have any say they're asexual asexual.
*  Like how are they in there with the perverts? How are they in there with the freaks?
*  How are they in there with the transgender people? How are they in there with fucking guys wearing leather thongs and G strings walking down the street?
*  Like we don't want any part of this. How does the A's how are the A's in that they just don't want to fuck.
*  My friend came out as bisexual, this guy in New York, and he goes, well, I've been so oppressed.
*  I'm like, am I supposed to feel bad that you get to fuck everybody really?
*  He's been oppressed. How so? I don't know. I don't know.
*  I mean, how are you? It's a fun thing to say. It's a fun thing to say.
*  Yeah. And it also gives you like a position where people have to go, oh my God, I'm so sorry.
*  What did I do? George Bush was like talking about pride the other day.
*  And I was like, if he was if he was. Yeah. Yeah. He was on some interview.
*  And and I was like, if he was president today, having to, you know, the L the LMAFOs, the HGTVs, the PB&Js, these are tasty folks, you know, my cousins are trans listen.
*  Now watch this drive. But think about how much has changed. Yeah. Since him.
*  Well, he is so reasonable now and compare. I used to have a joke about Bush getting elected about the Iraq War and that there's people in the back of the room.
*  And their idea was the only way to find out how dumb people really are is to have a dumb president and see if everybody freaks out.
*  Because the only way they know that he's dumb is if they're smarter than him. Yeah.
*  So the only way to find out is put a dumb president and see how everybody responds.
*  And then it was all about the Iraq War and all these things happen, like what they believe.
*  And then at the end of it, I go, I think the people in the back of the room are going, I think we can go dumber.
*  And they were right. Yeah, they were so right. Well, people act like Trump and Biden are the first with Quinoa.
*  We're we had an autistic cowboy run in the country for eight years. We wanted eight years of that.
*  Yeah. Yeah. But people didn't want it at the end, which is why Obama won. Yeah.
*  You know, which is what this country always does. We go.
*  We swing hard one way and then we swing the other way.
*  And Duncan Trussell said this when they were smashing windows and looting during the George Floyd protests.
*  Duncan said, dude, this is going to be so bad because we're going to have a right wing authoritarian president next.
*  And I thought about it. I was like, God damn, he's probably right, because that's that's really what happens.
*  There's like an overcorrection. Yeah.
*  One way and like the the San Francisco London breed mayor thing, this is an overcorrection to discrimination.
*  So there is some discrimination of gay people. There's discrimination of all kinds of people.
*  How now, though? Well, there's still there's still with gay people, for sure.
*  There's still people that are homophobic, especially religious people.
*  It's too complicated now because it's like, well, there's that.
*  And then there's, you know, gay guys who dress up as women who want to read to kids.
*  And then there's those who cut their dicks. It's too.
*  My dad came out of the closet when I was seven. So I was raised in this stuff.
*  He came out as racist, but he no, he's gay. I got a gay dad.
*  I have two dad, two dad, mom remarried and then my dad with a husband.
*  And so it's funny, I try to talk about this like, well, shut up straight white guy.
*  This isn't your lived experience. I'm like, no, it is. It is.
*  I say you say this on stage. I talk about it on stage.
*  I talk about it. Yeah, people started booing me when I started talking about this in New York City a long time ago.
*  It's the first time where I talked about my personal life because I have a crazy.
*  Everyone has a crazy life. What were they booing?
*  It's just like you can't talk about you can't. That's their life.
*  You can't talk about what it's like to be a gay person.
*  And it's like when I was seven, I was hiding it from my friends.
*  So I was living like a closeted gay guy. I went to insane lengths to hide my dad having a boyfriend because back this was 1993.
*  That's when it was, you know, and prior that's when it was bad.
*  But I imagine what guys like that think of what's going on now to be like you're like a two-spirit heterosexual, whatever this shit is.
*  Yeah. And back then it was bad.
*  But when I was in middle school, my friend Josh, his mom was gay and he didn't tell us and nobody nobody talked about it.
*  But I lesbian moms a little cooler.
*  She had the whole thing like she was wearing the sleeveless vest with the arms.
*  She was a big lady and she had a girlfriend with short hair that was always over the house.
*  It was like the whole like you'd go, who's that lady?
*  Oh, that's my mom's friend. Why is she always over?
*  She lived with you exactly what it was one of them things.
*  Yeah. But I lived in San Francisco.
*  And so when I moved to Boston, I moved to Florida for a few years.
*  Then we moved to Boston like I had been around gay people from the time I was seven to eleven.
*  Like my neighbors were gay. My aunt used to go over and play bongos with them naked.
*  They would smoke pot and play bongos. I remember.
*  I was just cooler. Yeah.
*  I mean, she just loved the fact she could just be naked around guys and no one cared.
*  But it was just this thing where like the whole neighborhood was gay.
*  Everybody was gay. So gay was super normal to me.
*  I did. But so my friend was like hiding the fact that his mom was gay.
*  You know, we never really pressed him on it.
*  But me and my other friend were like, you know, his mom's gay, right?
*  Like, yeah, obviously. But, you know, we were 13.
*  Like, what are you gonna do?
*  For men, I think it was associated with AIDS.
*  So I remember I was in the car and, you know, we would like raise money for AIDS runs and all this stuff.
*  And my friend's like, that's the AIDS thing, right? Yeah.
*  And I would tell him my dad's an attorney. I would tell him because he goes, this is my partner.
*  And I would tell my friends, they go, why is your dad's partner sleeping?
*  My dad's partner's sleeping. That's his law partner.
*  I go, they're working on a case. They're gonna be up all night, fellas.
*  You know, if you hear some banging and moaning and say they're recreating the murder, they're in there.
*  I would come up with this. Probably why I'm a good writer.
*  Because I back then it was not accepted at all.
*  When did everybody figure it out?
*  I never told anybody.
*  Wow. Yeah.
*  I think I was in college the first time I told somebody because I was a theater major.
*  So it was like I was safe. Yeah.
*  I was the weird one being straight.
*  And it also gives you like social props.
*  It does, yeah.
*  Street cred.
*  Yeah, I'll take whatever I can get now when you got resting January 6 face, man. You need something.
*  Do you think you have January 6? Well, you do with that hat.
*  Resting January 6 face. Yeah.
*  Yeah, I don't know. I don't care.
*  I was raised to hate America. All that bullshit. I fucking love this country, man.
*  It's a great country. I love it.
*  There's no reason to hate America. No.
*  We should always hate bad behavior in all groups of people, left and right.
*  Yeah.
*  Shitty, evil people on both sides. That's what we're supposed to hate.
*  We're not supposed to hate America.
*  And the history, it's history. You got to honor it.
*  Even like the stuff growing up with my dad and stuff.
*  I had a lot of resentment about that.
*  But I thought, you know what? That was my burden to bear.
*  And I have friends who, you know, who saw my day.
*  You know, gay was bad back then. But they'd see my dad being a great dad and cooking us dinner.
*  And so their introduction to a homosexual was this normal guy.
*  My dad, he looks like you. He looks kind of like Bruce Willis and fucking...
*  He's just a normal dude. He's not a feminine. He doesn't do the like, yeah, it's like, you know.
*  Which is interesting, right? That there's different groups of gay people.
*  I associate gay with people who behave in a very specific, exaggerated way.
*  Yeah. Well, they're the loudest ones on the floats with their dick out and a four-year-old's face.
*  Well, that's what's weird. It's like, it's not just gay pride. It's overtly sexual behavior pride. You know?
*  Those things should have nothing to do with you.
*  They're so different. Like, I know so many gay guys that are just like...
*  You would never know unless they told you they were gay. They just seemed like men.
*  Do you think people are actually homophobic or do they have an issue with it getting sort of convoluted into this sexual thing that our kids are seeing?
*  I think people who are homophobic just lack nuance. They don't understand that there's weird people in every group.
*  Like, would you be heterophobic if you found out about people that are child molesters?
*  You know, like if there was men that wanted to date 14-year-old girls and have sex with 14-year-old girls, you wouldn't be heterophobic because of that.
*  Just like you shouldn't be homophobic if there's gay men that want to groom young boys.
*  It's not about the gay. It's about assholes. It's about shitty members of society.
*  And it's about a lot of them are people who are victims themselves. And then they perpetuate it again later in life.
*  It's almost like being bitten by a vampire. One of the things that happens with a lot of these molested guys...
*  That's how you become gay, by the way.
*  Blah!
*  Bitten by a vampire?
*  Yeah.
*  But a lot of these molested guys wind up doing it to other kids, which is fucking insanely evil.
*  Like, their life got destroyed, and then they wound up destroying other people's lives.
*  I think it's something like 30% become molesters.
*  Crazy.
*  My priest, and I don't know the backstory on this, but he blew his brains out when I was eight years old.
*  Jesus, dude. Seven and eight was rough for you.
*  Seven was dad coming out, and then...
*  What did the priest do that he wanted to blow his brains out?
*  I don't know, but I always think about it because I'm like, were my blow jobs that bad?
*  Baaaaa!
*  You know what I mean? Were they that bad?
*  Was it Catholic?
*  I don't know what he did.
*  He didn't touch me because I wasn't a part of it.
*  Catholic?
*  Methodist.
*  Methodist. Interesting. Are they allowed to get married?
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  Huh.
*  They're allowed to blow their brains out. He did it at the altar.
*  Oh my God. In front of everybody?
*  No, off day. Thank God.
*  But I remember going back in the next day and we just had a new guy and he had a mustache.
*  He looked like Ned Flanders. And I'm like, no, I can't do this.
*  Did they tell everybody what happened?
*  Yeah.
*  Did he leave a note?
*  Uh, maybe. I don't know.
*  Does anybody know what was wrong?
*  No, I Googled it. It's been wiped. I can't even find the story.
*  Oh boy.
*  I know. They're good at wiping that.
*  Wow, there's a fucking, there's a horrible thing that you people connect priest with child molesters.
*  Because, you know, like just like we're talking about other things, there's a group of them.
*  Well, I wonder if by occupation that they're, if it's the most, I can't say for sure, but.
*  It's certainly associated the most. Like it's not like NASCAR drivers.
*  Imagine if that many NASCAR drivers were molesting kids, they'd shut NASCAR down in a fucking heartbeat.
*  Sure they do.
*  But meanwhile, the Catholic church gets tax exempt status.
*  Right.
*  You know, they're literally guilty of moving people who are molesters to another place where they can molest new people instead of turning them in.
*  That's what Pope Benedict got in trouble for. It's one of the reasons why he stepped down.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. He was responsible for moving this one guy that went on to molest a hundred deaf kids.
*  Yeah.
*  Whew.
*  Yeah, they would move these people to places where they could get away with it instead of turn them in.
*  And I don't know if they gave them counseling. I mean, what the fuck?
*  The thing about that particular evil, the evil of child molesters is you don't, it doesn't seem to be able to be fixed.
*  Like no one, you know, if you were a guy who was like a like a wolf of Wall Street guy, he did a lot of crazy shit with the stock market.
*  But then you realize like I fucked up. You know, I should have never done that. I was doing drugs. I fucked up.
*  People that kind of accept that you're not a thief anymore.
*  You can go do talk shows, you know, you can write a book and people go, wow, that guy, they made a movie out of them.
*  You know, Leonardo DiCaprio, Leonardo DiCaprio played him in a fucking movie and now he's out there.
*  He's back.
*  But we don't think that way about child molesters.
*  It's the one like if you murdered somebody like I was young, I was stupid.
*  I hated that person. I didn't think I murdered them.
*  You do 25 years in jail. You come out. Maybe we think like that guy's reformed.
*  There's no feeling like that ever.
*  You go out and make midnight at Paris after that.
*  Yes.
*  He never went to jail.
*  No, I don't know if he did.
*  Well, he did something.
*  I went out with a girl who told she goes, I feel like I'm with hanging out with Woody Allen when I'm hanging out with you.
*  And I was like, I don't know if that was a year Woody Allen.
*  Yeah, yes. Any hall.
*  You give me an existential crisis, you know, you're not even Asian, you know, I'm trying something different.
*  Have you ever listened to his old stand up?
*  Yeah, I like it.
*  It's so pervy.
*  Yeah, he's very pervy.
*  But it's it's hilarious how openly pervy.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And then you have to think of the time in which he was doing the stand up.
*  This is the 1960s.
*  Yeah.
*  So he's doing this like weird sexual fucking a moose, you know, the moose had me mounted on the wall.
*  Well, he's talking about girls.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  We talked about girls.
*  I loved girls.
*  His voice is so to be, you know, you know, he really this is really what his voice is.
*  You're a knockout show.
*  You really are.
*  And he's an odd dude.
*  Yeah.
*  That shows when you're funny, though, you can be that's that's your currency.
*  He's an ugly, weird looking guy.
*  But if you're funny, you that's that's what you do.
*  Yeah, up until the whole child molesting accusations.
*  Yeah, she was a bit of a bat shit crazy lady.
*  I mean, both of them deserve whatever happened.
*  They both deserve it.
*  She was adopting kids and returning them.
*  What?
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  She returned them all the time.
*  Yeah. Why?
*  Yeah. She just batted like this one.
*  You know, she would get like mangled kids and all these, you know, they'd have all these disabilities and stuff.
*  And then she would return them.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, all all the kids have come out with different stories, but, you know, well, if you're they deserve each other.
*  If you're fostering kids and taking care of kids, you're taking care of kids that have already experienced like some crazy shit.
*  You know, these kids are probably already fucked up.
*  Probably didn't speak English.
*  They'd bring them in from different countries, China and stuff.
*  They didn't speak English.
*  They'd be like disabled.
*  And then Woody Allen's like, you want to go for a walk?
*  You know, but his movies are so good.
*  They're pretty good.
*  They're not that good.
*  They're not that good.
*  But what I love about it is a different nobody could do that now and go, I can go go make a movie a year.
*  You're going, I'm going to see the Rogan movie.
*  I'm going to see the I'm seeing the Shane Gillis movie.
*  Did he really make one a year?
*  Yeah. Wow.
*  He made real cheap, didn't pay himself.
*  And that will never have that again.
*  I remember when I was in my teens going, I'm seeing the Woody Allen movie.
*  You didn't even care what it was.
*  It's like a new comedian special coming out.
*  You just go, oh, he's good.
*  Right.
*  How many does he have?
*  Oh, my God.
*  Look at the movies.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  He's still making them.
*  He's still making them.
*  That one's good.
*  Rainy in New York.
*  It's good.
*  Where does he live now?
*  He lives in Manhattan.
*  Still?
*  Yeah.
*  Same place.
*  Upper East Side.
*  I wonder if he gets fucked with.
*  Like, can he just walk around?
*  Probably.
*  He's old, man.
*  Yeah.
*  He is old.
*  I don't think people would recognize him.
*  Really?
*  Oh, come on.
*  Not the younger generation.
*  I think they know who he is.
*  He never lived with Mia Farrow, I found out.
*  So they never even slept over at each other's house.
*  They were never married.
*  Oh, no kidding.
*  Yeah.
*  It doesn't make it less weird that he started fucking her daughter, but.
*  No.
*  It does not.
*  You know.
*  Especially since he knew her since she was like two.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, not good.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's what he looks like now.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, they'd recognize him in a heartbeat, dude.
*  Well, she's older now.
*  Yeah.
*  He's 88.
*  Wow.
*  God damn.
*  He's done.
*  The pandemic, I think, finished him.
*  He's 88.
*  Finished him.
*  Well, I mean, just life is finishing him.
*  He's 88 years old, man.
*  I mean, that's just.
*  And he still does a movie a year.
*  What did he get arrested for there?
*  That's from a movie.
*  Take the Money and Run, I think.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah.
*  He had some great fucking movies, man.
*  He did.
*  But he's a real like germaphobe, neurotic guy.
*  The pandemic ruined anybody that had that type of personality.
*  Oh, I know a few people.
*  Oh, God.
*  Yeah.
*  Done.
*  Yeah, they're not coming back.
*  Not coming.
*  That is a tragedy.
*  That's the tragedy of our time, man.
*  Yeah, there were people that were barely hanging on.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  They were riddled with anxiety.
*  Yeah, I was one of them.
*  But it was more because I didn't get the vaccine and couldn't take part in society.
*  That was a fun little experiment we did that we're just going to pretend like never happened.
*  Yeah, that was an interesting thing.
*  Interesting little thing, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  We had segregation in this country based on medicine,
*  and then we're back to pretending like it never fucking happened.
*  Well, at least now they're having hearings on it.
*  Nine years later.
*  Fouchy was on TV the other day going, you know, it could have come from the lab.
*  It may have been a leak.
*  I want to stay open minded and unseen.
*  And they're like, yeah, OK.
*  Like, what?
*  Do you see all that leaked stuff coming out of his audio?
*  Yeah.
*  You got to make pressure people.
*  You got to.
*  Yeah, they'll drop their ideological bullshit when they can't work.
*  Dude.
*  They've been showing when you make their lives difficult,
*  they will drop their ideological bullshit.
*  Just give them another booster.
*  Boost them up.
*  Imagine saying that about people's jobs,
*  that you're going to force them into making a decision with their own body.
*  And not only that, but mandated.
*  And not only that, as a doctor, know that some people are allergic to some of the
*  components, some of the some of the actual ingredients in these facts.
*  Sure.
*  Aaron Rodgers is one of them.
*  Yeah.
*  He's allergic to one of the chemicals that's in it.
*  You can't take it.
*  And some people have immune systems that work pretty well.
*  And maybe you didn't you don't need to start jabbing them with experimental stuff.
*  I mean, yeah, it's a wild thing that happened.
*  And so many people are still defending it because they defended it previously.
*  They're not defending it from a position of like objectivity.
*  Like, here we are, 2024.
*  Let's look at the data.
*  No, they're defending it from this weird place of I defended it three years ago
*  and I've shamed people three years ago.
*  And we were right.
*  We were right.
*  You were wrong.
*  We were right.
*  It saved millions.
*  They always say that.
*  Save millions.
*  Which is, by the way, there's no way to tell if that's true.
*  There's no way to tell.
*  The number of people that actually die from COVID is so grossly exaggerated.
*  Most people think it's a very high number of people that died from COVID.
*  It's less than one percent.
*  It's like, was it point three?
*  Is it like one third of one percent?
*  Is that what it is?
*  Something like that.
*  And I don't know one person.
*  I know people do.
*  I know a couple of people.
*  You know, I know a couple of people that died.
*  But it's not what I remember.
*  I was watching CNN.
*  I was watching like a brainwashed woke person until the pandemic.
*  Every day I was on CNN watching, watching that death ticker,
*  that stock market.
*  And then when I made my decision not to get the vaccine
*  and I lost almost every friend, every job,
*  and was called like a far right Trump supporter,
*  I go, OK, this is we've never done this before.
*  What was your decision?
*  Why did you decide not to take it?
*  Well, I mean, I'm not getting something.
*  First of all, it wouldn't have been made that Trump's really good
*  at pushing things through regulations very fast.
*  If we had any other president, there's no way.
*  That's what warp speed.
*  You remember warp speed, Joe, right?
*  Nobody can do that.
*  We call it warp speed.
*  Edison couldn't do it with lightning speed, but I did warp speed.
*  I mean, they said, sure, it'll take 15 years.
*  I made it in two days.
*  He's bragging about how quick he did it.
*  Yeah, I'm not going to fucking get that.
*  I'm young. I'm healthy.
*  I had covid and natural immunity.
*  I was doing what everybody has done throughout history.
*  Right. You already had goes to really important.
*  Yeah. So why risk that?
*  And what was the what version of covid did you have the earliest?
*  I had the first the first the O.G. the original.
*  And how bad was it for you?
*  It was it was like I get the flu every year.
*  I'm tiny. I'm a sickly person.
*  You know, I'm allergic to fucking cigarettes.
*  Can I get one of those? Yeah, yeah, why not?
*  I quit smoking when I was 12.
*  But you smoke a cigar? I started when I was 10.
*  Oh, OK. Yeah, 10 to 21.
*  I smoked for 11 years. Nice.
*  So let's start now. Sorry, I would have been.
*  Now it's fine. It's fine.
*  I just got damn. How did I know that you had quit cigarettes?
*  Now you would know that somebody I think somebody brought it up.
*  Well, I put up a sign when I was filming the special that like a no smoking sign.
*  Hold that down. Oh, yeah.
*  A no smoking so the Marks brother when I fucking.
*  Well, I had I had a when I was I filmed the special last week and we were live editing it.
*  So I put up a no smoking sign in the green room because I had all these I had all this camera crew and stuff.
*  Mm hmm. What do you hit this thing?
*  The other side, the top that's flipped the way I handed it to turn towards you, turn towards you.
*  No, no, no. The other way.
*  You see that? That's the top right there. And you pulled that thing down.
*  OK, there you go. But you got it backwards.
*  You should do it the other way so you can see what you're doing.
*  Oh, like this? Yeah.
*  There you go. Oh, I was good at this when I was 12.
*  Where? Oh, yeah. I used to steal cigars.
*  I was in like a skateboard gang and I was so small they'd send me under the counter and I would steal like thousands of dollars of cigars.
*  Under counters? Yeah.
*  Sneak under the counter of a drugstore. Oh, God.
*  Because I was so small. And then I'd come out with and we would sell them on the street.
*  Your gang sold stolen cigars? Stolen cigars and we grew weed in my backyard.
*  Yeah, yeah. It was a real gang. I mean, somebody stole our weed once.
*  We went and flipped their car over and burnt it.
*  Wow. Yeah. Jesus. Yeah, yeah.
*  So that's, you know, the privilege of growing up in Connecticut.
*  What part of Connecticut? New Haven.
*  OK, I know New Haven. It's called Gunblazing. Everyone's like, oh, you're so privileged.
*  It was a, you know. New Haven's a sketchy place.
*  Sketchy. Yeah, we had gunshots every night. Every single night.
*  I used to do the Joker's Wild Comedy Club in New Haven.
*  You did? Yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  Is that still around? I don't know. It's where I did my first open mic.
*  No shit. You did your first open mic there?
*  Wow. Yeah. Actually, no. First one was the cafeteria at college.
*  Yeah, I was in a play. I was playing George Bush. First acting role I ever did.
*  Stuff happens. Did you ever hear about that play? No.
*  Stuff happens. It was in the West End in London.
*  It was all actual quotes from George Bush and his administration.
*  The whole thing. And it's fucking amazing. Really?
*  Yeah. Yeah. The war and terror. Weapons of mass destruction.
*  All the whole, the way they, you know, it was almost like the pandemic, the way they scared people.
*  Weapons of mass destruction. We got to take them out.
*  We got to do what we got to do. And we went in there.
*  And what came of that? Yeah.
*  Biden pulling out, leaving billions of dollars of shit behind. Yeah.
*  If you just compared Biden to George Bush, George Bush looks like a fucking Rhodes Scholar.
*  Yeah, Shakespeare. That's what's crazy. We thought that he was an idiot.
*  We thought, God, it's such an embarrassment that that guy is the president.
*  Yeah. And now look at the two choices we have. You're like, yo.
*  Bush would be like the wise choice at this point. Yeah.
*  You know? Oh, yeah.
*  Did you ever watch the clip when they're like asking them about, I think about Bin Laden or something?
*  He's like, yeah, we're going to find Bin Laden. But first, watch this drive.
*  I watch that every day. It was a good drive. Yeah.
*  And it was a way of keeping people calm and like, he's so American. He just is.
*  We're dumb. We're fucking stupid. Yeah.
*  He's a transport to Texas. You know, they're from Maine. He was born in New Haven.
*  Yeah. Was he really? And he denies it. He denies it.
*  The bridge that goes into New Haven is the George W. Bush Bridge.
*  And he denies he was born in Yale New Haven Hospital.
*  Wait a minute. Why would he lie about that? Because he wants to be from Texas.
*  You know, red, white and blue. I believe it.
*  Yeah, but everybody knows they're from Kennebunkport, Maine. Born in New Haven.
*  Really? Oh, yeah. Interesting. They're like, fuck you, we're naming the bridge after it.
*  Is it American? Hey, baby, New Haven. Yeah, New Haven, Connecticut.
*  So at one point in time, he was hiding this. Is that what it is?
*  Isn't that funny? He's younger than both fucking Trump and Biden.
*  He's Jesus Christ. He hasn't been the president in like 20 fucking years.
*  That's so crazy. He's younger than both of them. That's so nuts.
*  Look at that. That is so crazy. That's so nuts.
*  I would vote for him for a third term. A hundred percent. In a second.
*  Come on back, George. Yeah, we need a laugh, buddy.
*  And bring that Darth Vader fucking fake heart motherfucker with you.
*  Dick Cheney? Yeah. Is he still alive?
*  Yeah, he's literally in the Bible. He had no pulse at one point in time.
*  No pulse. Because he had an artificial heart put in while they were waiting to put a replacement heart in.
*  Oh, that's right. An artificial pump put in.
*  So this pump continually circulated blood. It didn't have a pulse. So he had no pulse.
*  Tell me that's not in the Bible. Isn't that in the Bible?
*  I don't know. Maybe you heard my priest blew his brains out when I was eight. I kind of stopped reading.
*  But I mean, if you're going to have like a demon incarnate, you probably have no pulse.
*  I would imagine. Watching Biden, when he freezes up now, you think he's gone, man.
*  Well, he's going to go. But also he's freezing up, medicated to the tits.
*  Like whatever they're doing to keep him alive.
*  The IV vitamin transfusions and fucking hormones and amphetamines, whatever they're doing.
*  I don't know what they're doing. Neutropics. I don't know what they're doing.
*  He could be the first president to be assassinated by time. Yeah.
*  I mean, I just. He's not going to make it. I just can't believe they're running him.
*  It doesn't even make sense. The more he flails about in these speeches, the more he fucks up.
*  The more it's almost like he feels like he doesn't want to do it.
*  So he's trying to get out of it. And this didn't happen.
*  This did not happen. White House denies claims Biden froze at fundraiser event.
*  They're calling him cheap fakes now. But wait a minute.
*  There's a video of the show where, look, I don't think that's a big deal.
*  The thing's over. He gets led off the stage like who cares?
*  That's nothing. Some of the other stuff like what was that one where he was like yelling at people like completely?
*  Just yell it with a big smile on his face. He always does that.
*  Yeah, but this was a wild one. That's just him walking off with Joe Biden, with Obama.
*  Like, who cares? That doesn't. I think it was the like he gave him a little pinch on the arm like you do to your grandma.
*  He's looking at the crowd. Let's go. He's just looking out at the crowd, which is odd.
*  He does look frozen though. Yeah, he's frozen. Yeah, but whatever.
*  That's the least of the things that have gone wrong. Sure.
*  The thing of it, have you seen the video of him yelling, Jamie?
*  There's this crazy video. He's like,
*  J-I-A-L-A-T!
*  Like he's not saying it. Someone says something to him and he yells something back, but it's literally no words.
*  And then he has a big smile on his face.
*  He yells and then he does that whisper. He's like,
*  We're like, we're, we're, we're, we're first in history.
*  She sure heard. Yeah, we wrote the bill there.
*  It's hard to believe it's real. It's almost like we're being punked by China.
*  Oh, they, yeah, they're definitely doing that.
*  They're definitely doing that. COVID was a bit of a punk.
*  A little bit. A little, yeah, minor worldwide punk.
*  That we funded. That we funded. Yeah, our tax dollars.
*  How about reparations for everybody who got fired for not getting the COVID vaccine?
*  I think everyone should get a fat check on a thousand dollars.
*  That's not a bad idea. That's not even enough. How many people lost their fucking jobs?
*  Dude, people, it's destroyed people.
*  This isn't it. Not it.
*  Let me hear this though. Let me hear what this one is.
*  Donald Trump, when he was commander in chief, refused to visit a cemetery,
*  US cemetery outside of Paris for fallen American soldiers.
*  And he referred to those heroes, and I quote, as suckers and losers.
*  He actually said that. Oh. He said that. How dare he say that.
*  How dare he talk about my son and all those things like that.
*  What? How dare you?
*  Sweet old man though. Yeah.
*  Is that how his son died? Why is he saying his son?
*  His son, the death of his son changes by the day.
*  It's like. Yeah, but what is he saying there? Is he saying his son died as a military person?
*  Yeah, I don't think he died in war. He mixes it up.
*  Does it say how he died? He died from cancer.
*  Biden had radiation chemotherapy treatments. Cancer remained stable.
*  May 20, 2015, he was admitted to Walter Reed National Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland,
*  because of recurrence of brain cancer. He died there 10 days later.
*  OK. What does what does that have to do?
*  What? Why is he saying? How dare they talk about my son?
*  He'll link everything to his son. Oh, no, no, no.
*  No, no, no exposure to military burn pits in Iraq.
*  OK, that makes sense. OK.
*  Oh, so what did he do?
*  According to his father, Bo was dialed, diagnosed with how say that word.
*  Ankylosing spondylitis.
*  Ankylosing spondylitis.
*  After returning from service in Kosovo, he was later diagnosed with brain cancers.
*  Father believes is a possible possibly a consequence of exposure to military burn pits.
*  Well, those burn pits 100 percent fuck people up.
*  That's so crazy that they did that, too.
*  They had soldiers over there and they had all this waste and they just burned it all.
*  And then the wind would just blow it right into the camp.
*  So these soldiers are just breathing in toxic chemical waste.
*  Yeah. Yikes. Yeah.
*  What the fuck, man?
*  And what was his son doing?
*  Where someone was in Kosovo? Was his son serving?
*  I think so. Is that what happened?
*  It's amazing how Trump, he looks like he looks so young and energized compared to Biden now.
*  Yeah, but it's just compared to just compared to it.
*  He was in Kosovo after 1998, 1999, Kosovo war, working on behalf of the OSCE to train judges and prosecutors for the local judicial system.
*  2004, became a partner in the law firm of Bittiforato, Gentile, Biden and Bailik, where he worked for two years before being elected attorney general of Delaware.
*  He was nominated when Joe Biden was nominated for vice president.
*  Bo introduced him. Many delegates wept at his speech, which were counted the auto accident that killed his mother and sister and the subsequent commitment his father made to his sons.
*  So he's active duty deployed to Iraq, sent to Fort Bliss for pre-deployment training.
*  This day after his father participated, 2008 presidential campaigns, only vice presidential debate.
*  Father was on record saying, I don't want him going, but I'll tell you what, I don't want my grandson or my granddaughter's going back in 15 years.
*  So I can't see it all, Jimmy. It's cut off.
*  Oh, so how we leave makes a big difference. Whoa, that didn't age well.
*  So how we leave makes a big difference.
*  Then you think about what they did in Afghanistan.
*  Hey, man, fuck that job.
*  Fuck, fuck that job.
*  You literally have to be a crazy person to want that job.
*  Like, do you imagine wanting the stress of being either the vice president or the president?
*  Brian Regan has a joke about being president.
*  Every morning you wake up, someone's like, problems, sir, lots and lots of problems.
*  Any of those jobs.
*  There's not one day where everything's like, fucking yeah.
*  Do you think they should have an age cap on the politicians?
*  Well, they got a minimum, right? 35 to run.
*  If you want to be a fireman, you have to show that you're physically competent.
*  You have to complete a physical fitness course.
*  Sure.
*  You have to, you know, because you might be able to have to do things.
*  If you are a president, I think you should have to commit a mental fitness course.
*  Like they should have to test you with puzzles.
*  They should have to ask you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Legitimately.
*  Legitimately.
*  Like, it sounds stupid, but that's a good way to find out whether someone's brain works well.
*  Test people with puzzles and quizzes and ask them questions about history.
*  And they shouldn't be able to prepare for it.
*  I think it should be something that you just announced.
*  Today's the day.
*  We're going to pull them into this room and we're going to film it all and ask them a bunch of questions about all kinds of things.
*  And then let's find out how that guy, how his brain works.
*  I mean, I think Mitch McConnell had two strokes in a very short amount of time.
*  He locks up, whatever that is.
*  I don't think it's a stroke, but he definitely locks up like Windows 95.
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's not good.
*  It's not good and he's not stepping down.
*  These people are so old.
*  They're so old and they shouldn't be doing anything.
*  They certainly shouldn't be running the world for future generations that they are absolutely not going to witness.
*  Mitch McConnell is actually stepping down.
*  Oh, he will step down.
*  When did he decide?
*  Not too long ago.
*  It was just a couple months ago.
*  They said.
*  Oh, OK.
*  Finally.
*  Yeah.
*  82.
*  But he should have stepped down fucking immediately.
*  He sounds like Mr. Magoo and Jimmy Storm.
*  I mean, you're Gigi Ping or whatever watching these politicians just having a good chuckle.
*  I think that Gigi Ping knows those politicians don't really run jack shit.
*  It's the, you know, what Trump likes to call the deep state.
*  The deep state.
*  Real. It's real.
*  There's a bunch of people that run the government.
*  Who are they, though?
*  Well, there's a lot of money.
*  There's heads of immense corporations that have incredible financial control and influence on politicians.
*  This is the reason why lobbyists are some of the richest fucking people in the country.
*  Some of the richest real estate is in Virginia, right outside of D.C.
*  And it's a lot of its lobbyists.
*  The amount of money that they pour into campaigns and pour into making sure that their agendas are being met and that their businesses get to grow because of regulations or lack of regulations or tariffs or lack of tariffs or whatever the fuck they're trying to do.
*  That's that's who runs things really and makes decisions.
*  And then the politicians keep us embattled in these social squabbles.
*  You know, it's like when they have when Kamala Harris had this guy in a dress with a beard come to the White House recently, she's like, oh, my God, for Pride Month.
*  Come on in. You're in the White House.
*  That is to accentuate this.
*  The social squabbling.
*  It's so people get fired up.
*  Yay. Queers in the White House.
*  And then other people go, what the fuck are queers doing in the White House?
*  It's like that.
*  This is a part of the grand plan to keep people not paying attention to the really important issues and to just constantly.
*  It's like these these fucking beach balls.
*  They throw up at a concert.
*  They constantly get thrown up.
*  There's working.
*  They're going to take away gay marriage now.
*  They're going to take away abortion.
*  They're going to take away this guns, the border.
*  And they just keep throwing these things in the air.
*  So you're just like looking left and right and looking left and right.
*  And while this is going on, there's all sorts of laws being passed that allow them to look at any computer, any laptop, any any phone.
*  You're going to be able to bypass encryption with A.I.
*  I was just watching a video where a security expert was talking about that.
*  He was talking about what's that guy's name?
*  Rob Braxman.
*  He was talking about how A.I. in your operating system, like once they get A.I.
*  in your operating system, all this stuff like signal and WhatsApp encrypted end to end encrypted devices, that's nonsense.
*  It's not going to work anymore.
*  It's not going to do anything.
*  They're going to be able to get your information before it's encrypted as you're typing it before you send it.
*  Everything is going to be transparent.
*  They'll have access to anything they want.
*  Anything you have on any device.
*  It doesn't matter what kind of encryption and what kind of bullshit you're using.
*  All that's out the window.
*  And he was explaining that.
*  What about Elon's Neuralink chip?
*  Is that you think people are going to have those?
*  Yeah.
*  And they can just go open up, you know, they don't have to say it.
*  You just think it.
*  Open up Google.
*  You know, that's going to happen.
*  There's going to be versions of that.
*  And it's going to get.
*  But we had what's Nolan's last name?
*  Say it again.
*  Arbaugh.
*  Arbaugh.
*  You say it the right way.
*  Arbaugh.
*  Arbaugh.
*  He's the first Neuralink patient.
*  We had him in the other day.
*  And I think the episode comes out today.
*  Yeah, it's out now.
*  Yeah, it's out now.
*  And yeah, he's the first guy.
*  Oh my God.
*  Does he sound like Elon?
*  He's like, yeah, I'm sorry.
*  So it's working pretty well.
*  It's very, very smart.
*  Very smart.
*  Very interesting person to talk to.
*  Completely paralyzed from the neck down.
*  Except for a few movements in his hands.
*  And he can kind of move a little bit.
*  His spinal cord's not totally severed, but it's very badly damaged from an accident in the river.
*  And now with this Neuralink, he can play video games.
*  He can do all kinds of shit.
*  And he said the cursor goes where his eyes go.
*  The cursor goes exactly where he wants it to go.
*  So he's like, I have a built-in aimbot if I'm playing video games.
*  Because I don't miss.
*  He's like, I can look right at it and I can shoot at things.
*  Which is pretty wild.
*  And it makes you think, okay, well, for soldiers, that's a must.
*  You have to give them that.
*  And that's, you know, some of the fighter jets, the new helmets that they have on now are augmented reality helmets.
*  And when they're flying the jets, as they're looking at a specific spot, that's where the crosshairs go.
*  So the crosshairs are connected to this AR.
*  Are we going to be doing that with jokes?
*  Like you just hit the punch line?
*  I think comedy is probably going to be one of the last places where the actual human experience exists in a pure form.
*  You know, it's one of several reasons why at the mothership we make people put their phones in a bag.
*  Like, get that out of your head.
*  Yeah.
*  Stop looking at that.
*  Just sit down and watch a show.
*  Huge difference.
*  It's a giant difference.
*  But if we could still have things like that, it'll remind us of what it's like to be a human.
*  You know, I feel like the movies have kind of gone away.
*  Going to the movie theater, I stopped.
*  Well, I stopped during the pandemic because you couldn't go.
*  And then I was like, oh, this is way better.
*  If you have a nice TV at home and no one's going to interrupt and, you know, there's something about that kind of taking a girl on a date.
*  But, oh, yeah, I remember I went everybody had to be six feet apart and, you know, two people in each row.
*  And that's all made up.
*  When they found out six.
*  Oh, he's like six feet.
*  It was out there.
*  I didn't I didn't make up the rules.
*  It was out there.
*  From this flu when we didn't even have fucking electricity back then.
*  Well, there's no it doesn't make sense.
*  It's in the air.
*  It's a respiratory virus.
*  They've never ever in the history of human beings been able to contain a respiratory virus.
*  You can't do it.
*  If a respiratory virus gets out to a certain number of people and it starts spreading through certain population, it's just going to.
*  And it also has animal reservoirs.
*  So one of the things that it actually can exist in certain animals.
*  In fact, in deer, they tested a bunch of white tailed deer, just wild deer and a bunch of them tested positive for covid-19.
*  Are we going to look back this that six there's still six feet stand six feet apart at the airport.
*  It's so fucking stupid.
*  It's so stupid, but it was all a thing where people looked for something to make them feel better.
*  Right.
*  So even though masks didn't work, even though six foot distancing didn't work, if you were out in public and you knew that covid was a thing and there wasn't some sort of fake measure that made you at least feel safe.
*  Like you have to stand a little bit apart from each other.
*  You have to wear the mask.
*  We're going to be OK if we follow these rules.
*  We took the vaccine.
*  We took the vaccine.
*  We're standing six feet away.
*  We're wearing a mask.
*  And so all those things, even though none of those things kept you from getting covid zero of those things kept you from getting covid.
*  In fact, there's more evidence now that the more of those shots you take, the more you get covid.
*  There's a bunch of different reasons for that, but I'm not a virologist or biologist.
*  But those things at least kept people thinking that they were doing the right thing and that maybe they're going to be safe instead of just a freak out of a bunch of people with no masks and a wild disease.
*  That we've been told is going to kill everybody.
*  I saw the clip of him saying, you know, master, they'll make you feel better.
*  And so I thought, OK, that makes sense.
*  Nobody said in that clip.
*  Yeah, it's not going to help.
*  It's not going to help.
*  And then where one then people start wearing to.
*  Yeah, he was wearing to.
*  Yeah, you got to wear to then wear a face shield and put a fucking diaper over your fucking head.
*  The where to is just like the woke shit in San Francisco.
*  It never stops.
*  It would go to where a beekeeper's outfit would go further.
*  If they let it stay on.
*  I wear two masks now.
*  I feel more protected.
*  Yeah.
*  Wrap yourself in plastic and just stay underwater.
*  It's amazing how that guy can gaslight.
*  It's amazing.
*  He does it and his hands fidget in the most obvious body language.
*  Oh, he's fucking.
*  I love watching him when he's in Congress, when they're when they're interrogating him.
*  It's a political theater, Ron.
*  It's all misinformation and disinformation.
*  Yeah.
*  He's well he's well prepared to gaslight.
*  But how can people still watch him and go, yeah, you know, we did the right thing.
*  Even in that audio that you were talking about.
*  Yeah.
*  He said, would you make people's lives difficult?
*  Yeah.
*  It will drop their ideological bullshit and get vaccinated.
*  Fucking worked.
*  He said in when they were when they were quizzing him on this, when they were asking him about this and confronting him with this, he said, that's not what I meant.
*  Yeah, he's sick.
*  He's a sick mad scientist.
*  What could you possibly have meant other than what you said?
*  If you're that guy.
*  Yeah.
*  This is not like a thought experiment.
*  You're hanging out with buddies like imagine if you were a guy.
*  You would tell people.
*  No, that's not what that was.
*  That was you, the head of the NIH, you, the head of our America's coronavirus task force.
*  You're the big guy.
*  You're the one America looks to for the answers.
*  And you're saying that.
*  Yeah.
*  Shame them.
*  And it.
*  But God, did that work, man?
*  That was what I what I learned from that was how hard it is to stand up for something you believe in.
*  God damn to go.
*  I'm going to do this and I'm going to you start to see your friends disappear.
*  Your family.
*  And I wasn't allowed home for Christmas.
*  Yeah.
*  I had to sit outside on a porch with half my family outside wearing masks on and I'm standing on the other side.
*  It's 38 degrees out.
*  Wow.
*  And I'm going, what am I like, like the first AIDS patient here?
*  How do they respond to that now?
*  They apologize?
*  No, no, it's just it.
*  Well, no, it's just everything's just back.
*  We're just back.
*  We're back open.
*  You know, it's but that's do you think that's just human nature?
*  Like we're going to.
*  People are cowards.
*  People are cowards.
*  And there's like a mass psychosis that happens.
*  Like everybody collectively panicked in the face of this fear that we'd never experienced before, like a global pandemic in our lifetime.
*  And then people fell apart.
*  Like that's what happens to people when they get pressured.
*  There's a lot of people out there that have never really experienced actual pressure in their life.
*  So when something scary like a virus comes into their life, they fold up like a house of cards.
*  They just can't take it.
*  They don't know what the fuck to do.
*  And they don't have any personal sovereignty.
*  So they don't have the ability to go.
*  Wait, what?
*  What is everyone saying?
*  That doesn't make any sense.
*  Why am I going to do that?
*  What are the consequences?
*  What?
*  How much do we know about pharmaceutical drug companies?
*  Have they ever lied before?
*  Oh, they have.
*  Have they ever been fine?
*  Are the most fines in medical history?
*  OK, what are these studies?
*  Like how long did they take to do these studies?
*  Like it's a hundred percent effective.
*  What does that mean?
*  How do they define a hundred percent effective?
*  Does that mean if you take it, you definitely won't get covid?
*  Because that's what I thought it meant.
*  Do you know what it meant and a hundred percent effective in stopping death in the vaccine?
*  Robert Kennedy explains to me this is his words, not mine.
*  But if he's right, it's the craziest fucking thing I've ever heard in my life.
*  And I think he's right.
*  In the placebo group, two people died.
*  I'm going to do his voice while you talk if you don't mind.
*  Don't do that.
*  In the placebo group, two people died from covid.
*  In the vaccine group, one person died.
*  Two is a hundred percent more than one.
*  So it's one hundred percent effective.
*  Imagine that.
*  Imagine that kind of math.
*  That's that's Fauci kind of gaslight.
*  Nobody really knew.
*  Nobody knew.
*  It's like a hundred percent effective.
*  So you get people like Rachel Maddow on TV telling you that the virus stops with you.
*  You can't you can't get infected.
*  You can't transmit.
*  And then they never even they had to admit later in European court that they never even tested it for transmission.
*  It was never tested for transmission.
*  Who who hears that and is going to go, well, fuck it.
*  No, everyone's like, yeah, yeah, I get I get to be the hero.
*  I get to get the shot.
*  Yeah. And I get to end it.
*  I end that's how you get to put it on your fucking Instagram.
*  Yeah.
*  I got back.
*  And you know what?
*  Fucking fine.
*  But don't shame the people who just made the decision that it's not for me.
*  I never said one negative thing about the vaccine or who got it.
*  And God damn, dude, even in the in the standup scene, I was a far right QAnon.
*  All the fucking things.
*  Yeah.
*  Horse medicine guy.
*  You know, you know, it's like, listen, man, I got it on CNN.
*  I know it.
*  I know it more than anybody knows it.
*  I know.
*  Well, Chris Cuomo would not.
*  You see the Dave Smith.
*  Dude, Dave Smith.
*  Fuck.
*  Lit him on fire.
*  God, he lit him on fire on his corpse.
*  That piece of shit that that clip actually I made.
*  I did an impression of you doing an impression of Don Lemon.
*  Dude, wait, you know, don't get the vaccine.
*  Can't go to work.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't get the vaccine.
*  You can't take a poop.
*  Don't get the vaccine.
*  Unbelievable that that is on national television and that clip lives on and they get to just
*  get away with it.
*  I remember when I was talking about him and Chris Cuomo, when he's talking about people
*  injecting veterinary medicine and then Chris Cuomo saying, Ivermectin, a dewormer.
*  Like the stupidity in which they were describing on cable television.
*  Like, first of all, you're not injecting anything, you fucking idiot.
*  You're taking a small pill that's one of the safest drug profiles of any drug in recorded
*  history.
*  And then you're taking a pill that's one of the safest drugs in the world.
*  And then you're taking a pill that's one of the safest drugs in the world.
*  And then you're taking a pill that's one of the safest drugs in the world.
*  And then you're taking a pill that's one of the safest drugs in the world.
*  And then you're taking a pill that's one of the safest drugs in the world.
*  And then you're taking a pill that's one of the safest drugs in the world.
*  And then you're taking a pill that's one of the safest drugs in the world.
*  And then you're taking a pill that's one of the safest drugs in the world.
*  And then you're taking a pill that's one of the safest drugs in the world.
*  Everybody has to take this experimental fucking rushed vaccine that Trump pushed the regulations.
*  Yeah, but you're missing the point.
*  The point is I was already better.
*  That's the dumbest part about this.
*  The dumbest part about it.
*  Let them experiment, let them not experiment.
*  That's not the point.
*  The point was I got better really quick.
*  Which is hooray.
*  Yeah, but they didn't want that.
*  So that's when the machine moved and, you know, they went with this horse dewormer narrative
*  because they were worried that other people were going to start taking ivermectin.
*  I took a bunch of things and I talked about all.
*  I didn't say ivermectin by itself.
*  I said IV vitamins, monoclonal antibodies, Z packs.
*  I said I literally gave the list of different things.
*  There was some cordist.
*  What is that stuff called?
*  There was some sort of a steroid that I took too.
*  You were better like in two days or something, right?
*  Yeah, quick.
*  Holy shit.
*  Like quick.
*  How old are you?
*  Like it was gone, 56.
*  God damn.
*  I was working.
*  I did 10 rounds on the bag six days later.
*  I was like, let's see what's going on because the only way to really see what's going on,
*  see if I have endurance.
*  Yeah.
*  I did 10 rounds on the bag.
*  I was nothing.
*  Five days in, I did a workout and I tried it.
*  I was like, I feel pretty good.
*  I don't want to like relapse because I kept hearing that people would work out too quick
*  and they'd relapse.
*  So I said, let me just go through like a decent workout and see how I feel.
*  If I feel at all drained or tired, I'm pretty in tune, which is, you know, how I knew something
*  was wrong in the first place.
*  I'm pretty tuned in to my body.
*  And then the next day I said, all right, let's fucking push it.
*  Let's see what's up.
*  And I pushed it.
*  I felt 100%.
*  I was 100% six days later.
*  And I think I was 100% five days later.
*  I just didn't try.
*  So that was bad for the narrative because the narrative was this thing was super dangerous.
*  You know, you need to take a vaccine.
*  That's the only way through it.
*  And my doctor was saying, no, no, it's not as dangerous.
*  It's not as dangerous as they're saying, especially someone like you who works out every day
*  and takes vitamins every day and always eats healthy.
*  This is not the thing that's going to get you.
*  He's like, with the people that are dying, what I'm seeing is people with comorbidities.
*  He was explaining everything to me.
*  And he recommended a series of nutrients to take to prepare yourself to like pump up your immune system.
*  And he's like, but there's a bunch of things that you can take if you do get infected that will help you recover.
*  And that's what I took.
*  And it worked.
*  Yeah.
*  I think how many people could have perhaps replicated that.
*  They didn't want that.
*  In order to have the emergency use authorization so that they could make sure that everybody gets vaccinated,
*  they had to have no other treatments.
*  That's why they demonize ivermectin.
*  That's why they demonize hydroxychloroquine.
*  That's why they they kept a lot of people from getting monoclonal antibodies.
*  They didn't want any solution other than the one that was going to make them insane amounts of money.
*  And that's what they pushed for.
*  And we went through that.
*  And the thing is like, are did we learn?
*  That's the question.
*  Did we learn?
*  I don't think so.
*  I don't know.
*  I think a lot of people learned.
*  A lot of people.
*  And I think a lot of people.
*  You learned.
*  I learned, but I almost didn't survive it.
*  To go through that.
*  And I had no I had no bank account.
*  I had no money.
*  The money I was getting was from Comedy Club Cash.
*  And I had just gotten to the clubs in New York City.
*  And I decided I'm not I'm not going here's my papers to get in.
*  I'm not doing it.
*  I'm not doing it.
*  I fucking performed outside during those shows.
*  I was performing for free outside outside of comedy clubs.
*  And then once the vaccine is that we need your papers.
*  And I just said I can't do it.
*  I said OK take care.
*  Wow.
*  And and how long did you go from that to not doing stand up?
*  How many how many months did you not do stand up?
*  Well I started just doing videos in my living room.
*  I lost my fucking mind.
*  That's the thing is I and when I tour a lot of my fans you know went through a similar thing.
*  And so when I meet them after it's it's it's it's painful because everybody tells me the story.
*  I'm a firefighter.
*  I lost my job.
*  I'm a nurse.
*  I lost my job.
*  I lost my family.
*  I was isolated.
*  My my just met a guy.
*  His daughter killed herself because she couldn't practice her sports.
*  She was locked in her bedroom.
*  It's like the fucking damage that was done.
*  And to be able to stay steady during that and go all right I'm going to go through this now without any friends and being labeled this far right crazy person for just saying no thanks to the shot.
*  Yeah it it you can't believe you know what that does to you.
*  And so I just feel I feel so I feel so much for these people that did it and who's who stuck up to it.
*  Yeah I do too.
*  And I also feel for the people that got suckered into taking it and now they have like serious consequences or serious health problems.
*  You know I was ready to get vaccinated.
*  The UFC had allocated a bunch of vaccines for their employees because they were doing shows during the pandemic.
*  We did shows in the height of the pandemic with no crowds.
*  So the UFC has this place called the Apex Center and the Apex Center is a small arena that the UFC built and they built it to do like the day and why Tuesday night contender series and a bunch of different other fights that they filmed there.
*  And so we went there and they said we've got the vaccine so you can get vaccinated.
*  We saved one for if you want to get it.
*  I said OK great.
*  A lot of the UFC employees got it was the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.
*  And so I called up the doctor.
*  Hey can I get it today.
*  It was like the day of the fights.
*  He said I can't do it today.
*  You got to you have to come to the clinic.
*  Can you come on Monday.
*  And I said I can't come on Monday.
*  I got to go back Sunday.
*  I said but I'll be back in two weeks for the next fights.
*  We'll do it then.
*  In the time that I left the vaccine got pulled for blood clots and I knew two people that had strokes.
*  One guy that I met and another guy who was a friend of a guy that I met and they told me that they had strokes like within five days of getting vaccinated.
*  And I was like wait what.
*  And then they were saying I was reading the news story about it.
*  They're pulling they're pulling it because of blood clots.
*  I remember that these guys had got had like holy shit.
*  And I think I talked to the UFC.
*  I go hey man I don't want to take that.
*  And you know they one of the guys that I talked to there was like I agree with it.
*  Like you know I took it.
*  I don't know.
*  I think I feel OK but I know a guy I know everybody knew a guy that got fucked up.
*  Everybody somebody who got fucked up by it.
*  But it was like all of a sudden the genie had come out of the bottle because before that I was all in.
*  I was I was not in any way shape or form anti-vax.
*  And it doesn't make you anti-vax for not wanting to get one point is in fact I was at a I was having a conversation with one of the scientists that I talked to about this.
*  I was like maybe this would be good to get people that are these crazy people that are anti-vaccine to like wake up and recognize the importance of these things.
*  This is my mindset back then.
*  And so when that happened I decided like I'm not taking a chance with this thing.
*  Like this is too weird.
*  And then I knew another guy who had some sort of a heart problem from the Moderna one allegedly.
*  And then it just got it just started getting weirder and weirder.
*  And then when a couple of my friends got covered one of the things that happened is my whole family got covered.
*  And I was like well I should probably just get it.
*  And I was like if I get I was getting tested every day because we were doing the podcast.
*  Yeah. So the way we do the podcast to keep everybody safe is all the employees got tested security got tested.
*  I got tested everybody got tested and a couple of times we had to cancel shows because someone someone tested positive.
*  And then we all everybody had to keep getting tested.
*  We were very diligent about it.
*  But my whole family got it.
*  My kids got it and they were fine.
*  Like they skated through it like one day two days.
*  They felt great.
*  Like this was early early days like no vaccine.
*  No one knew what the fuck the treatment was.
*  My wife got it.
*  She took Ivermectin because they were actually prescribing it back then and her doctor prescribed it back then.
*  This is the early early days.
*  Yeah I didn't get it but I did feel not good.
*  But I was in the house man.
*  I hugged the kids and they were like you're going to get it.
*  I'm like I'm not going to get it.
*  I was like it was a joke.
*  We were joking around because like they weren't even that sick.
*  And my wife got it worse than them for sure.
*  But I didn't get it.
*  And I kept working out.
*  I was working out and I remember one day I worked out and I didn't feel good.
*  I was like man I feel fucking weak.
*  And I was like I'm just going to do like use like lighter weights and just go through like three series of this routine that I do just light and easy.
*  Don't push it.
*  Just just get the blood flowing a little bit.
*  And then the next day I went back to the gym and I did the same thing.
*  I started working.
*  I was like I don't fucking feel that good.
*  Like I still feel a little off.
*  Like let's just do the same thing.
*  Nice and light.
*  Just go through the motions not pushing anything.
*  And then the next day I went in and I felt fucking great.
*  I'm like OK it's gone.
*  Whatever it was it's gone.
*  Damn.
*  I tested every day.
*  Never tested positive for it.
*  But my body clearly was fighting something.
*  There's something going on.
*  And I because I'm so in tune with it I recognize that I didn't push.
*  I do have some friends though that are meatheads and they also felt that same thing.
*  And they were doing jujitsu and they just kept training really hard and they got real sick.
*  Because if you get sick while you're broken down from training like if you have a really hard really hard workout is the whole thing is it makes your body stronger because it breaks you down and then your body has to build back up again.
*  I got to have to help help help build a body here.
*  You can have a son's been working out.
*  We can have you come in.
*  I do laps in my hot tub man.
*  That's as much as I do.
*  I don't need much.
*  Well you should do a little something.
*  You don't have to do anything rigorous.
*  You actually I heard you.
*  I heard you say once do a hundred push ups a day and it'll change your life and it fucking did just I couldn't do you know I did 50 now I could do a hundred.
*  No problem.
*  Yeah.
*  And my whole everything it's like you got to be able to you got to do what you're willing to do.
*  We got to have some activity.
*  Yeah.
*  Your body needs activity.
*  Your body.
*  So the point is if you break yourself down from really hard workouts you will get fucking sick sick like the sickest I've ever been is when I got sick because I was working out really hard because when that happens then it hits you and you just fucking get wrecked.
*  And I knew a bunch of people that did that but just got to be smart.
*  Yeah.
*  And so a lot of tough guys are not smart because they're just too tough too tough and they make these decisions like I'll just fucking power through.
*  Our ape brain our man cave brain you know it takes over.
*  It does but that's also what makes you successful that stupid part of your brain that could just power through things.
*  That's what makes you get up in the morning that's it gives you discipline.
*  Yeah.
*  But that also can fuck you up.
*  It can fuck you up.
*  Yeah it can fuck you have to know you have to be the general of the army.
*  Yeah.
*  You have to understand what's going on.
*  You can't always just be the soldier.
*  Sometimes you have to be strategic about it like no no no hold is not the time to attack.
*  Well you need people you you really trust who can tell you.
*  I mean I the weekend that I felt just filmed I've stayed up for three days straight to finish editing it.
*  So I've never done that.
*  And I remember doing it going this is I don't know if this is really stupid or really smart but Biden could die any day and half of your set is about Biden.
*  The wind could take him out man.
*  And so I just did three days you know a couple hours of sleep.
*  That's hilarious. It's like a race to see how supposed to film it in and end of August in Chicago.
*  And I go no if he dies this is useless.
*  This three years of honing these fucking jokes and that's such a crazy mindset.
*  I got to get it out before the president died.
*  I got to beat his funeral.
*  Oh my God.
*  Do you think do you think that they're going to put in Gavin Newsom.
*  Oh that's what I think.
*  I keep thinking like every day I'm waiting waiting for the big announcement in the news.
*  He is so repulsive man.
*  He's repulsive but he knows how to talk.
*  That's all and he's attractive.
*  God damn it. He's got a nice hair.
*  Hot privilege.
*  Yeah he's a smooth gas lighter and got that serial killer face though.
*  Super good at running a state into the ground.
*  He talks like he's rapping.
*  He's like yeah we're gonna shut down.
*  Yeah well it scares me.
*  It's very practiced.
*  He's a performer you know.
*  But that's what half this country wants.
*  They want someone who's just going to make them feel good enough to go to work every day.
*  Sure.
*  As their rights get eroded.
*  Yeah.
*  Slowly but surely.
*  Kamala Harris that would be interesting.
*  Even to have her for one day as president.
*  Bro they've been hiding that lady.
*  That would be interesting.
*  No.
*  No no no.
*  That's what Russia is going to attack.
*  You know I got kicked out of a comedy club for doing an impression of her.
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  They said it's no longer okay for a straight white guy to do an impression of a retarded hyena.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  What was the club?
*  It was like a makeshift thing during COVID.
*  It was this outdoor thing and I got thrown out.
*  They go you're racist.
*  I was like making fun of her.
*  Oh my God.
*  And I got thrown to the curb.
*  Wow.
*  Because I couldn't do the club so I was unvaccinated.
*  I hate saying unvaccinated.
*  That makes it sound like the vaccine.
*  It's like being I didn't get circumcised.
*  I don't like being called uncircumcised.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  So you can't un something that just is.
*  Right.
*  The dick and then the chop dick.
*  Yeah.
*  I hate that.
*  It is weird.
*  You have to be careful with the way we phrase you're unvaxxed.
*  It's like oh fuck it.
*  I'm just a human with blood.
*  Regular blood.
*  And you got Fauci juice.
*  Trump Fauci juice floating around your body.
*  Warp speed juice inside of you son.
*  Warp speed.
*  And so did the joke go over well?
*  Did it get a good laugh?
*  I was just kind of talking about race and stuff.
*  You're a racist.
*  And the manager came and physically threw me to the curb.
*  And I just remember what is going on?
*  When I started comedy, I started around the time of like Sam Merrill and Mark Normand.
*  And I started two years after them.
*  And we were still doing open mics.
*  You'd see Mark Normand on The Tonight Show and then back at the club.
*  Hey, hey comedy.
*  All right.
*  Hey, I'm fat.
*  Praise Allah.
*  Hey.
*  And we would say the craziest shit.
*  And it made you good.
*  And then suddenly it was like you can't say this.
*  You can't say that.
*  You can't say that.
*  And it's all made up.
*  It's all made up.
*  Well, it all happened during the Obama administration.
*  It was a wave of it.
*  And like Dave Smith has tracked it.
*  It's really interesting to describe it.
*  Yeah.
*  He describes like when the phrases, all the different catchphrases that all of it's around 2012.
*  That's like this big ramp up of all these things.
*  Racism, all these ideas, transphobia, all this big ramp up of all these issues happened around 2012.
*  I'm transphobic, but that just means because I'm afraid of them.
*  Joe, I've gone out with two by accident.
*  Yeah.
*  I used to do online dating and they would have good angles.
*  The surgery is getting good too.
*  And if they're Asian, game over.
*  Game over.
*  So I was on a date with a black woman.
*  It turned out to be a man.
*  And I had a complete mental breakdown.
*  I ran in the bathroom.
*  I called my friend.
*  I go out with a dude and he wants to fuck me.
*  He wants to take me home.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That happened twice.
*  So did they explain to you that they had a dick?
*  No.
*  No.
*  No?
*  If you're dealing with someone who has a man, I'm not saying all people that, I don't even think trans is it.
*  It's all fucking just makes you have a seizure.
*  But no, they don't, a lot of them don't tell you.
*  Well, a lot of them feel like you don't have to tell.
*  I was actually watching a podcast where a comic was arguing that you shouldn't have to tell someone that you're trans if you're dating them.
*  Even if you're having sex with them.
*  Hmm.
*  Well, you're gonna find out.
*  A comic was arguing that.
*  When they're fucking vagina.
*  And they were doing it in just this woke, compliant way.
*  It wasn't like they had a well thought out point.
*  It was just like, yeah, why should you have to tell people?
*  Like, what the fuck are you talking about?
*  What are you talking about?
*  You should tell people if you have bad credit.
*  You should tell people.
*  You're gonna get involved in a romantic relationship with someone and you owe the government $100,000 in taxes.
*  You should have to fucking tell people that.
*  Like, I might be in trouble.
*  I might have to run to Costa Rica.
*  You should have to tell people a lot of things.
*  Yeah, well, that's the new way.
*  It's just this compliance for all this new shit that didn't exist a couple years ago.
*  Well, the thing is that they want to say that trans women are women.
*  So why should they have to tell you?
*  I think it's transphobic to call somebody trans.
*  Because if they're an actual woman, they're just a woman.
*  So why are you calling them trans?
*  You can't transition if you were born a woman and you feel like a woman.
*  You really want to support people like this?
*  Trans shouldn't be on the fucking table.
*  That's a woman.
*  With a dick though.
*  With the dick.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's how you say trans woman.
*  The woman with the dick?
*  Just so to let everybody know.
*  Just say woman with a dick.
*  A dick person, yeah.
*  A dick holding person.
*  Dick holding person.
*  For now.
*  Dick halving person.
*  To get rid of the dick.
*  Oh man.
*  I wonder if that's the thing.
*  I wonder if I've ever even.
*  No boy no.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  They should show the surgery.
*  You want kids to get involved.
*  They should show the surgery of taking your forearm skin and building a penis.
*  It's hard enough having God giving penis.
*  Imagine one built by a bunch of arteries.
*  That one's scary, but that one doesn't take away your vagina.
*  The scary one is the penis to a vagina.
*  They take it off.
*  They fold it in really.
*  They make an opening in your body.
*  And then you have to keep it dilated all the time.
*  So you have to shove something up there to make sure it doesn't close up like a fucking ear piercing.
*  Yo.
*  Man.
*  Yo.
*  One day they're going to be able to do gene therapy.
*  And they're going to be able to literally transform someone into a woman.
*  That's not off the table.
*  They're going to be able to do that.
*  And you know some animals can do that.
*  That's one of the funniest things that Alex Jones got called out for.
*  The turn of the frogs, gay.
*  But that's a real thing.
*  Atrazine.
*  It's a it's pesticide or an herbicide.
*  They got it in with these frogs and half of the frogs change their gender.
*  Like here it is.
*  Atrazine is an herbicide and endocrine disruptor that can harm the sexual development of frogs by altering their hormone cycles.
*  Exposure to atrazine at concentrations as low as 0.1 parts per billion can cause gonadal malformations including hermaphrodites and males with multiple testes.
*  Atrazine can also chemically castrate male frogs turning them into females or demasculizing them.
*  That's kind of happening anyways in New York City.
*  They're doing it to men.
*  You see I walk around and you see these couples where the female looks like the guy and the man looks more feminine.
*  Men are just being emasculated.
*  If they allow it.
*  But a lot of them.
*  A lot of them allow it.
*  I was one of those guys.
*  Because when the options are all of these women.
*  This is the options.
*  Women create the sexual marketplace and men kind of dictate their behavior.
*  Imagine if you and I were left to our own devices with no kind of woman to kind of keep you in check.
*  So men have been adapting.
*  Vikings.
*  That's where Vikings came from.
*  That's where pirates came from.
*  You leave men alone and not have a bunch of women around going hey slow the fuck down.
*  Slow it down.
*  Then you have battle axes.
*  Boats full of savages storming villages.
*  Yeah.
*  The capital.
*  Yeah.
*  And so that's the overcorrection.
*  That's the overcorrection is you get these incredibly feminized men.
*  And one of the ways that happens is jobs.
*  Right.
*  So you have a job and you are in this social structure for eight hours a day that is very unnatural and weird.
*  And most companies have DEI scores and most companies have all these different requirements and they're openly allowed to discriminate against especially heterosexual white men.
*  I may know one or two things about that.
*  Yeah.
*  There was a thing that Elon tweeted I think today or yesterday in response to one of these things at Disney where one of the guys at Disney like openly said I would never hire a gay.
*  I would never hire a straight white man.
*  Like I have that on tape.
*  You know I have a lawsuit.
*  Well that's why I'm bringing it up.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean so you and I talked about it in the green room and tell your story.
*  Tell what happened and how this all this shit fest.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's quite it's quite a long story.
*  I mean it I started when I started comedy and started I've been doing 20 years.
*  So I've been I've been on TV TV shows guest stars co-stars.
*  You never really heard you know that's too many white guys or you know it's getting a little too white.
*  And I remember like at comedy clubs you just start to hear people say you know there's too many white guys too many fucking white guys.
*  And then it became it became quite popular to just start to say there's too many of you guys.
*  So what do you do.
*  You know you got to get rid of them.
*  You know the first time it happened to me I was invited to do a podcast.
*  So woman she was a lesbian.
*  She wanted me to come on and tell the story of being raised by gay men.
*  She goes I think this will be good to bridge our two fan bases so people can hear it from a straight guy's point of view of what it's like to kind of grow up and around.
*  You know I grew up in gay bars and piano bars and drag shows and I'm kind of the long term study for what it does to you.
*  It fucks you up.
*  You know I started to think maybe I'm gay maybe I'm you know I tried in college actually I was going home to visit my family.
*  I tried kissing a guy just because I felt like I needed to fit in this shit really it really.
*  How'd that go.
*  Oh he was like get the fuck away from me.
*  I remember I was in the car and just going like fuck maybe I'm gay my dad's gay I got a gay brother.
*  One of my dad's brother's gay I think my grandfather it's you know it's just genetic.
*  Yeah it's genetic.
*  And I just I mean it goes get the fuck away from me because I just wanted to fit in.
*  I wanted something to talk about at Thanksgiving dinner.
*  Right.
*  I wanted to be the gay you know.
*  Yeah.
*  It's so peer pressure.
*  Peer pressure.
*  This girl invited me on to talk about this and she was a friend.
*  She texts me and she goes I think this was after the George Floyd thing maybe and she goes I can't have a straight white guy on anymore.
*  And I remember just going like what the fuck.
*  You can't have me on just because I'm my skin color.
*  What changed.
*  It was the during the BLM stuff that stuff really ramped up it became kind of I think celebratory to go fuck white people fucking white women white you know.
*  Right.
*  I think it became normalized a little way to know any amount is too much but it became celebrated in a way.
*  And so that happened and then it happened another podcast and then I was I had an acting agent who whenever I would do stand I used to host Mark Norman show hot soup and all the agents would come and every you know every couple months I'm going to go why aren't you on SNL we got to get you in Holly why aren't you.
*  And I'd go well sure well sign me get send me you need auditions.
*  And so this guy saw him and he brought me in it was the biggest agency at the time Abrams it was called and I'm waiting around going what's going on no auditions is SNL coming to check me out and he any emails and he goes too tough out there for white guys.
*  He kind of was like we're done here.
*  The next day fires me removes me right when the next day it was soon after removed me from the roster I got an email.
*  Some more time went by and then another manager scouted me brought me in it's called AGI entertainment I think and he goes dude you're you're a killer he goes you got an acting resume he goes we're going to get you on curb your enthusiasm.
*  You know and I was like okay maybe this is finally somebody who's got the balls to to fight this shit.
*  Months go by he calls me and he goes we hit a snag he said we we don't we can't have any more white guys or we're not hiring white guys we're not representing white guys and I and I just was like what the fuck is going on how could you say that.
*  And I go is it company policy and he goes yeah.
*  So halfway through the conversation I take my phone out because this happened so many times I was literally I was losing my fucking mind my therapist goes dude you got to start recording this you have to record this stuff because it was happening every month.
*  I got a commercial campaign they go you've been replaced with the black woman he goes you're the you're the guy for the job.
*  It was like a hosting thing where you got to impressions I was perfect for it they replaced me so I started you know being prepared and I recorded it and I got it on tape and I just what did you get on tape what he said I got him I got him literally saying we will not represent white men and it's company policy.
*  He said it in plain it's not it couldn't be any more clear.
*  He said we cannot work with you just because your skin color and where were you when you recorded this were you in New York.
*  Yeah I was in New York so you're allowed you're allowed to do that yeah yeah I didn't even know that you have to tell them that you're recording no no no sitting at my pie did like a little because I couldn't work because the vaccine stuff so I was just locked in my room for two years making Instagram videos.
*  I mean I went from zero to a million over a million followers just from I was doing Fauci every day doing cameos going on the radio is Fauci is wow and it was just bizarre and but it did it it it fucked me up because it was so it's so confusing to have someone go you are the man for the job I had a great resume I mean I was I was being considered for big Hollywood roles.
*  I was brought in for a sneaky Pete Giovanni Robisi I was up for that role and making my own films and yeah it fucked me up I got really depressed I lost my mind.
*  And so when you recorded this on tape what happened after you recorded it on tape.
*  After that I was too afraid because when I would tell people about this they would go well whatever white guys have had it good you know I'm going I just fucking got here.
*  But isn't that one of the things that someone said to you like white guys have had a good run.
*  People say that to me all the time.
*  Wasn't that one of the things that one of the agents had said to you.
*  I mean I don't know if an agent said that but but you were telling me that someone said it to you.
*  Comedy yeah comedy clubs a lot of not necessarily clubs but like the independent run shows there would be no there would be like no white people allowed shows.
*  What yeah oh yeah oh yeah yeah I was at a club and I did a spot guy goes you going on the next show and I go yeah he goes I didn't know you were in the LGBT plus 2 RQR community and I go what he goes yeah it's only no straight people allowed.
*  I was like what the fuck.
*  What the fuck is going on.
*  And so I after that I waited a while.
*  I talked to my there I just didn't know what to do because I didn't want that to become a force of its own.
*  I wanted to have my talent lead the way which it had always been doing.
*  And it's tough to have people call you say you're oh you're you're just being a victim or whatever and it's like yes sometimes you're a victim and you have to fight it to heal from it and to move on from it and so I thought if I don't fight this I'm going to kill myself because it was so it's so humiliating to have someone go your skin color is just it's just not the time for it.
*  And so I just thought I'm going to go for it and I just put it on Instagram I said hey I just got turned down for being white any attorneys out there and one guy reached out because I'm a discrimination attorney he goes this is one of the most clear acts of discrimination I've ever seen.
*  He said it's so clear cut.
*  And so that was a couple years ago so it's an ongoing thing these things take a long time but.
*  And so what are you you're suing for discrimination is that we're suing for yeah yeah yeah every every race is protected under the civil you know civil rights laws that there's no.
*  Isn't that crazy though that they would think they're so in captured by this fucking mind virus that they would think it's okay to be racist to white people.
*  Not only okay but like sell celebratory.
*  Yeah you know why yeah and I don't let people fucking do that to me people think I'm just this nice little I'm a fucking animal.
*  When you grow up in a crazy environment and you survive it man it's like fucking come at me and I said I'm going to it's a hill I'll die on I don't care.
*  I was like this is war we are in a full blown culture war and and all I would give up everything for it.
*  Because I also owe it to you know people that can't fight for themselves I had this 10 year period where this shit wasn't going on I built up my acting chops my comedy chops with nobody saying you can't do that you can't say that.
*  And so I had this kind of you know this this energy I got I have to no one's going to do it for you you know I saw Jordan Peterson you know fight for that bill C 16 thing.
*  Yeah and I go holy shit watching if it's worth watching the congressional hearing in Canada where he's explaining you can't compel speech you can't tell somebody you have to say my pronouns or you go to jail.
*  He's like this is going to get out of fucking control everything he said came true.
*  Yeah I had him on went at the beginning of that stuff and I remember people saying to me like why do you care about what happens these obscure moments that happen in these universities.
*  And I had Brett Weinstein on after the evergreen college thing same kind of thing.
*  And I was saying like you know these people are going to graduate.
*  Do you understand what this is the future. Yeah. These attitudes that are being in these kids are being indoctrinated into these mindsets they're going to expand and they're going to be involved in the workplace and they're going to be involved in politics and culture.
*  This mind virus is going to go everywhere and you got to say what it is you got to you got to call it out when you see it.
*  This is kind of kind of crazy and obviously all these years later I mean this was like 2016 I guess.
*  Yeah. So here we are you know.
*  Well he's part of the reason I pursued this Jordan because I just he's like you have to tell the truth.
*  Tell the truth. That's it. Tell the truth or tell the truth or at least don't lie.
*  You know it's like well it's like you can't bloody compel my speech you know.
*  That's pretty good. Clean your damn room you know it's like finger a cat rescue your father from the bell.
*  It's like well you know it's like you know.
*  You know why because I was in a little emasculated little he him living in New York and I would sit in my room and watch his lectures with my fucking head would explode.
*  I go oh this is all the shit that I think and feel but I haven't been able to articulate.
*  He's a brilliant guy.
*  And my life that my life changed forever. Once I heard him say that tell the truth at least don't lie and my life has changed.
*  That video of him with Kathy Newman. Have you seen that.
*  That's amazing. I watch that every week. It's amazing.
*  It's a master class and how people will try to bend your way and he does not bend.
*  He'd be like well you know women need to like contend in the workplace.
*  So what you're saying is women should just be raped in the break room.
*  It's like no it's like I'm not saying that.
*  It's a funny conversation because it's all that gotcha shit gone wrong because you're doing it with a skilled person a skilled linguist and someone who really understands what he's saying.
*  And has a deep understanding of the history of Marxist and Leninist philosophy and what what it leads to what communism and socialism actually leads to what you're actually saying is you by in by forcing people to comply.
*  There's only one way you force people to comply and that's violence.
*  That is the only way.
*  Ultimately it will we're going to put you in jail.
*  What happens if I resist we're going to kill you.
*  It gets to that.
*  It gets to violence.
*  We're going to grab you.
*  We're going to hunt you down.
*  We're going to put you in a cage and then we're going to force everybody else to comply as well.
*  And this is what he's saying is like you cannot go down this path if you do not know where it leads to.
*  You can't think you're being virtuous by standing up for this disenfranchised and imposing this especially the gender pronoun thing which at that point in time there was 78 different recognized gender pronouns.
*  Yeah.
*  Who knows how many there are now.
*  Like now it's not.
*  Thousands.
*  It's just like people just make things up.
*  And that's what's the fun thing about tick tock.
*  China is so clever.
*  Oh my god.
*  They're so good with tick tock is so good.
*  It's so they're so smart what they did.
*  And then to show you these outrageous people over and over again with fake eyelashes reading stories to kids just freaking everybody out with a bunch of different you know I'm two spirit and I'm this and that and I'm trans masculine with like fucking the whole thing is just nuts.
*  And then shutting down free speech.
*  I mean I've been I've been banned for shut down for three years.
*  They froze my I was going all my pandemic shit all they talked.
*  They banned you.
*  What'd you do.
*  Well they don't have to tell you.
*  They don't have to be in white boy.
*  I was texting while white.
*  They don't have to tell you that's part of when you sign up.
*  Right.
*  Especially tick tock and it's common it's a communist Chinese.
*  We are let it's an act of war living in our pocket.
*  I don't use it.
*  I can't believe it.
*  The one I don't use.
*  Well I was telling you I changed my name to queer disabled comedian and suddenly they let me I started getting ad offers from tick tock.
*  They just like they.
*  And then when I did the bit about where I come out on stage is gay.
*  That was the first video that they let kind of through because I because the algorithm let it through.
*  Probably get reviewed eventually.
*  Yeah it just got removed.
*  I just posted it again because I'm like fuck you.
*  So I keep posting these things over and over.
*  You just posted under different names.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah my youngest daughter is obsessed with the vegan teacher.
*  The vegan teachers is crazy lady on tick tock.
*  That's like this crazy vegan lady and she keeps getting banned.
*  So they keep bringing her.
*  She keeps making up new accounts and coming back.
*  So that's what I do on stage.
*  I keep coming up with new identities to see what I can get away with.
*  What is this?
*  Oh this is his.
*  Yeah that's been frozen for three years.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And look at the first video.
*  Like that's how many views all of my videos used to get.
*  3.1 million.
*  Yeah I was blowing up like I was getting like 10 20 thousand followers a day.
*  And then.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  And that's the difference between a comic selling out a theater and half fill in a club.
*  Yeah.
*  You know that type of exposure.
*  Oh for sure.
*  Especially a comic like you is actually very funny.
*  When you have these messages that come and say that your account's being frozen.
*  They don't give you any reason.
*  Do they say noncompliance or community standards.
*  They can say disinformation.
*  Hateful behavior.
*  What did they say?
*  Each one is different.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like each video.
*  When they pulled your account what did they say?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Hateful behavior.
*  My Instagram got pulled too.
*  No.
*  Oh bro that's when I lost it.
*  When did that get pulled?
*  That was the only.
*  It's back now right?
*  It's back.
*  I by the grace of God I met somebody outside the comedy cellar.
*  And she goes can I follow you on Instagram?
*  I said no.
*  They just banned my account.
*  And that was the only way I was making money.
*  Was selling tickets from my Instagram videos and going on the road.
*  And this girl said I.
*  She goes I just quit working there.
*  And I said can they just turn you off and on?
*  She goes yeah.
*  I go can you have my account turned back on?
*  She goes absolutely.
*  I gave her my information.
*  She sent it to somebody on Instagram.
*  They just flipped the switch back on the next day I was back.
*  So is it just completely subjective based on what an employee decides?
*  That you're offensive?
*  Yes.
*  They have a whole fucking department.
*  And if they go well they got two complaints or whatever.
*  He's being transphobic or whatever the fuck bullshit is going on at the time.
*  And you can't have that with art.
*  No especially not comedy.
*  Especially not comedy.
*  I mean the whole idea is to push limits.
*  And the whole idea is to like walk that crazy line.
*  And say wild shit for fun.
*  It's just for fun.
*  These aren't like.
*  You can't put them in the same categories as hate speech.
*  Because no one's trying to be hateful.
*  They're just trying to get laughs.
*  And they're getting laughs often times by saying something that the audience knows they don't mean.
*  They're saying it because it's funny.
*  Not because it's true.
*  Not because they want you to think it's true.
*  Because it's a ridiculous thing to say.
*  And it's a funny thing to say.
*  And when you hear the audience laugh.
*  That means it worked.
*  It was effective.
*  It doesn't mean you can then put that in print and say that this is an anti-LBGTQT.
*  Who gets to decide?
*  Plus AI2.
*  Who gets to decide?
*  It's like pointing to a random person in the crowd at the mothership going.
*  You get to pick what's hateful and what's not.
*  And what comedians get to perform.
*  Exactly.
*  But also to have random people working at Instagram that get to decide that.
*  Or TikTok.
*  They just get to decide that.
*  That's so crazy.
*  And thank God for Elon Musk and Twitter.
*  And X now.
*  Whatever.
*  I'm never calling it X.
*  I hate that.
*  Well, porn pops.
*  It's kind of crazy that they have porn on it.
*  But that was always the thing.
*  No, but I mean every porn site is like XXX.
*  So you type it in and usually a porn site pops up.
*  Well, that's maybe your browsing history, sir.
*  Well, that's talking about a friend of mine.
*  But at least on that site you don't have to worry about that shit.
*  You can get wild.
*  You can do whatever the fuck you want there.
*  I got banned the day or week he actually I had his attorney reach out to him personally.
*  Because I was banned right before he started.
*  And I go, oh, Elon's taking over.
*  They're going to give me my account back.
*  And you know, it just didn't happen.
*  And I was doing an RFK fundraiser.
*  I was doing stand up with RFK Jr.
*  And his attorney, Elon's attorney was there.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And he and she texted him or something.
*  So I'll get a pretty cool.
*  We'll turn it back on.
*  So it's pretty funny.
*  We'll get it going again.
*  Well, there's no way he could have known.
*  I mean, there's so there's so many fucking people on there about a bunch of people that had gotten unfairly banned,
*  including Megan Murphy, who got unfairly banned for saying that a man is never a woman.
*  They banned her forever.
*  Well, good.
*  But now she's back.
*  She's a feminist.
*  That's what's so crazy.
*  She was just arguing about that trans men or trans women are invading women's spaces and imposing masculine behavior and masculine character.
*  They're acting like men and taking over women's spaces.
*  Well, that was actually the only way to get a movie role for me.
*  I was in that Daily Wire Lady Ballers.
*  And I thought how funny that I get kind of canceled for being a white guy.
*  And now the first role actually, no, I was in the Western with Gina Carano.
*  Oh, the one with Cowboy?
*  Yeah.
*  Cowboy's. I had to kick him in the fucking nuts.
*  Did you beat the shit out of him?
*  That's hilarious.
*  That must have been terrifying.
*  Oh, we fought every day.
*  Yeah, he almost killed me.
*  That was a scene where they hit that guy.
*  No, not fake.
*  He goes, fucking get me in the nuts.
*  And he goes, so he had me actually kick him in the nuts.
*  Does he have a cup on?
*  No. And I was like, dude, if you're fucking with me and I do this and you kill me, this is not.
*  And he's like, fucking.
*  And I ran and kicked him in the nuts.
*  We had to do it like five times.
*  Oh my God.
*  That guy is an animal.
*  He's a savage.
*  He would be like, let's just improvise the fight scenes.
*  I'm like, I'm a Lego next to you, dude.
*  Yeah, he's too wild.
*  He's wild.
*  He's so crazy.
*  And Gina, man, she is a monster.
*  I mean, the stuff she had to do in that film every day, get fucking killed and raped and beat up.
*  And she, they found me on Instagram.
*  Wow.
*  I was on my couch depressed and I got a DM.
*  Do you want to interview or audition for the new Gina Carana movie?
*  That's great.
*  And she just, she's suing Disney right now.
*  Yeah. I think she should win.
*  I hope so.
*  What she did was to, I mean, the whole thing is just so, everyone's so crazy.
*  Everybody gets so nuts and it happens so fast.
*  It's a wild ride from like 2017 on.
*  It's like once Trump got into office, there was like all the women's marches.
*  Remember those?
*  Yeah, that's where I got pussy.
*  Yeah, but those were like everybody, they were women.
*  It was just women.
*  Yeah.
*  It wasn't like, what's a woman?
*  No.
*  Women are marching, pussy hats on.
*  There's no dudes in wigs.
*  And within a couple years, this mass wave of confusion just goes through the culture.
*  And everybody's at each other's throats on social media.
*  I never like interact on social media.
*  I just don't do it.
*  You can't.
*  I don't think it's good for you.
*  You can't.
*  Yeah.
*  I've taken the bait a couple times.
*  I mean, you know, it's, if you're just a regular person and then suddenly you start blowing up or whatever
*  and people are calling you all the worst possible names in the world.
*  Like, it's a little alarming at first and you want to defend yourself.
*  But now, I mean, you can't.
*  I think if you wanted to really engage people on actual ideas, you'd have to do it anonymously.
*  I think if you really want to like, if you want to have honest discussions with people publicly about stuff,
*  you're really better off doing it anonymously.
*  Because if you did it anonymously, and I don't have any desire to do this either,
*  but if you do it anonymously, at least you could.
*  There's no personal attacks.
*  No one knows who you are.
*  No one knows anything about you.
*  You could just talk about this issue, you know, whatever the issue is, like A.I., whatever it is,
*  whatever it is, is people are debating online.
*  You could have discussions about it, you know, like people do on like 4chan or something like that or Reddit.
*  Like you have a fucking crazy fake screen name.
*  No one has to know who you are.
*  And you can talk about things.
*  But if you're a public person like you are, and you're going like,
*  I see people arguing with people back and forth about the quality of their work.
*  Musicians arguing with fans or trolls about whether or not their last album was good.
*  I'm like, what are you doing, man?
*  You are inviting mental illness into your home.
*  You got to disconnect.
*  Disconnect, man.
*  Disconnect.
*  And most people are not disconnected because it is the one form of conflict that they can engage in
*  that doesn't really have consequences.
*  Unless you say something really crazy and then it goes public.
*  But that's pretty rare.
*  Most people are just attacking people like randomly getting out their aggression, just attacking people and engaging in arguments online.
*  It's like, my God.
*  It's a great distraction, though.
*  It's to make it in our industry.
*  It takes 100 percent of your time and effort.
*  I mean, I'm in I'm in almost 20 years to the point where I can now like not worry about feeding myself.
*  Well, you came to my attention because of the videos.
*  That's what I found out about you.
*  And then comics.
*  Comics will all have very high praise of you.
*  So that's a nice thing to know.
*  It's a nice thing to know.
*  And so.
*  Hey, hey, comedy.
*  But I remember that was actually Mark Norman laughing at your jokes when you were new was like the first tonight show.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And he would just go, ha.
*  So all the comics that became the way to let somebody know you were good.
*  Everyone would do the Mark Norman laugh.
*  So nobody would actually give a genuine laugh.
*  But if you're a hey, ha, ha, ha, you're like, all right.
*  Right. Someone says that's a good one.
*  Yeah, because a lot of times when someone has a really funny joke, I'm always like, ah, it's good.
*  That's good.
*  You know, that's the same thing.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know what I did actually, because I was so afraid to say what I actually thought, I started doing impressions because I would do my job.
*  I would get my real thoughts out through my impressions and people would link it to them.
*  So like I'd be talking about feminism, doing Bill Burr, be like, right.
*  I went out with this girl last night, this fucking cunt, right.
*  Actually, I got a toxic masculine rights.
*  Fucking brutal. Right.
*  I got to listen to that shit on a fucking Monday.
*  And everybody would erupt.
*  And I'd go, oh, my God, they think that was Bill Burr's thought.
*  That was me.
*  Right.
*  And so my whole act became, you know, just doing Trump, all sorts of stuff.
*  And I'm pulling back from that a little now that I have some balls.
*  I've grown some balls.
*  But it's still a fun way to do it.
*  It's still a fun way to do it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a fun, it's a nice little way that you can sneak things in.
*  You know.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you do it?
*  You're pretty good at them.
*  Impressions?
*  Yeah.
*  I have a limited range.
*  The ones that I do, I can do good, but I have a limited range.
*  Have you ever done them on stage?
*  Yeah.
*  I used to do a Mike Tyson impression.
*  Because Mike Tyson yelled at some guy in the audience that he would fuck him till he loved him.
*  And I was like, do you have any idea how long that would take?
*  And he would have to decide.
*  He would have to decide if you love him.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I remember that.
*  I could do Tyson.
*  I could do a few different people.
*  It's so funny when people say it's cheap or stupid.
*  I go, you just did an impression of your mom or the mailman.
*  Everybody's doing, you know.
*  Fuck those people.
*  Yeah.
*  Funny, funny.
*  It's funny, it's funny.
*  If it's good, it's good.
*  If it's not good, you won't laugh.
*  That's it.
*  End of story.
*  You need this later?
*  Yeah, thanks.
*  Anybody who says it's cheap is like, there's cheap stuff.
*  We all know cheap stuff, but cheap stuff's not impressions.
*  Some great people do great impressions, and it's part of the fun of watching them on stage.
*  Like when Shane does Trump.
*  It's so good.
*  It's so crazy good.
*  Or he does Conor McGregor.
*  It's like, it's fun.
*  I haven't heard of Conor McGregor.
*  Yeah, he does Conor McGregor in Roadhouse.
*  It's very funny.
*  But it's just, it's fun.
*  And the crowd loves it.
*  And you're there to please the crowd.
*  I'm one of the crowd.
*  I love it.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, this idea, this, this, it's all perpetrated by artists who can't, either can't do the impressions
*  or are under this false idea that there's like a way that you're supposed to do comedy.
*  Like there was an alt way that you're supposed to do comedy where you weren't supposed to try hard.
*  Oh God.
*  There was a lot of that.
*  And if you acted things out or you have too much energy, they didn't like you.
*  Like you were supposed to not try and you're supposed to just stand there and be kind of monotone-ish.
*  Yeah, that's why I didn't.
*  I don't really hang out with comedians.
*  Or I am now a little bit because it's a little more comfortable at the mothership.
*  But I didn't like those things getting in my head and then thinking, are these comics judging me in the back or whatever?
*  They probably are. Who cares?
*  They are.
*  They are.
*  All the ones who do suck.
*  But when you're new, when you're fresh and you're malleable, you know, you need to, you need to grow like a foundation.
*  Oh, a lot of people get sucked down that road.
*  You get sucked down that road in life and not just in comedy, but in pretty much every world, every community.
*  You get sucked into the ideas of the peers.
*  You want to fit in. You want to be one of them.
*  You got to lift the top, remember?
*  Oh.
*  Pop the top.
*  It's like the ideas of your peers.
*  You get sucked into this idea that this is the way I'm supposed to think and behave.
*  This is the way I'm supposed to perform my art.
*  This is supposed to way I'm...
*  Like when I first started out, everybody had to be clean.
*  You had to be a clean comedian.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Because when I started out, it was the 80s, the late 80s.
*  I started in 88 and that was the time where everybody wanted to get on The Tonight Show and everybody wanted to get a sitcom.
*  So you develop this like squeaky clean television friendly act.
*  And if you didn't have a squeaky clean television friendly act, oh, this fucking idiot.
*  He's just going to do the road.
*  You're just going to be a road act.
*  Damn.
*  And that's what I was.
*  I barely got work in town.
*  Did you ever do Carson or anything?
*  No.
*  No.
*  I never did any of those talk shows until I became a guest because I was on a television show, like on Fear Factor or something like that.
*  I just sat down and talked to Conan O'Brien, that kind of thing.
*  But I didn't do stand up on it.
*  First of all, because I didn't like that kind of stand up.
*  I didn't like five minutes.
*  That drove me nuts.
*  I had done a couple of things.
*  I did the MTV half hour comedy hour and a couple of those other TV type shows.
*  But that wasn't...
*  I wanted to be a club comic.
*  That's all I wanted to do.
*  I wanted to be a professional club comic.
*  And I remember everybody saying, you're never going to get work.
*  You're never going to get work.
*  And part of me was like, I don't...
*  I mean, I remember having this conversation once with this comic and he was the host of Open Mic Night.
*  And he said, listen, you got to change your actor.
*  You're never going to work.
*  And he was a professional.
*  And he was like doing okay.
*  He was pretty good, like a professional, like a local middle act type guy that had like a competent 20 minutes.
*  It was not bad.
*  It wasn't good.
*  But back then, I thought it was really good.
*  That's even that.
*  Because I was 21.
*  I saw him live before I ever got paid to do comedy.
*  I went to see Dom Irerra and he was one of the opening acts.
*  And when he told me that he was like, you're never going to get any work.
*  You got to stop swearing.
*  And I go, but all my favorite comedians are like Andrew Dice Clay.
*  He goes, you're not Dice Clay.
*  I go, I was like, okay, but at one point in time, Dice Clay might...
*  He's like, look, you don't have to listen, but you're not going to have a career.
*  And he like fucking stormed away and left me feeling like shit.
*  And then four or five years later, I came back to the club headlining because I was on news radio.
*  And the place was sold out.
*  And he said, what do you want me to say?
*  I go, tell them you gave me the worst advice that anybody ever gave me.
*  And then tell them all the TV credits that I have that you don't have.
*  And he just like shook his head a little bit and just walked away.
*  Because he was still the same guy.
*  He was still trapped.
*  He was still a shitty, mediocre, barely funny act that was passable under the best conditions possible only.
*  But like you would never repeat his jokes at a party.
*  He said it was never fun.
*  And I went up and killed.
*  And it was so good.
*  It was fun.
*  And I was dirty.
*  But this like there was like a lot of the comedians back then, like the established guys were actually angry that I had succeeded with a dirty act because I was on television.
*  Like I remember one of them saying, I can't believe they gave him a job with fucking Disney.
*  Disney hired him because Disney was where I got my first development deal.
*  And they're like, fucking Disney.
*  Have they ever seen his blowjob jokes like Disney?
*  And I was like, well, that shit's on Disney now.
*  It's come full circle.
*  It's where kids are learning.
*  But back then it was everybody wanted to be clean.
*  And so there was a lot of peer pressure.
*  So I tried.
*  I tried.
*  I tried to like conform my act.
*  I tried to like write like material that was not me.
*  Can't do it.
*  You know, I was a 21 year old animal who was a kickboxer.
*  That's all I was doing.
*  I was my whole childhood from 15 to 21 was me traveling around the country trying to kick people unconscious.
*  And then all of a sudden I'm in this new environment where everybody's hyper sensitive and everybody wants you to be clean and everybody wants you to do these jokes that to me were just like, I want to hear wild shit.
*  I like wild shit.
*  Like I got into comedy because I saw Kinnison.
*  Yeah, I got into comedy.
*  So I saw I want to do wild shit.
*  That's what I want to do.
*  You are a fucking animal on stage.
*  It's like watching a wild animal.
*  But it's just you just letting your fucking self come out.
*  It's just who I am.
*  I mean, that's just me being like what I think is funny, like my kind of comedy.
*  You don't have to like it.
*  A lot of people don't.
*  That's OK.
*  That's what I like.
*  But that's like all music, man.
*  You know, like there's people that don't like the black keys.
*  I don't understand them because I love them.
*  So I listen to black keys.
*  I'm like, fuck, yeah.
*  And some people are like, oh, OK, just don't watch it.
*  But this is just life.
*  But when you're in an environment where people are telling you like it's an alt
*  environment and all of your peers and all the people that are so desperately trying
*  to succeed because you you've achieved a level of comfort now so you can look back on it
*  because it's not that long ago where you didn't know if it was going to work out.
*  And that moment when you're starting out, whether it's comedy or anything, martial
*  arts, fucking everything I would imagine, when you're endeavoring, when you're entering
*  into this like crazy world of possibilities, this might not work.
*  Like what are the odds that it works?
*  How many comedians who do an open mic night ever become a professional headliner?
*  God damn it.
*  It's not even one out of a thousand.
*  No, it's a nutty number.
*  So if that was your child, you know, you're not going to be able to do it.
*  If that was your child or a really good friend, you would say, oh, my God, don't do this.
*  This is not it's not going to work out for you.
*  You're going to be that 40 year old loser staying on people's couches with no future.
*  Fuck man.
*  Don't do this.
*  So when you're in that environment, like the alt scene when no one's really quite sure.
*  And then there's a few people that have made it a little bit.
*  And those are the ones that kind of set the standards and they behave that way.
*  And everybody else wants to be like them.
*  And they just want to be liked by everybody else.
*  Everybody conforms.
*  Everybody becomes like this same thing.
*  It's that group identity thing, which is really why things are crumbling right now.
*  You can't have it.
*  There is no there's no community.
*  Any person that tells me I'm in a community, you're a child.
*  If your community is not your close friends and your family and you say you're in a community, you're a child.
*  There isn't there's no comedy community.
*  There are a bunch of them.
*  There are a bunch of them.
*  Yeah, they're little microcosms of groups of people.
*  Yeah.
*  But once you have said this is our group identity, like this is what white men are.
*  This is what black women are.
*  It's well, one of the nice things about the club is that when we hired Adam Eaget to take over and be the town quarter, one of the things that we were real clear because he was experiencing a lot of pressure in L.A.
*  Like he'd get pressure like, why don't you have more women on the lineup?
*  Why don't you have more this in the lineup?
*  How can we have any gay people?
*  How can we know this?
*  I said, listen, man, this is going to be this club is going to be 100 percent of meritocracy.
*  I do not give a fuck about any mandates.
*  I don't give a fuck.
*  All I care is if you're funny, if you're a funny trans person, you're a funny gay person, you're funny white guy, you're funny black lady.
*  Who fucking cares?
*  Are you funny?
*  And if you're funny, you're in.
*  And because of that, look how fucking diverse the lineup.
*  That's what happens, especially with the people coming up.
*  There's all kinds of different kinds of people from all kinds of different walks of life with totally different styles on stage.
*  There's so many different styles and complete freedom, complete freedom to try.
*  And Adam is so smart that he'll have these conversations with these people.
*  He'll be like, I see what you're trying to do.
*  You know, just you just got to like hone it in, figure it out.
*  I see you're trying to say it like this, but maybe like there's a way to say it that like makes the same point, but it's not as clunky.
*  So valuable.
*  That doesn't happen in New York.
*  It's like you're out if you're not doing what we want and you don't know what they want because it changes.
*  So it's good for us.
*  It is.
*  It is.
*  It's like helping recruiting tremendously.
*  When I met Adam, I was like in shock.
*  I go, this is so foreign to me.
*  A Booker who's like wants to work with you and like and will take a risk in like invest in your talent.
*  And he was one of Norm MacDonald's best friends.
*  He did a show with Norm.
*  The guy knows comedy inside and out.
*  I've known Adam for at least 20 years, at least.
*  I knew Adam when he was working at the Tempe Improv back when I would just do the road there and I became friends with him then.
*  And then he came to me when I was banned from the Comedy Store.
*  He came to me at the Improv.
*  When did you get banned from the Comedy Store?
*  2007.
*  I left the Comedy Store in 2007 over that Carl Smencia thing.
*  And so I told him I'm like I'm never coming back.
*  I'm like I'm gone.
*  You've never gone back?
*  No, I did.
*  I went back in 2014.
*  But one of the reasons I went back is the guy that was running it was fired.
*  They caught him stealing money.
*  He got fired.
*  And then Adam Eaget took over.
*  And when Adam took over, Adam came to visit me at the Improv and I was performing at the Improv.
*  And he was like I'd really love to have you back at the store.
*  I'm like dude, I don't know if I could fucking go back there, man.
*  I just like I said I was never going back.
*  The whole thing was so fucked up.
*  He's like you know but that guy's gone and it's different now.
*  And we're trying to bring the Comedy Store back.
*  And so the reason why I did go back though was because Ari Shaffir was filming a special there.
*  And I had been friends with Ari when Ari was a doorman.
*  I met Ari when Ari was just starting out.
*  He was this young, fresh-faced doorman who just abandoned religion really recently.
*  And so he was like this young kid and he was funny.
*  And I became friends with him and then I started taking him on the road with me.
*  After a couple years of him, you know, like seeing him perform, I gave him some spots outside of town.
*  I took him to Denver.
*  He killed.
*  I'm like goddamn.
*  And so I helped Ari.
*  I brought him in front of all these crowds.
*  I gave him like the kind of advice that I would want someone to give to me.
*  And him performing at the Comedy Store, having a Comedy Central special and doing it at the Comedy Store to me was like I have to be there.
*  Yeah.
*  I have to.
*  I have to see that.
*  I have to be there.
*  I have to support him.
*  I'm so proud of him.
*  I'm so happy.
*  I had to go there.
*  So I went there the day before.
*  And the day I went, I saw Roast Battle.
*  And I was like this is amazing.
*  It was so vibrant and so alive.
*  And the place was packed.
*  We're upstairs.
*  And I was one of the judges.
*  Like you'd have a judge like that gets to judge the roasts.
*  And we had so much fun.
*  And Jeff Ross was hosting it.
*  And it was just the whole thing.
*  The whole thing was just it was so it was so vibrant.
*  I was like this is like a writing exercise.
*  This is like I mean it's a real thing.
*  I mean it's a roast battle.
*  Roast battles are you're picking on someone.
*  Yes.
*  But it's really just a writing exercise with one specific target.
*  That's all it is.
*  One topic you stay on.
*  And Brian Moses is an amazing host of that too.
*  He's so good because he's so likable.
*  He's so fun.
*  And he even makes people hug it out.
*  You know like at the end we're all going to hug.
*  Like you know it's nice.
*  He does a great job of like keeping it peaceful and playful.
*  And then I remember being there for that.
*  I go OK I think I got to come back.
*  And then the next day Ari did a special.
*  It was amazing.
*  I couldn't believe it.
*  I was like this is just so crazy to see him filming a special at the comedy store from knowing him from being a doorman.
*  Yeah.
*  You know.
*  And now here he is.
*  You see people get so good so fast.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I only know him as a killer.
*  I have no concept of Ari or you know any of those guys when they start.
*  Yeah.
*  That's one of the cool things about getting to see someone from the very beginning.
*  You know when I saw Tony Hinchcliffe I think he had been doing comedy five or six years when I first met him.
*  Yeah.
*  And I look at him.
*  He's the best.
*  Tony is the best roaster on planet Earth.
*  There's no one better.
*  And he'll do it off the cuff.
*  He can do it off the cuff better than anybody alive.
*  Yeah.
*  It's so good you think oh this is all pre-written.
*  And you go no he just picked all this.
*  You know I watch him in the mothership.
*  Dude he does it in the green room all the time.
*  Him and David Lucas I keep telling them this.
*  God damn it you motherfuckers.
*  Do a show together.
*  Yeah.
*  The two of them together are magic.
*  It brings out the absolute best in David Lucas because David Lucas goes savage on Tony and Tony goes savage on him.
*  And they're both laughing at each other's lines.
*  So like he'll clown Tony and Tony will be dying laughing.
*  Like no one gets angry and he'll clown David and David will be dying laughing.
*  Like personal shit like about the way he looks and you know dying of diabetes and dying laughing.
*  Imagine that happening with like young Gen Z awoke people like experiencing something.
*  They should have to go to the mothership and sit and watch that and go look you can tear somebody down and it's all fun.
*  It's just funsies.
*  And one of the things about the mothership that's so important is kill Tony because what kill Tony shows everyone is that in one minute all you have the time for is to be funny.
*  And everything funny is rewarded.
*  You could say outrageous things.
*  People say outrageous things on kill Tony all the time.
*  But if you do well in that one minute and they give you a big notebook and they say we're going to bring you back and then you get to get a chance to go back or you get a golden ticket.
*  You get to perform again or then you become the newest regular and now guys have careers.
*  Yeah.
*  Cam Patterson has a fucking thriving career.
*  Hans Kim has a thriving career.
*  William Montgomery thriving career.
*  David Lucas.
*  These guys are killing it on the road.
*  Killing it.
*  Fuck I should have moved here five years ago.
*  No no no.
*  Perfect time dude.
*  You're doing great.
*  And in the new special that you just filmed there is coming out.
*  It is.
*  Yeah.
*  When are you going to put it out?
*  It's it'll be out probably tonight.
*  Oh shit that's so fast.
*  And it was it's all election stuff and I'm not a big fan of themed comedy specials but it was just like.
*  Why not?
*  I don't know.
*  Nobody even why not for now?
*  Well that's why I changed course and I saw that Biden thing where he's sitting on the imaginary chair and I go I got to get this out now.
*  And the weekend was so fun man that room is magical.
*  It's a great room.
*  I think that building is alive dude.
*  It feels like it's been there for 20 years.
*  Yeah it felt like that right away.
*  The building felt like that right away.
*  That building's been there since 1927.
*  And I have this thought about things that have been around a long time.
*  I think memories get baked into buildings.
*  I really do.
*  Sure.
*  When I go to the comedy store every time I go to the comedy store I have this feeling.
*  You walk in the hallway you get this feeling like wow so much has happened here.
*  There's so many experiences baked into that even when no one's in that building.
*  I used to like when we were leaving late at night you know we'd be hanging out in the back bar in Mitzi's bar and we'd be drinking and talking and everybody's like all right time to go home.
*  And we'd go out in the hallway and you just feel the building.
*  The building that building's alive.
*  It wouldn't have been the same if you just built a new construction.
*  It wouldn't have it would have had that kind of fresh kind of.
*  We would have made it alive.
*  We would have eventually it would have it would have taken a little time.
*  We would have we brought the right spirit.
*  We brought the spirit of the comedy store to the mothership.
*  You know we knew what we needed.
*  We knew we needed because we already had it.
*  We had it in L.A.
*  We had that we had a home base and that's what we needed here.
*  Like when we first moved here I was like God we don't have a home base.
*  We had the Vulcan which is great but it wasn't set up the way I would set it up.
*  It wasn't ideal.
*  Like there was a lot of problems with the dynamics of the and I was like it's also not it's not quite big enough.
*  Like this isn't ideal.
*  Like so we started looking for other places and then when we found the mothership when we want when I walked into the Ritz theater and looked around it was like the place was talking to me.
*  It was was it just one.
*  What was it.
*  What did it look like when you walked in.
*  It's been a bunch of things since 1927.
*  It was a pool hall.
*  It was a punk rock club.
*  I guess it was a nudie movie theater at one point in time.
*  I can still feel the vibe.
*  Yeah.
*  And the sexual energy in there.
*  Weird energy in that place.
*  And then from I think 2007 on it was the Alamo Drafthouse.
*  So that's what it used to look like.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  So it used to be like that.
*  But was that the whole thing though or is that just what the fat man is now.
*  That's the fat man.
*  So the little boy was always there too.
*  That was a smaller theater.
*  So the Alamo Drafthouse had two theaters.
*  One theater that sat like 120 people and one theater that sat like whatever the seats.
*  We have it set up for 250 people now.
*  So you see how it angles up like that.
*  Yeah.
*  So what we did was we right where Jamie's cursor is we cut the floor.
*  Oh shit.
*  And so we lifted from all the way back to like the second row.
*  We lifted the floor up to that height so it's flat.
*  And then so it doesn't angle downward.
*  So that's the little room right.
*  So we lifted the floor up to make it closer to the ceiling and then we changed the dynamics of the stage.
*  So instead of being like this steep angle like a movie theater where everybody has a nice shot at the screen.
*  It's flat like a comedy club and then we lowered the ceiling.
*  And then so you could see where the balcony is.
*  The ceiling is lower even than the balcony.
*  Because that was Louie's idea.
*  To lower it.
*  Louie's idea was like can you lower the ceiling even more.
*  And I'm like I think we can.
*  And so I brought it in.
*  That's New York.
*  New York everything's just so fucking low.
*  Yeah it is but it's also Louie because he's not just a comic.
*  He's also a producer.
*  Like he's done a lot of films and he understands like sets and he deeply understands like recording and dynamics.
*  He's like he goes cover everything with cloth like good muffle all the back.
*  Is that the old.
*  What was this one.
*  Wow.
*  They're definitely watching something on the screen.
*  So that was they had one solid balcony back then.
*  Interesting.
*  Instead of two balconies.
*  That's the fat man too.
*  Yeah.
*  Crazy.
*  Look at all them back then.
*  Look at them.
*  I found a picture of Henry Rollins there.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  Henry Rollins is on stage there in 1983.
*  Look at that.
*  What year is that from?
*  Trying to find out.
*  That's crazy.
*  They're watching a talkie there a colored film.
*  That's what it looked like back then dude.
*  Isn't that nuts.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's been there for so long.
*  And it was the the queen that used to be called.
*  Wow.
*  Is that a river in front of it.
*  What is that.
*  That's the dirt.
*  Oh.
*  That's the ground man.
*  That's probably before it was paved.
*  Well they had pavement.
*  Yeah they probably didn't pave it yet.
*  And so when we got there.
*  Oh here's another funny story.
*  When we got there we had to tear some of the stuff off the walls and a swastika was painted on the brick.
*  Whoopsie daisy.
*  Yeah.
*  Because you know it used to be a punk rock club.
*  I guess someone painted a swastika on the wall.
*  Jesus.
*  Punk show there.
*  Yeah there's a punk show.
*  Did I show you that photo of Henry Rollins that I sent out to you?
*  I think I did.
*  So we're doing all the construction.
*  And I figured someone would fucking remove the swastika.
*  But it was like months before we opened I go hey why is the fucking swastika still here.
*  And so they go we'll take it we'll remove it.
*  So they remove the paint which made a clear white swastika.
*  I go hey retards get rid of the design.
*  Don't accept it because now it's even more obvious because now that where all the fucking swastika was was sandblasted off.
*  In the exact same design.
*  It's cleaner.
*  You know that's what happens when you hire laborers who don't really necessarily know what that fucking thing is.
*  They could have sent it to Columbia University.
*  Is that Henry Rollins on stage there?
*  Yeah Black Flag 1982 Ritz Theater.
*  Yeah.
*  Holy shit.
*  I sent you one.
*  Did I show you the one?
*  I'll send it to you right now.
*  I got a better photo of it.
*  The better photo is pretty fucking crazy.
*  Hold on a second.
*  I'll get it here.
*  I know I got it in this little pile.
*  That's 1980 black and white 1982.
*  Well you probably hired someone to do it in black and white.
*  Do it in black and white.
*  It's funny things really do feel old timey in black and white.
*  I can't find it.
*  I give up.
*  But anyway point is we have photos in the downstairs before you go on stage.
*  There's those photos of Steve Ray Vaughan.
*  That's him on stage in that club in 83.
*  Damn.
*  Yeah.
*  So there's like this crazy history that's baked into that place.
*  And think about just think about the history in the last year you've been open.
*  I know.
*  How much has happened in that room?
*  Well how much has happened to the Austin comedy scene?
*  The fucking scene has exploded.
*  It's pretty wild.
*  It's just a neat it's a it was an empty void that was needed because you go on the coasts and there's great clubs but that group identity shit this race can say this and that it's every night you got to sift through that bullshit.
*  There's also a history of wild comedy here because this is where Bill Hicks started.
*  This is where Kenison started.
*  They both started in Texas.
*  And when I had heard about Texas like Jeanine Garofalo was out here at one point in Houston.
*  There was a bunch of comics are out here in Houston and I was like what is going on in Houston.
*  I remember hearing about that when I lived in Boston because I lived in Boston.
*  Comedy store was Mecca.
*  That was the place you had to get to.
*  I remember everyone is like you got to get to the comic stores where Richard Pryor started.
*  That's where Sam Kenison started.
*  Dice Clay was there.
*  All these comedians were at the comedy store.
*  You had to get to the comedy store.
*  It was the place.
*  Then I kept hearing about Houston.
*  And then when I saw Kenison and Hicks people like you know they came from Houston.
*  I was like what?
*  Kenison came from Houston?
*  Like from Texas?
*  Texas made comedians?
*  Where was he performing though?
*  What was available?
*  The laugh stop.
*  The laugh stop in River Oaks was a fucking amazing club.
*  I don't think it's there anymore.
*  I don't think the club is not there anymore because the club moved to a new location.
*  I think that club went under.
*  But the original place where the laugh stop was was a great club.
*  Low ceiling.
*  Perfect little stage.
*  And then there was also a little side area where they had an open mic that would go to like 2 o'clock in the morning.
*  Vibrant scene.
*  Like really vibrant scene.
*  Everybody loved to come through Houston and work that club.
*  And when you worked that club you know you'd do like whatever Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, whatever days you'd do.
*  You would go there and you'd see the open mics.
*  And it would be packed.
*  And the local comics were really good.
*  They were good man.
*  Local comics were fucking good.
*  Like you know you'd get to see these guys like Jimmy Pineapple.
*  These guys like you probably never even heard of them.
*  No.
*  Solid fucking comedians.
*  You know and Sean Rouse was there at the time.
*  And Ralphie May.
*  There was a lot of comics coming out of that area that I was like this is nuts man.
*  I did not know that like Houston, like Texas, mostly Houston had this scene.
*  And Austin had a bit of a scene but you know a little bit smaller.
*  But nothing was like what it is now.
*  You should have something in the middle of the country.
*  You can't just have comedy on the liberal coasts.
*  You need something in the middle of the country.
*  I think that has something to do with it.
*  It helps for sanity for sure.
*  But it also helps that it's run by comics.
*  Like that club is run by us.
*  It's our club.
*  There's no one else.
*  There's no management.
*  You know there's no like there's no overseer.
*  There's no executives that are making decisions based on money.
*  Everything is made based on comedy.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah I know some places if they get a couple complaints about a joke they want you to.
*  I'm not going to mention where but I kind of got a little talking to.
*  Like we got some complaints about this one joke.
*  And I'm thinking like who gives a fuck.
*  The joke kills every time.
*  Yeah they don't get it.
*  They're working against themselves.
*  Yeah.
*  They don't even understand what they're doing.
*  They're literally poisoning their own business with this stupidity.
*  You just got to like let people know you can be free and you'll have more audience members.
*  And you will get rid of these people that are looking to be offended constantly.
*  Because it won't be effective.
*  All that shit only works if people comply.
*  If people don't comply and then other people go this is just comedy.
*  Just like when you go to see Quentin Tarantino movies nobody's really getting killed.
*  You know Bob Marley Bob Marley never really shot the sheriff.
*  I don't know if you know that.
*  That was not real.
*  Come on.
*  I know.
*  Come on.
*  Crazy.
*  It's comedy.
*  And the problem is these fucking idiots that are running these clubs are giving in to the very thing that's going to kill their business.
*  This is giving me like a second birth really.
*  Because I hit this wall where kind of you know I've developed this act and then you need to experiment.
*  Yeah.
*  And once I started getting challenged when I would try to like veer off and experiment a little and I'm never going to bomb.
*  I will end strong.
*  I'm there to entertain the crowd.
*  That's that's my thing.
*  I'm willing to do crazy shit and experiment but everybody's paying and they're there and you know I'm going to end strong.
*  And so yeah that was enough to get my ass to Texas.
*  I never thought I'd live in Texas.
*  You can be free here.
*  You can be free here and you can be free where we are.
*  Like it's we've set it up that way.
*  We want it to be.
*  It's like an actual safe space.
*  You know for real.
*  Yeah. But safe for everybody.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean you can be whatever the fuck you want as long as what you're saying is funny.
*  It's all it is.
*  There's no room for any horseshit.
*  No ideology.
*  No nonsense.
*  It's just you could have an ideology but it's just going to be funny.
*  That is palpable there or maybe the opposite of that.
*  There's no like the meritocracy that you set up.
*  You can feel that there you go in there and it's you're funny or not.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're supportive.
*  This very support identity politics stuff which is just killing the business man.
*  The scene everywhere else was just bad for some business that's about taking risks and saying outrageous things and pushing the envelope.
*  And that's all the greats.
*  All the imagine setting up like what a comedy club essentially is in this world in the world of standup comedy.
*  A comedy club is a place where you can hone your craft and perform.
*  So you go to clubs you learn how to do it.
*  Then you go to clubs and you make a living doing it.
*  And then eventually if you get big enough then you start branching out into theaters and arenas.
*  So it's literally the gym.
*  It's literally the dojo.
*  It's a rehearsal.
*  It's the place where you learn.
*  Imagine having a place where you learn where you can't take chances.
*  In a business that's wrapped around taking chances where all the greats whether it's Don Rickles, Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, all of them said wild shit.
*  All of them.
*  And the only way you develop wild shit is by performing it on stage in front of people with freedom where you get a chance.
*  I just watched the George Carlin documentary.
*  Did you see that?
*  It was on HBO or whatever.
*  It was so good.
*  And I'm almost like man he almost had more freedom than we.
*  He's talking about seven words you can't say.
*  Shit, piss, fuck, cuck, sucker, motherfucker and tits.
*  Now it's like the seven million topics you can't talk about.
*  Race, gender, gender.
*  But you can.
*  You can.
*  You just have to do it.
*  And if you have a club that has that established like the mothership, anybody could do it.
*  You don't have to have a big audience.
*  They'll let you do it.
*  Anyone will let you do it.
*  And no one's going to complain.
*  And then they will come see you again.
*  And then you'll develop.
*  And then the people come to see you know what you do and there's no worries.
*  That's how comedy should be done.
*  That's the right way to develop both offensive and non offensive acts.
*  Sure.
*  You know some of my favorite acts are not.
*  Nate Bargatze is hilarious.
*  Completely non offensive.
*  Hilarious.
*  But that's Nate's act.
*  Yeah.
*  Brian Reegus.
*  Sebastian Maza.
*  Same thing.
*  Great comedians.
*  But that's their thing.
*  And that's great.
*  There's no right way to do it.
*  Do you ever want to see a clean person just go I want to see them do an hour of the filthiest fucking shit.
*  It would be funny.
*  Sebastian.
*  You know you're going to get your take on this Joe.
*  Yeah.
*  I take a girl home the other day.
*  She goes can I give you a rim job?
*  I go what is it?
*  She starts pecking at me like a baby bird.
*  I go I don't want my girlfriend to have the same lingo as my mechanic.
*  What are you going to start tweaking my nipples?
*  Give me a I just want to see him fucking get Seinfeld.
*  Yeah.
*  Talking about fucking trans stuff and all that.
*  Well even Seinfeld is pushing back on all this woke shit.
*  Well he's getting protests.
*  Have you seen the protests?
*  Every show now.
*  Well there was Palestine.
*  There's Palestine protests.
*  It is but it's still kind of linked up with like we're going to shut down comedy for our cause.
*  So he's getting caught up in that stuff.
*  Well you got a lot of really dumb young people that are very entitled and think they can shut things down because they have a cause.
*  You think they would learn but they're not going to and they're going to keep doing it and there's more attention they get every time they do it.
*  See the stop oil now people they just they vandalize Stonehenge.
*  What the fuck does Stonehenge have to do with oil?
*  It's an amazing monument that's thousands of years old and you just spray paint all over it because you want people to stop using oil.
*  It's a mental illness.
*  And you're wearing clothes made out of oil.
*  You fucking idiot.
*  Everything you own was shipped on a truck that was used oil.
*  Every fucking thing you eat every fucking thing in your house.
*  Everything your house is made out of the electronics on your phone.
*  The wires in your wall.
*  Everything uses plastic you fucking idiot.
*  Everything uses oil.
*  You're not stopping shit.
*  No.
*  Yeah a little tomato soup on the Van Gogh.
*  It's always rich kids too.
*  It's entitled kids.
*  It's posh kids that think that this is the thing that they should be doing with their life because they don't have any purpose.
*  They're taught that from now.
*  I mean for me it started popping up in college a little bit.
*  These kids like age three.
*  Anti-racist baby.
*  That's a real book.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah my kid when we were in school right after the George Floyd thing they sent an email saying to young kids like some of them as young as like six and seven went there saying that it's not enough that you not be racist.
*  You have to be anti-racist.
*  They're telling us the kids who don't have any concept of race.
*  They have black friends Indian friends Asian friends.
*  These are friends who's nice to me.
*  Who likes playing the toys that I play with.
*  Who likes playing the games that I play.
*  Let's let's hang out.
*  You know they don't care.
*  And you're making them focus on this for no fucking reason.
*  It's going to fuck them up.
*  Yeah.
*  So they fired the person at the school and it became like a big lawsuit.
*  But they realized they were getting grifted on.
*  But Jesus fucking Christ you idiots like how did you not see through and the parents were freaking out like what the fuck are you teaching them like why are you doing this like why are you introducing all these ideas.
*  Is there a problem.
*  Let's talk about the problem.
*  There's no fucking problem.
*  This is not an issue at all.
*  And you're making it an issue to make yourself important.
*  And that's the problem with these positions when people have these positions of equity and inclusiveness.
*  Oh my god.
*  They have these positions in universities.
*  They have these positions in corporations.
*  It's like God damn the whole equity thing.
*  That's that happened overnight.
*  The word equality was switched with equity.
*  Yeah.
*  The the equal outcome.
*  And that's so you have to force that's the only way to do it is to force it.
*  We have to force it.
*  We have to have this person and this person in this race.
*  But all the identities are becoming infinite now.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's like you're going to OK with Kamala Harris.
*  I mean they had to discriminate against every other type of person because they said we're having a black woman.
*  So they had to discriminate against black men.
*  Yeah.
*  And Asian women and everybody.
*  Yeah.
*  Well it's definitely not a meritocracy if you got her.
*  No.
*  No.
*  None of it makes any sense.
*  The whole the whole thing's bonkers man.
*  It's a fascinating fascinating time to be alive.
*  But it's good for comedy.
*  Good for comedy.
*  I'm actually playing a DEI officer a Jedi.
*  He's called Justice Equity Inclusion Officer and Adam Carolla has a new cartoon Mr.
*  Burcham which he's been which he he pitched that like 10 15 years ago to Fox and they said no.
*  And Daily Wire who's just like scooping stuff up.
*  They produced it and it's think a lot of that was a response to what we were talking about once.
*  We're saying you can't make a good comedy movie now because no one will go off.
*  Jeremy saw it.
*  I saw that and was like fuck dude.
*  They wrote that thing in like two weeks.
*  They flew me out to punch it up.
*  We filmed it in like three weeks and it was out.
*  That's why.
*  But this is Mr. Burcham.
*  Kyle's in it.
*  Megan Kelly's in it.
*  And Kelly it's got a cast man.
*  Nice.
*  It's got Jay Moore.
*  Nice.
*  That's my little diversity officer guy.
*  Alonzo.
*  Yeah.
*  I love Alonzo.
*  Nice.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like you know it's like a family guy.
*  It's a fun time to push back.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a fun time to push back.
*  The things have gone a little bit haywire but we're going to be all right.
*  For a comedian.
*  Oh my God.
*  I just wake up and I just look at the headlines.
*  And one thing that comedy does do is it highlights how ridiculous these things are and it takes
*  some of the weight off of them.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the only way.
*  Even look with the word woke.
*  Woke used to be a cool thing and it with because of comedy.
*  It's foolish.
*  It's now it's a clown world word.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a clown world word that you can't use on the other side.
*  You can't say I'm woke because I was like bye.
*  You fucking idiot.
*  You fucking loser.
*  Yeah.
*  You fucking idiot.
*  So it becomes pejorative.
*  It's something that someone points to.
*  It says oh you're infected with the woke mind virus.
*  Like no.
*  No.
*  Like no one who is woke claims woke.
*  No.
*  You can't do it.
*  They used to.
*  That's from comedy.
*  That is from it.
*  It's from memes.
*  It's from the internet.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what it is man.
*  Incredible.
*  Well listen dude I'm happy you're here.
*  Hey thank you brother.
*  You're a very very funny guy.
*  It's been really fun watching you perform at the club.
*  I appreciate it man.
*  You're killing it.
*  Your special is going to fucking destroy.
*  I saw some clips.
*  It's really funny.
*  Thank you for building this thing.
*  That is so needed.
*  My pleasure.
*  Thanks for joining the team.
*  We're flying out from around the world now we're showing up.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah it's fun.
*  We're having a good time.
*  Awesome.
*  And we're going to keep rolling man.
*  We got more plans.
*  I can't wait.
*  We're going to do some more wild shit.
*  I'm two weeks in here.
*  Yeah we're going to expand.
*  Get me buff please.
*  Let's do it.
