# Joe Rogan Experience #2034 - Jeremy Jones
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6.0s)]
*  Jeremy Jones, what's happening, baby? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=10.0s)]
*  Not much, not much. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=14.0s)]
*  We finally did this. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=15.0s)]
*  Yeah, trying to run out. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=16.0s)]
*  Yeah, man, playing you is a very humbling experience. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=17.0s)]
*  I should tell everybody that Jeremy Jones, professional pool player, the team captain [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=20.0s)]
*  of the Moscone Cup, which is the most prestigious international team tournament in all the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=25.0s)]
*  world of pool. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=30.0s)]
*  But what I really enjoyed about talking with you for the last couple of days is you're [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=31.0s)]
*  just, you're a very smart guy, very interesting guy. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=35.0s)]
*  There's a lot of, you know, like a lot of interests in all kinds of different things. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=39.0s)]
*  You're a very fascinating guy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=43.0s)]
*  That's why you're so good at commentary. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=45.0s)]
*  Yeah, I guess so. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=46.0s)]
*  Maybe just growing up watching all that stuff. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=47.0s)]
*  And I think my parents, you know, they had pretty vast interest, even though maybe didn't [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=49.0s)]
*  afford it all the time to be able to, you know, kind of go with it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=54.0s)]
*  But yeah, number five or six kids, you learn a lot of stuff. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=57.0s)]
*  Well, it's just always been fascinating to me. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=60.0s)]
*  The people that are really good at pool are some of the fucking smartest people I've ever met in my life. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=62.0s)]
*  There's just, they just got that bug. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=67.0s)]
*  They got that bug to chase this one thing, geometry and pockets and balls and collisions. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=69.0s)]
*  And they got that bug to chase it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=75.0s)]
*  But some of the best players that I've talked to, they're some of the smartest people I've ever met. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=77.0s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=82.0s)]
*  I mean, that just tells you about the game, right? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=83.0s)]
*  How much there is to it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=85.0s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, it's just it grabs you. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=86.0s)]
*  And, you know, if you're watching, paying attention, what goes on, it's like hardly ever the same thing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=90.0s)]
*  You know, you don't realize how much control you have. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=95.0s)]
*  I thought I thought pool was kind of like a game you played waiting on a bowling alley lane, you know, prior to playing it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=98.0s)]
*  Right. I didn't know you could play it well. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=103.0s)]
*  I didn't know you could play it for a living. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=105.0s)]
*  You know, there's movies out there and stuff, but I mean, it just didn't seem real. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=107.0s)]
*  When you were how old were you when you first started playing? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=111.0s)]
*  Really playing 17. I was 17 years old. Yeah, I started late. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=114.0s)]
*  I started really late. I was 25, I think. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=119.0s)]
*  Somewhere around 24, 24, 25. Yeah. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=123.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I worked two jobs and one of them, we'd, you know, have a few beers on the weekends at a pizza restaurant, play poker with our money, our tip money. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=127.0s)]
*  And one of the guys would go to the game room and play pool. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=136.0s)]
*  And he took me down there one day and kind of hustled me a little bit. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=139.0s)]
*  You know, we kind of knew each other like that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=143.0s)]
*  And the only thing I wanted to do was be able to beat him, Joe. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=145.0s)]
*  That's like that's what I wanted to do. Yeah. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=148.0s)]
*  And that's so I quit one of the jobs. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=150.0s)]
*  I quit the pizza restaurant, went got a job at the game room so I could play for free and, you know, kind of the rest is history from there. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=152.0s)]
*  Wow. It's a game that just sucks you in. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=159.0s)]
*  I remember I used to go and play with my friend John and we would go to this place, Executive Billiards in White Plains. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=163.0s)]
*  And when we got there, you know, it was an interesting time because there was a lot of gambling going on in that place. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=171.0s)]
*  And the guy, the owner was a wild man. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=179.0s)]
*  The owner of the pool hall was this really eccentric musician. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=181.0s)]
*  Yeah. His name was Guy Azzariti, but he would use the name Guy Hamilton when he performed. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=187.0s)]
*  He was this musician, like a piano player, like really good musician. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=192.0s)]
*  And he had some money from, you know, his career as a piano player. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=196.0s)]
*  And he was really in a pool. He loved the culture of it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=200.0s)]
*  And so he was the owner of this joint. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=203.0s)]
*  And we were all just hanging out with him, having fun. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=206.0s)]
*  And I would go there and it would be filled with people gambling. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=208.0s)]
*  And I was like, this place is wild. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=212.0s)]
*  And then I was watching, like, really good players play when I was, you know, just starting out, didn't know what I was doing. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=215.0s)]
*  And I was like, that looks so different than anybody else I've ever seen play pool. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=220.0s)]
*  Like the way they hit the ball is so soft and they're in such control. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=225.0s)]
*  And you're watching the ball spin off the cushions to get perfect on the next ball and everybody's like shaking their head. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=229.0s)]
*  Wow. I'm like, that got me hooked. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=235.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I think the culture of it is a big, big part of it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=238.0s)]
*  I mean, just being able to gamble and not take it personal. Right. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=242.0s)]
*  You know, like you hate the casino when you go lose. Right. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=246.0s)]
*  I mean, they're like cussing the casino. They're cheating. They're doing this. Right. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=249.0s)]
*  But I mean, where I was at, we could gamble and then we could hang out. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=252.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, and then we're on teams next day and we're not on, you know, so that to me was pretty fascinating overall. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=257.0s)]
*  You know, there's a culture that encourages more gambling and the best way to encourage more gambling is not have fisticuffs every time somebody loses. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=263.0s)]
*  Like some guys just get too personal. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=269.0s)]
*  Look, it's a natural feeling. The guy just beat you. You feel that you're you're angry at him. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=271.0s)]
*  But really, you should be angry yourself. Yeah, absolutely. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=276.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it's just that's what you're both trying to do. It's an agreement. Like you figure it out. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=278.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you know, you beat a guy, you don't bust his chops too often. Right. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=283.0s)]
*  You let him cool off and then it all is good. But everybody goes back to like McCready's character in The Color of Money, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=286.0s)]
*  which is apparently from what everybody tells me from those days, really McCready was probably like wilder than that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=292.0s)]
*  No, I think I've sweated it 100 percent. Really? Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=299.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was in with a player playing Keith and I think they played something like four days or five days with like an eight hour break or 10 hour break in the middle. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=302.0s)]
*  Wow. You know, if you say that stay there and sweat that kind of pool with those guys, you see stuff that you're just not going to see. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=313.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? They get a little rum dumb. They get agitated. Then they're hugging, you know, an hour. Oh, yeah, it's crazy. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=319.0s)]
*  Yeah. But but Keith would definitely talk a little bit, you know, but he liked a little banner. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=326.0s)]
*  Those are the craziest legendary sessions when guys just gambled for three straight days in a row. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=331.0s)]
*  People think it's bullshit, but that was that's part of the thing about pool and gambling is nobody wants to quit. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=336.0s)]
*  Oh, no, no, you're trying. I mean, if you don't quit when you're up and if you're down and you still got some fight left in you, this guy might get tired or money. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=343.0s)]
*  You know, you might, you know, I've seen him go through three or four steakhorses in a night. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=351.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, but I mean, I think you and I were talking about earlier so much different these days. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=355.0s)]
*  When I went to the pool room, I was fully rested like 10, 12 hours because I knew I'm there to be four or five guys. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=360.0s)]
*  I'm going to be there 20, 30 hours. Wow. Yeah. I mean, you know, that's what you want. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=367.0s)]
*  You want to put the parlay on them, you know, like that. You want to take a, you know, somewhat small bankroll and try to run it through somebody. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=372.0s)]
*  So that's a fascinating way to live your life. It really is. I've always I mean that if at all of the things if you talk about like American folklore, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=378.0s)]
*  just like American culture, all the poetic characters, the professional pool player is one of the most interesting because it is the least guaranteed job that has ever existed. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=388.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's lots of sayings. I think it's the hard way to make it easy living. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=402.0s)]
*  Easy living is one of them, right? But but I mean, you know, if I was lucky, I was around some of the old school ones as well. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=407.0s)]
*  And the charisma is true. You know, like if you see genuine charisma, I mean, it's a real thing. Yeah. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=414.0s)]
*  And that's what the old guys had that the other young guys have it too. But it's just a little different. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=420.0s)]
*  Well, everyone seems it's interesting because it seems like pool is just like every other thing in that the guys today are as good, if not better than anybody that's ever existed. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=425.0s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. There's more of them. That's the problem. You know, there's so many. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=437.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. And I'm so impressed. I mean, Europe, Asia, you know, guys from Taiwan, guys from China, guys from Japan, guys from Spain. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=441.0s)]
*  It's like, whoa, killers, most global support there is, I think it's it's amazing how much talent there is out there. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=453.0s)]
*  Like, I'm just so impressed with what the level is now, because if you like no disrespect to anybody who played back in the day, but if you go back and you watch a tournament from like the 80s versus you watch how these guys are playing now, it's it's almost like it's a completely different game. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=463.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, different style rather. Yeah, I think the equipment allows for that, too. Yeah. You know what I mean? So yeah. And the training. I mean, these guys, you know, you had Federer Gorst. I'm sure you all talked about his regimen, right? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=478.0s)]
*  He's my my perfect example. He's almost playing like a totally different style of pool, like his style of pool is like, it's so perfect, like his position, the way he stands with his body, how rigid it is. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=492.0s)]
*  It's like people that don't understand that are just seeing a guy just make something look easy. But people that do understand like that, that's like a work of art. Like, look what he's doing. Oh, absolutely artwork. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=505.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's kind of like, you know, back in the day, you'd kind of, you know, I used to say to a lot of guys that go on the road, hey, if they don't beat me in the first couple hours, we're all right. You know what I mean? Because I get better and better and better. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=515.0s)]
*  And he kind of doesn't even look for that. You know, he doesn't even want to gear. He just has this is steady gear. You know what I mean? It's just like he's not looking for that rhythm, even though it's there, I guess a little bit. But he's just a different machine. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=526.0s)]
*  Well, he's so well trained in terms of his fundamentals, and it's all so repeatable. And I think that that exists in martial arts, it exists in archery, and it really exists in pool. If you have really good fundamentals, like, like, that's why a lot of those snooker guys really excel when they try to learn pool. They're fundamentals, like their stroke fundamentals are so perfect. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=540.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I mean, they they they learn some things as they come over. I mean, they hate when you say snooker though, right? Don't they give you a hard time? snooker snooker. Yeah. Or the you know, I don't still don't know why a bank is called a double and snooker. Just a one rail bank is called a double. So I mean, there's a few of them that that I'm not really sure about. But you know, that's that's an interesting game, too. Oh, it's a great game. Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, I think nine balls a little better looking for today's people. I think that's a good game. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=561.0s)]
*  I think that's a good game. I think that's a good game. I think that's a good game. I think that's a good game. I think that's a good game. I think that's a good game. I think that's a good game.

*  real straight stroke you know been around a long time and it was it was a [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=683.52s)]
*  pretty fun experience for Max I was happy to see it so when you were a kid [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=687.16s)]
*  and so you start off working in this game room and you learn how to play pool [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=690.32s)]
*  then like how long before you're just all in with pool like all day long oh it [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=696.48s)]
*  didn't take long at all and and I was kind of lucky a little unlucky but lucky [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=702.48s)]
*  at the same time where my parents actually split up for like 12 13 months [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=707.36s)]
*  right so during this time I live with my mom and there's no chance I would have [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=711.08s)]
*  ever been a pool player if they didn't split up for that little period of time [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=715.88s)]
*  right so my dad just wouldn't have allowed it and so they got back together [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=719.2s)]
*  and then I'm graduating high school getting out of school so it wasn't [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=723.72s)]
*  really up to him but I was pretty much first road trip right out of high school [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=726.92s)]

*  of pool together we decided we're gonna do this and his was more of an [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=741.92s)]
*  experience experiment kind of thing you know he was going on to UT and you know [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=744.8399999999999s)]

*  these spots you know and back in the day now I didn't know this as of yet because [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=765.0s)]
*  it was my first road trip but on a normal road trip because no cell phones [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=769.84s)]
*  right you go to like Waffle House when you drive in you get you some food you [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=773.88s)]
*  go get the yellow pages and you literally go to where it says beards in [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=778.8s)]
*  the yellow pages you know and you just start going to pay phone and calling and [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=782.64s)]
*  normally the bartender or whoever answers will divulge a little more [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=786.96s)]
*  information than they probably should you know like if the players knew oh yeah [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=791.72s)]
*  she's telling me I Joe's a good player and he likes to get one night of all [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=795.52s)]
*  this guy likes to play one pocket you know so you get a lot of information [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=798.68s)]
*  over the phone and then you just go to those pool rooms and you know start [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=802.0s)]
*  trying to get down Wow and how good of a player were you fresh out of high [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=805.96s)]
*  school well you know a year and I was real lucky I had some really good [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=810.24s)]
*  players just kind of like come to the pool room and played me pool and do [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=814.44s)]
*  things with me and show me things and and I was a pretty good athlete anyway [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=817.8s)]
*  so I kind of picked up things quick but I played good enough to beat him on the [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=822.08s)]
*  way to Florida Joe but they're way too smart and we were way too dumb to stop [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=827.64s)]
*  at the same pool rooms on the way back because they got us all the way but they [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=833.08s)]
*  kind of knew how we played you know what I mean brought some play yeah yeah got us [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=836.38s)]
*  on a few gaff games you know mmm so we kind of went empty on the way home [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=840.22s)]
*  pretty much but explain a gaff game to the so a gaff game is kind of like you [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=844.14s)]
*  know three card right the shell game any of those games you know you're gonna [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=850.1800000000001s)]
*  lose and even if you're going to pick the right one they start the you know [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=854.82s)]
*  the song and dance again that's how the shell game goes right so it's basically [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=858.7s)]
*  a game that you're just not gonna win an example it sounds good kind of like oh [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=862.58s)]
*  like this might sound good to you but you know better now like eight ball [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=868.9s)]
*  taking balls off that kind of thing or say we're playing nine ball right and I [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=872.86s)]
*  might say to you Joe all you got to do is drive a ball to the rail but I get [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=877.34s)]
*  break ball in hand playing nine ball you understand so I mean if I'm basically [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=881.94s)]
*  playing the ghost meaning right I'm gonna try and run out every time but [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=887.94s)]
*  until you start to see it happening you're not gonna believe it you might go [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=890.9s)]
*  for that you ain't even got a pocket of ball you just got to drive one to a rail [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=893.86s)]
*  you know there's tons of them so that's an interesting game to play with someone [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=897.3s)]
*  who can't play because that would get them thinking I can do that or naive [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=901.9799999999999s)]
*  pool rooms like if there's not any poor rooms with a good player that just [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=906.06s)]
*  really ain't running out I mean that just sounds like the world right you know [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=909.18s)]
*  I mean that just sounds alright yeah go ahead yeah exactly I can drive one to a [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=912.66s)]
*  rail that's for sure but you know that's but the thing is like what like [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=916.9s)]
*  practicing with you today probably not like and especially if it's a bucket [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=920.66s)]
*  that's a large pocketed table you've run out like a champion man it's amazing [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=925.7s)]
*  and I know you're not like playing professionally as much anymore but damn [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=930.86s)]
*  that was really impressive yeah I've been here a few days got to play a [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=935.58s)]
*  little pool here in Austin already so that's good but skinny Bob's yes [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=938.7800000000001s)]

*  it's just this and especially it's one of those things that always said it's [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=955.0600000000001s)]
*  like an art form that only the people that do it appreciate yeah and when you [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=959.1800000000001s)]
*  really get into it you see different strikers you know I mean the strokes are [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=964.5400000000001s)]
*  different you know what I mean a little bit you know the positions a little [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=967.5400000000001s)]
*  different at times different things different breakers different ways to win [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=970.58s)]
*  you know what I mean so it's attractive in that manner I think yeah no it's it's [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=974.14s)]
*  just it's an interesting thing that there's different approaches you know [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=979.06s)]
*  some guys have like thick shafts some guys a little tiny shafts yeah body [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=981.9399999999999s)]

*  Gronk almost not quite as muscle as a big dude yeah huge and then you got what [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=993.98s)]

*  favorite guys to watch because there's the way they play is so smooth it's just [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1005.5s)]
*  it's so controlled like it seems like he's never hitting the ball at [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1010.38s)]
*  different speeds he's just hitting it at different places on the ball unless [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1016.34s)]
*  it's a very soft shot everything is just like this beautiful controlled stroke [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1020.9s)]
*  yeah everything looks medium right everything looks like right in the [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1025.54s)]
*  middle I forget what match I was watching recently but he broke around [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1028.94s)]
*  the first five racks and it was just like exquisite oh yeah like little one [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1031.82s)]
*  the little one no that was the big one oh Kokemi yeah there's a third you know [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1035.6599999999999s)]
*  Sasson's there's a third one you know I heard yeah I haven't seen that guy play [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1040.34s)]
*  yeah he's got a lot of talent he's he's way tall compared to the other two oh [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1043.82s)]
*  really so it's almost like when I watch him he's still kind of getting his [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1048.1s)]
*  coordination as a tall man because he's pretty young you know so yeah but he's [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1051.5s)]
*  got a lot of game as well there's something about you know watching these [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1056.26s)]
*  guys from the time that they're really young like some guys get so good so [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1059.86s)]
*  quick like Wu Chao Ching you know the dude who won the World Championships at [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1064.62s)]
*  what 16 years old yeah the nine ball and then later in the year the eight ball as [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1069.1799999999998s)]
*  well insane 16 oh yeah I was there when he won the nine ball he was like [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1072.86s)]
*  fearless well he manhandled the whole tournament yeah 16 it was like you could [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1077.4599999999998s)]
*  see after like the third or fourth round a little different complexion on his [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1082.3s)]
*  opponents compared to everyone else's opponents yeah he was an interesting guy [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1086.04s)]
*  too because he played with a heavy southwest right yeah well the Chinese [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1089.34s)]
*  Taipei former Taiwanese right that's a big common cue for them is the southwest [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1093.86s)]
*  maybe more on southwest and Chinese Taipei than anywhere in the world but [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1099.54s)]
*  that's what's interesting too is that everybody has like a different [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1104.06s)]
*  philosophy on whether a cue should be heavy or cue should be light but what's [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1106.3799999999999s)]
*  fatty you know to the people that don't know what the fuck we're talking about [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1110.1s)]
*  what's what's so fascinating about it is you're trying to apply a certain amount [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1113.58s)]
*  of pressure to this thing that you're holding in your hand that you drive [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1119.1s)]
*  into a cue ball to get the proper amount of revolutions and you're doing it [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1123.3799999999999s)]
*  across a whole table so it's like a nine foot canvas and when the ball goes three [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1127.4599999999998s)]
*  rails and comes all the way back it sits perfect for position on the next ball [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=1133.86s)]

*  I used to have a box of Accustats VHS tapes like this like a washing machine [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2102.22s)]
*  box filled with Pat Fleming's tapes and I got rid of all of them now because you [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2108.42s)]
*  just fucking get everything on YouTube yeah everything's on YouTube well I asked [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2115.58s)]
*  this question you might know is there any more stream sport in the world than [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2119.1s)]
*  pool it's streamed constantly I mean but so many different ones so many [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2123.14s)]
*  different ones right all these different pool rooms like Oscars pool room hard [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2128.2999999999997s)]
*  times in Sacramento just streamed that tournament I was saying I was watching [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2131.7s)]
*  Tyler Steyer and Shane play yeah let alone great players I mean the next [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2135.46s)]
*  level down other tournaments I mean just yeah right amazing to me I don't know of [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2140.22s)]
*  other sports I don't watch them like that I mean I'm sports guy but maybe [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2144.3399999999997s)]
*  maybe what you're into some type of MMA or some type of martial arts or [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2148.18s)]
*  something maybe that's streamed a lot they don't really stream that that often [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2152.82s)]
*  I mean there's only like big events that stream there's UFC there's Bellator [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2156.86s)]
*  there's I guess you probably get PFL on some sort of streaming device too right [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2162.82s)]
*  it has to be right and then one championship I think you get that [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2169.26s)]
*  streaming too but I feel like there's so many multiple pool events that are [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2172.98s)]
*  happening like simultaneously. Oh platform after platform really I mean there's a ton I mean there's no more I don't think that I've ever heard of or seen. I think it's the internet I think the internet sort of rekindled it in some people and I also think it got a boost during the pandemic because people started playing again. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2179.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh yeah yeah I was talking to you about pool table sales and what yeah during [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2195.7000000000003s)]
*  during the pandemic it was through the roof and and along with that I mean [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2199.6600000000003s)]
*  you're gonna just get a percentage that like it you know and once they start [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2204.0600000000004s)]
*  liking it they're gonna watch it so if a kid gets really good now it's actually a [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2207.62s)]
*  legitimate career path but when you were doing it you're just a wild person [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2213.18s)]
*  you're just out there doing wild person things. Well yeah it kind of made steps [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2216.58s)]
*  for me I mean I kind of like I said I never knew you could make a living or [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2221.9s)]
*  play good pool and then it kind of alright I can make a pool I'm actually [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2225.54s)]
*  making you know cash money you know pretty good overall for the year and and [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2229.18s)]
*  then I started to plan some smaller I never really had a clue of playing [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2234.18s)]
*  professionally still it kind of crept up on me. When did that happen? Well 1995 and [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2237.3s)]
*  six is I was Johnny Archer kind of just told me he said hey you need to start [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2244.7000000000003s)]
*  playing the next level you said you're the good enough player is where you [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2249.1000000000004s)]
*  should be it just depends on if that's what you want to do you know and so I [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2252.5s)]
*  still gambled afterwards kind of slowed down a little more of the gambling [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2256.1800000000003s)]
*  started go to tournaments traveling all over the world and you know country [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2260.42s)]
*  playing tournaments but I started to realize I really like the tournaments [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2263.58s)]
*  that's a different pressure only knowing you can't you know just flip the coin [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2266.98s)]
*  again yeah you know so especially because the first year I think I played [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2270.74s)]
*  seven tournaments and I might have won one match and I could beat most the guys [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2275.74s)]
*  I was losing to now the first draw was hard because I wasn't a seeded player so [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2281.06s)]
*  I was Efren you know Lua you know Johnny you know Kim Davenport all those guys [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2285.8199999999997s)]
*  but but on the loser side I lose matches to guys I'm supposed to be a lot of [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2291.26s)]
*  times but I was a different nervous so I was really intrigued on getting through [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2295.5800000000004s)]
*  that you know like getting to where that wasn't a problem whether I want or not [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2299.38s)]
*  it's a different nervousness than gambling oh a hundred percent yeah [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2302.9s)]
*  gambling I don't recall ever starting off nervous only only take that back now [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2307.0200000000004s)]
*  if I only had a couple barrels and I was on the road you know what I mean like [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2313.1000000000004s)]
*  and that's happened several times where you know let's just imagine now this is [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2316.1800000000003s)]
*  true story even smaller probably but let's just say I had a hundred bucks and [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2320.62s)]
*  that sounds crazy to be a thousand miles away and you know he gets a hundred [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2324.7s)]
*  bucks and a guy's trying to say come on I'll play some hunter to game one pocket [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2327.9s)]
*  right and I'm trying to get him to play for 50 so I can have two barrels you know [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2332.1s)]
*  and he's just insisting we play for a hundred so now I'll start off a little [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2337.02s)]
*  nervous knowing I got one barrel and if I quit after one game it looks real bad [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2341.22s)]
*  as far as the action and yeah you know so but I've had to do that a few times [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2345.18s)]
*  because percentages say I'm supposed to beat this guy you know and pump up oh [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2348.98s)]
*  percentages say yeah but I mean you know that's the difference that but I mean [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2354.26s)]
*  overall gamma and I played races to five for five thousand I played the biggest [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2359.06s)]
*  set I ever played was like 38 G's but I wasn't nervous at all really no I mean I [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2363.98s)]
*  knew the person I was playing we probably had history of playing before [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2370.3s)]
*  you know what I mean I knew what to expect you know generally it was one [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2373.3s)]
*  pocket more just wasn't as much big nine ball back in the day you know [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2376.98s)]
*  unlike today but but yeah the tournament is totally different and like you go up [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2381.46s)]
*  the scale like Moscone Cup it's off the charts that's why it's so impressive [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2388.06s)]
*  watching someone just break and run five racks in a row in a tournament it's just [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2391.82s)]
*  perfect precision it's because you know the control that's involved and all those [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2396.5s)]
*  little fine movements and oh yeah but that's the thing though when they heat [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2401.42s)]
*  up a little bit you know what I'm saying they start to forget about a [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2405.94s)]
*  little bit more they start to play better but even the fillers and fetters [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2409.3s)]
*  and all them you know and they'll tell you but they're nervous I mean you can [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2414.26s)]
*  see it out there you know like you know they're nervous but they're battling [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2418.18s)]
*  through it yeah I could imagine poor Max at a hundred and eighty beats per second [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2421.14s)]
*  he was pissed at me he beats permitted is so much that's like oh that's like a [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2425.58s)]
*  full-on sprint no it was way up there and there was somebody I can't remember [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2430.18s)]
*  maybe it was Shane that was like 90 or 85 like way way down there shuts that [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2435.2599999999998s)]
*  hearing aid off I know it's strong huh that's such a great thing to be able to [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2441.3s)]
*  do to shut the world out it's not a great thing to be deaf obviously but yeah to [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2445.38s)]
*  have that with pool you know it's almost like it's he's like it's like you know [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2449.22s)]
*  what a sensory deprivation tank is mm-hmm I'll show you one we have one out [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2456.7s)]
*  okay you lay in saltwater and you float and the water is the same temperature as [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2460.18s)]
*  your skin you close the door total silence total darkness and in the [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2464.62s)]
*  absence of sensory input your brain becomes like supercharged you can think [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2468.58s)]
*  about things better you see everything more clearly and you start to almost [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2473.38s)]
*  achieve like a psychedelic state while you're doing this and the benefit of not [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2479.38s)]
*  having sensory input is the other senses for whatever or your mind rather is more [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2484.72s)]
*  free it has less resources that are hogging up its you know it's yeah it [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2489.82s)]
*  makes its energy I imagine that's what's going on with him he just shuts that [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2494.9s)]
*  hearing aid off and he can probably just completely concentrate on the game well [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2500.1000000000004s)]
*  that and the one I thought about with him because he's always been talked about [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2505.82s)]
*  with practice so much right his regimen was so you know long right yeah but I [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2509.02s)]
*  mean to be able to shut them off when you're practicing and being a poor room [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2513.6200000000003s)]
*  you know what I mean right really get involved in yourself that's the big deal [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2516.86s)]
*  with most guys that practice even the ones that want to get bothered a lot you [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2519.66s)]
*  know what I mean right actions or whatnot probably also just a situation [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2523.46s)]
*  when people he was there people just left him alone they kind of knew it you [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2528.62s)]
*  know I was hanging out with Max Everly and we were at this pool hall in Las [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2532.1s)]
*  Vegas that this Italian guy owned this guy had the best food of any pool hall [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2537.2599999999998s)]
*  I've ever been to in my life I mean legit Italian food it was sensational he [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2543.46s)]
*  had lasagna and linguini with clams and garlic bread yeah this guy was from Italy and he [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2549.98s)]
*  would bring over food from he was like a chef in Italy he'd bring over his food [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2557.2200000000003s)]
*  from Italy like imported mortadella and all this it was insane that the food was [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2560.7400000000002s)]
*  so good but anyway this is while Shane was still on top of the world this is [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2564.58s)]
*  when he's doing the tar matches and all those things and we're playing it's like [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2568.62s)]
*  a Friday night before a UFC and Shane is practicing by himself for like five hours [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2572.74s)]
*  just five hours stroking in balls and getting perfect positions setting things [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2579.8199999999997s)]
*  up again and setting things up again for five hours by himself didn't talk to [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2585.5s)]
*  anybody just firing balls in well that's the amazing thing too you ever see him [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2590.18s)]
*  just sit on the back rail with the cue ball and set up the long shot hitting it [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2595.1s)]
*  100 miles an hour we'll try doing that for like three or four hours straight [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2599.58s)]
*  yeah hitting the ball that hard you know swinging that I mean you'll be wore out [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2603.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean he'll be he'll win the hot seat at the US Open and be the first guy [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2607.1s)]
*  practicing not even played till the next day you know be there eight hours nine [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2612.02s)]
*  hours getting ready next day wakes up does the same thing eight or nine hours [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2615.7s)]
*  before he's got to play the big final wow oh no he's sick he's a sicko for sure [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2620.46s)]
*  but I mean it shows though it shows yeah I mean under you know I don't know [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2625.54s)]
*  if there's anyone better in the tough shot ever I mean I know filler's awesome [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2632.1s)]
*  and everything but the true tough shot I mean under the biggest pressure maybe [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2635.86s)]
*  Shane's the best well he's certainly in the argument is the greatest of all time [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2639.62s)]
*  I mean you got a handful of people Efrain and so many different people we [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2643.62s)]
*  were talking about boost Amante when he was in his prime but the thing about all [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2648.06s)]
*  those guys like like when you go back to like the early days of tournament play [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2652.94s)]
*  and Efrain Reyes and the Filipino invasion like that was all gambling it [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2660.42s)]
*  was all gambling oh 100% which is one of the most exciting parts of the game of [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2665.2200000000003s)]
*  pool is this illegal aspect of it well it's like such a drip it's not illegal [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2670.5600000000004s)]
*  everywhere but in a lot of places it is well as soon as someone bets on the side [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2676.6200000000003s)]
*  it becomes illegal I think is how it works oh well that's illegal every single [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2680.42s)]
*  yeah right but if someone bets on the side in Texas yeah that's a former racketeering or [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2684.42s)]
*  something yeah something like that yeah yeah but Efrain you know the story [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2690.06s)]
*  you could have made a bet with your friends like what if you and I were playing no me and you [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2693.42s)]
*  are supposed to be able to play and we could bet a million okay and it wouldn't [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2697.7000000000003s)]
*  be a problem but Jamie couldn't bet on us I think that's something that's yeah or if [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2701.7000000000003s)]
*  there's someone taking a percentage of some sort that's kind of like the poker [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2705.42s)]
*  y'all got the legal poker around here right I do not know I don't play poker yeah well they [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2709.66s)]
*  got the legal poker rooms but they charge like pool time you know like by the hour so they don't [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2713.54s)]
*  take any money out of the pot you know interest yeah so it's legal now that makes sense yeah [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2718.06s)]
*  that's not a bad compromise but I feel like not being able to bet on your friend is un-American [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2723.06s)]
*  I were definitely not texting that's for sure you know I'm saying like if you're gambling with [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2729.02s)]
*  somebody and you're playing this someone I'm like I got money on Jeremy if I and if I say [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2734.5s)]
*  that that's illegal if like you were just making an agreement I think so yeah that's so crazy [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2739.54s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that sounds so crazy it happened once in Houston like right before I started [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2745.58s)]
*  actually a couple times but once in Houston at a pool room that I frequented like a year or two [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2750.42s)]
*  before I really started going there right when I was young they didn't take the guys that were [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2755.82s)]
*  playing they took the guys that were all betting on the side oh my god yeah is that crazy yeah [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2759.9s)]
*  meanwhile how many people are out there getting robbed for real Rob yeah right how many people [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2765.7400000000002s)]
*  could you've been arrested instead of like finding people or gambling the wrong way yeah there's a [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2770.98s)]
*  lot of those right yeah it's just it's such a like and you know like I said those two books [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2777.14s)]
*  are great at like depicting the romantic aspect of it playing off the rail and running the table [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2783.46s)]
*  but to have actually lived that life to actually been like when did you when did you come off that [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2789.18s)]
*  life like when did you stop like traveling constantly like town to town kind of thing [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2795.62s)]
*  yeah probably around 1998-99 I really jumped up in the rankings started being able to get like [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2801.46s)]
*  real sponsors paychecks stuff like that from sponsors but I still didn't quit gambling I [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2808.18s)]
*  still played plenty of people it was just kind of like it wasn't spent a lot of time traveling [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2815.34s)]
*  you know like waiting around like you might go somewhere if you know it's a good spot you know [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2820.46s)]
*  like somebody sent you there hey they're gambling you know but it might take a little time get to [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2824.5s)]
*  know you what not before they're comfortable you might stay a week two weeks three weeks at a place [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2827.86s)]
*  was there the fear that you entering into professional tournaments would knock your gambling [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2832.1800000000003s)]
*  by this time people everyone knew I mean you know it didn't take long before a few few trips I [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2837.58s)]
*  went by my middle name yeah because there were magazines that you know you could see what's [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=2845.94s)]

*  so so I beat him that set so now at hard times you've been there right in LA yeah yeah so they [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3003.5s)]
*  got the player side right with the tight tables and they got the looser tables well he had me on [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3011.22s)]
*  the looser tables thinking you know I'm just a sucker you know so he says the stake horse says [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3015.18s)]
*  double the bet and we'll give you the eight on the tight tables right so this is like really good [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3020.82s)]
*  for me you know now I'm getting a spot on even a tougher table so I beat him that set but during [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3026.1000000000004s)]
*  that second set a friend of mine had built me a cue and sent it out to the guy that ran the [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3031.5800000000004s)]
*  tournaments in LA right so I'm going by Tyler and this guy walks up and he says real loud he says [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3037.26s)]
*  are you Jeremy Jones? Oh no. He says if you are I got a cue for you you know and I was like no I [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3045.9s)]

*  Jeremy Jones you know and I just sent him on his way and then the next day when I came in Mark knew [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3058.62s)]
*  who I was and you know everyone spilled the beans kind of thing I had to go tell the guy all right [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3063.26s)]
*  that's my cue and everything so. Was he mad at you? No no not at all he understood it's kind of like a [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3068.14s)]
*  funny story around there now I think but Marcus was mad at me for a little while. Yeah that's why [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3073.5s)]
*  I was asked. Oh yeah because he was European you know and it was just kind of like you know if [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3078.22s)]
*  someone got me like that you know I'm gonna it's gonna sting but it's gonna be more like all right [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3082.78s)]
*  touche kind of thing you know what I'm saying later on you know we're gonna laugh about it and [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3087.62s)]
*  stuff but it took it's almost like if you first beat Efron he walks by you but he don't say much [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3091.34s)]
*  to you for about a month or two. Really? Oh yeah he's got to let that wear off a little bit but [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3096.66s)]
*  took it Marcus probably about a decade before it was bad. So when he beat you the first two [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3101.14s)]
*  sets even were you hustling a little? Well I might not have put forth my best effort but he played [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3107.68s)]
*  real good you know what I mean he was just all right let me pick up this four or five hundred. But were you purposely trying to set [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3115.62s)]
*  something up? Well I thought I you know I'm definitely not trying to win for 200 you know [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3119.9s)]
*  what I mean like his steak horse who now is actually after that trip became real good friend [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3125.2799999999997s)]
*  of mine you know at that time he was known you could beat him out of you know 40 and 50 you know [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3129.7s)]
*  thousand right so you're not gonna start off doing anything like that for 200 so. So when you first [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3134.5s)]
*  start playing you play good but you're not really bearing down. Right. So you're showing him that you [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3140.62s)]
*  can play a little but you might miss some shots that. Plus I wanted to see him play. Right. You know I [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3147.3799999999997s)]
*  heard the name I kind of wanted to really see because eventually to beat him out of the real [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3153.2999999999997s)]
*  money is gonna be playing even. Right. You know what I mean because he's another great player so that [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3157.18s)]
*  eventually was gonna happen but Marcus ended up having to leave the country for his visa got [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3161.58s)]
*  shortened up or something like that he actually ended up leaving the next day but I stuck around [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=3166.8599999999997s)]

*  also an understanding amongst guys who gamble with each other on a regular basis that it's I'm losing [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4378.36s)]
*  money to you you're losing money to me we're all good yeah absolutely yeah just a little going this [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4384.4800000000005s)]

*  tournament still under the name of Cesar Morales and he went up to Red Walling and he says mr. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4470.24s)]
*  Walling he said I got to ask you a question or I got to tell you something my my real name isn't [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4476.400000000001s)]

*  before he got to win in the tournament he wanted to fess up you know and so Red Walling said yeah [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4485.56s)]
*  just tell us your real name now so I will make sure you get paid you know pretty crazy and that [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4490.6s)]

*  in the Philippines that there was so much gambling going on in Texas back then and how did they know [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4501.72s)]
*  they could take this kid from the Philippines who turns out to be one of the greatest players if not [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4506.96s)]
*  the greatest it's ever lived and then just rob everybody well Philippines are everywhere Filipino [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4511.52s)]
*  people are everywhere I mean if you ego the tournament could be just I mean you just pick a [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4517.64s)]
*  place out of the blue if there's Filipino champion there there's gonna be a groves of them showing [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4523.360000000001s)]
*  up to watch so they keep kind of keep control of it plus there was one of the original guys that [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4528.400000000001s)]
*  was a top player him and his brother Rudy Pasquale and JR Pasquale they came before Efron and all [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4534.240000000001s)]
*  them and they lived in Houston so they they kind of brought them there for the for the Reds [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4540.52s)]
*  tournaments and all the action yeah so kind of like we said information right so they knew Efron [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4545.2s)]
*  in the Philippines or so effort had already had a name so if he had tried to come over as Efron Ray [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4552.96s)]
*  as people would already have heard about him absolutely 100% yeah and the thing is then at [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4558.12s)]
*  that point there were only a couple of them that you heard about from outside of America so Efron [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4564.5199999999995s)]
*  was one of them for sure it wouldn't get lost what is the the highest stakes match you've ever [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4569.32s)]
*  seen played probably in New Orleans there's a billionaire Carl Baum I think he took on like [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4575.04s)]
*  220,000 worth of action he's he's not a good player but he's not a bad player he's kind of [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4585.799999999999s)]
*  a guy and he comes down to a few tournaments and he plays real expensive you know on the bar table [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4591.599999999999s)]
*  he plays nine ball plays another weak player or he plays a good player getting a huge spot and like [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4596.68s)]
*  how much is he gambling oh I mean he's he's playing like six or seven games ahead or maybe [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4602.88s)]
*  a race to nine for you know in the middle might be like 80 or 100 but he'll bet another hundred [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4607.72s)]
*  on the side well when he comes everyone bets against him just because the you know you're [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4612.72s)]
*  looking at the odds right right yeah you're looking at and that's another thing in the pool [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4617.68s)]
*  room you might get a good game but you know the guy's short right so you got to wait you know [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4621.28s)]
*  what I mean you know you want to get the most out of that game if you do win yeah plump with cash [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4627.48s)]
*  exactly yeah that's interesting that's it's like all knowing when to pull the trigger knowing [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4631.84s)]
*  where a person's at you know when it's all prime knowing if they scored recently yeah how they're [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4638.5199999999995s)]
*  playing Tony Allen used to be the best because you know people bet on matches and stuff at the [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4643.88s)]
*  tournaments you know and he was just so in tune with all the players you know some of them some [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4650.04s)]
*  of their personal lives you know and like that makes a huge difference on his pool so mental oh [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4654.4s)]
*  yeah your girlfriend breaks up with you yeah kicked out of your apartment yeah now you might [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4660.04s)]
*  play like shit or or if like a couple things don't go your way to start with Tony you say that if he [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4664.88s)]
*  doesn't get it his way at the beginning he's gonna fold he's just in that mood right now you know [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4669.8s)]
*  what I'm saying so like just so many different aspects yeah so is the biggest games that you've [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4673.44s)]
*  seen played or really from people that aren't the best players have you seen what is like the most [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4681.0s)]
*  high stakes between like two elite players because I know there's there's some legendary stories [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4687.2s)]
*  about you know guys like Bustamante and Johnny Archer and runs the whole set yeah and Bustamante [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4692.16s)]
*  ups the bet yes let's flip the coin yeah double the bet and beat him yeah I was I played on that [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4700.16s)]
*  table that was in Toledo Ohio how many 13 and out 13 racks and out Johnny broke and ran 13 racks in [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4705.76s)]
*  a row yeah I would never play with another cue ever for a second in life yeah that cue is an [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4712.68s)]
*  extension of his soul all right to run 13 racks is so bananas yeah do it and how much were they [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4719.04s)]
*  I think it was like ten you know back then the thing is these days of course everything has gone [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4725.759999999999s)]
*  up in money right so but there's more being bet now so I would say like when Dennis and Shane [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4730.44s)]
*  played a few years ago here it is that was a huge one says one time we're in Toledo and Archer is [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4735.32s)]
*  playing Bustamante erased the 13 for 2000 2000 okay 13 consecutive racks in a row yeah Johnny [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4740.36s)]
*  was a bad ombre for money oh my god he was awesome in tournament but he's awesome in everything yeah [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4749.8s)]
*  just rarely ever saw him get beat for money I mean he would give guys that were like really good [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4755.52s)]
*  players the last four you know what I mean on tight tape oh no I got this Jeremy no problem you [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4759.52s)]
*  know never saw him practice by the way so yeah the guy like Johnny like with all this new technology [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4764.76s)]
*  with like carbon fiber cues and the like does a guy like that still play with a wood shaft I think [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4770.92s)]
*  so I haven't seen him playing in quite some time he it's been probably four or five years that I've [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4777.28s)]
*  seen since he's really been in a big competitive tournament now he did play the US Open a couple [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4782.16s)]
*  years ago won a match or two but didn't didn't do that well so I don't think he's playing a ton [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4786.719999999999s)]
*  so yeah last I saw him play yeah you know I think he opened a pool room there in North Georgia so [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4792.84s)]
*  doing a lot of that but this this technology thing like we were talking about this today that [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4800.4s)]
*  there's these new carbon fiber shafts and they're very consistent and all these people play with [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4805.719999999999s)]
*  them but some players still prefer the feedback that they get from wood and that's part of the [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4811.0s)]
*  enjoyment of the game is like feeling that feedback in your hand yeah I think so I mean you know you [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4817.94s)]
*  definitely get a lot of feel you know you don't want something that's like a two by four right I [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4824.5199999999995s)]
*  mean you know that's why you know players they break in like they get a new cue they break in [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4828.88s)]
*  the shaft the oils off your hands you know just a number of things you like I think one of the [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4835.32s)]
*  things about the carbon fiber which I like I like it but you get a lot out of it but sometimes you [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4840.56s)]
*  know if you get a little hairy that miss can be a little uglier really yeah just because it does [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4846.92s)]
*  put a little more spin on the ball you know it's just just a higher little higher spin rate overall [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4852.92s)]
*  so I mean you know if you get a little you know like say you decel the ball could be real ugly you [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4857.36s)]
*  know or if you really over hit it you know but my point would that like Johnny played perfect with [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4862.88s)]
*  a wooden shaft like try how would you convince that guy to even try carbon fiber well if he could [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4868.679999999999s)]
*  just do it a little easier you know if you can swing a little yeah yeah yeah you could swing a [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4875.12s)]
*  little more you know subtly hate to say soft or anything like that but just a little less on it [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4881.12s)]
*  overall or let's say you're putting a tip and a half of left English maybe you only got to go a [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4886.28s)]
*  tip or a half a tip mm-hmm no it's a little comfort level you know comfort overall it just [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4891.32s)]
*  makes the ball react differently yeah and I don't know exactly all the technology behind it other [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4897.2s)]
*  than you know we can you can build them how you want exactly right would there's still a little [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4902.44s)]
*  variable I think yeah but the thing that bums me out is that part of pool is the custom cue [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4907.88s)]
*  makers there's like these guys that are making these beautiful functional pieces of art oh [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4915.48s)]
*  absolutely absolutely you know what you know with the carbon fiber I guess most the companies and [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4921.44s)]
*  really with the playability it's gone to more performance than it is even though they are you [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4926.48s)]
*  know they make attractive cues and all that but it you wouldn't say it's the the time and effort [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4932.839999999999s)]
*  like some of your handcrafted cues right it's just about winning yeah about showing up with a [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4937.16s)]
*  ball of bush yeah yeah that's a great scene oh I loved I've made a post about my new cue the [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=4942.96s)]

*  but what my point is it's like the video game thing gets people too and it got me as well for [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5045.44s)]
*  a while I was completely addicted to playing online quake yeah played like these 3d shooters [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5050.759999999999s)]

*  log on and you find some server somewhere and there's some guy waiting to play and you get in [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5061.839999999999s)]
*  and then you just chase after each other in these maps and you hear footsteps and rockets coming at [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5066.679999999999s)]
*  you oh yeah it's so but I bought a lot of that stuff for the kids have you oh yeah but what it [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5072.48s)]
*  doesn't do though it's like it doesn't clear your mind the way pool does when you're playing pool [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5077.959999999999s)]
*  I think it's a lot like archery and then it's so difficult to do to have like precision and move [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5085.5199999999995s)]
*  the occasionally when you do it right and you're cleaning your mind it's like so satisfying whereas [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5091.599999999999s)]
*  video games are just exciting when it's over you're like cracked out yeah when I would end I'd be [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5098.16s)]
*  like oh Jesus Christ like adrenaline's all fucked up like I gotta go home yeah this is too much it's [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5102.48s)]

*  they're putting to get in like it's crunch time and they're getting to the end of a video game [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5168.4400000000005s)]

*  it's so captivating it's so difficult for them to put them down because they're so good now and [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5202.280000000001s)]
*  the graphics are so insane it's like it's so much more exciting and for a lot of kids they [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5207.16s)]
*  don't want to be outside maybe they get picked on maybe someone fox with them at school like [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5212.0s)]
*  they just can't wait to live in that world well I think the parents do to be fair I see parents [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5215.44s)]
*  that don't mind the kids being upstairs you know doing their own thing self-included at times you [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5221.04s)]

*  our age can get addicted to those things right oh yeah we set up a local area network at our old [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5235.2s)]
*  studio and I had a quick cold turkey I was like this is too much Jamie and me and our friend Jeff [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5241.64s)]

*  too crazy just too addictive yeah I have a friend in st. Louis he has places all over st. Louis and [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5252.88s)]
*  other towns just for gaming people can come in 24-7 they pay a membership couch is set up [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5258.44s)]
*  bunch of gaming set up oh so they just come in and just log on to a game yeah yeah they pay a [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5264.88s)]
*  monthly for it makes sense especially if you can't afford like great equipment you know yeah and I [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5270.8s)]
*  think social too I think it's fairly social oh yeah for sure yeah it's probably a great place to [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5276.56s)]
*  buy weed too they have the automated pool rooms now around the country you know where there's no [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5281.68s)]
*  one working automated pool rooms oh yeah there's several throughout the country now where you just [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5289.68s)]
*  you know they got ten tables or whatever they got vending machines and whatnot you just have your [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5295.2s)]
*  card that lets you in and has cameras and all that you have to be there with a member if you're not [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5299.92s)]
*  you know what I mean kind of monthly fee yeah oh so you log in with your card and however many [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5304.92s)]
*  hours you play does it charge you by the hour well a lot of them have like a you can buy the [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5311.4400000000005s)]
*  membership plus so many hours a month at a discounted charge you understand you know where [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5318.2s)]
*  you get a little break or you can just pay the hourly I think so like your credit cards on file [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5323.36s)]
*  or something that's kind of a bummer because like the house man at a pool hall there's always been [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5327.88s)]
*  some interesting humans oh absolutely yeah how can you get rid of the house man yeah but I mean [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5333.0s)]
*  you know for for big places like Miami has one Des Moines has one Seattle has one that's kind [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5337.84s)]
*  of part-time meaning half the week they're kind of regular and then the other half the week they're [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5344.08s)]
*  kind of automated on the slower days so I mean I guess I it's better than not being open well [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5349.52s)]
*  they can go 24-7 also like a lot of them are 24-7 where people can you know kind of like a gym you [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5356.64s)]
*  know they can kind of go at their own leisure so you have a car to get in yeah so it's a club yeah [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5362.52s)]
*  basically that's well that makes sense yeah it's better I mean yeah you know a lot of people carry [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5368.120000000001s)]
*  some bigger products out of there and whatnot sell you some stuff you know make appointment [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5373.400000000001s)]
*  maybe like Tony Robles you know him sure yeah he's part of one in Miami oh yeah and he coaches a lot [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5377.04s)]
*  out of there and stuff so oh yeah that's all right that makes sense that makes a lot of sense so how [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5384.72s)]
*  often are you on the road doing commentary now probably 15 weeks a year probably or so but I do [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5391.6s)]
*  some remotely from home as well but the bigger events I travel do you ever play when you go to [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5402.64s)]
*  these places occasionally but not in the tournament of course I'm just working right but matchup I [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5407.320000000001s)]
*  actually played a guy in London a couple months ago yeah yeah and I think I surprised him a little [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5412.88s)]
*  bit he's a good player you know this guy so right but he thought you were done yeah I think he [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5419.76s)]
*  thought he was gonna win you know he had beaten Darren Appleton last year gambling you know so [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5425.6s)]
*  that tells you he's a good player you know yeah I mean I think he was an underdog playing Darren [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5430.24s)]
*  but he did beat him and so and he's kind of a crazy guy like known to do some super crazy [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5433.84s)]
*  stuff like probably stuff I can't say on here you know okay you know like you can just imagine [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5440.24s)]

*  that when he wants to play again is he trying to get a spot no too proud this guy really yeah but [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5462.84s)]
*  that's good though I mean he's like I think he's very very wealthy man you know kind of like family [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5468.32s)]
*  stuff but but I don't I can't remember ever asking for a spot from any good player oh wow [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5473.24s)]
*  yeah well that's where he gets his juice right well he tries to beat you with the bet you know [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5478.76s)]
*  like he went on I'll play SVB to not two thousand a set two thousand a game you know pounds again [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5484.12s)]
*  you know like yeah so he you know he didn't try that with me as much but I beat him you know like [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5490.08s)]
*  three sets we're betting that much thousand right hurt a couple sets thousand but then he went to [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5496.12s)]
*  like let's play three thousand a game you know I'm like yeah yeah I mean yeah we're gonna put up [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5501.2s)]
*  like 60,000 let's go you know anybody I mean you know let's not do it and just play like two [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5509.12s)]
*  games I don't do that right so better off to just play sets know where you're at how many [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5513.88s)]
*  different pros this guy matched up with several I mean I think he's played Darren a few times he [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5519.2s)]
*  plays all the English guys over there I think he actually has played Shane before really yeah I [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5524.48s)]
*  think of course Shane beat him but but yeah he tries to play as many as he can he plays a lot [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5531.16s)]
*  of local guys over in England is that common that guys match up like that in England no this is the [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5535.84s)]
*  guy that kind of creates the action oh yeah most the action that happens with the good players is [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5541.84s)]
*  through this guy you know but now you know what English eight ball is right yes okay so that's [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5547.96s)]
*  hit the scene again so now they're they're playing you might have saw the video on it but they're [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5553.04s)]
*  playing like huge sets hundred thousand pound sets of English eight ball gambling yeah huge sets [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5559.0s)]
*  yeah and English eight ball it's just like different colored balls they don't have numbers [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5565.04s)]
*  right right and then it's basically like eight ball there's maybe a couple little bitty rules [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5570.76s)]
*  that are different but the pockets are different remember like the Chinese eight ball we're talking [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5576.44s)]
*  about there so they're rounded pockets like a snooker table but the balls are smaller also so [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5581.0s)]
*  it's all fairly comparable so the balls are smaller than pool balls yeah how much smaller I [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5586.44s)]
*  think they're like snooker snooker ball size oh really yeah yeah because the pockets around it [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5592.48s)]
*  you know and what's the size of the table three and a half by seven oh yeah oh interesting yeah [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5597.24s)]
*  there it is right there yeah that's kind of like what Jason Shaw started playing on for the most [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5603.4s)]
*  part or played a lot of Darren he was a world champion at this game and do these guys use pool [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5608.2s)]
*  cues oh wow look how small it is in comparison they use like snooker cues you know more the [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5613.12s)]
*  wood you know now what is the benefit of that because like this is I've always wanted to ask [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5619.0s)]
*  someone like you these questions like what why would they play with us cue that's really really [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5624.56s)]
*  stiff if well they that little ball deflects and you know the felt they play on kind of promotes [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5630.12s)]
*  deflection a little easier as well that thicker nap felt you know you've seen this snooker felt [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5636.92s)]
*  right yeah it's kind of like directional felt you can actually wave your hand and the direct [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5641.6s)]
*  the felt so thick it'll change directions you know what I mean so much slower yeah it's well [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5646.2s)]
*  they've gotten it to where it's actually much faster now than it ever was but not as fast as [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5650.88s)]
*  Simona's no it shouldn't be much slower than what yeah and and the lighter balls don't go as far [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5655.599999999999s)]
*  like three cushion mm-hmm that's why they use the big balls because they go five six seven rails [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5661.72s)]
*  with the cue ball right yeah so it goes a long ways but yeah the stiffer but to me it's kind of [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5666.599999999999s)]
*  weird because they don't put much side spin on the ball right you know unless they have a cupcake [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5671.96s)]
*  that's laid up in the hole there are the real close to it they aren't putting side spin on the [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5676.92s)]
*  ball has anybody tried to develop a carbon fiber snooker cue oh yeah there's a guy Q tech actually [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5681.4s)]
*  did and there's a guy that qualified for the tour using it yeah from he's one of Q tech players [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5687.4800000000005s)]
*  that's the weird thing is how every cue react it's like you're getting feedback from every [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5693.68s)]
*  different one that's slightly different and how it makes the ball react yeah it's like tips [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5700.84s)]
*  everything else when you're on the road do these players ever match up with each other oh yeah [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5707.4400000000005s)]
*  like common yeah Vegas is a real good one you know we're there for two like the one I saw you at I [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5712.28s)]
*  met you at right yes that March I think it was yeah that one there were there for two weeks and [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5717.400000000001s)]
*  the Europeans and the Asian they all like to gamble it's just not something that happens a lot [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5723.96s)]
*  where they're from but when they get over here yeah they make a lot of games and they're all [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5730.44s)]
*  getting introduced to one pocket they all like one pocket you know so one thing about one pocket [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5734.12s)]
*  compared to nine balls it's just a little easier to make a game there's more room to match up you [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5738.919999999999s)]
*  know so like say for instance me and you're gonna play each other nine ball most likely I'm gonna [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5744.5199999999995s)]
*  give you a game that I can't win at or I'm gonna give you a game that you can't win at like the [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5750.919999999999s)]
*  handicap you know what I'm saying it's hard to make a game unless you get two guys that are real [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5755.599999999999s)]
*  close to each other right in level but one pocket for some reason the spot shows up so you can make [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5759.8s)]
*  it that you know a game where I go to 10 balls you go to five or six or something right and it [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5766.92s)]
*  actually in time you'll start to see it it's pretty fair you know if the game's right so where you can [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5771.64s)]
*  see a big ups and downs tosses and turns you know it's just not as exciting to watch no no I mean [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5778.2s)]
*  you got to get into it you know it's it's it's not as fast right but most people that get into it [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5783.72s)]
*  they love it there's no doubt about that oh I get it I mean it's a very intricate game but as far as [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5788.6s)]
*  like getting people to tune into it you don't have a chance in hell oh no chance zero chance no chance [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5795.400000000001s)]
*  even though in the pool world which is pretty vast you know that it's the biggest watch streams [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5802.04s)]
*  really yeah like the head-up matches you know there might be a nine ball that comes along every now and [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5809.72s)]
*  again but for the most part because the one pocket people spend you know they got money those are [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5815.0s)]
*  gamblers you know what I mean yeah yeah it's weird that that's the big gambling game yeah well that's [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5820.6s)]
*  the only reason is again because you can take you can match levels yeah yeah there's so many ways to [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5826.04s)]
*  match up you know I mean I played games you know I played a guy in st. Louis one time 55 to 8 or 9 [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5831.72s)]
*  I think it was wow so I had to spot my first whatever 40 balls 42 balls or something yeah yeah [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5840.52s)]
*  now that's a little extreme spot yeah yeah we were and you know you got to bet a little higher [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5848.040000000001s)]
*  because the games don't go very fast right right but uh you know you know what backgammon is of [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5852.120000000001s)]
*  course right and you know how they play with the cube yes okay so we played one pocket big money [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5857.160000000001s)]
*  with the cube so say me and you are playing the cubes neutral well say you break the balls [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5862.280000000001s)]
*  and say we're playing for 100 a point on the on the cube right and you break the balls and break [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5868.52s)]
*  bad and sell out a shot a scratch or whatever right okay well I can take the cube and offer it to you [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5873.64s)]
*  and you either got to take the cube and now we're playing for 200 because the cube always doubles [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5880.6s)]
*  right like backgammon or you got to pay off that game for 100 and we start a new one whoa you see [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5885.08s)]
*  like the backgammon right now this is the advantage if I offer to you the cube and you accept it [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5891.64s)]
*  now you're in control of the cube so if you turn things around later in the game to where it's your [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5898.04s)]
*  advantage you're the only one that can offer the cube back so now you offer it back to me and I say [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5903.08s)]
*  I either got to pay off the 200 that we're playing for now or now it's worth 400 you see and but now [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5909.64s)]
*  I'm in control of the cube because I accepted it oh that's a great way to play oh that's exciting [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5917.0s)]
*  oh yeah and you can do that almost any game when you can do it on the golf course [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5923.32s)]
*  like you like your guy hits right and before you hit say he hits it in a rough I can say all right [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5927.0s)]
*  we're playing for 100 a hole I'm offering you the cube you want to take the cube and play for 200 [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5933.24s)]
*  this hole before you see me hit or you want to pay off the 100 wow what's it called hammering [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5938.2s)]
*  hammering have you done this a couple times Jamie's a golf junkie well backgammon is the most [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5944.679999999999s)]
*  popular place the cubes kind of known for you know what I mean and gambling because it's a [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5952.52s)]
*  it's a numbers game so you read your numbers right your position you say I like my position [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5956.92s)]
*  I'm gonna say I'll offer you the cube great way to gamble by the way especially if you're there for [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5961.160000000001s)]
*  a while like you're playing a guy all the time that's interesting yeah but you can't do that [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5968.04s)]
*  with nine ball really but you could do it with one pocket because the one pocket it's a vast game it [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5973.0s)]
*  might take an hour right you know yeah that makes sense yeah but still nine balls the most [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5978.12s)]
*  fun thing to watch well especially these days it's off the charts I have too much add for one pocket [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5983.4s)]
*  you know how many times I've heard that before yeah from all people that were telling you the [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5989.48s)]
*  truth and then they end up becoming great one pocket players are you talking about like pro [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5993.08s)]
*  nine-ball players it may be you know the diagnosis for your for your add I don't have that kind of [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=5997.64s)]
*  time no I barely have time to play a few hours a week you know which is frustrating because like [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6002.84s)]
*  right when I get warmed up then I gotta stop yeah I gotta go somewhere because we were talking [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6007.96s)]
*  about this it's so nuts like what's required to play really good pool but it's really eight hours [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6012.28s)]
*  a day we both kind of agreed on that right oh I'm you know I used to gamble and then I'd play [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6017.0s)]
*  between right but when I decided to go ahead and just I moved to Jacksonville Florida and I didn't [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6022.52s)]
*  know anyone wasn't a real gambling place had some action but I just said all right I'm just [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6028.52s)]
*  gonna practice I'm gonna forget about the gambling I'll see how I can do on this tour this 98 and the [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6032.68s)]
*  98 once I started doing the eight hours a day I went from like 24th to first on tour wow ended [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6037.48s)]
*  up fourth on tour for that year Earl ended up winning the tour that year but but then got back [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6046.12s)]
*  the first another 10 or months later a year later and hovered around the top 10 for 10 or 12 years [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6051.719999999999s)]
*  mainly just because of that practicing I could tell the difference between me and the next guy [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6058.2s)]
*  yeah 100% and when you're practicing you're practicing with purpose right you're practicing [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6063.24s)]
*  you're not just throwing balls around you're setting things up oh yeah and the main thing to [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6068.68s)]
*  me and this this will make you practice well is if you just put yourself in a tournament setting [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6073.56s)]
*  you know like take your time go look at your position you know what I'm saying like you don't [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6079.72s)]
*  slow play or anything just what you would normally do right you know most of guys want to just swing [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6083.320000000001s)]
*  the cue a little bit and then when they get in the tournament all of a sudden slow down [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6087.88s)]
*  yeah it's a hard thing to do all of a sudden yeah better off just go ahead and play speedy around [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6091.0s)]
*  the table like you've been doing you know that's the same thing with fighting oh I'm sure yeah you [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6096.36s)]
*  you want to really practice the same way that you perform you know you don't want to spar hard all [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6102.28s)]
*  the time but you you definitely don't want to try to switch up what you do in the intense competition [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6108.2s)]
*  oh absolutely I mean you know Skyler Woodward huge huge talent I mean I think he really could [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6115.88s)]
*  be number one player in the world yeah we were just talking about him yeah just a real keen mind [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6121.0s)]
*  and one thing I tell him I don't need a thousand balls a day you need 300 quality balls a day [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6125.400000000001s)]
*  you know what I mean and that's a huge difference and right I think he's doing that a little more [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6130.52s)]
*  and it's uh it's shown yeah it's it requires so much of you it's tough it requires so much you [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6134.76s)]
*  have to be a full-on addict you know and that's those are the guys who succeed in this wild game [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6142.5199999999995s)]
*  but everyone is attracted to it like the idea of being a good pool player is very attractive to [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6149.5599999999995s)]
*  people oh yeah yeah once you start to see that ball move but well everyone's played it right [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6155.719999999999s)]
*  that's why everyone's player they realize oh yeah we we went out and had a beer and played one game [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6162.12s)]
*  over an hour and a half you know or a couple you know we had four drinks and we played one game [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6166.759999999999s)]
*  you know just because it's so difficult so but it's it's one of those things that if you like a [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6171.64s)]
*  person like yourself like literally made a living running around gambling doing it like what [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6177.8s)]
*  percentage of the population has ever done that for years and years yeah very slim I'm my last [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6183.08s)]
*  regular job I was 19 a lot of people uh they most people laugh some are not that happy about that [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6189.0s)]
*  so they've been working you know pretty hard which hey it takes a lot of hard work though [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6196.68s)]
*  it's not easy well it 100 takes a lot of work but how did you transition from doing that to being [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6201.0s)]
*  able to do uh such good commentary because one of the things that I really enjoy about your commentary [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6208.12s)]
*  is you explain all the different things that's happening to the ball you explain what could cause [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6213.48s)]
*  problems and then a lot of times those problems occur and go yeah you know that's a common mistake [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6221.56s)]
*  yeah how did you develop the ability to articulate all these thoughts so smoothly [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6226.44s)]
*  uh I think uh man I grew up loving commentators you know whenever I was a kid you knew all the [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6232.599999999999s)]
*  commentators because there wasn't cable television and all the games weren't on 38 different channels [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6239.88s)]
*  and you know so you kind of learned to know that cosale was coming on monday and frank gifford and [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6244.44s)]
*  all those guys right so those uh I really like those moments and uh and then I was always a [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6249.88s)]
*  sports guy just I've always been able to pick apart the smaller things in the games [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6256.12s)]
*  you know I was a really good baseball player believe it or not I was a really good tennis [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6261.32s)]
*  player you know look I used to be like 260 in high school playing tennis you know yeah but I [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6265.0s)]
*  knew how to take advantage of all the smart sides of the game you know so I could pick apart you [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6270.84s)]
*  know if I did it this way he's most likely going to hit the ball back that way you know I learned [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6275.72s)]
*  all the little things that would help out a slow fat guy right right so um and I did the same in [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6279.8s)]
*  baseball just was really good at the things I could do really well and and uh I think you just learn [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6285.56s)]
*  more that way and and then pool I was super lucky Joe I mean I mean I was around the buddy halls [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6291.320000000001s)]
*  jersey reds never had a problem with Nick Vaughn or any of those guys uh helping me and then I [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6296.92s)]
*  played Efron all the time you know so learning the game I learned it a lot and uh but as far as the [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6302.84s)]
*  speaking side I never thought twice about it too much just kind of do it you know like but it's [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6307.8s)]
*  it's that you can articulate all the problems that can occur yeah well I mean I've been teaching the [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6313.88s)]
*  last eight years that helps a little bit um but I just always been one to be able to see the table [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6318.68s)]
*  like right after a break I can see a lot I can just visualize a lot um recognize a problem pretty [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6324.6s)]
*  easily and then I pay attention to where and understand it's probably the same thing in your [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6330.6s)]
*  your field to where the mistakes are common if you see if you see them coming you know what I'm [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6336.04s)]
*  saying like you know from one player to the next whether it be the position they played the stroke [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6341.400000000001s)]
*  they made you know what I mean tip position it doesn't matter they're pretty common mistakes [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6345.56s)]
*  throughout the players you just got to be able to recognize them one of the things that I really [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6349.96s)]
*  love about the game is that there are these two sides of it there are there is the quiet tournament [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6353.8s)]
*  play with the applause after a great run out and then there's the pool hall which is so different [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6359.48s)]
*  where people learn how to play pool and where people gamble playing pool and then where they [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6367.0s)]
*  get really good then all of a sudden they're doing some totally different thing now now you're [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6371.879999999999s)]
*  playing in this very professional tournament where you're wearing slacks and nice shoes and a golf [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6376.28s)]
*  shirt and oh yeah it's fascinating that there's these two different worlds yeah and they that's [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6381.16s)]
*  where the smarts come in you kind of learn to live in both right yeah when when you were coming up [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6387.24s)]
*  was it more colorful than it is now do you think that like because there's so many more professionals [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6394.2s)]
*  now and they're so good yeah and I think at times they're they're trained to be a little more [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6400.04s)]
*  machine like you know what I mean like oh you can't lose this focus you know and where I [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6408.12s)]
*  watch some older tapes and I see some of the guys you know I look at Efron for instance man you can [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6414.04s)]
*  tell he's nervous but he's enjoying it you know he was really a sportsman out there and I think [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6417.88s)]
*  that's the one thing we're missing a little bit of not the playing side of things and of course the [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6422.5199999999995s)]
*  guys personalities exactly you know and and the good thing is they're getting a little more in front [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6427.48s)]
*  of the camera now so I think it's starting to come out yeah but it's just like you can't fake [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6432.28s)]
*  someone being a nut like you can't fake a Keith McCready type character or even [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6437.8s)]
*  Earl Strickland type character like that's just what they are exactly yeah you can't just come up [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6443.16s)]
*  with lines trying to it's just them you know like you know if you ever hung out with Earl which I'm [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6447.639999999999s)]
*  sure you have and yeah if he starts to tell you about stories how we should be playing and where [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6452.76s)]
*  we should be at it's it's some of the greatest experience you'll ever have because he's so genuine [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6457.8s)]
*  about it like he really truly believes we're supposed to be you know on the biggest stages [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6462.76s)]
*  yeah well his commentary is awesome too I love when he reviews matches yeah just does all by [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6469.48s)]
*  himself review it you can learn a lot from the way he moves the ball around oh yeah like that's it's [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6474.36s)]
*  very interesting just to hear the thought process behind it do you what do you have a part of the [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6479.879999999999s)]
*  game that you like more do you like the pool hall gambling part more or the tournament more [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6485.4s)]
*  that's hard they but if like one of the things about pools we got to clean up pool and stop [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6491.32s)]
*  gambling you hear that all the time and my thought is always like no you don't like what are you [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6497.16s)]
*  doing oh no I mean I think society today is fine with it you know of course you don't want like [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6503.32s)]
*  real bad bad things happening or anything like that and I haven't seen that like my career people [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6509.24s)]
*  ask me about you know a few times I was a little sketched about this or that but I mean you know [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6514.12s)]
*  for the most part I mean it's just as easy as normal normal living over overall you know you [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6519.5599999999995s)]
*  never got in a situation where you I wouldn't say that but um how many situations did you get [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6524.68s)]
*  in where they were like real touch well give me one that's touch and go uh well you know I think [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6529.88s)]
*  I told you you know just being safe I'd leave the pool room and it wasn't the people you were [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6535.0s)]
*  gambling with it was the people that knew cash was around they they weren't necessarily pool players [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6539.88s)]
*  or anything like that right and so you'd leave the pool room and you drive around 20-30 minutes if [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6544.52s)]
*  you're in a you know charles and south galina or somewhere you know before you went back but just [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6549.4800000000005s)]
*  to make sure no one's following you yeah yeah I was real lucky you know knock on wood I was never [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6553.56s)]
*  robbed uh in any form or fashion a few times I got warned maybe something guys were talking about [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6558.360000000001s)]
*  things so oh yeah one time in LA I was not to go in too deep something I'll tell you later but uh [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6565.96s)]
*  you know there was kind of like some mobster guys that were kind of uh kind of taking aim on me and [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6572.92s)]
*  a friend of mine we'd won a bunch of money around there like a hundred thousand and uh yeah they were [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6578.360000000001s)]
*  trying to get it so we got out of there pretty quick yeah and I was very fortunate that actually [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6583.32s)]
*  one of the guys I beat out of probably half the money is the one that told me really yeah we had [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6588.5199999999995s)]
*  become friends and whatnot and uh and uh he just came in to me one day and he kind of laid it on [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6593.96s)]
*  the line a little bit for me and uh yeah so time to get out of dodge yeah yeah even though you know [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6598.759999999999s)]
*  he was still wanting to have a stab at his money of course but uh you know we continued that later [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6605.4s)]
*  well that's nice of him to do oh heck yeah well we like comics have favorite places to perform [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6610.84s)]

*  is that the case with pool too it's like there's like hot spot areas oh absolutely what causes [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6621.4s)]
*  these you know is it just like one great pool room and people sometimes yes usually a steak [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=6627.639999999999s)]

*  let me make the game yeah exactly right but he you know directed that energy towards trying to [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7034.04s)]
*  be the best in the world and yeah you know it's paid off pretty well for him yeah it's it's uh [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7040.28s)]
*  it's always to me fascinating to watch a person who rises above all like what are they doing [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7046.68s)]
*  different like what's going on how are they doing this so much better than everybody else [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7053.72s)]
*  and you know with him it's just the obsessive practice and just this fucking focus that he has [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7058.36s)]
*  yeah that's the one that you know i think any of us can practice and at times i feel like his [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7064.679999999999s)]
*  practice could uh be better and i don't mean it unfairly meaning like get a little more out of it [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7070.5199999999995s)]
*  sometimes like i've seen him shoot there sit there and shoot a 900 mile an hour jacked up stop shot [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7077.08s)]
*  for hours you mean that's going to come up like once every year right here it does i know i know [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7083.24s)]
*  i know there's a lot to get back on but the thing that i was getting at is he's just a unique [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7089.639999999999s)]
*  individual with the focus like when he gets those crazy eyes when those eyes the oxygen starts [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7094.679999999999s)]
*  making them oh my god i'm like all right we're home we're good because if the ball's laid tough [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7100.44s)]
*  no one's beating them you know if both players get a tough layout no one's beating them so when [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7106.76s)]
*  you are the coach of the mosconi cup is he the guy that you're like most happy he's in the clench [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7112.28s)]
*  yeah i mean i was talking about earlier uh last night with my buddies the ones you met uh and uh [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7119.32s)]
*  you know the best thing for me coming to musconi as far as a decision is hill hill and do i gotta [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7124.759999999999s)]
*  pick skyler or shane to to play that hill hill match you know pretty good decision yeah just [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7129.639999999999s)]
*  because you know you gotta say shane's the the probably the pick most of the time but i mean [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7135.0s)]
*  skyler's one of those that may prove you different that week you know what i mean it may be like a [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7140.76s)]
*  no-brainer you know so hmm and the mosconi cup is fascinating because it's it's they openly [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7145.24s)]
*  encourage cheering like it's so why i'm joking let's hear this hear the volume on this [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7152.76s)]
*  pressure pack oh that was when yeah yeah that's 2018 when we won after losing eight years in a row [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7160.839999999999s)]
*  but so these i don't think that crowds like how are they so much different for the [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7173.16s)]
*  mosconi cup than they were they're singing and dancing yeah they're you know usa versus europe [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7178.5199999999995s)]
*  oh yeah it's big you know they're i mean all those countries they're big on that i mean [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7184.36s)]
*  soccer fans i mean it's just freaking crazy is that okay is that but is that is that better would [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7189.5599999999995s)]
*  that make it more exciting if people cheered in between shots but didn't do it at all while the [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7195.96s)]
*  guys down on the ball like if because it seems like they're good at that well they somewhat get [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7201.16s)]
*  almost settled you know occasionally you still have something peep out you're settled down [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7206.04s)]
*  yeah yeah the referee well your call the first place it was a small venue only 600 is when i [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7210.839999999999s)]
*  started now that one had like 3000 i think right on top of you you know what i mean right on top [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7216.679999999999s)]
*  of you you can feel everyone's energy but your call they used to have like laser pointers the [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7221.799999999999s)]
*  crowd did and they'd point at the nine ball while we're shooting i mean they were ruthless yeah [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7226.839999999999s)]
*  because they had two sessions a noon and a six so they start drinking about 11 30 well by the time [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7231.879999999999s)]
*  the six o'clock come there were fights every time i mean it was unbelievable yeah i mean but amongst [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7238.2s)]
*  friends that came together you know what i mean like those english are but it's so much different [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7243.88s)]
*  than any other pool tournament and one of the things i was thinking was jamie and i jamie showed [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7248.44s)]
*  me that golf tournament where they play in front of a giant audience in phoenix you mean yeah yeah [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7253.24s)]
*  like that's amazing yeah like that's what a great idea where everybody's cheering and screaming [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7259.5599999999995s)]
*  oh yeah and maybe that's a thing that like with the muscone cup if you had a high stakes [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7265.48s)]
*  game like that where people in the audience reacted like that oh yeah maybe that would get [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7273.16s)]
*  more people engaged well i think that but the thing with the long ones man they just play too [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7279.24s)]
*  long races a race to a hundred i mean come on let's right let's cut it up and do three out of five [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7283.32s)]

*  because it was always very quiet well the thing is the players are loosening up a little more so [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7318.76s)]
*  you know the fans are going to follow what the players they want to engage with the players [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7323.88s)]

*  kind of gaming that promoted in some areas i think new york was one of them really yeah juke boxes [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7568.92s)]

*  executive billiards where i used to play they had a vhs player and they played the hustler all the [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7656.28s)]
*  time all the time to the point where like everybody in the pool hall could like say the words they knew [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7662.44s)]
*  it they knew every line whenever great movie is a sad story though so unbelievable it's a fucking [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7668.12s)]
*  bummer man yeah they made some bummer movies back then yeah well big parts of it would be so [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7674.76s)]
*  sad it had you know it had great highs right but i mean like when he's beating fats but then you [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7680.68s)]
*  just know what's coming and it's just yeah there about the next hour the movie's just like tear [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7685.8s)]
*  jerker yeah um another thing that was amazing about that movie is how good jackie gleason played [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7690.52s)]
*  oh yeah jackie gleason could really play oh yeah watch the difference between watching a guy like [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7696.4400000000005s)]
*  tom cruise or watching a guy like paul newman tom cruise was better than paul newman but [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7701.64s)]
*  jackie gleason looked like a real player yeah it wasn't painful to watch no not at all no it wasn't [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7706.76s)]
*  like lifting the cue up with every shot like there's some scenes with newman where you gotta [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7711.88s)]
*  you gotta reshoot that don't do that don't lift the cue up as you're shooting that's ridiculous [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7715.72s)]
*  yeah when he's breaking the balls and that one scene i think it comes up but well he shot a ball [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7720.200000000001s)]
*  like with follow and like lifted the cue up at the same like stay down stay down yeah great [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7725.240000000001s)]
*  actor though but oh yeah but all his shots were kind of like trick shots yeah a little more you [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7731.5599999999995s)]
*  know they looked okay yeah it looked okay it wasn't offensive you know no no no but jackie gleason [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7736.36s)]
*  looked like a player the way he would stroke the ball like wow and you could see him making break [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7743.5599999999995s)]
*  shots like you see his whole body and moving the cue ball and all that yeah well they say he was a [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7748.679999999999s)]
*  uh a racquetball i think at one time as a kid and then just was a real character like a pull hole [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7754.759999999999s)]
*  kind of guy so makes sense yeah yeah yeah for sure all his all his roles he kind of played not [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7760.36s)]
*  later in his years but you know the honeymooners and whatnot it seemed like the kind of guy that [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7766.679999999999s)]
*  could fit in the pool hall pretty well yeah yeah kind of again a lot of charisma it's just [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7770.599999999999s)]
*  interesting that that one movie which was like this massive movie where he plays a serious character [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7776.28s)]
*  and it's not funny at all oh you would never even imagine that that's the same guy from the honeymooners [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7782.28s)]
*  i know you know yeah because he hardly ever smiles in the entire movie in the hustler i don't know if [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7787.24s)]
*  he ever did nope he's just a no-nonsense killer yeah what was the uh yeah he's one of my favorite [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7791.639999999999s)]
*  actors too the guy that played his steak horse oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i think it was in a [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7797.96s)]
*  second god damn it i know it's on the tip of my tongue jorsey scott that's right my brother be [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7804.12s)]
*  hot at me if i didn't remember that name yeah oh my god he was phenomenal he was great piper lori [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7809.4s)]
*  yeah she was phenomenal the whole movie yeah it's an amazing movie it's it holds up too it's one of [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7814.6s)]
*  those movies it really holds up you go back and watch it and you go man and then the style of [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7819.240000000001s)]
*  film they did back there was more quiet there wasn't music playing in every moment they told [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7824.360000000001s)]
*  you how to think you know the the movie played itself out yeah well the scenes the setting [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7828.4400000000005s)]
*  yeah told you a ton about what was going on you know like in the pool hall names i guess it was [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7834.4400000000005s)]
*  yeah it didn't take a whole lot of words to get the feeling and what you know everyone was about [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7839.32s)]
*  in the movie so yeah which i thought they did pretty well at that and the color money as well [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7846.36s)]
*  yeah you know what i'm saying for the most part yeah for the most part because you could say [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7851.719999999999s)]
*  not many had a lot of lines besides tom right you know mary elizabeth master Antonio i think is [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7855.719999999999s)]
*  who it was and paul neuman everyone else was just bits and pieces so but it did capture the feeling [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7863.72s)]
*  that you get from that i wonder how many people like became pool hustlers after the hustler how [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7869.400000000001s)]
*  many people saw that movie because back then they didn't have very many movies oh no those were two [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7874.4400000000005s)]
*  of the big those were two of the biggest yeah yeah i wonder how many people that probably caused a [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7879.4800000000005s)]
*  resurgence in 63 as well i would i would say so yeah 100 yeah i think it did pretty well overall [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7884.12s)]
*  oh yeah it was a huge movie yeah did it win anything who gives a shit about those things [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7892.2s)]
*  you know like i was saying i think i think the color money is actually paul neuman's first oscar [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7897.16s)]
*  win really yeah he got he got nominated a few times but never actually won it uh at least i [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7902.92s)]
*  checked the hustler first right yeah uh best cinematography best art direction best actress [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7909.4s)]
*  best picture wow best adapted screenplay wow won everything yeah jesus holy shit yeah i wonder [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7917.0s)]
*  who won best actor that year besides paul neuman yeah i think that was the thing about the color [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7923.8s)]
*  money like they had to give it to him because he hadn't won it yet yeah maybe he was good in [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7928.2s)]
*  it though oh he's phenomenal yeah he was really good it's a great movie challenge of tour is one [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7931.8s)]
*  of my favorites too yeah so yeah but i just love movies that you know it's not offensive it like [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7935.8s)]
*  really does capture what it's like in in these places yeah yeah i mean i you know let me correct [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7942.2s)]
*  that it was nominated for most of those i just said oh which ones did it win one art direction [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7949.48s)]
*  cinematography oh damn it let's do a little bit of what we talked about though yeah for the most [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7953.8s)]
*  part exactly yeah art direction cinematography were so important in that movie that that place [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7958.76s)]
*  aims if that doesn't exist someone needs to build it i think it did though it exists i think it did [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7963.96s)]
*  not nine more but probably they filmed in a pool hall they wouldn't set up a new pool hall no i [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7968.92s)]
*  think it did in fact maybe it's in another book or another some something to do with pool i think [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7973.24s)]
*  is and then it's quoted from that movie so what was the name of the original place do you know [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7980.76s)]
*  what was it really called mcgurray's and ames yeah two places that were defunct it says [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7985.24s)]
*  they were defunct before yes and much of the action was filmed at two oh now defunct pool [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7991.88s)]
*  also i guess i don't know whenever they're writing now if it was the time they're writing [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=7997.0s)]
*  it or the time that they're shooting it oh it says mcgurray's and ames billiard academy is where [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8000.2s)]
*  they shot it yeah i think those are real places that's color money or the hustler a hustler yeah [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8004.84s)]
*  interesting yeah now i think now the one that the one that i didn't like in the color money is [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8009.64s)]
*  whenever the the two men and a stranger kind of you remember that didn't that doesn't really [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8015.24s)]
*  you're trying to get someone in real trouble with something like that yeah but uh but a lot [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8021.56s)]
*  of that other stuff though yeah i mean you know kind of like i said earlier with shimat you know [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8026.36s)]
*  i wasn't like not i just kind of wanted to see him play right because i knew it wasn't going to [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8031.799999999999s)]
*  end up for 200 even if we didn't play that was just going to be it you know what i mean but [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8036.36s)]
*  it wasn't going to be any real action for 200 so let me just kind of evaluate him yeah and that [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8040.92s)]
*  you can kind of see that in the color money when he's kind of he's figuring out the right way to [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8045.799999999999s)]
*  do it how paul's teaching them and he's you know handing over small bank rolls but then getting [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8049.639999999999s)]
*  bigger bank rolls in return you know when he wins you know what i mean so so that that kind [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8055.08s)]
*  of stuff happened a lot actually i love the forrest whittaker scene oh yeah forrest can [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8060.5199999999995s)]
*  ask you a question yeah do you think i should lose weight that was a big dig though big dig [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8065.24s)]
*  but another good one forrest whittaker and he actually looked like he had a little stroke [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8073.16s)]
*  yeah yeah a little something yeah yeah he could play a little yeah yeah there's quite a few out [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8076.92s)]
*  there that that like the game well didn't mike seagal coach them oh i wouldn't doubt that i know [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8081.32s)]
*  he coached paul tom cruise yeah yeah there were a few of them around the guy i worked with last [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8086.44s)]
*  night yeah you're right i'm looking at right now oh yeah yeah larry schwartz the guy from chicago [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8092.2s)]
*  you may have heard of him he worked on that and it was in that movie as well worked i did commentary [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8097.0s)]
*  with him last night as a matter of fact well my my big fear is that the game will somehow [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8101.08s)]
*  another slide away it doesn't seem like that's i was worried about that for a while yeah but it [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8106.92s)]
*  doesn't seem like that's happening anymore now there's a international resurgence yeah well the [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpFt3FupdY&t=8111.72s)]
