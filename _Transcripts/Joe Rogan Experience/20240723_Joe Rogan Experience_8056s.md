# JRE MMA Show #160 with Francis Ngannou
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ0eCBdqwvY)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  All right, we're up.
*  What's up, man?
*  Good to see you.
*  You have had a lot of experiences since the last time I saw you.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of things happened.
*  That's why I like, I always about writing my book and chapter keep adding up, adding up, adding up.
*  And yes, every time you feel like you're just maybe in the beginning or in the middle.
*  Yeah, I don't think so.
*  You're definitely only in the middle.
*  Yeah, in the middle.
*  Somewhere, I mean, it's not the beginning, but it's a lot of experiences.
*  So tell me about leading up to the Tyson Fury fight.
*  Oh, the Tyson Fury fight, that was great.
*  You know, I was just there living a dream, you know, get this big moment, get that fight that I've been waiting for four years.
*  The fight that everybody said you were never going to get.
*  Yes.
*  Which is crazy.
*  Like, thank God for the Saudis, because they are making things happen, which is really incredible.
*  They are making things happen.
*  Incredible.
*  It's not like who is this, who is that, you know, it's like, OK, we want it to happen, then make it happen.
*  Yeah, because everybody wanted to see it happen.
*  But it was one of those things where everybody dismissed it.
*  Everybody said that's not going to happen.
*  Tyson Fury is the heavyweight champion.
*  Why would he fight a guy who doesn't have any professional boxing matches?
*  That's crazy.
*  That's not going to happen.
*  And it happened.
*  And then everybody said you didn't stand a chance.
*  And then when you knocked him down the second round, everybody was like, holy shit.
*  And when you were dancing over him when he went down.
*  Yeah.
*  But, you know, I think a lot of people do mistake something, you know.
*  And I always tell people, like, not because you're a fighter that you walk in the bar and there's this guy coming to you,
*  maybe this fat guy coming to you, and then you stand there and because you're a fighter, don't think like he's a threat.
*  Everybody could be a threat.
*  You better take two steps back and then like see your distance and get ready to defend yourself.
*  You know, if everybody hits you, anybody hits you, you're going to get hurt.
*  Right. True.
*  So, yes, I might not have been doing boxing.
*  I'm not a boxer, but still I'm a fighter.
*  And even if I wasn't a fighter, you know, I can hurt and I can harm somebody.
*  You're a big motherfucker.
*  I'm a big guy.
*  So I was watching it and people was like, no, he stand no chance. He has zero chance.
*  I'm like, there is not a fight on earth that zero chance, that element of zero chance doesn't exist.
*  I mean, if you look at it, I'm a man guy and then two men together, someone might have more techniques, might know the sport.
*  But even if I never been in the gym, you still better watch out.
*  I still have a chance.
*  Maybe not as much, maybe not equal chance, but I still do have a chance.
*  But you can't dismiss someone like you and drop your guard and think that you don't have any chance.
*  You shouldn't dismiss anybody.
*  No.
*  We used to be in the, I have seen fight that people show up and then they pretend like, oh, they're going to fight.
*  They have stone in their hand.
*  And if you dismiss them because you think like, oh, he's a small guy, he hits you with the stone in his hand.
*  Right, right, right, right.
*  While by the time you find out that he has stone in the hand, you are in the ground.
*  Right. Exactly.
*  But it was very clear to me that you had some interesting strategies when you went into that fight.
*  First of all, you were fighting a lot of it in Southpaw.
*  Why did you decide to do that?
*  Was that something that you guys had devised before the fight?
*  You thought it would be an interesting strategy?
*  Or is that just like the way you like to box?
*  I like to box like that, but I also thought it was a strategy.
*  That he would be a good strategy as well.
*  Because like basically on the Tyson-Fury fight, I think the Southpaw was a big component in that fight.
*  Because every time that I realized that every time that I switched to Southpaw, he was thinking.
*  But when I switched back to orthodox, he was pressing.
*  So when I want to take a break, I switched to Southpaw a little bit.
*  What was it like to, I mean, obviously you've had many MMA fights.
*  You've been very successful UFC heavyweight champion as an MMA fighter.
*  But what was the difference in the feel of like going into a professional boxing fight with a guy like Tyson-Fury,
*  who is the heavyweight champion in the world and one of the greatest of all time?
*  He's absolutely one of the greatest heavyweight boxers ever.
*  Yeah. But he was completely different.
*  The environment is different. The organization is different.
*  It's different to be stepped in the ring for the first time.
*  OK, you have all these spotlight on you, but you're in the ring.
*  It feels different. Sometimes you're in the cage.
*  You're used to the cage. You lean on that cage. You have that feeling.
*  You grab the cage.
*  Also your shoes off.
*  Yes. And then in the cage, you know that you can do more.
*  You can wrestle. You can do this. And you're comfortable with that.
*  But you're in the ring for the very first time, somewhere that you've never been.
*  It feels different. And then you're thinking like, oh, man, how am I going to do?
*  Am I going to be able to do three rounds? Am I going to be able to do four rounds?
*  I don't know. I'm going to find out just now. There's not a way back.
*  You're going to find out.
*  So by every round, you have to think about like, OK, how am I doing?
*  This is the first round, then second round. OK, so this is the fifth round.
*  I'm not too bad. So I think I'm going to get there.
*  You know, just go like that.
*  So you're concerned about endurance.
*  Yes, you're very concerned about endurance.
*  He was 10 rounds and I didn't know how I'm going to be feeling after the third round.
*  You turned it on the eighth round and the eighth round you hit him with some big shots.
*  That was one of your best rounds.
*  Yeah, the eighth round was pretty good.
*  Then I get a little then I pull my feet off the gas on the ninth round.
*  And then the 10 rounds, I'm like, you know, like, oh, I feel good.
*  This is the last round, right? Feel good.
*  That's when I started to do like those Superman punch or the stuff.
*  For me, he was already a win.
*  He shocked the world, that's for sure.
*  Did you have any mock fights in the gym?
*  Like, did you bring any professional boxers and have like, try to go 8, 10 rounds in the gym?
*  Sparring.
*  Yeah. But like with no head gear, like smaller gloves.
*  Did you do anything like that replicated an actual professional boxing match?
*  No.
*  We just do like a normal sparring, have different sparring partner sometimes to push me.
*  But we didn't do anything like that.
*  You know, as an MMA fighter, we used to spar without gloves, without head gear and stuff.
*  But you get into boxing, everything is so strict, so specific.
*  And then you get to the point that you kind of like ask yourself, like,
*  I'm taking a chance to hurt now and get pulled up of the fight.
*  I'm just going to train.
*  I train the best that I could, that I can.
*  Then I will get there, see, figure out what's happened.
*  And so, but from the time the negotiation started to the time of the fight,
*  how much time did you have to prepare for this?
*  For the negotiation?
*  No. So you had the negotiations and then once it was signed,
*  how much time did you have to prepare for the actual fight itself?
*  Were you preparing already, hoping you were going to have a boxing match?
*  Yeah, but it's different to like think that, oh, I might have a boxing match.
*  I want to have a boxing match.
*  Then when you have a boxing match and knowing who you are going to fight is something different.
*  You know, you prepare the real preparations that now.
*  And between the moment that we signed the fight to the fight itself, it was over three months.
*  Because I know that it wasn't my field, you know, and I didn't have any.
*  And it's not like I was in the gym training, boxing every day.
*  So it was basically four months.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah, I took it in a moment for a pre-camp.
*  I came back here because I was in Cameroon at time.
*  Then I came back here.
*  My team and I, we work on like everything.
*  We had like a pre-camp, you know, just train to get in shape, start like sparring.
*  And then we started the sparring with three rounds.
*  The first sparring was like three rounds.
*  Move around, see.
*  Then we started to go work round after round, you know.
*  What I thought when I saw the fight is imagine if you had just gone into professional boxing
*  like 10 years ago, how well you would do.
*  No MMA, no kicking, no wrestling, just professional boxing.
*  For you to do that well against a guy like Tyson Fury, who's that good.
*  I don't really know.
*  Those are the stuff that I don't usually think about.
*  I think life sometimes just had a path for you.
*  You follow the path that destiny that life has for you.
*  And you just be grateful because regardless of the fact that I didn't start 10 years earlier,
*  I didn't have that opportunity 10 years earlier.
*  Meanwhile, I had to discover MMA and have a great journey in MMA, have a great experience
*  in MMA, you know.
*  So it's something that I will not regret that.
*  I will not beat that up over the opportunity of starting boxing early.
*  It just happened.
*  I took my chance.
*  I do what I can do.
*  It's all about like figure out how far I can go, what I can possibly do.
*  You know, so I'm not 18 years, 20 years old guy that I dream in to have a career into
*  this, but I still want to know what I can possibly do at this point of my life.
*  Yeah.
*  What was the experience like when it was all over?
*  Like, what did it feel like when you just went 10 rounds and a lot of people, including
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, I feel, I feel very great.
*  You know, like regardless of the result for me, knowing what I was going through, what
*  was in my mind, like what's going to happen into this fight, first round, second round,
*  then I get in the 10th round.
*  Good.
*  And I pretty, I feel like I wasn't doing bad.
*  So for me, that was a win.
*  That was a satisfaction, you know.
*  Right.
*  The result was other part of it, which didn't matter most, but I knew already that when
*  if ever you get, because I couldn't guarantee that we will get in the 10th round, but if
*  ever we get there, I wasn't expecting to win.
*  When you dropped him.
*  Definitely not.
*  When you dropped him in the second round, I jumped off the couch.
*  I jumped in the air.
*  I would say something, you know, like I won this from the moment that they accepted the
*  fight, that they signed the fight, because I think I was on the, very underestimate,
*  you know, they didn't know that I could have do something, you know, if they have known
*  that beforehand, maybe this fight wouldn't have never happened because they would have
*  see a risk and they wouldn't want to take that risk.
*  So this was basically like, let's say zero risk.
*  And it probably would have been different too, because there was no footage to prepare
*  for you.
*  Right?
*  Like the only footage that he could prepare was watching you fight in MMA.
*  Yes.
*  He was...
*  There it is.
*  Why are you dancing in front of him?
*  When we started fight, when the referee say, okay, you guys go to your corner.
*  He said, let me take you to school.
*  So that was the dancing was like, I think you own, you're a bad professor.
*  You're a bad teacher.
*  That was the only reason why I did that.
*  He's a funny guy, man.
*  He's funny.
*  He's very entertaining.
*  Yeah.
*  He's so entertaining.
*  He's so entertaining.
*  That's happened to really like being very talented in boxing, good at it, but he's an
*  entertainer.
*  I mean, he's the way he sells it.
*  I mean, even the way he like was playing with his fat, like standing next to you, like rubbing
*  his belly.
*  Like sometimes he will insult you.
*  I don't know if he's insulting you or if he's making fun, but it's just funny that you have
*  to laugh.
*  You really have nothing to say.
*  He kept talking about how big your dick must be.
*  He's a funny dude, man.
*  He's a funny dude.
*  He said that since the first, he started said those things the first time we met and he
*  will put some stuff up sometime that you're like, what?
*  And I really have a hard time understanding what he's saying.
*  Oh, I do.
*  So I struggle a lot.
*  And English is my first language.
*  And I have to translate to tell me what he said.
*  His English is hard to understand.
*  The gypsy king, he's quite a character.
*  Did you hang out with him at all after the fight?
*  No, we didn't hang out.
*  But I think we both respect each other.
*  I think he always, he always, I mean, he was entertaining, but he always show respect.
*  And I know that he respected me even from the beginning.
*  It's not like this was after the fight.
*  Even from the beginning, he could have say everything that he would say to make his show,
*  to make people laugh, you know, but he's very respectful.
*  That's cool.
*  Yeah.
*  Was there any talk after the fight about a rematch?
*  Yes, there is a, there was even a rematch close.
*  How do you call it?
*  First regard of rematch close.
*  There was some sort, something in the contract about the rematch close.
*  Was that if you beat him or if?
*  Was if I get in the eight rounds.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  So the deal of the rematch was if I get in the eight rounds.
*  So why didn't the rematch materialize?
*  I think it's a timing.
*  I think it's a matter of timing.
*  So, so you go from that fight to the Anthony Joshua fight.
*  Yes.
*  What about the preparation and leading up to that fight?
*  In fact, the preparation for the Anthony Joshua fight, then I started, you know, after having
*  like four months of training camp for the Tyson Fury fight, I had this feeling, you
*  know, and then I get a little, I get a little confident now I know how it works, like 10
*  rounds.
*  And then it was pretty good.
*  You know, the Tyson Fury fight, I think I sparred, I sparred like 10 rounds for like
*  two weeks.
*  Yeah, like four, four sparring of 10 rounds barely.
*  But the Tyson, the Anthony Joshua fight, six weeks before the fight, I was, no, I wasn't
*  10.
*  No, the Tyson Fury, yeah, four weeks before the fight, I was already doing like 10 rounds.
*  And I was feeling good, you know, even a little lighter.
*  But things plays out different.
*  And I think, unlike the Tyson Fury fight, that nobody expected me to do anything here,
*  they were expecting me to do something.
*  So things played out a little different.
*  And then we get into five weeks.
*  And then every time that we're going to do something in the five weeks, whether it's
*  media, they're going to pick me up and then I get there, have to wait like one hour and
*  a half before he arrives.
*  And that was like maybe the third day of the week that Dewey, Dewey Cooper, he said, oh,
*  he started to get really mad, upset about it, like, yes, this is how they get, they
*  do to get fired tired.
*  But at the time, I didn't know what was going on, you know.
*  So I'm like, no, come relax, Dewey, it's okay.
*  You know, I didn't know until we get to the fight day.
*  Friday, we receive an email, pick up time.
*  I mean, this one thing I'm among others.
*  Pick up time, 10.30 from the hotel.
*  And then when they say 10.30 by 10.20, there's a car in your door waiting.
*  We go to the supposed five to five time, between midnight to 1 a.m.
*  We get to the arena, 10.45.
*  There's a producer coming to the locker room, say, oh, guy, we are running late on the broadcast.
*  Now we are, we're going to go around 1.45 each.
*  I'm like, okay, 1.45, it's 10.45, three hours.
*  Okay.
*  You know.
*  So what do you do?
*  Do you eat?
*  Do you sleep?
*  What do you do when you know you have three more hours?
*  You know, just stay there and then you have like a drug test guy around waiting for you to pee.
*  How far before the fight do you eat?
*  Usually maybe like four or five hours.
*  Yeah, like maybe five to six hours.
*  And then you get some snacks in between, you know.
*  And then, yeah, it was around 1.30 that he was, until new usual arrived.
*  I saw him, I'm like, so we supposed to fight at 1.45, he's arriving at 1.30.
*  What does that mean?
*  It's going to.
*  So.
*  So they're playing games.
*  Until we fight at 1.00, at 3.30.
*  Oh, wow.
*  I've been in Saudi for almost two months training to fight between midnight and 1.00.
*  That was my training time by 2.00, 3.00.
*  So they wanted to keep you anxious, drag it on psychologically, put it in your head, you
*  don't know when you're going to fight.
*  Pretty much.
*  Yeah.
*  But even at that time, I didn't know what was happening.
*  Right.
*  After everything that I was like, what's going on?
*  Because I get to the point that I was so tired.
*  I was in the locker room, hitting meat, then sit down, feeling asleep.
*  Then I tell Eric, Eric Nixic, like, bro, something wrong.
*  I'm asleep.
*  I feel like I want to sleep.
*  Like I'm sweating.
*  But we just keep doing.
*  So that's fight.
*  I mean, not to say Anthony Joshua couldn't win me.
*  I think if there's somebody that you can lose against him, he is the guy.
*  And he's one of the best of doing it.
*  And this is definitely not on him because he wasn't the guy that was sending all those
*  emails, was organizing.
*  I'm not blaming him about anything, but the organization, bro, they did quite some stuff
*  that wasn't fair.
*  Wish on the Tyson fight was perfect.
*  Everything was perfect because I wasn't a threat.
*  Nobody cares about me.
*  Everything was organized.
*  We get there.
*  In the locker room, I think it was two hours before the fight, probably.
*  So then I'm like, well, Anthony Joshua is a veteran.
*  He's been in the boxing game for a long time.
*  He knows all the different tricks.
*  They also obviously very much prepared for your style.
*  They saw you fight Tyson Fury.
*  So they had tape on you as Tyson Fury did not have boxing tape.
*  He didn't have any footage to study, but Anthony Joshua did.
*  And it was very clear that he knew you had certain tendencies and there were certain
*  things that you did with the Tyson Fury fight that he exploited in his fight.
*  Maybe.
*  And then I think again, I think he's capable to figure out everybody.
*  I think he's capable to win everybody.
*  But in this case, I feel like in some ways, they stand on my way a little bit.
*  They stood in your way.
*  Yeah.
*  So they played some games.
*  Well, they wanted to get the most advantage possible, which is smart.
*  If you were their coach, their manager, that's what I would do too.
*  But he wasn't their coach that was organizing the fight.
*  So you think it's the organization itself that they set everything up in his favor?
*  The organization.
*  Yes, his team was part of organization because it was Greensbury and Mushroom.
*  Those emails was coming from there.
*  So those are the people that told you to get there three hours earlier than you needed to be?
*  Yeah.
*  Those are the people that were sending the schedule, the five week schedule.
*  And every day we send everything like pick up time, the program and the schedule.
*  Have you had a chance to go back and watch the Anthony Joshua fight?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I didn't.
*  Yes, I watched it.
*  What was your question?
*  What do you remember about the fight?
*  What was different watching it?
*  Oh, even like feeling it.
*  It wasn't even before I went to watch it.
*  I get in the ring.
*  Was wasn't was, you know, wasn't feeling myself.
*  And the first round when he knocked me down, like I fell and I was like, did I slip?
*  Like, what exactly knocked me down, made me fall like this punch?
*  Because I felt the punch, but it wasn't the punch that would knock me down, you know?
*  So that's when I really get confused at that time.
*  I'm like, damn, what?
*  But this is the thing.
*  From that moment, I can knock down with a punch that wasn't that hard because...
*  You don't think it was that hard?
*  No, he hit my hand before he hit my face.
*  And I felt it.
*  I felt the punch, but I wasn't on the floor.
*  The first one.
*  And then I get counted, then stood up.
*  We finished the round.
*  I went on my corner.
*  But by the time I went on my corner, I never came back from that.
*  I keep going.
*  And I remember being in my corner and Dewi was like, don't go on Southpaw.
*  He's waiting you on Southpaw.
*  Do this champ, do this champ.
*  That was it.
*  That's from there.
*  I don't remember when I left the stool to get in the second round.
*  Well, that was probably from the big punch in the second round too, right?
*  Yeah, but I'm talking about the first round.
*  Right.
*  But the memory afterwards is always going to be cloudy after a knockout, especially
*  a bad knockout like that.
*  Yeah.
*  But I remember, I remember exactly what's happened until we get to the store.
*  I remember being there, like start having blurry vision.
*  Like the guy was in front of me.
*  The, my team was in front of me speaking to me and then the voice was getting
*  distance.
*  So you think there was something wrong?
*  I don't know if it was the fatigue.
*  I don't know what was it, but something wasn't right.
*  So something wasn't right on, forget about the punches he landed.
*  Something else was wrong.
*  Is that what you're saying?
*  Yeah.
*  Something was wrong.
*  Do you think it's something you ate?
*  Do you think it was something that someone gave you?
*  I have no proof.
*  I don't know if maybe-
*  Did you get tested after the fight?
*  Maybe it's the fact that I can, I get there at that time.
*  So just the fatigue and the anxiety.
*  I don't know if it's the fatigue.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, but something wrong.
*  I, I wanted to get, first of all, like when all those things happen, you are in
*  the moment, you don't think like you don't get out of the fight and think about
*  like, go get tested, you know?
*  You process things and then see to understand, to see how he was wrong.
*  But by the time they say, I think I need, we have to do like within 12 hours to do
*  like blood or urine, 12 and 14 and 24 hours.
*  That was it.
*  So I didn't do that.
*  I, I can't say it was that.
*  I don't know, but-
*  But it felt like something was wrong.
*  I wasn't, it wasn't me.
*  Yeah.
*  So did it feel like something was wrong, like just plain fatigue or did it feel
*  like something was wrong?
*  Like maybe you were poisoned or maybe drugged.
*  Plain fatigue.
*  Fatigue.
*  Yeah.
*  So just fatigue.
*  Yeah.
*  And so-
*  The fatigue aspect.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, this is also an aspect of experience, right?
*  Because this is only your second professional boxing fight.
*  And you know, there's things that people do.
*  Like they, they do very intelligent things to like, Gervonta Davis, when he fought Ryan
*  Garcia, he made him rehydrate.
*  He made him dehydrate, get down to a low weight.
*  And then he, there was a clause in the contract where he couldn't gain more than
*  10 pounds before the fight itself.
*  So he went into the fight dehydrated.
*  Smart for a guy like Gervonta, who's a huge puncher, you know?
*  So there's things that like experienced professionals that have been in the game
*  a long time will get a fighter to agree to that's not in their best interest.
*  And then there's things that they can do to you, like make you wait all day.
*  And make you wait around, which will fatigue you.
*  Yeah.
*  But there wasn't a thing or something in the contract that was forcing me to do
*  something, the only thing was like to show up on time.
*  Right.
*  So that's, that was everything.
*  Because like before all that, the week before sparring, everything feels good.
*  I spar way more better, way more stronger than what I did on the Fury fight.
*  Even my sparring partner was different at that time.
*  You know, on the Fury fight, we were getting some somebody in maybe after the
*  six or eight rounds just to weigh me down.
*  But the quality of a boxing wasn't that impressive, right?
*  Here, it was different.
*  And I was able to hold.
*  I know that if I had to fall, he would take a little more to get me down.
*  Hmm.
*  Well, Anthony Joshua was a big puncher.
*  He's a big puncher and he punched, he's fast.
*  He's fast and he's a one punch knockout puncher as opposed to Tyson Fury can
*  knock guys out with one punch, but really he wears guys out.
*  He beats guys up and then takes them out later.
*  Like the Deontay Wilder fight, like he beats him up and then he takes him out.
*  You know, whereas Joshua can take people out with one shot.
*  He's a, he's a much bigger, physically much more powerful guy.
*  No, I agree with that.
*  And I, I knew that.
*  I knew that.
*  What would you do differently if you could do the Anthony Joshua fight again?
*  That's the problem.
*  We did everything right.
*  Like.
*  Everything right in preparation.
*  In preparation.
*  We did everything right.
*  You know, sometime, you know, like when for, uh, for example, I, um, I
*  fought Stipe, I went back and I could have least a, I couldn't make a whole
*  list of what I did wrong, what I could have done better.
*  And that's why, like even after that fight, my next fight again, directly
*  with was so bad because I was still working on the list of what I have done.
*  Done wrong, but here we were very disciplined.
*  We did everything and everybody was professional.
*  You can say, uh, this person did this wrong.
*  This should have been like this.
*  This should have been like that.
*  It's so different too, because you're going from no professional boxing
*  fights to two of the very, very best, not just in the world, but the two
*  of the very best ever.
*  Anthony Joshua, Olympic gold medalist, elite fighter, incredible athlete.
*  I mean, he's so good.
*  So did you think like at all about having fights with maybe some guys that
*  were below that level to get more experience, like after the Tyson
*  Fury fight, maybe fighting a guy who's like ranked 15th or 16th, you know.
*  I never thought about that.
*  You know, it just went for the money.
*  And the money and the big fight, the big fight is obviously,
*  yes, one, the big fight.
*  So like, uh, for example, um, after the Tyson Fury fight, if I go for another
*  guy, uh, top 15, like what's, what's the goal here?
*  I mean, again, I'm not 20 years old.
*  I'm not 25 that I have a plan to grow up the ranking and get to the championship.
*  I want
*  just get that money.
*  Yeah.
*  Get the money.
*  The big fight out of the big fight.
*  You.
*  So that was, that was the goal.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you achieved that goal because like, first of all, going to the Tyson
*  Fury fight, you didn't know if there was a plan after that, if there was
*  another fight after that, and then after the Tyson Fury fight, the next fight
*  that you have a call for was a Anthony Joshua fight.
*  Were you trying to get a different fight after the Tyson Fury fight?
*  Like after the Tyson Fury fight, were you trying to get a rematch or were you
*  just willing to take whatever they are offering you?
*  The rematch was there.
*  We know we had the rematch, but he was going to fight Yusick first thing that's
*  supposed to happen in December and he couldn't.
*  Right.
*  He got cut.
*  Yeah.
*  He couldn't, he couldn't fight in December.
*  So I wasn't really on something.
*  I was just there and then I get the offer of Anthony Joshua.
*  Then I'm like, let's go.
*  So where do you stand now?
*  What do you, what are you planning on doing now?
*  What do I plan on doing now?
*  I think I still have a couple in me.
*  Boxing fights.
*  Yeah.
*  Couple boxing fight.
*  Yeah.
*  Basically boxing fight.
*  I have couple MMA fight and I think, I haven't think like, I'm going to
*  fight MMA fight by the end of the year with PFR.
*  I'm going to fight, might have to fight in Saudi.
*  Again.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, one of the things that has been discussed that, apparently the UFC might
*  be open to because the Saudis throw around so much money is the potential of a,
*  a joint promotion, a cross promotion with you versus John Jones.
*  Make it happen.
*  That is what the world wants to see.
*  Because when you have a guy like yourself that, you know, knocks out
*  Steve Bay becomes the undisputed UFC heavyweight champion.
*  And then through negotiation only decides to relinquish the belt.
*  Everybody, even though John Jones is the champion now, everybody's like, yeah,
*  but you didn't win the title against the champion and you were the most compelling
*  fight in the heavyweight division for sure for John Jones.
*  Well, that's what I wish.
*  But, you know, in these days, this, this takes a lot more than what I want or
*  what I wish to happen.
*  There's a lot going on.
*  Yeah, there's a lot going on.
*  So tell me what, what is the status of your deal with the PFL now?
*  So how does that work?
*  It's working pretty good.
*  We have a good relationship.
*  I have some fight.
*  Again, I will be fighting by the end of the year.
*  And then,
*  do you know who you're fighting?
*  I think a rain and federal is the guy.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the guy that knocked out Ryan Bader.
*  Yeah.
*  He's dangerous.
*  That guy's he's legit.
*  I've been telling people about this guy for what?
*  Almost two years.
*  He's a big dude.
*  Yeah.
*  But very athletic, very athletic, fast, fast hand, one, two knee stuff,
*  like very athletic.
*  Yeah.
*  So I think it's, it's, it's, it's, it's going to be him.
*  And you think that fight will be in Saudi Arabia as well?
*  Yeah.
*  That's what the PFA is working on.
*  Interesting.
*  Do you know when that'll take place?
*  October, October.
*  Yeah.
*  They're working on October.
*  It's not finalized yet, but there was talking about October 19.
*  Isn't that around the same time the UFC has that big Abu Dhabi card?
*  Don't they have a big, can you go to the UFC's website and see what
*  their Abu Dhabi card is?
*  I believe I want to say some somewhere around the end of October.
*  There's a big UFC card in Abu Dhabi.
*  25th, October 25th.
*  So October 25th.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So why don't we have to.
*  Yeah.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if the UFC has that card finalized.
*  Do they have that card finalized?
*  They always put on a big fight when they go to Abu Dhabi.
*  Abu Dhabi is always a big card.
*  A lot of like top level fighters on that card.
*  Hmm.
*  Yeah.
*  Even this, this, this Riyadh one going to be a big card.
*  No, I'm sure.
*  If we make it happen, we're going to stack, they're going to stack that card.
*  Do you know who else would be on that card with you?
*  Um, I don't, again, it's not finalized yet, but I think, uh,
*  Cedric Dumbay will be on that.
*  Dumbay.
*  I love that dude.
*  Yeah.
*  I've had him on the podcast before.
*  He's an entertainer too.
*  He's a comedian.
*  He's a comedian.
*  He's crazy.
*  He's fine.
*  He's very funny, but goddamn he can fight.
*  Oh no, he can fight.
*  How crazy was that fight?
*  He can back up what, whatever he said.
*  Yeah.
*  He's an elite kickboxer, elite kickboxer.
*  He trained at my gym in LA when I had my gym in LA, uh, my gym in LA, his
*  trainer came when he did my podcast and he had a workout session and man, his
*  workout sessions are crazy.
*  He's so cardio intensive.
*  They're doing like sprints on the treadmill and they run to the heavy bag
*  sprints on the heavy bag, run back to the treadmill.
*  I was like, damn, like watching that.
*  I was like, no wonder why this guy has a crazy gas tank.
*  Well, he was a champion for glory for a long time.
*  So, and that wasn't a mistake.
*  He was knocking everybody out, not just knocking everybody out, but the way he
*  did it, like he melted guys, he put pressure on them and knockout power, but
*  intelligence and just great technique.
*  But the cardio was crazy.
*  And I remember thinking like, this dude doesn't get tired.
*  And then watching him train.
*  I'm like, oh, well there it is.
*  I mean, he's not just doing like normal mitt work.
*  Like I've seen other guys work out with a do mitt work to do their things.
*  Like his stuff is cardio intensive, man.
*  He has, he wants to have a full gas tank when he gets in there.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, he knows what he's looking for.
*  How crazy was that fight where they called the fight because he stepped on a
*  piece of glass inside the cage.
*  I don't know, man.
*  I don't, and I don't even know what that referee was doing.
*  All they had to do was pull it out of his toe.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, he's like, yeah.
*  Something I said, something in my toe and the referee was like, fights off.
*  Yeah.
*  I think you stop the fight and you even check the canvas.
*  If there's no more piece of glass on the canvas.
*  That should be overturned.
*  Dangerous.
*  That should, it is dangerous, but that should be a no contest.
*  There's no way that should count as a loss.
*  That was a no contest fight.
*  No contest at all.
*  No chance.
*  How the fuck does another guy get away?
*  He's not complaining about like a eye poke or something that didn't happen.
*  Nothing.
*  Piece of a glass.
*  A piece of, and he's pointing to it.
*  So, and he's saying, just let me get it out of my toe.
*  Yeah.
*  Let me get this out of my toe.
*  It shouldn't be there.
*  And you know, things happen.
*  Who knows how it even got in there?
*  Who knows what happened?
*  The odds, just some random freak accident.
*  He steps on something that nobody, you know what?
*  It could have been stuck to someone's shoe and someone's walking around the
*  cage with that stuck in their shoe and it falls out of their shoe and it sticks in
*  his toe, he stands on it, he gets it in his toe and he just points down.
*  They say, stop the fight.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's like, I lost.
*  He pointed down twice, like first and the referee.
*  See if you can find that Jamie.
*  See the second time I was reading someone's explanation of what Mark Goddard
*  did and they said he did what you're supposed to do.
*  Like a fighter can't ask for a timeout.
*  And so like, no, no, that's wrong.
*  There's a foreign object.
*  Yeah.
*  A foreign object.
*  That falls under to the timidity sections of the referee's guidelines.
*  No, no.
*  Timidity?
*  Continue fight.
*  This is just someone's explanation.
*  Do they say timidity?
*  That's what this is.
*  Oh, that's ridiculous.
*  No, no, no.
*  That's ridiculous.
*  See if you can find the footage though.
*  Cause the footage is, it's so obvious or something wrong.
*  The referee should just say time, ask what he's saying.
*  What, what?
*  It wasn't like he was in trouble and he was looking for a timeout.
*  Yeah.
*  It was just in the middle of the fight.
*  In the 50-50 position.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Break the fight.
*  Break the fight.
*  Nobody is losing position.
*  Exactly.
*  So here it is.
*  He's standing there.
*  Yeah.
*  It's not like nobody is losing.
*  Nobody is losing position from that.
*  It's not like you take a punch.
*  I want to recover from that.
*  Fucking crazy.
*  Yes.
*  No.
*  I just don't understand that at all.
*  I mean, I haven't talked to Mark about it.
*  That wasn't a good decision.
*  I don't understand.
*  I mean, maybe he's hindered by the rules.
*  Maybe that's just what the rules state you have to do.
*  When a fighter says you have to stop something for a second.
*  I don't know what the rules are in terms of that.
*  I've never seen that happen before.
*  I've never seen someone step on something inside the octagon and then point down to their foot.
*  I've never seen it.
*  So I don't.
*  But man, what a shame.
*  But he came after that and he won.
*  He won his next fight.
*  He's got to fuck up a lot of people, man.
*  I was bummed out that he went to the PFL.
*  I wanted that guy in the UFC.
*  He can fuck up a lot of people.
*  And you know, he's got a lot of years on the clock too.
*  He said he wanted to go to the UFC and then they give him some sort of contract.
*  And then I'm like, no, bro.
*  They gave him a bad contract?
*  Yeah.
*  That's unfortunate.
*  He said that on the on the tweet, right?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  That doesn't make any sense.
*  Well, that's crazy.
*  That guy could be a superstar.
*  He could be a superstar.
*  He's a superstar.
*  Yeah.
*  He's a superstar.
*  The guy filled up the best arena in Paris.
*  Yes.
*  In France, he's a superstar.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, and that could translate 100% to the United States and to the rest of the world.
*  I mean, he's that good.
*  He's that good.
*  Yeah.
*  He's he's one of the best in the world.
*  And the fact that he's over there, just like, well, great for the PFL, great for the PFL,
*  you know, but for the UFC, like that's a big loss.
*  Like anytime you can get an elite kickboxer and he did a lot of training.
*  He did a lot of training in wrestling, went to AKA, trained there.
*  He's he's really worked on his takedown defense and he wants something.
*  Yeah, he definitely wants something and he's working on it.
*  And the guy has serious discipline and work ethic.
*  And he's just smart, man.
*  And the way he fights, he's just like he sets guys.
*  He talks so much shit before the fight, too.
*  He's fun.
*  Did you watch his first fight at the PFL?
*  Yeah.
*  The guy bring he brought a mattress.
*  What the fuck is this?
*  So Jordan go to sleep and he put the guy to sleep.
*  Yeah.
*  In a few seconds.
*  Well, the difference between his level of striking and most guys in that division level
*  of striking is like this.
*  Yeah, there's a huge gap, a giant gap.
*  The other people, the other guy was just trying to compensate with the wrestling or Jiu-Jitsu
*  or something.
*  Exactly.
*  Or and even if you don't have a better wrestling than him, at least you grab him.
*  You avoid some punch.
*  Yes.
*  And the thing about him is that every fight starts standing up.
*  So one thing, if you're a really good wrestler, you have to take the guy to the
*  ground, but the fight starts standing.
*  You know, with Cedric, the fight starts in his best place.
*  And then you see how he was fighting his second fight.
*  He was very low.
*  He went very low.
*  Like, okay, you're a wrestler.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's see how you're going to get that level change.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm already down here.
*  So getting very, he's very intelligent, very intelligent.
*  And again, his level of striking.
*  And we see that with like guys like Alex Pereira, right?
*  Like that level of striking when you're a glory champion, the level of striking is so
*  high.
*  It's so above the average MMA fighter.
*  Then when he gets in there with these guys, they don't, they don't want none of that.
*  And then as soon as they started to get like a little wrestling defense and stuff
*  like that, they become a trouble.
*  You can't take him down anymore.
*  Exactly.
*  And then you, you stand in front of him, he smoke you.
*  So what could you do?
*  Well, you see that with Alex Pereira now.
*  His takedown defense is much better and he keeps getting better.
*  He's evolving so quickly.
*  Like that because he's been training.
*  Yeah.
*  He's been training for so long.
*  He's been training for so long.
*  And then he's also training with Glover, you know, Glover Tichara, also former champion.
*  I mean, Glover was a guy that was locked out of America for six years.
*  He couldn't come to America for six years because he had visa issues and he was like
*  the boogeyman.
*  We would all hear about him in Brazil and everybody would talk.
*  Yeah.
*  Glover was like one of those guys before he entered into the UFC that I think he wasted
*  his prime, unfortunately, in Brazil.
*  Not I'll say wasted his prime, but I think his prime years were outside of the United
*  States.
*  That's why when he won the title, he was like 42.
*  43.
*  43.
*  What exactly is a prime years for a guy that won a title of 44, 43.
*  I think you get to the point to get you to think that maybe 43 is the prime years.
*  He won the title that year, right?
*  Yeah.
*  You watched that.
*  I'm like 43.
*  He's not that old.
*  You know, I think at 43, you can still do something.
*  Yeah.
*  It depends on the division, right?
*  Like George Foreman won the heavyweight title at 45.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Heavyweight is more, yeah, it's different because they don't push on that gas, you
*  know, throw some punch and move.
*  How old is Cedric?
*  Cedric Ndombé?
*  Yeah.
*  Find out how old he is.
*  I want to say he's young.
*  Yeah, he's young.
*  He's young.
*  He might be 30.
*  How old is he?
*  31.
*  That's a good age.
*  31.
*  Yeah.
*  And with that level of kickboxing, woo, and power, man, you know, like not just
*  like technique, but power and endurance.
*  Like it's a rare combination he has of very, very good endurance and extreme power.
*  Yeah.
*  He hit like a deaf guy.
*  He's a fucking killer.
*  I'm excited to see what happens.
*  Do you understand the PFL's point system?
*  Do you understand that system?
*  What do you mean?
*  You know how they have points?
*  Like if you get a knockout in the first round, you get one point or three points.
*  Or what the fuck are they doing?
*  Why are they doing that?
*  That's for the regular season.
*  I think it's just to push, push people for a better fight.
*  Everybody knows that you get a knockout.
*  You get, you deserve something better.
*  You get a finish, you get something.
*  Right.
*  But you can't always get a finish.
*  But what if you're fighting a guy that's like your level, like you're both elite and you're
*  both fighting in like this incredible fight.
*  You shouldn't be penalized because you can't take out a fighter who's the best in the
*  world in the first round.
*  That seems crazy to me.
*  Yeah.
*  But either way, if you win a fight, you're winning something.
*  Yeah.
*  You just win more.
*  It's like having a win bonus or something.
*  I don't like win bonuses either.
*  I hate win bonuses.
*  Yeah, me too.
*  I don't like it.
*  I don't like it.
*  I like boxing set up better where you have a contractual, you have a contract.
*  You're going to get paid $10 million, whatever it is.
*  That's what you get.
*  You don't get $10 million, but you only get $5 million if a shitty judge gives it to the
*  other guy, which we've seen so many times in the UFC.
*  Guys lose half their paycheck because of a bad decision.
*  Yeah.
*  But what does that benefit?
*  Well, who does it benefit?
*  I don't know who it benefits.
*  I don't think it benefits anybody.
*  I think it's bad for everybody.
*  I think it's bad for the audience because they're like, what?
*  Cause it makes them angry.
*  It's bad for the fighter for sure.
*  If a fighter loses their paycheck, loses half their paycheck because of a bad decision.
*  How about the promotion?
*  I don't even think it's good for the promotion.
*  I think it's unfair.
*  I don't think it makes any sense.
*  No guys trying at the elite level.
*  Everyone's trying to win.
*  They're all trying to win.
*  Yeah.
*  No one's not trying to win.
*  Absolutely.
*  No one's going to just coast.
*  For the most part, you get there by winning.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  The whole thing is the glory of victory.
*  So what you're trying to do, you're not going to fight less hard.
*  I just don't understand the logic behind it.
*  I think it's a flawed concept.
*  And I think it's something that never existed in combat sports before MMA and really shouldn't exist.
*  I think fighters fight their best, especially at the elite level.
*  They fight their best.
*  Yeah.
*  I agree with you because like when you lose a fight, at least you should get your full pay on that fight.
*  Yes.
*  But that won't, the loss won't help you with the advantage on the next fight.
*  Right.
*  You know, on next negotiation.
*  I'm like, oh, you lose two fights in a row.
*  Right.
*  So you don't have a power position anymore.
*  Exactly.
*  Like just to pick half of your purse because you lose a fight.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy.
*  I don't like it at all.
*  No.
*  I don't like it at all.
*  I just, it doesn't make sense to me.
*  I've heard people try to argue it and every time they try to make an argument for it, I'm like, I don't get it.
*  It's not fair for the fighters.
*  Fighters only have, if they're really lucky.
*  Like what's the most fights that an elite fighter in the UFC has?
*  Like 50, 45, 50 fights.
*  You know, maybe.
*  50 fights.
*  Maybe.
*  There's a few guys that have like that level of fights.
*  Most guys, they top off way less than that.
*  Oh, way, way less.
*  Yeah, way less.
*  So the idea that like.
*  By the time you start your career, if you already, you have like an injury.
*  Yeah.
*  Good luck.
*  Right.
*  Good luck to reach 25.
*  Especially ACL surgery out for a year.
*  Shoulder surgery.
*  You're out for a year.
*  Broken hand.
*  You're out for five months.
*  It might never be the same.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, and most people it's not like there's an age to start like, oh, you start at 20 or 25.
*  Right.
*  Some people will get there at 30, over 30.
*  I mean.
*  Well, how old are you?
*  You started training so late.
*  Like how old were you when you started training?
*  At 27.
*  Yeah.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  It was 27.
*  Yeah.
*  But he was my only, that was only when I could have trained.
*  Right.
*  You know.
*  Yeah.
*  So.
*  You only have a certain amount of years.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But just want to do the best out of those years.
*  Of course.
*  But for you to be fighting on a system that penalizes you if there's a bad judge and you
*  miss half your paycheck, does the PFL do win bonuses too?
*  Do they do the same thing?
*  Uh, I don't know exactly.
*  You don't know.
*  You're you're Scott.
*  Your contract is probably different than everybody else's.
*  Yes.
*  And I haven't.
*  Yeah.
*  My contract is different.
*  I know I either way, I wouldn't go for that.
*  Uh, win bonus stuff.
*  I have nothing against bonus, but don't split my, my, uh, my paycheck into talking
*  about like winning bonus.
*  No, give me my paycheck.
*  If you want to, uh, give a bonus for the win, let's do another deal on that one.
*  Yeah, that makes sense.
*  Yeah, that makes sense.
*  I just, I think.
*  Whether I lose or I don't lose or I win, I train, I get prepared for the fight.
*  I come, I give it, I give everything for that fight.
*  I should get paid.
*  Yes.
*  And the same thing that I give in that fight to lose could have get me to win.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I agree.
*  I agree.
*  And so now the PFL and Bellator are one organization now, right?
*  The PFL acquired Bellator.
*  Is that what's going on?
*  Yes.
*  Do the Saudis have something to do with that as well?
*  Don't they own part of it?
*  They invest in the PFL.
*  Yes.
*  In the main PFL because there's a main PFL, a house PFL that has like
*  the PFL and the Bellator now.
*  And then now they are having like a P original PFL, like a PFL, PFL
*  Amina that launched this year and then PFL Africa that's launching next year.
*  And that's your shirt.
*  Yeah.
*  And so you're a part of that as well, right?
*  Oh yeah.
*  That's, that was the biggest, I think that was the biggest reason for me in that contract.
*  The PFL Africa part was the most important one in that contract.
*  You know, like, um, before that I was trying to like, even to the UFC, I have
*  requested to be like, Oh, I want to be the UFC ambassador in Africa.
*  I want to do something out there.
*  I'm like, Oh no, we don't know.
*  You know, this is not, we don't.
*  And then I get a PFL.
*  They say, okay, we're doing this.
*  We'll do that.
*  They show me the roadmap.
*  Like, okay, we launched PFL Africa, 2025 you are the PFL Africa chairman.
*  Um, like which extent, because I don't want that bullshit of paper
*  chairman or whatever it is.
*  Like I wish it's then like, what exactly are you seeing in PFL Africa?
*  And then they put it out and give, show me some element.
*  I'm like, good.
*  Then I'm on board.
*  Well, that is one good thing about going over to the PFL because you, you
*  have so much value to them.
*  Like for you coming over, you were the undisputed heavyweight champion of the UFC.
*  You come over to the PFL, everybody knows who you are.
*  Now it elevates the PFL.
*  So it's nice because it'll allow you to do more things.
*  And, uh, to be honest, one thing I have a healthy relationship, you know, it's,
*  it's peaceful get to the point of my life that I really get tired or sick of drama.
*  Sometimes I just get into something into some, find myself in the
*  middle of some drama and then I just walk away.
*  Whatever you want to say, you say something, you might say, I disrespect you.
*  You say, Oh, I did that, bro.
*  I don't have so much energy to give into that.
*  So that was part of what was going on with the UFC.
*  There was a lot of drama.
*  That's yeah.
*  That's, and that's what would take a lot out of you.
*  You get to the point that you're like, I want, I just want this to be over.
*  Right.
*  I just want to get to be over, get back to my life, but you are already in the middle.
*  Whether you want to go back, you have to deal with drama.
*  If you have to go forward, you have to deal with drama.
*  So you better keep going forward.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially, I mean, like how much time do you have left?
*  Right.
*  I mean, how many more years you think you're going to be fighting?
*  Yeah.
*  And does matter.
*  I mean, uh, soon 38 and I think I'm going to be, I really want to retire in my, um,
*  as they say, I want to leave the sport before the sport leaves me.
*  Hmm.
*  Smart.
*  Yeah.
*  So I'm thinking in my average, like 41.
*  So three more years.
*  Yeah.
*  41 by that.
*  Do you have a thought of how many more boxing fights versus how many more MMA
*  fights you want to do?
*  Hmm.
*  Not exactly.
*  I think I would take it how, how it comes.
*  Hmm.
*  I'll take it how it comes.
*  And so the next fight will be MMA definitely or maybe maybe in a, in a
*  boxing fight.
*  Maybe in a, maybe in my forties, uh, I still feel like I have it, you know?
*  Right.
*  If I feel like at 41, I feel like I have it.
*  Well, you keep going to waste.
*  Well, I keep, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Keep going to waste.
*  Well, yeah, exactly.
*  Keep regenerating and then take one at, at, at the time, you know?
*  But, uh, what I, what I really don't want to do is to like wake up and go to the
*  gym, like I'm forced, you know?
*  Right.
*  If I feel like I have it or I'm excited, oh, today's a sparring day.
*  I'm going to get there.
*  Whether I'm going to beat somebody up or they're going to beat me up either way.
*  I'm excited.
*  Right.
*  You know, if I still have that, I keep going.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  As soon as I don't have that, even if I'm not 40 yet, I think is a sign is a call out.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's intelligent.
*  That's smart.
*  That's the way you phrased it.
*  I liked the way you phrased it.
*  Leave the sport before the sport leaves you.
*  Yeah.
*  That's.
*  Cause we've all seen guys who hung around to, I was, I was still always do the sport.
*  I will never really leave the sport, but the competition at that level, you know, you
*  need to be ready.
*  You need to be into it.
*  You need to want to be there.
*  You don't just want to do it because okay, I have to know you don't go play with
*  punches because you have to know.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  You better want to be enthusiastic.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So do you know for sure that you'll be fighting MMA next, or is it possible that a big
*  boxing match could present itself and you would do that next?
*  I will say MMA next.
*  Definitely.
*  Yeah.
*  I will say MMA next because I supposed to fight, it's been over a year, little over
*  a year now since the PFA agreement and then supposed to have a fight in a year.
*  So now we are getting a little out of the timeline.
*  For sure.
*  And by the time we were figuring out who should be my opponent, and I think things
*  are very clear now, Rain and Federer made his serve very clear that he's a
*  challenger that should make the fight.
*  He's the opponent that can make that fight happen.
*  And let's assume you get past that.
*  Will you then decide whether or not you're going to fight MMA next or boxing next?
*  No.
*  Because one of the things about the PFL is there's not a lot of challenges, not a
*  lot of very compelling challenges for you there, unfortunately, at least now.
*  They could sign some more top flight heavyweights.
*  I mean, who knows what happens with many people?
*  Who knows what happens with John Jones?
*  I mean, I don't know what happens with any of these guys.
*  I mean, he could wind up going to the PFL.
*  Who fucking knows?
*  He could.
*  If they come up with some big money, you know, you could get a lot of people that
*  will be willing to go over there.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, like after, I think after this fight, I'll see what's happened.
*  I don't really have a clear mind on what will happen, but I will say most likely
*  boxing.
*  Most likely boxing after that?
*  Yeah, most likely boxing.
*  Do you have an opponent in mind?
*  No.
*  No?
*  Absolutely not.
*  We will see the landscape and what I can get.
*  Who I can get.
*  Because my, my expectation, as you were asking me earlier, like how many fighters
*  do I think I can do in MMA or boxing?
*  I think if I get to, if I get to like a good full fight plan in boxing, I think
*  that could be good, you know.
*  You get like a good full fight and then you build like, no, who and who, who and
*  who should be next.
*  That could be my, my potential retirement plan.
*  Well, it sounds like you already made a good amount of money.
*  Like.
*  Yeah, I have made a good amount of money, but you also have to remember that I
*  started this sport for passion.
*  You know, you don't start the sport for the money because at first there is no
*  money, at first it's just punch flying over your head all over and you have to
*  touch and then fight and not get paid, fight for free for quite some time.
*  You know, so I love the sport.
*  I still love the sport.
*  I love the sport of, I love combat sport.
*  I love fighting.
*  I feel like I cannot do it anymore.
*  Is boxing more unique to you because it's a new challenge?
*  Boxing is different to me because it's even my, my boat, my, my, um, even the
*  master's memory are not the same.
*  The functionality of my body is not the same, you know, unlike MMA that I know
*  every single moment of my life, I know every single moment of my life, I know
*  that I know every single action in MMA, every single moment I've been there tens
*  of times, I know I get this, but boxing, you're still like, okay, you know, you
*  might get even in some position and get stressed because you never been there.
*  You don't know, you have to figure out.
*  Right.
*  You know, instead of it being instinctive.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you, until you get there two, three, two, three times, then you
*  I'm like, ah, it's okay.
*  I can deal with it.
*  You know, uh, MMA, I go, I go, uh, MMA fight with a knee injury.
*  I'm still like, I get this, but boxing little different.
*  You, you basically know that question in yourself about if you can handle this.
*  Right.
*  Like I get this.
*  Right, right, right.
*  It's different.
*  There's a lot of thinking because it's a new thing for you.
*  When you train for boxing, I know you have a Dewey Cooper, you have Eric
*  Nixik, like, did you bring other people in to help train you in boxing?
*  Yeah.
*  I brought a John Bumba from France.
*  Uh, he assists, uh, Dewey sometime because he's, he's very like, um, he has
*  a very good amateur style, which I think is something that I still need to build
*  in my game and, uh, yeah, other than that, I have a trip, which is my
*  strength and conditioning coach.
*  So I put those elements down.
*  Did you get a chance to spar any top heavyweights in America?
*  Top heavyweight like who?
*  Um, I would say Carlos Thakam, um, Guido is at top right now.
*  He's my, um, he's my other sparring partner.
*  But in America, uh, not other top, uh, I get Jeremiah Milton as well.
*  Um, but no other big name in America.
*  Which is even more impressive, your performance against Tyson Fury, when
*  you consider like, you really didn't even spar elite heavyweights.
*  Listen, I think sometime we, um, we don't give credit to some people
*  because they don't just have a name because they are not, they haven't
*  have his get, have a stage to play on.
*  Right.
*  You know, and we think like, oh, it's nobody, or it's not an elite.
*  Let me take you some example before Andy Ruiz fought Anthony Joshua.
*  Would you think about him as an elite fighter?
*  No, a lot of people has no idea, but he was still there and he was just
*  good at, as he is right now, but because he didn't have the scene to be seen,
*  to be exposed, so nobody cared about him.
*  And he should say, Oh, I spar with Andy Ruiz.
*  I'm like, yes, but you haven't spar with the elite.
*  You see, and there's a lot of people like that out there.
*  Right.
*  A lot of people that haven't got their shot yet, but they haven't got their
*  shot, but they are there, they are present.
*  They are elite.
*  Right.
*  They are present.
*  They are elite.
*  Well, when you first made your way and you know, when you told that story on
*  the podcast of your journey, leaving Cameroon and making your way and getting
*  turned back so many times, when you first arrived and you finally got to France,
*  you wanted to be a boxer.
*  No, even before I left, I wanted to be a boxer.
*  Even decades before I left, I wanted to be a boxer.
*  That wasn't even a question.
*  I always knew what I wanted.
*  So when it finally went full circle and you became a boxer again, did it feel
*  like, Oh, this is how it was supposed to be?
*  I was living my dream.
*  There is no way that I don't think there's a way that things supposed to be.
*  You get what you get and then you, you, you, you be grateful and then you
*  make the best out of it.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, so I was living the dream.
*  You know, I ended up having the fight, having to fight, uh, to best, to best
*  boxer in the world after having a great MMA career, not bad for me, guy coming
*  from where I came from.
*  No, it's amazing.
*  Basically from having the path that I had, you know, and who knows some good
*  thing might still happen.
*  Oh, some good things.
*  I'm sure will still happen, but your path is incredible.
*  And I encourage anybody that hasn't heard it to go back and listen to the
*  first podcast you and I did together where you explained it.
*  I was stunned.
*  I remember for the rest of the day, all I could think about was your story and how
*  insane it is that what you had to go through to finally make it to Europe.
*  Incredible story.
*  You know, just as I was talking, I was saying earlier, um, because some people
*  hasn't been exposed, they haven't get a big, big stage, like, uh, they don't care
*  about them.
*  There are a lot of people out there with a better story than mine, with a better,
*  they're stronger than mine that even me, I'm impressed.
*  I'm like, bro, how do you do that?
*  I don't think I could have done that.
*  You know, but, and they had a lot, not like one or like two, three, a lot of
*  people, you know, but I think I happen to be the one that have the same and have
*  been exposed.
*  My story has been exposed to the world.
*  It's you went through that struggle and I have the Jorgen experience to tell my
*  own story, which they don't have.
*  Well, I'd have, I'd be happy to have them on too, if they had a story like yours
*  and the success that you've had from that.
*  It's very inspiring.
*  And it speaks to the human spirit because, uh, that's, that's what people love to
*  hear about, about someone who did not give up and struggled so hard.
*  What, how many times did you get sent back?
*  Seven, eight times?
*  Um, six times in the, in the, in the ocean six times.
*  And then I made it, I made it the seventh time.
*  Crazy.
*  Crazy.
*  Seven is a magic number.
*  It is a magic number, right?
*  It's a lucky number.
*  Yeah.
*  The seven times.
*  It's an incredibly inspirational story.
*  And, and I love the fact that you're dedicated to doing this thing in Africa
*  now and to give more people an opportunity and to give them a path towards a career.
*  You know, um, regardless of what you might think of, of, of my life, I
*  think I'm a very blessed guy.
*  I think I'm a very lucky guy.
*  First of all, to like, I think even if, when I explained, you might don't really
*  understand where I came from and to imagine that I'm here today calling a
*  shot, bro, it's crazy.
*  It's just insane.
*  You know, so I think I'm a very lucky guy.
*  God has really blessed me.
*  And then, um, I also think those blessing comes with a lot of opportunity
*  that I can bring back, you know, because when I was there for so many times, I
*  can't tell you how many times that my hope was to somebody to come do something,
*  to some good Samaritan, to take some action that I would take advantage on.
*  You know, then he happened that, uh, uh, I've been blessed to be, to be the
*  guy that can do that.
*  And even without taking, uh, even without that, taking anything out of me, you know,
*  so like, I'm like, he will be a sin not to do, not to do something, you know, like,
*  um, for example, for the PFA Africa, my, my dream about that, what get me excited
*  about that is just seeing myself not have to leave Africa as I did, and then
*  have to compete in the good platform.
*  Like that have to make a living, have to fight in the, uh, of war class
*  fighter in that level and just stay at home and not have to risk all this life,
*  go through all this stuff to the ocean, through the ocean, the bar wire, the
*  prison stuff that I've been to do that.
*  You know, I just have to stay home and do that.
*  Right.
*  So now it's a new, it's a platform that's going to give opportunity to many people
*  that maybe have a plan to go through that same path and that might not have made it.
*  You know, they're just doing it at home.
*  That's beautiful.
*  How could you not do think of doing something like that when you have an
*  opportunity and it's not like, oh, uh, is a war that they carry and put on your
*  head and you a burden that you have to carry is the opportunity that you can
*  just help participate and make it happen.
*  So tell me how does this play out?
*  Do you establish gyms in Africa?
*  Are you going to put a gym in Cameroon?
*  Are you going to, how are you going to do this?
*  I have two gyms in Cameroon already.
*  Oh, you do?
*  Yeah.
*  We through my foundation.
*  I have one gym, one gym for six years now.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And then the second gym, uh, been around for almost two years.
*  And we built that one with a partner.
*  Um, I mean, a partner helped us to build that.
*  They, they like our project, um, uh, with the foundation and then they joined us.
*  Premier bet.
*  They joined us to that, to build the fund that gym for us, a very big, big
*  gas gym.
*  Um, so we have that too, and we were in the project to build the third one.
*  But with the PFL, one thing that I require, uh, I requested, and then it was
*  granted was that everywhere that we are going to do, we're going to try to build
*  gyms around because yes, it's good to bring PFL to bring competition around.
*  But remember so many, uh, many of those people, they have nothing.
*  Many of those kids that want to fight, they might be training in the, uh, uh,
*  beach on the beach.
*  They might be training.
*  They don't really have a gym to train at, but yet you're expecting them to
*  compete at the highest level.
*  So it's at least good to have a system that will help them.
*  You know, it's like, uh, having a garden, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Having a garden to create talent that you need for your organization.
*  You know, so helping them to help you because at the end of the day, you
*  need talent at the end of the day.
*  Talent needs organization.
*  So the thing is that, uh, with PFL Africa, we're going to build gyms that fighter
*  who use and develop, and then we're going to also implement, uh, help like get
*  coaches, experienced, experienced coaches, uh, that can go and teach and also
*  teach another coach how to properly train at that, uh, coach at that level,
*  stuff like that.
*  So, uh, that's, that's the goal.
*  You know, it's, it's about like building something.
*  It's not like here that you come and everything is established and you have
*  your promotion and go, no, it's like building something, working, uh, from the
*  grass.
*  Yeah.
*  That's beautiful.
*  So Africa is obviously a huge continent and there's so many countries in it.
*  Full of talent.
*  What is the scene like in Africa right now in terms of like, what are the local
*  promotions and how many of them are there and how many, like, how many, like
*  young, talented fighters do you see that are coming out of there that could
*  eventually come over to PFL or the UFC or belt or, or what FC or any of the
*  large organizations.
*  Okay.
*  So you asked me the question like many American, what is the scene in America,
*  in Africa,
*  in the
*  Africa is 52 country.
*  Right.
*  And I never been in five or 10.
*  So I know South Africa has a large scene, you know, obviously Drekas
*  Duplassis from South Africa.
*  There's a lot of good fighters.
*  They have an organization that I think is EFC, something like that.
*  Nigeria, they've been doing good.
*  Uh, they also have a, I think it's African knockout that Usman Kamaru is part of.
*  Right.
*  Um, there are, and there are also some, uh, regional organization.
*  They might be smaller or not like quite, uh, popular.
*  Is there one large organization over there at all?
*  No, not yet.
*  Most of them are fairly small.
*  Yeah.
*  Because again, you have to build everything from the scratch.
*  Right.
*  So everything is true.
*  Everybody is trying to do the best out of what you get.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Like if to have a good organization, you need to build gym.
*  You need to give those fighter a way to train.
*  You need to help them about like having experience, get experience, get training,
*  uh, top coaches, get top coaches.
*  And then more people training.
*  At least they have training partners, which is not, they don't have, you have seen,
*  I have seen a lot of some African fighter that are really good, but they don't
*  have to go somewhere else because they don't have a training partners, you know,
*  but with, with, uh, this, uh, uh, program they're going to have, it's going to be
*  a whole ecosystem, a whole ecosystem in the fact that you're going to have a gym
*  that are going to train and then maybe provide a fighter for, we're going to
*  fight in the promotion and that might be, might have money and then that money
*  will attract people, you know, um, will attract other people to train because he
*  can, he have seen other one making a living out of training.
*  He have seen that is possible.
*  He have seen the opportunity right next to his door.
*  Like they're here.
*  I don't have to travel.
*  It's not in America anymore.
*  It's not in Europe anymore.
*  It's here.
*  I just have to stay here and get dedicated.
*  So it's possible.
*  And that's interesting too.
*  If the PFL has a, I mean, if they establish PFL Africa, the beautiful thing is that if
*  they have top level fights over there and then they take those fights and they
*  broadcast them all over the world, then there's so much opportunity.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, uh, the, the, the fighter of PFL Africa will not only be seen in Africa,
*  not to mention that the champions of the PFL Africa, uh, just as PFL
*  MENA and PFL Europe, they will all come together to fight for the main PFL title.
*  You know, so that's exciting.
*  Everybody is getting that big, uh, stage is, uh, they are all working,
*  they are all still under like the, the glow, the main PFL.
*  Yeah.
*  You see, which is something that, uh, is very interesting.
*  Um, and then we give more, um, more spotlight, more opportunity, also
*  get, uh, attention of media.
*  And then who says media says attention of sponsor that will go maybe to gym, to
*  fighters, and that create, that will create a ecosystem around that media
*  interests, the sponsor come around and then fighter get paid and then maybe
*  his sparring partner get paid or I don't know, he has his assistant or somebody
*  working to work for him, get paid and the money is now in the loop.
*  And everybody, do you see yourself, uh, after you retire from fighting, going
*  into a coaching and mentoring role for fighters, do you, do you see yourself
*  being more of an executive position, like working with either the PFL or whoever?
*  I don't see, really, I never see myself as a coach.
*  I don't have like a vocation for that.
*  It's not something that I have.
*  I look, I'm looking forward to, although, um, I see myself like, um, maybe stay in
*  the sport some way, like I also don't see myself as a manager.
*  That's a hard job.
*  And yeah, I know cool.
*  A lot of bullshit.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of bullshit.
*  Like you, I just think that to be a good, is a job that you think like to be good
*  at it, you need to be screwing somebody.
*  Right.
*  Most likely, not always, but most likely might be on the table.
*  So I don't see myself like that, but I see myself really like working on like,
*  um, the growth of the sport, basically in Africa.
*  And again, that's why like the PFL Africa comes to me, like the writing,
*  yeah, you know, the, the, the retirement plan, thinking that I could be focused on
*  being working on, I know how Africa worked perfectly.
*  I know how PFL work perfectly.
*  I know, uh, Pete Murray and Don Davis, they are very excited about it, but bro,
*  they are white people from America and they don't know how Africa works.
*  I am from Africa and I know the deep ground of Africa and I know the challenge
*  there, I know the problem there as an athlete and I think that's where I will
*  impact. I think a role of an executive will be like, it's some fancy thing that
*  yes, I might have, but I think my good job is to, to work on the field because I
*  know the problem.
*  The root.
*  The root and the problem there.
*  What could be done?
*  What needs to be done?
*  What fight, what they, what they need, you know, I think that's what I will be
*  best at.
*  Also for young fighters.
*  Like, yeah, it's cool to be chairman of PFL Africa, but I'm not going to sit in
*  the office.
*  I'm like, Oh, I'm a chairman and then wear suit and tie every day to, to run
*  stuff, you know, I think I can.
*  No, it doesn't seem like it.
*  But I think like for you, for a young fighter, there's no greater source of
*  inspiration than a guy like yourself.
*  I mean, if you look at your career, you've only been fighting for 10 years.
*  What, look at all you've accomplished.
*  UFC heavyweight champion fought two of the best boxers alive.
*  You're an international superstar.
*  You made millions of dollars.
*  Like that is the height of inspiration.
*  Don't say that on Mike's joke.
*  Sorry, everybody knows.
*  Yeah.
*  But when you say that out loud, maybe you get some lawsuit.
*  You know, money is like honey.
*  You always attract bees.
*  That's so true.
*  A lot of stingers out there.
*  So let's forget about the money, but just look at the accomplishment and just
*  knowing that you came in, especially again, if someone hears your story of how
*  hard it was for you to literally essentially walk from Cameroon to Morocco
*  and then make it all the way over to Europe and then make a career and fight
*  it and then make it to the United States, get into the UFC and then in a matter of
*  a few short years, become the UFC heavyweight champion for young fighters.
*  That's like, like that guy did it.
*  Like he did it.
*  I, he did.
*  He came from where I came from.
*  I can do it now.
*  Once someone has done it, it makes it more accessible.
*  At least mentally to a lot of people.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  And I think that's the fundamental idea about my foundation.
*  My, the reason why I did a foundation for me, he was just so, not only those
*  kids can have access in the gym, which is something that me growing up, I was
*  just dreaming about it.
*  The only gym that I have seen until I was 22 was the gym that I saw whether in
*  my dream or in the TV.
*  I never see a real gym, even though I always want to do combat sport.
*  But I, I thought like, if you build like nice gym, not only those kids have access,
*  he make them have this feeling, this connection with reality.
*  Like, oh, the thing that I always see in TV is here is possible, you know?
*  And then the guy that maybe I've seen in TV on TV or heard about is also here.
*  Like he's around, he came here.
*  So it's possible, you know, because, so the idea of the foundation was just to
*  motivate kids, allow them to be believe in themselves.
*  And I think it's still what we're working on to help them believe, trust, have a
*  trust in themselves, a self-believing, have a self-confidence in themselves.
*  And this doesn't matter what they want to do in life.
*  You might want to be a doctor.
*  You might want to be a lawyer, accountant, journalist, whatever you want to do.
*  But I do think that a guy that believes, somebody that believe in himself,
*  success for that guy is just a matter of time.
*  And you can be a champion in whatever you do.
*  See, like it doesn't, you don't have to be a fighter to become a champion.
*  I'm glad you brought that up because there's another question I wanted to ask you is,
*  do you have any other aspirations of doing things outside of fighting once you've
*  retired? Because one of the things you were talking to Jamie about before the
*  show started was producing.
*  You were talking about production, like film and filming things.
*  And do you have other aspirations?
*  I have a lot of aspiration, but not like a job.
*  I have a lot of passion.
*  You know, I'm passionate about a lot of things today.
*  I use, I can, I have quite the resource to have some hobbies, you know, stuff that
*  I, I'm excited about, I'm passionate about.
*  I create a small production in Cameroon, in my village, just to train kids so they
*  can have to touch camera like this.
*  All those stuff that we have here, I have it back home.
*  They touch, they learn on it.
*  You know, I just want them to be able to operate a good camera.
*  If someday they want to do, or somebody want to do a movie, they have somebody
*  that can operate a nice camera, just home.
*  Don't need to go to Europe or in America to bring people because local, they can
*  do, and they have been trained in on good cameras, you know?
*  So I have started stuff like that a lot.
*  What inspired you to do that in terms of cameras and production and stuff?
*  I always love cameras.
*  I always love, I see, and I always impressed.
*  And then I see stuff here and then I see the challenge, the difference that are,
*  you know, like you will see somebody that make a film, a movie that might be on
*  Netflix with a very low quality of camera.
*  Then I'm like, what if this guy has a, has a, has access on a good camera?
*  What can he do?
*  Right.
*  You know?
*  Well, that's one of the things you like, you were talking about with fighters.
*  There's a lot of people out there that are very talented.
*  They just haven't had their shot, their shot yet.
*  Absolutely.
*  There's a lot of people like that with filmmaking and with standup comedy and
*  writing, every year, everything.
*  Yeah.
*  And I'll have another opportunity.
*  I always say this.
*  I think I'm, I, we might have become, uh, uh, UF, uh, the first African champion.
*  Just because there wasn't so many people that have a chance.
*  I mean, like, uh, when you look at, uh, Camaro, Adesanya, I, I'm sure if you go
*  to Africa, you can find some motherfuckers who can beat us up, but lucky us.
*  She didn't have that chance yet.
*  So that's very humble of you.
*  We took the opportunity.
*  Right.
*  Well, you open the door though, and it makes it possible for others, which is,
*  that's one of the more important things about accomplishment is that
*  every time goes by, the challenge will become tougher and tougher and we will
*  come around and we will be very, we might come very short.
*  Well, look at Brazil.
*  You know, I mean, look at Brazil.
*  There's so many champions, so many elite fighters come out of Brazil.
*  Now it's because hoist Gracie opened that door and then the UFC just became
*  a place for them.
*  And then you should take even that Droid Gracie on his prime, put him here.
*  He's going to get beat up by maybe by some kickboxer.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, but he's, he was the one that opened that door, you know, that
*  gave that opportunity that made the path through that.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just, it's so important that you recognize that, that like your position
*  is not just as an individual, but your position is as an inspiration to others.
*  And to give people this, this, they see it like, I can do it.
*  He did it.
*  It's possible.
*  Yeah.
*  I think, in life, we, we take every opportunity that we have.
*  We get to the point again that we have a opportunity to affect other life.
*  How many people affect other life?
*  How many people in their lifetime walk around and, uh, parents walk to them.
*  I'm like, Oh, my kid want to become, be like you.
*  Right.
*  You know, I think, I think it's something really cool.
*  It's really great.
*  It's very cool.
*  Like a parent that want the best for their kids.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  Kids wanted to be like you.
*  Yes.
*  It's different because he's not very smart.
*  He's not wise.
*  And even kids want to be, do some dumb shit.
*  So you might be a bad guy and kids still want to be like, a drug dealer,
*  but a parent that really protective about their kids, like one, the best for their kids.
*  And then they'll come like, Oh, you're so smart.
*  Oh, your son is such an inspiration.
*  My kid want to be like you.
*  So that's that basically like him approving that he, he kids should be like you.
*  He hope for his kid to become like you.
*  That's a big statement, which is pretty cool.
*  Yeah, it is pretty cool.
*  It's really cool.
*  It's really cool.
*  And it's a, there's such a unique time for people too, because.
*  Internet is available pretty much all over the world now.
*  So kids in all these countries, especially if they have phones, they have access to all of this information.
*  All.
*  And it's messy.
*  It's coming for from all over and you can, they can find everything.
*  Yeah.
*  Everything.
*  Now how to help them pick what's good and what's not good.
*  Right.
*  That's the problem.
*  Yeah.
*  Because information is good, but.
*  A lot of it's bullshit.
*  A lot of it is bullshit.
*  You have to filter because some, some of them are just bad seed.
*  Yeah, that's true too.
*  Yeah.
*  And then as you see what's happening in the Amazon, there's a, this very small,
*  uncontacted tribe and they got internet access.
*  And now a lot of them are just on their phones all day.
*  And then the tribe leaders are like, well, what the fuck?
*  Everyone's lazy.
*  You guys are becoming like Americans now.
*  You're just on your phone all day.
*  They're looking at tits and look at a porn and like, you know, of course,
*  and this thing that they thought would be a beautiful thing.
*  Oh, this would be so great.
*  We're going to get access to information.
*  People are going to get educated.
*  Instead, you know, a lot of them are just looking at Tik TOK videos.
*  Yeah.
*  But they got to have to figure out how to manage that people for the most part are
*  lazy.
*  Really?
*  You think so?
*  Yeah.
*  I think people for the most part are lazy.
*  If you give them an opportunity to be lazy.
*  No, it's hard to be disciplined, especially if you don't have examples of other
*  disciplined people around you.
*  You know, some people might have, might just have been educated, keep going to
*  school because they choose school over work.
*  That's true.
*  And some people choose work over school.
*  That's true as well.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you go to school and after being graduated or big oil or have your
*  PhD and then you're like, oh, he's educated.
*  He's this.
*  In fact, you were running away from, from a job.
*  I'm sure that's educators.
*  That's the problem with our universities.
*  Those people want to teach.
*  At the end of the day, yes, you are educated, but in reality, you are lazy.
*  If you have a job, if you have a job that is going to wear a suit and act like a
*  boss every day, he can do it.
*  But if he has to like start something and work really hard, you can't stand it.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't stand it.
*  There's a lot of truth in that.
*  But someone will also be a worker because they had a vision.
*  They want to do that.
*  They are excited of a knowledge to, uh, implement into something.
*  And then after that, they just started business and this, you know, because
*  starting a business never is never easy.
*  Right.
*  You have to be a worker.
*  When you have a business, when you start a business, it's not like a nine to five job.
*  You know, you don't have time.
*  Sometimes you have to wake up at midnight or at 2 a.m.
*  to pick up a call because this guy is, I don't know, in China, in Europe and the
*  time different and you have to keep going.
*  You have to be on his time.
*  You have to be on meeting in the meeting at this time.
*  So that's where, you know, if you are a worker or not, but if you see that the
*  office nine to seven, yeah, wear your suit.
*  I'm a manager of these.
*  I'm that I'm that.
*  You know, I'd be lazy.
*  And lazy people do a good job too, because lazy people find a strategy of avoiding work.
*  That's true.
*  Which is very intelligent.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  They find ways.
*  Yes.
*  To get things done without really putting in the work.
*  That is true.
*  Yeah.
*  There's so many books like that.
*  The four hour work week.
*  You know, there's a lot of books on people just trying to avoid work.
*  Yeah.
*  But they still have to move to wash their dishes.
*  Yeah.
*  Close like dishwasher, for example.
*  I think it is the idea of some lazy person that didn't want to wash dishes.
*  Are you agree with me?
*  So a lazy person didn't want to wash dishes.
*  So they hired a dishwasher.
*  No, they invent.
*  Oh, they invented dishwasher.
*  Oh, a machine.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, they thought about it.
*  Like, how can I get my dishes clean without have to wash it?
*  Or also it's more efficient because you can put them in the dishwasher.
*  It's efficient, but the idea come from laziness.
*  Interesting.
*  I mean, he might be, I'm not saying it's the thing, but he might be coming from laziness.
*  You have a point.
*  I don't want to wash my clothes anymore.
*  How can I, but I still need to wear a clean clothes.
*  Right.
*  How can I do to get my clothes clean without washing them?
*  Wash machine.
*  That's true.
*  Right.
*  Because you only wear like one piece of clothes a day and you only eat, use one
*  plate when you eat.
*  How hard is it to wash that one plate?
*  It takes 30 seconds.
*  You get some soap, you get a sponge, rinse it off, put it in the dryer.
*  You're done.
*  Like I have a, that's a good point, man.
*  Yeah.
*  I never thought of it that way.
*  I get in my house and it's something that I still don't understand.
*  Sometimes I would leave plates around and then if I have my housekeeping coming,
*  they'll always take them and put in the dishwasher and everything in the dishwasher.
*  And I don't know what happened.
*  If it's the dishwasher, something wrong with it.
*  You never get things clean properly.
*  Well, you kind of have to clean them before you put them in the dishwasher, which is
*  crazy.
*  So if you just clean them a little bit more, you wouldn't have to put them in the
*  dishwasher.
*  You probably save time.
*  Okay.
*  Personally, I never use a dishwasher.
*  I don't know how it works.
*  I don't know how it works.
*  The easier thing for me is after using one or two plates, I wash it, put it there.
*  Yeah.
*  It's easier.
*  Or even if I stack like three, four plates after I come, take five minutes,
*  clean it, put it there.
*  Yeah.
*  It's easier for me than running machine and this, which I don't even know how it
*  works too much.
*  And it's going to, sometimes it might be loud.
*  I would just want to watch my TV and that shit is running behind me.
*  That's true.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  That's a good point.
*  Yeah.
*  That is a lazy person's invention.
*  A smart, lazy person.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  People are very creative.
*  I never thought about it that way, but I think you're right.
*  Yeah.
*  But then there's some things like vacuum cleaner.
*  You need that.
*  How the fuck are you going to get anything out of a carpet without a
*  vacuum cleaner?
*  You need that.
*  Yeah.
*  There's some inventions that clean that makes sense.
*  But I think, I mean, everything makes sense.
*  Yeah.
*  Even like a wash machine makes sense.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, after training, you come and put your clothes there.
*  You train two, twice a day.
*  You put your clothes after two days.
*  You press that button on the machine when you're leaving.
*  Because that, brrr, you're out.
*  Yeah.
*  Come back is done.
*  You put it in the dryer again.
*  Yeah.
*  No, that's a very good point though, about inventions and also about how
*  lazy people avoid work and about a lot of educated people are just avoiding
*  work by continuing their education.
*  I know personally, people that have done that.
*  They get their PhD, they get grants, they get loans.
*  I know you go in like a family house and then they are like maybe four kids.
*  There's dishes, they have to clean the house.
*  And then someone have a homework.
*  And even if he does have a homework, he's reading a book.
*  He's in the middle of the book.
*  So that means he's not cleaning anything.
*  Because he's reading.
*  You guys are not reading, you have to clean.
*  So how easy is that?
*  Well, people love to put off things they're supposed to do.
*  You know, it's an interesting thing too about fighters, because the difference
*  between, there's like a lot of factors involved in being a fighter.
*  There's the mentality, there's the ability to focus and to perform under pressure.
*  It's very difficult to do, but there's also the ability to prepare properly.
*  So like to have the discipline to do everything that you're supposed to do.
*  And it's even more difficult sometimes for talented people.
*  Yeah, I think fighting is more about discipline because not always
*  talented people will make it.
*  And you might have talent as much as you want.
*  If you don't work, if you don't put some work in and then get
*  disciplined, you will not get there.
*  Right.
*  Like if you look like the champions of every weight class, every promotion,
*  most likely they are not the most talented guys, but they are very hardworking
*  and they have like something very special that distinguish them.
*  Do you know the expression, hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's it.
*  That's true.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  Absolutely.
*  You, cause talent, one of the things that's unfortunate about talent is that when you're
*  talented, you're better than everybody else in the gym.
*  And so you can kind of get away without training as hard, maybe a physical gifts.
*  Maybe you just have an understanding of fighting.
*  And then you take it for granted because you didn't have to work to get it.
*  You don't even have the feeling that you need to work, to, to, to work more, to
*  improve it because he was just there.
*  Right.
*  So you don't even understand that they work for it.
*  Right.
*  You just, you just happen to have it.
*  Yep.
*  And then they say you have to work for it.
*  Come on, bro.
*  For what?
*  Right.
*  I didn't do anything, but I still get it.
*  And if you can get away with it for a while, you develop habits of not training a
*  hundred percent, not really putting a hundred percent into it, but still being
*  successful because you're talented.
*  But then you run into someone who's talented and has discipline.
*  And that's where you get fucked up.
*  Okay.
*  That's the problem.
*  Right.
*  When you get talent and discipline, you get a Michael Jordan and then you get Mike
*  Tyson talent and discipline.
*  You get Mike Tyson.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you get to, you also get like, uh, some people that are not talented, but
*  they are just the, uh, best Walker in the room.
*  Your talent will have it at some point.
*  Talent will have a limit.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  Has a limit, especially if someone is willing to really outwork you really
*  outwork everyone.
*  Yeah.
*  He has to, because like when you don't have talent, you basically start from
*  nothing, then you have one, then you have two, then you know that you have those
*  two because you've been working.
*  So you have to keep working, not only to maintain it, to keep the two, but to get
*  the three and the four and then you get into that process and then you get to work.
*  Yeah.
*  When you get talent, you wake up someday, you have five out of 10 without working.
*  Yes.
*  You don't understand that you need to work to get the six and seven.
*  Right.
*  The guy that only has like the two, he already understood that he already knew
*  that he needs to, he needs to work to get those two to get the three.
*  Yes.
*  So at some point he's going to catch you at five and if you're not improving,
*  he's going to keep going up.
*  He's going to get to six and seven.
*  And you'll be like, this motherfucker was below me.
*  At five, barely go at six, seven.
*  Yeah.
*  And then there's guys that are really good in the gym.
*  And then when they get to the bright lights, they can't perform.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is the craziest thing.
*  There's these superstars in the gym.
*  And I remember from my kickboxing days, there was guys that were just so good in
*  the gym.
*  And then they would get into that ring and they were just,
*  you could see it.
*  They just diminished.
*  Like they were 50% of themselves when they competed.
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe it says there's something about anxiety, their inability to manage stress.
*  Maybe, I don't know.
*  I mean, I don't know what it is.
*  I always feel like some people can overcome it and they don't.
*  And some people do.
*  Some people, they start off as great gym guys and then they perform badly, but
*  then eventually they figure it out.
*  They just keep, keep growing and learning.
*  But there are also a lot of people that go to the gym to become a world champion at
*  the gym.
*  You know, I have seen a lot of, there's a lot of people that you get even in the
*  gym, they are coming to try to figure out that guy is good.
*  So I might have to check him out.
*  You know, they have that.
*  Mentality.
*  Right.
*  So in the gym, why you, maybe as a professional fighter, you are there to train,
*  have a good training to learn.
*  Yes.
*  Because you know that you only have one place that you want to show up.
*  It's in the fight.
*  Right.
*  So the two other months you're in the gym and sometimes if you have somebody in
*  front of you that you feel like he's not catching up with your level, you give him
*  an advantage.
*  You're like, okay, let me start on the back.
*  Right.
*  Let's start on this position.
*  Right.
*  It gives him an advantage so he can challenge you more.
*  Yes.
*  You know what you're doing.
*  You know why you are doing that.
*  That takes a healthy control of your ego.
*  You take it.
*  You see a guy that is a good wrestler, a good jiu-jitsu, but has very bad
*  striking, you know that he's, he, you always start on a stand up.
*  You always start up and then he, he might not be able to take you down.
*  I'm like, okay, let's go.
*  They start on the ground.
*  Step on me.
*  Have that.
*  You know, stuff like that, because you know that you want to work that position.
*  Right.
*  You're taking advantage on him, but some people are there like to prove that.
*  Oh, I'm something.
*  They're competing.
*  Instead of competing.
*  Yeah.
*  That's competing.
*  Yeah.
*  And they don't usually gain more on that.
*  And those people will get in the fight and it's different.
*  Yeah, it's different.
*  It's that is a very interesting thing, right?
*  It's like some people understand it objectively.
*  Like I'm here to learn and grow and I need to work on my weaknesses to make them
*  my strengths and some people want to avoid their weaknesses.
*  So they only work on their strengths.
*  So they look good in the gym.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I care about how they look.
*  Yeah.
*  I used to see that a lot with kick boxers that didn't want to do jiu-jitsu because
*  they didn't like to get tapped.
*  Cause on the feet, they were a killer.
*  And then they go to the ground.
*  They're like, they're like a beginner.
*  They don't like that.
*  They don't like getting dominated on the ground.
*  So they would just like skip jiu-jitsu classes, skip wrestling training.
*  They didn't want to have anything to do with that.
*  I think it was also about like a generation that people around the gym
*  wasn't, wasn't understanding also.
*  Like, uh, there's a gym there.
*  There are people that if you're training with them and something happened and you
*  tap, they'll be like, oh, we're pussy.
*  Right.
*  You know, and I think those kind of people, they don't have their
*  teammate to improve, you know, instead of like, oh, no, you shouldn't do this.
*  Or you should do this instead to avoid, uh, to avoid that.
*  And I'm like, oh, no bro.
*  You don't tap like, yeah, you don't tap.
*  Then what?
*  You go to sleep or you break your arm.
*  Or you break your arm.
*  Yeah.
*  If you don't tap in the gym, you're a moron.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a stupid thing to not tap in the gym.
*  And I've been stupid before.
*  It's like a thing that people do where they, they think that they're.
*  Yeah.
*  All you're doing is getting injured and it's, if you don't tap to an arm bar,
*  you're going to fuck your elbow up and then you might not be able to train
*  right for months.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  You have to, yeah.
*  You know, the Gracie's have a great perspective on that.
*  They always say, keep it playful.
*  They always say that when you're in the gym, you're, you're just training and
*  learning and you got to keep it playful.
*  Marcelo Garcia says that all the time.
*  Who's one of the greatest jujitsu guys of all time.
*  He says, you have to open up your game in the gym.
*  You can't be closed off.
*  It'd be too defensive.
*  You have to open up your gym, your, your game and learn that what happens if
*  you get stuck in bad positions.
*  Yeah.
*  Learn when you get caught.
*  You get caught, you tap.
*  And even if you don't get top, uh, caught sometime, get your position in some,
*  in, get yourself in a position to get caught.
*  Yes.
*  Or let somebody cut you and trying to defend.
*  Yeah.
*  Understand like how to get out of there.
*  Yes.
*  You do that.
*  That's why they call practice.
*  Do you think you'll ever compete in jujitsu?
*  You ever think that's something that's interesting to you?
*  Me?
*  Yeah.
*  No, I don't think so.
*  I don't have any knees or ankles to give up.
*  That's a good point.
*  Man.
*  I watched a video this past weekend of a guy getting his leg broken.
*  If I was 25 years.
*  I'm gonna send you this Jamie, cause this is horrific.
*  If this is, if I was 25, 20, 25, I would take those chances to all those stuff.
*  Fun.
*  Yeah.
*  Why?
*  I don't have anything to give up.
*  Yeah.
*  That's, um, I'm going to show you something, Jamie.
*  This, uh, this video scared the fucking shit out of me.
*  This video is, is this guy gets caught in this, uh, heel hook.
*  Hold on a second.
*  Where is it?
*  Yeah.
*  I'm gonna send it to you, Jamie.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm sending it to you, Jamie.
*  This shit's horrible.
*  This guy gets caught in an inside heel hook, like 10 seconds into the match and
*  he doesn't tap and his leg snaps in half.
*  Yeah.
*  Watch this.
*  That's stupid.
*  Check this out.
*  So this guy, they scramble.
*  Austin.
*  That's sound.
*  Play that again.
*  So I can hear that sound.
*  A very long time.
*  That's in South Africa.
*  That's how that's again.
*  Punch me in the face, bro.
*  Yeah.
*  That leg might not ever be the same again.
*  No, punch me in the face.
*  Not the leg yourself.
*  Like, do you imagine like just thinking of the day that you're like, make this
*  sound like, oh God damn.
*  It's staff right here.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  Like right there.
*  Yes.
*  Like the spiral.
*  Yeah.
*  Spiral fracture was the shin.
*  Horrible.
*  And the sound was like a baseball bat breaking.
*  Oh, I'll never forget the sound when Chris Weidman kicked Uriah Hall and
*  snapped his knee and snapped his shin in half.
*  The sound was so horrible.
*  That crying.
*  He's never been the same again.
*  You know, it's like that those breaks, like especially the shin break.
*  You know, I wonder like if Conor McGregor is ever going to come back again.
*  It's like, it's very difficult to come back from that break.
*  That was, that's one of the worst injuries.
*  And I think like for that kind of injury, the most, the most difficult
*  part is the mental part.
*  You don't know if it's going to be taken.
*  Right.
*  To try to get to like, you know, like, obviously you have a rehab, right?
*  Right.
*  You rehab the part that is injured.
*  Right.
*  The rehab of your mind to be able to trust that again.
*  Right.
*  That's the problem.
*  You know, I'm like, I don't know about that.
*  Maybe we just keep, skip this part.
*  Well, even when you're not injured, like your fight with Stipe and then you fight
*  Derek Lewis in the back of your mind, you're still thinking about the Stipe fight.
*  Right.
*  I'm still fighting Stipe.
*  I'm still like, what the hell, why did I do this?
*  No, I should be patient.
*  I should do this.
*  You know, I'm there fighting Stipe.
*  And then I get surprised when the fight was over.
*  And then I'm like, I'm like, okay, this is it.
*  We still have one more round, right?
*  Like now it's over.
*  It's been three rounds.
*  Because I was just being patient.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you came back from that though.
*  How did you come back from that?
*  How did you get your mind straight?
*  I mean, I think, uh, I get to the point that, um, I just let it go and I'm like, okay,
*  because I'm like, if this the end, at least let's finish how we started at the
*  beginning, he was all phone, right?
*  Like having fun.
*  I feel like at some point along the way, I lost that phone.
*  I don't know when, but I lost that phone and it's about like, oh, we need, you have
*  to win, you shouldn't lose this, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  So did you make a decision in your mind to go back to having fun again?
*  Yeah.
*  He was just like, have fun.
*  And then whatever happened, happened.
*  Don't, don't care.
*  And if this is it, if you lose again, and then maybe have to be, have to get caught
*  or whatever, at least enjoy it.
*  So is this, I get in China, have to fight, cut his blade 45 seconds.
*  It was over.
*  I'm like, yeah, no bad having fun.
*  Fun for you.
*  Yes.
*  I have the performance of the night.
*  Then keep going.
*  So did you ever work with a psychologist or a performance coach or did
*  it all just, you figure it out yourself?
*  I try, but I think I have it like a personal blockage.
*  I don't believe in that.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  I talk to myself a lot.
*  I spend time with me, with myself.
*  I mean, most of the time I'm by myself.
*  I'm a lonely person.
*  So I spent time with myself and I talked to myself a lot.
*  I figured out and analyze, and this was just me like growing up, you know,
*  didn't even have like, didn't have friends, didn't have like people to hang out with.
*  I wasn't welcome among kids.
*  So I created my own world in my mind that my own friends and everything in my mind.
*  So just used to hang out with myself.
*  So I get used to, just like that.
*  Well, that's so much better for a person in your position in life than to have
*  an entourage.
*  So I know a lot of guys when they get very successful, they have an entourage.
*  So they're surrounded by yes men all the time.
*  And that is one of the worst things that happens to a successful person.
*  But for them, for some people is cool.
*  You know, like even now, I think no later than last week, I was in the restaurant and I
*  walked there by myself, take a table, sit down.
*  The people look over there like, is that fucking Francis in Ghana?
*  Yeah, order my food.
*  Eat.
*  Do people freak out?
*  Like, is that Francis in Ghana sitting by himself?
*  Yeah, some people recognize you.
*  I'm like, yeah, are you expecting somebody?
*  And most of the time, the answer is yes.
*  Basically, like, leave me alone.
*  Right.
*  So you generally like being by yourself?
*  Yeah, I like to.
*  I do that a lot.
*  And people, I'm like, are you live here by yourself?
*  Are you by yourself?
*  I'm like, what's the problem by being by yourself?
*  It's been independent.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't need anybody to be to decide on my happiness or me having fun or whatever.
*  You know, like, sometimes I will spend two days in my house without going out.
*  Yeah, I'm good with it.
*  And I can go out.
*  I can do whatever I want.
*  But I just want to be there.
*  I don't want to be alone.
*  I don't want to be alone.
*  I don't want to be alone.
*  I want to do whatever I want.
*  But I just want to be there.
*  I did that recently.
*  You know, my family was out of town and I was home by myself for three days.
*  It was glorious.
*  I loved it.
*  Just gives you time to think about things.
*  I do that a lot.
*  But recently, I've been changing a little bit because like, staying home a lot will
*  make me think and will make me sad since I lost my kid, my boy.
*  then he'll make me think and make me sad.
*  And if I stay there, I will keep having those thoughts,
*  the sadness around, it's like the energy around me
*  is just sad.
*  I understand.
*  You know?
*  So then what I do is like when I start to feel
*  something like that, I just have to force myself,
*  like get out, grab the car key, get the hell out of here.
*  Like I'm running away from something.
*  Then by the time you even find the car key,
*  you find your shoes, you do this,
*  your mind is already thinking of something.
*  But if you just sit in your couch.
*  So sorrow, just sorrow.
*  Yeah, if you just sit in your couch,
*  then it's keep going, keep going, then it's sad.
*  Then you're pissed, then you're like hate life, everything.
*  Your son was 15 months old?
*  15 months old.
*  What happened?
*  Bro, I think he has some malformation on his mind.
*  Which is something that we didn't know.
*  He fainted, he passed out twice.
*  The first time was in Kimerun.
*  We took him to the hospital.
*  They didn't find anything.
*  The second time was in Saudi.
*  We took him to the hospital.
*  They ran a lot of exams.
*  They didn't do anything.
*  They did the EEG.
*  Didn't do the scan or the MRI.
*  Because I think according to them,
*  their conclusion was that he has a swollen lung.
*  And that was what was pressing his chest
*  and stopping him from breathing and create that faint.
*  So after all those exams, they give him some medicine
*  that is gonna be okay, nothing to worry about.
*  Because at first, they haven't thought about asthma.
*  They give like a ventilator and then afterward,
*  after some result, they took him out.
*  And then, you know, it put me in confident.
*  Even though like, I don't know, sometime I think,
*  some way in my mind, I have to think that yes,
*  but he didn't show any stress respiratory
*  if he was something from his lung.
*  But I'm like, bro, those was professional doctor and this.
*  And then I trust that.
*  So I basically like put my guard down.
*  And I remember being just getting in Dubai.
*  And that day I was thinking like, oh, life is,
*  mean wise, I'm not doing bad.
*  Life is good.
*  You know, I went to the gym like,
*  maybe I should go to club tonight.
*  I don't go to club, I don't go out.
*  Like, man, come on, which kind of guy are you?
*  So I went to the gym, went to workout.
*  I'm in the bike cycling.
*  Then I tried to call, I wanted to talk to him
*  when I was on the phone, on the bike.
*  Then I called his mom.
*  His mom didn't pick up the phone.
*  And I'm like, after I'm done,
*  I'm gonna go take my shower, lay in the bed and call him.
*  And 30 minutes after I was on the leg machine,
*  my phone rang, it was my little brother.
*  Say, bro, things are not going well here.
*  I'm like, what?
*  He said, Kobe pass out, he's not breathing.
*  We are at the hospital.
*  They kicked me out from the room.
*  Now I'm like, what's happened?
*  And then as we are talking,
*  he's also trying to get information.
*  So I lost him for like three, four minutes.
*  Then after I call him again.
*  And then I'm talking to him,
*  while he's talking to the nurse.
*  And the nurse was like, who are you?
*  Are you his dad?
*  He said, no.
*  Then who are you?
*  I'm his uncle.
*  Where is that?
*  His dad is not here.
*  Where?
*  He's gone.
*  Just like that.
*  He's gone, what do you mean?
*  He's gone.
*  How come he's gone?
*  This kid was 15 months.
*  He was bigger than 15 months.
*  He was growing.
*  He was the most joyful, happy kid around.
*  Hey, what do you mean he's gone?
*  Gone where?
*  Bro, that was it.
*  I thought I was dreaming.
*  I thought they're gonna say something.
*  No, that's not true.
*  Then I keep calling again.
*  And everybody's confirmed.
*  I call my mom.
*  My mom is just on tear.
*  Like, bro,
*  what the fuck is this?
*  And that was it.
*  And I never realized,
*  I have been in the situation that
*  I have seen people losing their kids,
*  mourning, maybe.
*  Definitely older kids.
*  But I'm like, man, this must be hot.
*  Even though I can feel it.
*  At that moment,
*  I mean, you don't know what could be your reaction.
*  You don't know.
*  I have been in the situation that I'm like,
*  bro, I don't cry.
*  I never cry.
*  I mean, not like I never cry,
*  but it don't just happen.
*  I don't know why.
*  No.
*  Maybe because you don't have a reason.
*  When you feel like something really hurt inside you,
*  like you can't breathe, it's hurting.
*  That was it.
*  When did this happen?
*  April 27th.
*  So this before the Joshua fight?
*  No, after.
*  After the Joshua fight.
*  Yeah, April 27th.
*  Almost two months after.
*  That was it.
*  And then all of the sudden,
*  you realize how
*  a kid that wasn't there two years ago
*  have became a major part of your life.
*  Or if it's not your life,
*  then you realize that all the things
*  that you were worrying about didn't mean shit at all.
*  Nothing mean like nothing.
*  It was the only thing at time that really matter.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's not there anymore.
*  But, you know, one thing is that,
*  you know, my dad passed away.
*  I was 15 and he got sick.
*  Just stay at home for like months
*  and couldn't even go to the hospital.
*  And get to the point that he couldn't even go
*  to the bathroom on his own, nothing.
*  But I was 15, I was stuck at school.
*  You know, I always tell myself,
*  like I was a kid, what could I have done?
*  And then after a couple years, I left school
*  and then I started think, I'm like, okay.
*  I had an excuse when my dad passed away.
*  I think I'm becoming an adult
*  and I still powerless.
*  I still can't do anything if something like that happened.
*  What happened if my mom got sick?
*  Like what happened if I have my own kids?
*  Like some days and they need me
*  or I will provide for them, like, or protect them.
*  And those was one of the thoughts that I always have,
*  like pushing me leaving.
*  Like, no, I need to do something, I need to take action.
*  Then after years, you get to the point
*  that you feel like you have it figured out.
*  Like, okay, I can afford a healthcare for my family.
*  I can take care if somebody needs to go to the hospital
*  or whatever it is, I can make it, I can do it.
*  Then all of the sudden, your own kids,
*  which is the one that rely on you, only you,
*  you couldn't even do anything for him.
*  You did, like by the time you get to the hospital,
*  he was gone.
*  You couldn't fight for him.
*  I'm like, bro, let me fight.
*  Let me say I have tried, let me say I did something.
*  Let's make all this work.
*  What's the point if after all this,
*  I get to the point that I'm still this powerless
*  in front of a real situation.
*  And that, that was, that's hurt.
*  That's hurt a lot.
*  I'm sorry to hear that, man.
*  I can't imagine.
*  I can't imagine, and it's also the pain of knowing
*  there's nothing you could have done.
*  It's just a medical thing that he was born with.
*  Yeah, he was born with, because when it happens,
*  everybody was confused, nobody knows.
*  So get home, then what should we do?
*  Let's do a autopsy.
*  Well, that one was tough because you think that,
*  they say, you know what, that they're gonna tear him,
*  cut him, cut his head.
*  Like, I mean,
*  a kid that yesterday, you were going,
*  excited to talk to him.
*  Now they are talking about like,
*  cut him this way, this way.
*  Like how come that is like,
*  but you know, it's at least good to know what happened.
*  Maybe that might save somebody in the future
*  because he's still a mystery there.
*  So say, let's do the autopsy.
*  That's why they find all this out.
*  The last time I saw him was me leaving Cameroon,
*  going to the elevator, and he was with my little brother,
*  and he didn't want me to go because he became my body
*  so much that he didn't, when I'm around,
*  he don't want me to leave him alone.
*  He can, I can take him whenever, wherever I go.
*  He might not done eat, he doesn't care,
*  as long as he's with me, like that was it.
*  He was my mate, like 15 months.
*  He's barely walking, but you know,
*  when I walked in, you know that I walked in.
*  You don't have, they don't have to ask like,
*  who walked in?
*  They know that it is his dad, you know, his reaction.
*  Or then you started think about all those little thing,
*  all those little things that you guys have,
*  just you want him, then it's over.
*  Then it's over.
*  When he was, the day that I was leaving,
*  he was crying, like wanted me to go with him,
*  but I keep going, I knew that I'm going to be back.
*  I have no clue that that was it.
*  I always say I should have go back one more time,
*  and one more day, I don't know,
*  hug him one more time.
*  Man.
*  That was it.
*  And then he get back in the apartment
*  and see all his toys, the stuff that he was playing,
*  the thing that you take from him the other day
*  and put here, it's right there,
*  but he's not there anymore,
*  and will never be there anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  Kobe.
*  Kobe, what's his name?
*  I named him after Kobe Bryant,
*  because I had a great memory of Kobe Bryant.
*  The day that the USA was launching,
*  was announcing the partnership with Buddy Amo,
*  was in New York.
*  I just arrived in the US at time, my English was so bad.
*  I'm in New York, we have to meet in this room,
*  this event, to make the announcement,
*  and I'm there a little early,
*  then Kobe came a little early too.
*  Meet me in the waiting room,
*  just Kobe and I there for like 30 minutes.
*  I don't, my English is very bad, I'm embarrassed,
*  I don't wanna speak, and then he keep talking,
*  asking questions, talk about my story,
*  ask me where I came from and how do I get,
*  and I'm like, wow, this impressive.
*  I'm like, this is Kobe, right?
*  I don't wanna bother him, but he's questioning me,
*  really excited about it, get me to talk.
*  Then I feel bad, I'm like, oh no,
*  your English is really good,
*  I understand what you're saying,
*  and then how about this, that, like for 30 minutes.
*  Until then, they know why it was the next guy
*  that walked in the room, and he say,
*  wow, do you know this guy's story?
*  Do you know his story?
*  He did this, he did that, and then I say, yes, I know.
*  Like, wow, this crazy, wow, it's crazy how we in America,
*  we don't know what's going around the world,
*  and Kobe was there talking like that.
*  I'm like, this is Kobe Bryant, you know?
*  So that was like my moment with Kobe.
*  Wow.
*  So when he passed out, when he died,
*  you know, I was in LA when I heard about the news,
*  and it hit me really bad,
*  and I decide I'm gonna make Kobe, and have a Kobe.
*  So that's it.
*  Then the day that he passed away, just the day before,
*  they were just making a little basketball court
*  that I have for him, his playground for him, you know?
*  Because I was so wait for him to start to be strong
*  on his feet, so we can go work, we can do this,
*  we can play soccer.
*  I've been looking for soccer clips for him,
*  this, that, you know, you have all the projects.
*  I have thought of like, which school should he go?
*  Like, think, oh, what should I do?
*  You know, you never know, maybe something happened to me.
*  I should set up something to keep him safe, you know?
*  You think like that, but no, it never cross your mind
*  that he will be the one living first.
*  From the moment that he was born,
*  not like when he was born, when he started to react,
*  and you really see like a living person,
*  you really start to plan out like how to protect him,
*  how to build a security around him, you know?
*  He wasn't just a kid, he was a project,
*  he became a huge project.
*  Everything that you think of that's good, that you want,
*  oh, it's for Kobe, it's for him, all of the sudden.
*  Then he's gone.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  You've been through a lot in your life, Francis.
*  Yeah.
*  You've been through a lot.
*  Well, a lot of people been through it.
*  You didn't just know.
*  Yeah.
*  Then after that, you look people that been through,
*  that lost a kid, you respect them more,
*  you give them some more respect.
*  Like my older brother lost two kids,
*  and I feel so bad not really being there for him
*  because I didn't understand.
*  I know that he lost kids,
*  but I didn't know what exactly that means.
*  Now that I understand, I'm like, man,
*  I should have been there more.
*  I feel bad that I didn't connect to his suffering,
*  to his pain.
*  And you respect him more from being through that
*  to overcome that twice.
*  Then you think like, you start to think like, no.
*  In fact, I think I'm not the toughest one though.
*  I'm being put in tests and realize
*  that I'm not as tough as I think.
*  There's nothing anybody could say.
*  That's the craziest thing.
*  There's no comfort that anybody can give you.
*  If they ask you what do you want,
*  or what can comfort you, you don't know.
*  So it's nothing.
*  It's really about like facing it daily.
*  Take it one at a time.
*  Do you have other children?
*  Yeah, I have another girl.
*  I have another girl.
*  But when it happen like that,
*  you feel like, I don't know, even though you're
*  in your mind, you think like you still have a lot going on,
*  a lot of things to be grateful about,
*  but in your heart, you feel like you're broke.
*  You have nothing.
*  Nothing is worth it.
*  I mean, I always love life and know that I have,
*  know that I have everything of society,
*  but at least for once, I'm like,
*  at least whenever I die, I'm gonna go see my kid.
*  I'm gonna see him.
*  I'm not afraid of it.
*  I still wanna live, but at least whenever,
*  you know, you get to, you get to that point,
*  to think like that.
*  So some way you're looking forward for whenever that happen.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm very sorry for your loss, man.
*  I really am.
*  I wish I could say something, but there's nothing to say.
*  There's nothing to say, Joe.
*  Thank you, though.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you for being here, man.
*  Thank you for being here.
*  Thank you for being here, man.
*  Thank you for everything.
*  You're an inspirational man.
*  You really are.
*  Thank you. Appreciate it.
*  Appreciate you being here,
*  and the best of luck to you in everything in life.
*  We will see.
*  That's why like, I really want to come back
*  and do something, you know, like,
*  because I really think like, maybe I should,
*  I get to the point that I'm like,
*  why do I fight for?
*  You know, I don't even have to, I don't want,
*  but bro, that boy for 15, for only 15 months,
*  I think he, he taught me something, you know,
*  like he was active, full of life,
*  and I think if there's one thing that he,
*  he would have been doing, he would have been doing,
*  he would have been doing something,
*  not staying there, not being a reason of giving up
*  or whatever, and I think that's,
*  that's the only way to honor him, his memory,
*  keep him alive, get a purpose,
*  make him a motivation,
*  and I think so.
*  We will see, we will see how it plays out.
*  Yeah.
*  Again, thank you, Francis.
*  Thank you for being here, man.
*  I really appreciate you.
*  Thank you, Joe.
*  All right.
*  Bye, everybody.
