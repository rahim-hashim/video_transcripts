# Joe Rogan Experience #2147 - Mike Baker
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI73AyWaODo)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  Mike Baker, it's very important that I ask you about this.
*  What's that?
*  Because I know you're an expert on conflict.
*  How do you feel about the Kendrick Lamar and Drake beef?
*  Man, I am so glad you asked me about this.
*  Because my boys, you know, I got three boys and all three of them have mentioned this
*  in the past few days.
*  And they want to talk about it.
*  So Scooter will say, God, did you hear what he said?
*  And I was like, honestly, no, I haven't.
*  But they've all brought this up.
*  I am completely unfamiliar with the, although it sounds like the old days, East versus West,
*  right?
*  In the old rap battle.
*  I think it's a personality thing because one of them is Toronto.
*  So it's actually America versus Canada.
*  Oh, well, that's right.
*  This is a real conflict there.
*  And which one is the little guy?
*  Kendrick Lamar.
*  Kendrick Lamar.
*  That's right.
*  That's what my middle boy Sluggo said.
*  I think he's like five foot one or something.
*  He's not a big fella.
*  No.
*  Him and Drake have been going at it now.
*  Four songs a piece.
*  So eight songs dedicated to beef.
*  I think that's fantastic.
*  I think we need more of that, right?
*  It's better than the Hamas conflict.
*  Security guard injured in shooting outside Drake's home in Toronto.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  God damn it.
*  Was it drive by?
*  The security guard was outside.
*  Said he was shot, I think unconsciously taken to the hospital.
*  Oh my God.
*  Don't listen to die.
*  See, it was...
*  Do not know whether the shooting was related.
*  Well, take a fucking guess.
*  You think it was or was it?
*  A drive by might be related?
*  Well that's when shit gets scary, when people start shooting at each other.
*  No, when it was just...
*  Because I think it was Sluggo who told me that one of them, I think it must have been
*  Drake who was talking about his...
*  He dissed him by talking about his size seven feet or something.
*  And that's fine.
*  I think it's great.
*  If everybody would just like...
*  If the Israelis and Hamas would go after each other in song...
*  Battle raps.
*  Yeah, battle raps.
*  Yeah, why not?
*  Yeah, dance off.
*  That's how they should do it.
*  Yeah.
*  This is...
*  It was hilarious, but everybody's invested in this beef.
*  My oldest daughter and my wife were in the car this morning and they were having a conversation.
*  These two grown ass women having a conversation about who's the superior rapper.
*  And they felt that Kendrick is a better lyricist, although Drake has more hits.
*  Drake has more hits.
*  Started from the bottom, now we're here.
*  I mean, look, he's got some bangers.
*  They both have bangers.
*  I love Kendrick Lamar.
*  I just wish these two would hug it out.
*  Yeah, well now it's moved on to the firefight stage of the battle.
*  Yeah, well now they're shooting.
*  What did you say, Jamie?
*  Kendrick's first big point was that it's 20 verse one because Drake has all those ghost
*  riders helping him make all these hits.
*  So that's an allegation in the rap community, apparently, that Drake hires ghost riders.
*  I don't know how I feel about that.
*  So I feel like the same way I feel like if I find out someone there's a banging song,
*  like Beyonce has a song out.
*  I don't get upset if she didn't write it.
*  Do you get upset?
*  It's mostly only in rap that people are like, you didn't write that.
*  Like comedy.
*  Like comedy.
*  Like the same thing with comedy.
*  Country song, they don't care.
*  Country, they do care.
*  Not really.
*  Yeah, not really.
*  I was going to say, yeah.
*  Guys like Zack Bryan shine through because they write their own shit.
*  But it's very collaborative.
*  The country is hugely collaborative.
*  Sure.
*  Tennessee Whiskey, right?
*  Tennessee Whiskey was a song.
*  Oh, Chris Tableton.
*  Yeah.
*  But he didn't write it and came out.
*  I thought he did write it.
*  No, it came out.
*  I think he performed it.
*  Someone else wrote it.
*  Came out years before.
*  He wrote a lot for other people though, correct?
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah, I haven't even think, there's tons of songs like that.
*  They write for each other.
*  Yeah.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of those guys that like Chris Tableton made a living for a long time as
*  a writer because people looked at him like, come on, man, you ain't sexy.
*  Meanwhile, they were wrong.
*  And it's a smaller community, right?
*  The country music community.
*  And it does tend to get more crossover between musicians and writers, right?
*  I mean, a lot of them will start out, like you said, as writers.
*  There you go.
*  Tennessee Whiskey, a country song written by Dean Dillon and Linda Hargrove.
*  Yeah, David Allen Coe.
*  It was originally recorded by artist David Allen Coe for his album The Same Name, peaking
*  at number 77 in the Billboard Hot Country Singles in 1981.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  George Jones, 1983 version of the song was included on his album Shine On and reached
*  number two on the Hot Country Singles chart.
*  What great artist.
*  Did you hear that Randy Travis is using AI now to make new songs because he was paralyzed
*  by a stroke?
*  But because they could take his voice, which is an iconic voice, Randy Travis has an incredible
*  voice, but because of AI, they can get recordings of him singing and he could plug it into AI
*  and he can still make songs.
*  And you know how much of a recording they need nowadays to actually mimic the entire
*  range of a person's voice?
*  It's 30 seconds.
*  But less than that now.
*  Not that long ago it was 30 seconds.
*  Now you need a snippet and by a snippet I mean seconds.
*  And you can then mimic that voice through a range of emotions and scenarios.
*  It's stunning.
*  There was a guy who just got fired because he made a fake AI recording of a guy he worked
*  for saying a bunch of racist things.
*  And the guy, like everybody was attacking him, he got in trouble and then they somehow
*  another did an analysis on it.
*  The director did it to like the principal of the high school.
*  Right.
*  He's allowed to get fired.
*  So he's like, oh, instead of me getting fired, watch this.
*  Right.
*  He thought he's being slick.
*  But he's a dummy and he didn't know that they can tell.
*  They can analyze audio recordings and tell whether or not they're real.
*  How do they do that?
*  How can they tell?
*  Well, that one specifically, I think someone else was like, it was a conversation between
*  two people and they're both were like that.
*  I didn't hear that and I didn't say that.
*  So they're like, well, what could have happened?
*  I mean, I think they got the guy's computer to find out what he did.
*  So he must have had a secret recording and then in that secret recording he took it and
*  then threw it through AI and had him say a bunch of N words in there.
*  Yeah.
*  There's two aspects to this whole thing, right?
*  There's the detection portion of it, right?
*  Can you detect something like this is fake, whether it's audio, whether it's video, a
*  combination of both.
*  And then there's the other side of it, which is trying to stay up with the capabilities
*  of those that are trying to do these identity thefts or whatever you want to call it.
*  And that's sort of the proactive effort to lock down recordings, right?
*  And there's some interesting work being done in that space where if you film something,
*  say you go to a campaign rally and you film that campaign rally, there are a handful
*  of companies out there figuring out that you can essentially watermark it, right?
*  So that it cannot be fucked with, right?
*  And that you can determine if it's an actual recording or not.
*  And that's really, I mean, you think about how much disinformation is roiling around
*  out there now.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  But detection, it's important, but it's not enough anymore.
*  So where the focus has to be is on ensuring that anything that's being recorded, whether
*  it's a body cam for a police officer, whether it's maybe somebody's at a protest, right?
*  And they're a protester or they're on the other side, whatever, to be able to film something
*  and then ensure that it's accurate and true going forward, right?
*  That's a really important part because you can't, the detection side of it's important,
*  but it can't stay up with the developments of all the folks out there, all the criminal
*  elements and whether it's state sponsored or not, that's out there with this disinformation
*  effort.
*  So, I mean, it's a fascinating problem that people are getting duped constantly.
*  It's a fascinating problem that is only going to get worse.
*  As these new versions of AI get rolled out, it's going to be more and more difficult to
*  detect what's true and what's fake.
*  And people can do it on their computer so easy now.
*  This one of Biden, he's walking and he pauses to talk to people and they CGI shit like that
*  he's pooping himself.
*  I saw that.
*  The one where he kind of stops.
*  He's into that weird pause.
*  He's got a fart.
*  And you just see him poop himself.
*  And people are out there saying, look, that's a mid-stage dementia stance, right?
*  That's what they're saying now.
*  They're talking about that.
*  I don't know about that.
*  But look, there's...
*  Well, something's going on.
*  If you talk about just, what do they call it?
*  Face swap, right?
*  So they can take a photo of somebody now.
*  They can take a little snippet of somebody talking now.
*  And there are over a hundred apps out there readily available to anybody that can basically
*  do this face swap technology and put somebody else in there.
*  And criminal elements are doing it all the time.
*  So if I'm a fraudster and I send a note, say, to somebody in procurement, I say, hey, you
*  need to send a check for $100,000 to our vendor.
*  Here's the details.
*  Well, they might have protocols in place at the company.
*  Says, okay, well, first, this is a large transaction.
*  I better call the finance director or whomever.
*  They've got a way that they can figure out how to spoof all of that.
*  So you could be talking to whom you think is the finance director, but they'll actually
*  with the face swap technology that's available out there, right?
*  It's somebody having a conversation.
*  You think it's the finance director, but they're talking to you and completely different
*  person. Completely different person gets changed.
*  Their face gets changed to look exactly like you.
*  So I could use face swap technology that exists today.
*  And with all the recordings that we have of you from this show, oh, fuck, yeah, yeah,
*  100 percent, we can have you saying a bunch of shit that you never really said and some
*  shit that I probably did say.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  We've said a lot of shit.
*  Yeah, there's some shit.
*  But let me ask you this.
*  Like when they're doing this, all this face swap technology and all this different stuff,
*  like what what can be done to try to keep ahead of it to make sure like from a national
*  security perspective, like how do you how do you keep how do you know?
*  Right. There's a couple of parts to that.
*  Netanyahu all of a sudden has some crazy speech and says some wild shit and like we're going
*  to war like, hey, yeah, is that real?
*  Well, what they I mean, again, part of it is like this.
*  There's a handful of companies out there and they will they they're able to, again, record
*  and instantly as it does it, it embeds information and embeds specific time, location, you know,
*  and it'll all be in the recording.
*  And it's in there.
*  Right. And then it's sort of a block chain system where then on the other side, the person
*  can look and go, yeah, this is accurate.
*  This is correct.
*  Right.
*  But people have to be able to take that.
*  And that's, I guess, where I'm going with this.
*  People have to be able to to to take that step to ensure that what they're watching
*  is accurate.
*  So when people say, well, how do you how do you prevent this?
*  How do you keep this from happening?
*  The unsatisfactory answer to a large degree is it comes down to individual people.
*  Right.
*  Everybody has a big fucking responsibility now, more so than before, to understand what
*  they're looking at, listening to, watching.
*  Well, we're fucked.
*  We're fucked.
*  We are.
*  Well, now we're really fucked.
*  I don't want to I don't want to sound cynical.
*  Because there's just too many people that are concerned about Drake and Kendrick Lamar
*  and don't even know what's going on in Gaza.
*  They're much more concerned with that.
*  We have like a lot of eighty four IQ years out there bouncing around, walking into traffic.
*  Yeah.
*  Eighty four.
*  What is that average nowadays?
*  Or is that I don't even know.
*  I think it's 15 percent of the population is 84 and below.
*  Right.
*  Is that what it is?
*  Remember, we looked at 15 percent is whatever 100 plus and above.
*  What's the actual numbers?
*  Like, let's let's get a pie chart of IQs.
*  Yes.
*  It's a standard deviation thing for.
*  So you already I know that you're above 84 just because you said that.
*  Yeah, you said standard deviation.
*  Wow.
*  Any Googles would want him.
*  So like that's because Carl's being petted.
*  No matter what, almost no matter what thing you're trying to average out, they're most
*  always end up looking this way.
*  And 15 percent will always be bro.
*  What percentage?
*  Zero point one percent are fifty five and below.
*  Fuck.
*  Two percent of the population is 70.
*  Jesus.
*  Between 55 and 72 percent of the population and then 14 percent of the population is 85.
*  Yeah, but 34 percent below 100.
*  So most people are between 85 and 115.
*  And me, I'm in that sweet zone between 115 and 130.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Really?
*  That's that's impressive.
*  I suspect I'm to the left of that somewhere.
*  Yeah, I've never taken an IQ test.
*  I took one at two o'clock in the morning and I wasn't even awake.
*  I wanted to sit and I said, I should probably take some alpha brain and take this bitch
*  again and get fired up.
*  But I didn't.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I just want to know, was it really stupid?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, God, that's OK.
*  That's interesting.
*  So, you know, a lot of people hanging out in the 85, the one thing I don't think the
*  real issue with all this stuff, though, is emotional intelligence and social intelligence.
*  And there's people that are very brilliant people that I know that suck at those other
*  things and that's held them back in life.
*  So are you smart?
*  Are you really smart?
*  Your emotional intelligence sucks so hard.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Your ability to read social cues, your ability to form meaningful friendships suck so hard
*  that you know, you're you're isolated and nobody likes to be around you.
*  But you have a high IQ.
*  So I'm supposed to think that's good.
*  That seems dumb.
*  I mean, it works for some people, I suppose.
*  It doesn't, though.
*  Well, that's a recipe for an unhappy life.
*  That's stupid.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I mean, you never know.
*  You get you get somebody who's who they're a brilliant scientist and they just they have
*  very little social life.
*  Maybe they're happy in the science lab.
*  I don't know.
*  That's true.
*  But I agree.
*  Empathy is I mean, we try to work with our kids all the time on that.
*  Right.
*  I mean, you want a well rounded kid.
*  Our job is to raise not average children, but you want them to be well rounded.
*  And empathy, being able to read social cues, read a room.
*  That's that is super important.
*  My kids are all very kind.
*  And I love that.
*  It makes me very, very happy.
*  They're very kind.
*  They're kind to people.
*  They're kind to their friends.
*  They're kind to people.
*  They feel bad when someone's not doing well.
*  They're kind.
*  That means a lot.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm very happy they got that from us.
*  That is I think it's they get that from you.
*  They get that from probably more from Mrs.
*  Rogen.
*  I'm nice, though.
*  And I work real hard at it, too, because I don't have instincts to be nice.
*  My instincts are survival.
*  The fittest.
*  It's very hard to like put that aside.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I've been there a few times, but it always feels better when I do.
*  It is.
*  You know what?
*  And that's how kids learn to do it.
*  Right.
*  I mean, people always ask, you know, about with parenting.
*  Kids are watching from the time they're nuggets.
*  Right.
*  And they absorb shit.
*  And, you know, if you want your kid to be empathetic, you've got to demonstrate that.
*  You got to demonstrate kindness.
*  You got to demonstrate consideration.
*  Our boys, my daughter's great.
*  My daughter is is very good.
*  And our boys are our boys.
*  They're aggressive and competitive and all that.
*  But I think ours probably follow the traditional sort of multi-kid path.
*  Right.
*  So like the oldest boy is empathetic.
*  Right.
*  And kind and considerate.
*  The youngest boy is probably a savage.
*  Youngest boys, he's like the fucking mayor of party town.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Because he's got to deal with the older brothers.
*  Exactly.
*  He had to grow up quicker.
*  Yeah.
*  And the middle boy, he's usually better at things, too.
*  Yeah.
*  Actually, you know what?
*  He's he's as my wife says, who's the greatest person I know, she she calls him the sleeper.
*  Right.
*  Because he kind of comes in on the radar.
*  You don't expect him to be great at something.
*  And then he is.
*  Right.
*  Because he's been watching and he's pissed off and he wants to be better than his brothers.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  And then the middle boy is just like he's just like, fuck you.
*  Get out of my way.
*  You know, he's the basketball player.
*  He's down in his own IMG.
*  He's into his own thing.
*  And and he's he's a great kid.
*  But he's just like, this is what I'm going to do.
*  I don't know what you're doing or what you're doing.
*  But here's here's me.
*  He's got a focus.
*  Yeah.
*  That's because there's a lot of people around and realize you can't concentrate on other
*  people being happy.
*  Got to do what he wants.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  So it is.
*  I mean, it's I think that's not dynamic, right?
*  It is.
*  And you think about it and you think about they all grow up and people talk about this
*  all the time.
*  So it's nothing new.
*  But you know, kids grow up in the same environment.
*  And then they end up being so uniquely different.
*  So in ways different out of the box.
*  And boy, genetics plays a factor.
*  My God plays a factor.
*  And you realize that when you see your kids grow up and you see traits that like there
*  is no fucking way this is getting to you anyway other than genetics.
*  There's no way.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I mean, at a certain point, yeah, they start to take some influence from their
*  friends.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, and they.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  But by then, hopefully, you've kind of already set their whatever their moral compass.
*  Right.
*  And they know what they're supposed to do.
*  Maybe they stray off that path occasionally.
*  Right.
*  But for the most part, no, they I think you've got to you've got to set the parameters.
*  You got to set the course.
*  Kids, little little kids want to know what the hell is expected of them.
*  I'll tell you one thing reports from the front lines of kids in high school today that woke
*  shit out the window.
*  That word retard comes flying out of these kids' mouths.
*  They're bringing that back strong.
*  Yeah.
*  They are bringing that back strong.
*  Yeah.
*  I'll tell you that woke thing.
*  It got into college.
*  And then the high school kids, the ones coming up now, they are rejecting it.
*  I 100 percent agree with you.
*  And I know that because our youngest Muggsy is like 12 years old now.
*  And so he's in seventh grade.
*  And he was in the complete blast zone of woke.
*  Right.
*  And like the oldest one who's 16, he kind of had some of it.
*  The middle one, again, didn't care.
*  He was like, you know, fuck you.
*  You don't play ball.
*  So I'm not paying attention to you.
*  And but the youngest one was in a complete firing, you know, fire zone of this, this,
*  this woke culture.
*  And you'll never meet a more conservative sexist kid in your life because he's just
*  like, he'll come back and he'll tell us some stories from his school, which is a great
*  school, but it's, it's pretty woke.
*  It's pretty liberal.
*  Right.
*  And you got, you got kids walking around as furries.
*  You got a lot of multicolored hair.
*  You got all sorts of things going on there.
*  And he'll come back and tell us stories.
*  And he just say, I just don't understand what the hell's happened.
*  And so he works harder to sport.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what you get from a lot of people that work hard at sports, people that value hard
*  work and people that value hard work tend to be more conservative and more less inclined
*  to indulge people on their mental illness.
*  You know, oh, you're a cat.
*  No you're not.
*  You have cat ears on.
*  They don't even look like a cat.
*  You don't even have a good costume on.
*  Like you're not tricking people in the dark.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  You're just a cat.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't, yeah.
*  No, you're just 12 and really confused and I get it.
*  He came home one day and he said, he said some girl turned around dressed as a cat and
*  kicked him, right?
*  Because she thought he had pulled her tail.
*  And then apparently she hissed at him and walked away.
*  And he was like, I didn't fucking pull her tail.
*  Oh my God.
*  I don't want anything to do with her.
*  Yeah.
*  So she hissed at him.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  This is so indulgent.
*  That's so crazy.
*  You know what's interesting?
*  Tucker Carlson had a very good point when he talked about the difference between different
*  dysphoria's like body dysphoria for like anorexia versus gender dysphoria.
*  And he said, when a child has body dysphoria and they think they're fat, you don't tell
*  them, oh yeah, you are fat.
*  No, you help them.
*  You say, no, you're not fat.
*  This is just a mental disorder.
*  But when someone says, I'm a boy, you say, oh, you are a boy.
*  You don't say, no sweetie, your name is Dorothy.
*  Yeah.
*  This is crazy.
*  Dorothy.
*  Where did they come from?
*  Dorothy.
*  Are people still naming their kid Dorothy?
*  I don't think, I think, no.
*  Bring it back.
*  I think Dorothy, Carol.
*  Nobody names their kids Carol.
*  It's a beautiful name.
*  Those are beautiful names.
*  Dot.
*  That was the nickname for Dorothy was Dot.
*  I know that because I know a Dorothy.
*  That's right.
*  She goes by Dot.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  People are like, what the fuck?
*  How bizarre.
*  Dot.
*  God.
*  How bizarre.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a weird one.
*  So, but you're right.
*  It's the indulgence.
*  Fine.
*  Do what you want to do.
*  I don't need to go along with it.
*  I don't need to celebrate it.
*  I don't need to, you know, and that's, but that's what's expected.
*  It went past like maybe I'm, I'm a little bit different.
*  I'm going to go through a phase in life.
*  Now it's like, I'm going through a phase and you better fucking well accept it.
*  It's also there's celebrated.
*  There's like a value, a social value to having anxiety.
*  There's a social value to what you will call childhood trauma, you know, or social value
*  to like everybody has PTSD from like, it could be from like high school.
*  It could be like from minor stuff, but it's, it's looked at as, oh, we have to be, you
*  know, we have to be considered of someone's past.
*  Everybody's got trauma.
*  Everybody.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a part of life.
*  But the, the, the answer is not to overindulge every single aspect of everyone's ideas so
*  that you do let a kid wear a fucking tail and ears and run around the high school and
*  be a freak because like that's not good either.
*  Yeah.
*  That's not healthy.
*  Well, it's crazy.
*  It's not healthy and it's, and it's confusing for those kids too.
*  Right.
*  I mean, I honestly believe if you, if you address it properly, right.
*  And you, and you deal with it, it's long-term better health for that individual, right.
*  Which is what you want, right?
*  You want everybody wants that.
*  And you know, but we've, we've got, I don't know.
*  If you want to go to a, once you're a grown adult and you got your own job and you pay
*  for your own apartment, you want to go to a furry convention.
*  God bless you.
*  God bless you.
*  I just don't think you should be able to wear a fucking tail in school and hiss at people.
*  That just seems, that seems silly.
*  Yeah.
*  It seems silly.
*  Also, my friend's son goes to a school where you can't wear hats.
*  So you can't wear hats in class, but kids can wear like fucking duck ears or ducks on
*  their ears.
*  Like, don't they?
*  How do they hear?
*  They have, they're like, they don't stick out.
*  Okay.
*  I was coming up with a stupid animal for some reason.
*  Duck.
*  That's how you know I'm not invested in this idea.
*  I think a duck without ears would be a good looking duck.
*  You had fucking dog ears or cat ears or whatever the fuck you think you are.
*  A raccoon.
*  Stop.
*  Our boys school.
*  We can't wear hats either.
*  Our boys schools.
*  Yeah, they can't wear hats, but they can wear these stupid fucking ears is my point.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause it's like a headband, I guess.
*  Or, you know.
*  This time of year is a great time of year.
*  It's a great time of year because speaking of hats and everything is that this time of
*  year is crew cut, flat top season.
*  So the youngest one, Muggsy, went ahead the other day and got himself a buzz cut.
*  It's nice.
*  We used to go, all my brothers and I, we knew it was, summer was approaching when my dad
*  would say, okay, there we go.
*  We had a home clipper kit.
*  There was something great about that flat top, that crew cut.
*  And so anyway, he's got his crew cut going on and I suspect he's the only one in this
*  entire school that's got this.
*  And it's a good look for him.
*  And it also, again, I think there's so much happening in the school in terms of the way
*  kids are, what's the word I'm looking for, coddled.
*  I feel proud about Muggsy because he comes walking into school and there's no mistake
*  in this kid is not angsty.
*  He's not worried about anything.
*  He's got the crew cut going on.
*  This is a very unique challenge for these kids to get through this bullshit and come
*  out of the other end.
*  Understanding that no one's coming to save you.
*  You're responsible for yourself and life and you got to get after it.
*  You got to actually do something.
*  If you want a successful, happy life, you have to be engaged in some sort of a pursuit,
*  something that you enjoy, whatever the fuck it is, find it, go for it.
*  Hard work is important.
*  The world really does operate on a meritocracy except in corrupt situations.
*  But it's also battlefield for these kids.
*  The minefield is probably a better way to put it.
*  Yes, you've got the kids, you want them to do all those things.
*  Play sports, be involved in hobbies, activities, whatever it is, stay busy, focus on your grades,
*  be balanced, be nice to people.
*  But they're walking through this minefield.
*  Every day there's a potential for them to upset somebody who's looking to be upset.
*  I'm talking about 12, 13, 14, 15-year-old kids who are looking to be insulted and very
*  quickly use the system that's been put in place, which caters to them.
*  My boys have run afoul of that system a couple of times for maybe speaking their mind.
*  Maybe not calling someone a them, addressing someone as a plural.
*  One of my kids went to school with a they them.
*  This girl wore makeup and dresses, but she said she was non-binary and she would get
*  upset if someone didn't call her a they or a them.
*  How old at the time?
*  11, 12?
*  Oh, God.
*  12?
*  12 I guess.
*  What the fuck, man?
*  Were you worried about that sort of thing when you were 11 years old?
*  I didn't even know it was a thing.
*  I don't think I realized it was a thing until I was 50.
*  I never heard of non-binary.
*  I would imagine that there are people that are asexual.
*  They're not interested in physical affection.
*  They're probably on the spectrum.
*  God bless you.
*  Is that what non-binary means?
*  No, but that's like asexual.
*  Asexual, I get.
*  When you say you're not a boy or a girl, okay, if you were a puppy and I wanted a boy puppy
*  or a girl puppy, which one would you be?
*  I know you're not a puppy.
*  This is the thing with the Supreme Court justice with Katanji Brown Jackson, who said she's
*  not a biologist.
*  They asked her, what is a woman?
*  She said, I'm not a biologist.
*  Right, but you're a woman.
*  So how about take a shot at it?
*  If I brought you a puppy, how do you know if it's a boy dog or a girl dog?
*  Can we use that same judgment for humans?
*  Is that possible?
*  Isn't it true in the majority of cases that a woman has ovaries and a vagina and they
*  can have babies for the most part?
*  Yeah, for the most part.
*  Just try to watch people lose their minds, try asking somebody like that, is there a
*  difference between a man and a woman?
*  To a Supreme Court justice 20 years ago.
*  Imagine if Ruth Bader Ginsburg 20 years ago, somebody asked her, she would go, shut the
*  fuck up with these stupid questions.
*  I'm here on the goddamn Supreme Court to get shit done, okay?
*  I'm not here to hear, what did you ask me?
*  What a woman is.
*  Why didn't you ask me what paint is?
*  Now ask me what tires are.
*  Now have a bunch of other shit.
*  What's a pencil?
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  What are we doing?
*  But it's university administrators.
*  It's anybody in a position of leadership who's afraid of getting bullied, right?
*  And so nobody wants to state the obvious.
*  We went through the whole pandemic with one side screaming, believe the science, right?
*  And now they're like, well, I know, it depends on the context of whether a man and a woman
*  are different.
*  Look, you can, again, do whatever you want to do.
*  But if you're a girl, but you identify as a boy, then you're a girl identifying as a
*  boy and vice versa, right?
*  That doesn't seem complicated to me.
*  Also, if you want us to trust the science, you got to make the science trustworthy.
*  You can't leave the science in the hand of corporations that stand to profit if the science
*  reflects one thing or the other.
*  You can't do that because they do it, they've done it forever.
*  They've been fined for it.
*  You know they do it.
*  You know it's standard practice.
*  You know that they run multiple tests and multiple studies and they'll throw out the
*  ones that don't show any positive results and they finagle the studies to show some
*  kind of fugazi positive thing and then they'll start prescribing it to people.
*  And they do it for money.
*  You know they do it for money.
*  Everybody knows they do it for money.
*  So shut the fuck up about this science thing until you can sort the science out, until
*  you know the science.
*  So unless you have a third party, non-biased, where there's not a revolving door between
*  the government organization and the pharmaceutical drug companies, which we know there is.
*  And we know that they know there is, so we know that they know where the fucking bread
*  is buttered and they know how to get things through and then looky-doo, he works for Moderna
*  now.
*  Looky-doo.
*  Eli Lilly.
*  Oh my God, look.
*  Looky-doo.
*  Glaxo Smith Klein just hired him.
*  You know, I mean look, everybody should make money.
*  I'm glad pharmaceutical drug companies exist.
*  They make awesome stuff.
*  But you gotta be honest and don't hit me with that trust the science shit if you haven't
*  made the science trustworthy.
*  Stop.
*  Yeah, and it also can't be a moving line.
*  Right?
*  Either you do or you don't.
*  Right?
*  And it can't be based on where you fall politically, right?
*  Which seems to be how it works, right?
*  And so it's a whenever it's a...
*  We trust some science, just not chromosome.
*  Yeah, it's very subjective.
*  Very subjective.
*  Yeah.
*  I wanted to ask you this before I forget.
*  When you were working for the agency, did you guys...
*  I know that there is a program where they use special effects makeup to change someone's
*  appearance.
*  Have you ever seen that in person?
*  Oh, yes.
*  How does it look?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it gets better all the time.
*  So, have I got a concert?
*  Like, could I sneak into a concert with a rubber nose?
*  Yeah.
*  Get me a nice blonde wig.
*  That's what we used to do.
*  We hand out rubber noses and googly eyes.
*  Then nobody would see us coming.
*  Like Clark Kent.
*  Yeah.
*  No, we have a disguise unit at the agency and I'm super proud of them.
*  And I was the benefit of their expertise on numerous occasions because you might guess,
*  I mean, I spent almost all my time with the agency overseas in operations and there's
*  some places where I don't blend.
*  Crazy.
*  I know.
*  So, they blended you just like on Team America World, please?
*  Remember?
*  Yes.
*  Bro, try to make sure that guy...
*  One of the greatest.
*  Hans Breiks.
*  Hans Breiks.
*  How good is that movie?
*  Yeah, that's the greatest movie ever.
*  They're the best.
*  Trey Parker, Matt Stone are the fucking best.
*  Oh my God.
*  When they did the puppet sex...
*  Matt Stone and Trey Parker.
*  Did I switch their names?
*  Yeah.
*  Matt...
*  Yeah.
*  The puppet sex scene.
*  The puppet sex scene when they thought, okay, a few minutes of this is making people uncomfortable.
*  Let's keep going with it.
*  Right?
*  Well, you know, the original is far longer.
*  Yeah.
*  The original is she poops on his chest or he poops on her chest and she pees on him or
*  he pees on her.
*  God, they're brilliant.
*  Look at this guy.
*  Muhammad Jihad.
*  Muhammad Jihad.
*  Muhammad Jihad.
*  Muhammad Jihad.
*  Muhammad Jihad.
*  Muhammad Jihad.
*  Muhammad Jihad.
*  Muhammad Jihad.
*  Muhammad Jihad.
*  Muhammad Jihad.
*  Muhammad Jihad.
*  Muhammad Jihad.
*  Muhammad Jihad.
*  Oh shit.
*  Come on, Gary.
*  Act.
*  Act.
*  You have the power.
*  Bark.
*  Dirk Dirk-a-la.
*  Dirk-a-Dirk-a.
*  Muhammad Jihad.
*  Haka Sherpa Sherpa.
*  Abak-a-la.
*  Man, this is taking me... this takes me back.
*  He's an actor, bro.
*  God, it's so good.
*  He saved them.
*  He saved them being an actor.
*  One of the greatest...
*  Yeah.
*  That really...
*  operational days too. Such an amazing movie. Yeah the disguise unit is fantastic and
*  okay so here's John Mendes yeah. So this is from the disguise unit? Wow. She was there she was uh
*  you know senior officer there. Did you ever were you ever talking to someone? You know I think
*  this motherfucker's wearing her disguise. No but I've talked to people wearing disguises. I've had
*  the full overhead masks. Look how good that is with sunglasses on. With sunglasses on that's crazy. I
*  never did wear the uh the monkey outfit. Yeah we didn't do that one. But look how good that looks.
*  Yeah. That's insane. Now and here's the thing about this is it because what they did was they
*  went they went to Hollywood um and there's been this this liaison for years years and years between
*  the agency and Hollywood when it comes to special effects when it comes to makeup
*  and again and it's horses for courses so sometimes you need a light disguise right. I'm not giving
*  away any secrets. This is stuff is all out there and so you know you get a light disguise it's for
*  a brief you know cover for action you know there's not you're not going to be engaged in it. So what
*  would be a what would be a light disguise? You know like a rubber nose. Yeah it could be it could
*  be like a wig it could be you know facial hair, a change of glasses, could be just a change of hair
*  color. In reality if you're out on the street I know I'd probably disappear down a rabbit hole
*  and people would be like oh this is fucking boring but if you're out on the street and you're just
*  you're in a surveillance exercise say right and you're covering a target then all you got to do
*  is you're just talking about switching up your your look a little bit. It could be a hat right
*  it could be a coat it could be a backpack whatever you're doing so it doesn't have to be much and
*  then you got the full other side of the spectrum which could be a full overhead mask right which is
*  that's a process right you got I mean it's it's just like with Hollywood I mean there's no
*  difference and the key is when you're out on the street and you're in disguise nobody is thinking
*  that person's in disguise right so it's dependent upon your bearing. I've seen people in disguise who
*  who don't pull it off well right because they they're worried like oh I'm in disguise people
*  are thinking I'm in disguise nobody gives a shit everybody's worried about their own little bubble.
*  So it's your your body movements and your body language. Right it's your it's your bearing how
*  do you how do you comport yourself how do you how do you carry yourself are you confident in it
*  and also do you understand that the vast majority of people out there no matter where you are right
*  fourth world country US wherever they're not thinking about it right and I've had extended
*  conversations with people in disguise where you know they don't they don't give a fuck they don't
*  know and it's it is remarkable how good they are at this but that unit is fantastic. Did it give you
*  like a rubber muscle suit ever? No I never got a fat suit no but I know one of the guys I worked
*  with he got a fat suit. Really? Yeah yeah yeah Chase's weight because that's that's also one of
*  those things where you know you you're looking to right I mean you're just looking to alter your
*  profile and weight is a big part of it. And what does the fat suit entail is it like a skin one
*  where it looks real or is it just like mostly it's under your clothes right and so it's like a
*  it's padding basically but it's quick you have to be able to do this quickly look I've been on the
*  streets of you know capital cities around the world where I'm on a motorcycle and you know I've
*  got I've got a helmet on that's a pretty good disguise but you got to get off that motorcycle
*  at some point and walk the streets or go somewhere whatever and so you've got to be able to do these
*  things quickly right or you're so again not not giving away any sources or methods but I will say
*  the disguise unit and and Mrs. Mendez there who they just showed briefly she ran that operation
*  to a great person and a great a great part of the agency and it is but it is acting right there's
*  no different. So did this was going to get to did they teach you how to walk casual they teach you
*  what to see in someone that's tense? Well yeah I mean you you spend a lot of time yeah yeah you do
*  that's a good way to put it I guess you you spend a lot of time observing people right and and
*  understanding and and part of that is you're trying to get a sense of if you're trying to
*  get a sense of whether they're lying you're watching for certain things you're watching
*  for their their body movement and the way they're behaving and the things that they're saying a lot
*  of times they're just they're they're not consistent with what they're saying so that's
*  not necessarily you know watching their movements but a lot of times if you're trying to get on
*  side with somebody right so if I'm if I'm trying to develop a relationship with the deputy foreign
*  minister of whatever from some country right because they've got inside information on their
*  nuke program then I'll spend a lot of time thinking about and watching and observing
*  that person and eventually I'm mirroring that person's activities right so you know if you're
*  sitting across from somebody and and and they they lean on the desk right and they start talking
*  to you they move in a little bit closer well I'm gonna do the same thing I'm gonna come in it they
*  don't know it they don't understand it but it it makes them more comfortable right so if you start
*  mirroring their their actions their activities that's just one of those things it's a it's a
*  small part of it but it's one of my buddy told me that when you see people like leaning against a
*  wall that we see people in foreign countries leaning against a wall nine times out of ten
*  they're american like what leaning like one shoulder against the wall he said it's a very
*  american thing to do like lean against doorways with one shoulder leaning against a wall with one
*  shoulder yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't make a lot of book on that I mean because you know it it's a
*  western thing more than just an american thing I've seen you know I'd spent a long time in
*  Europe and you know Italians will lean against the wall Spaniards are leaning against the wall
*  but it is a western thing so you know if you're walking the streets of Vladivostok or wherever
*  then you have to be aware of it also little things like how you eat right how do you hold
*  your fork and knife I mean it could be it could be anything that could you know show out as a
*  certain cultural handle so way that's different people hold their fork well you know if you hold
*  your like if you hold your knife here and you hold your fork here right and you just keep eating
*  with this hand you don't switch the the fork over to your your dominant hand right that's an
*  interesting take and and I mean like if you're over in the UK you see it all the time right people
*  just kind of eating like this right pushing pushing their food onto their fork 15 things
*  that stand out Americans are known for leaning on things while standing still aha aha this is
*  a habit the CIA even trains aha if CIA trains Americans to unlearn when trained to be a spy
*  don't worry we could still stand out on our own two feet Americans are always eating on the go
*  one person living in Europe was asked if America if they were American because they were eating a
*  bagel while walking hey we got to fuel up for all that small talk Americans are known for being
*  loud and friendly and our accents are a dead giveaway yeah that's okay Americans love small
*  talk and are super friendly okay Americans are known for wanting ice in their water a habit that
*  might seem as strange in countries where ice is not commonly consumed Americans often greet people
*  with hey how are you the greeting may be seen as too friendly or even mocking in some cultures
*  Americans are known for leaving tips are they okay yeah yeah that's true Americans have a reputation
*  for being confident okay even if you're walking in the wrong direction Americans are known for
*  enjoying sweet treats for breakfast a habit that may be seen as strange in other cultures where
*  breakfast is typically a savory meal Americans are often seen as being obsessed with their appearance
*  and constantly checking their appearance in mirrors it's because we're the shit Americans are known
*  for wearing tactical sunglasses a style that we've seen is unusual in other countries okay
*  Americans are known for saying y'all okay okay Americans are known for the love of baseball caps
*  yeah especially when worn backwards Americans are in love for the the love of saying the us or
*  America when asked if they're from even though these terms refer to the entire country Americans
*  are known for their friendly grins and making eye talk okay yeah yeah basically just leaning
*  against the wall thing that seems odd yeah yeah um yeah that's interesting but I yeah I've seen a
*  lot of leaners in my time yeah so but yeah those all those things it's good to be aware of but um
*  you were saying with the fork and knife thing that the Europeans keep a fork in one hand and
*  knife or other they cut and they don't switch hands yeah what people switch hands um I've seen
*  that a lot here in the states where people like they'll eat you'll you'll you'll cut you'll put
*  down you'll eat and maybe it's just because I hang around with a lot of posh people I don't know yeah
*  they seem like ditches yeah they'll sound like that's a I'm not saying I'm not saying they're
*  not your left hand sucks so hard that you have to swap out swap out yeah you're scared of the
*  force I think it's considered very uh etiquette also you're a bitch for not being able to cut
*  your food with your left hand too I know both those things you make you a bitch it's just a
*  lot easier if you also if you just kind of push you're pushing around right there like that and
*  but then again you know you could do it if you want to eat quick you got a two-hand thing so
*  yeah this magazine here that says that that's an American style apparently to hold the fork in your
*  dominant hand and switch so yeah that's the bitches of America so let's say for a steak for
*  instance oh look there's even pictures there's pictures to explain this to us how you cut to
*  it yeah zigzag style or something so fork goes back and forth now let's take a close look at
*  the details this is ridiculous actually that guy that guy holding it like a dagger looks like my
*  boy's eating I bet that dude's very boring in real life or a serial killer yeah or or an etiquette
*  teacher yeah either one so uh but they just the disguise thing is is fascinating and I've been
*  like I said I mean sometimes it can be very simple you you slap on I know it sounds silly if you slap
*  on a fake mustache but you're just changing your profile quickly right and and so it doesn't I will
*  say there were times when you'd get a disguise kit and it would have a baseball cap in it and go
*  I don't I don't think so I think because we're over season probably not a baseball cap yeah so
*  who's putting together these disguise kits for you it's the I mean the the outfit again it's the
*  disguise unit and the disguise unit isn't aware of cultural differences oh no they are but I'm
*  just saying in the old days I'm fairly old but in the old days they'd throw in a ball cap and you
*  think right okay well you're giving it up yeah so um but yeah hey what do I know um so is there any
*  video of people wearing these disguises where we could see what they look like I found another
*  video I was trying to I didn't want to I want to see what it looks like yeah I'm gonna see okay
*  because I saw one on Instagram but I don't know if it's real and wired same lady I think here she
*  transforms probably like the reporter yeah just imagine again and what are you doing you're
*  so here's this lady right they gave her a mustache they gave her some wacky hair
*  wow that's incredible
*  I don't know she tricked me no no what's going on that one's not that one's not the best one
*  it's not the best but that's then then that's also then they brought up the fork and knife in
*  the video which is interesting boy they love that fork and knife thing holding a cigarette comes up
*  in the video and how you hold a cigarette yeah it's very quick here they just show like
*  like the way you either between the fingers forward like that is that American pinching it
*  and who pinches it I don't know I've seen people here pinch it so I don't
*  yeah then it shows a guy doing a very quick thing like people that pinch it here they're
*  probably like European music that goes from a suit to just like taking it off putting on a hat and
*  now he's in disguise seeing it can be that simple right I mean it's and particularly if you're in
*  surveillance or you know or if you're doing you know counter surveillance you got to be aware of
*  these things did you see that I had a guest on the podcast that came with my friend Josh Dubin works
*  with criminal reform and getting innocent people out of jail so we had this guest that came on and
*  then after he was on the show one up killing somebody cut some dude's head off and yes yes
*  yes um and the unfortunate surveillance footage where he tried to wear a blonde wig and walk
*  around yeah but he didn't realize I think he didn't realize like how good modern surveillance
*  cameras are yeah it's like crystal clear that this dude was wearing a fucking wig yeah yeah that was
*  um yeah it's a hell of a story crazy story I was trying to explain that to my daughter last night
*  this is what happened oh god yeah that's that's interesting you know that that video that you just
*  showed because I I uh there's been some talk about the protests on campus right and the fact that all
*  these all these outside agitators activists and then the students the the actual students the ones
*  that are actually affiliated with the university most of them are wearing masks right right and
*  you know I part of it is I don't know it's they're they have mentally ill yeah they're mentally ill
*  it's a I photograph people every time I see them I photographed one today yeah saw somebody walking
*  outside with a mask on the dumb kind too the surgical blue stupid one yeah oh yeah that doesn't
*  do a goddamn thing but this was I think was was a solidarity thing they're all wearing masks and
*  part of it was also I think they were thinking they couldn't be identified and then there's a
*  lot of talk about retinal scanning right so how much of the face do you need in order to identify
*  people right and it's not much right retinal scanning it's not 100 accurate so there's other
*  things you have to do so would you be able to retinal scan that lady with that crazy outfit on
*  yeah yeah it's just retinal scanner and then no that shit would work the mustache which is which
*  is and that's yeah that's a great point glue on your face for nothing yeah and that shit is tough
*  to take off it's not good so uh yeah and that's that's a it's a really good point because now it's
*  made the life of of somebody who's working uh in operations a lot tougher right because of the
*  ability of and it's got to be a country where you're operating where they've got the resources and
*  the technology but it makes it a shit ton tougher to get away with things right and as does the
*  ability for communications intercepts and tracking of phones and all the other things so you know
*  while you know it's it's always the same story right technology it's got an upside and a downside
*  but the the face recognition the retinal scanning it's creating all sorts of problems from an
*  operational perspective overseas and here of course the problem is you know people are talking
*  about civil liberties and you know invasion of privacy and you know so you've got some students
*  out there and they they're covered and next thing you know they're identified right now they're
*  suspended and you know i fine you you know you not only that's some of them aren't getting to
*  graduate this one girl i was watching this video where they were they just told her she couldn't
*  graduate because she got arrested well you know what you you what are they say you play stupid
*  games yeah you win stupid prizes yeah so they all think they're doing something great they think
*  they're going to fix it it's it's you know a lot of misplaced energy with tents with tents yeah and
*  with with matching tents and um and that's that's the part look i again you know hey god bless the
*  the actual students who are out there feeling like they're being a part of something i get that
*  they're young people most of them are gormelists right they're just saying whatever right this is
*  you know this is their moment to shine so they're excited so they don't and they you know most of
*  them couldn't find gaza on a map of gaza so i think that you know that's that's one side of it right
*  and i can't you know whatever but it's the it's the coordination of it all by the various outside
*  groups and the activists and the funding of it right and the potential for that funding and the
*  coordination to tie back to groups like hamas or hasbullah which basically means you're tying back
*  to the iranian regime right because they that's the only reason those groups exist but nobody
*  seems curious about that because a lot of the media wanted to portray this as just like kids
*  being kids oh look at this is their moment to shine as as student activists and isn't it wonderful
*  and it's their vietnam protests and and bullshit some of it okay fine so it's layered right so
*  some of that's true you got those kids that are just doing that but there's the incuriosity of
*  the media to say well what the hell's behind this right and what groups is it is it uh you know
*  students for justice in palestine is it um you know us campaign for palestinian rights sammy dune
*  right which has connections back to hamas um there's a education for whatever just peace in
*  the middle east there's groups that have been actively engaging in this and that's why you get
*  the coordination of all of this right it's like but nobody asks okay what's behind it just students
*  active no it's not it's it's a coordinated effort and then you look at those groups who are always
*  active in this in this realm right and always looking to uh have organizations disinvest from
*  israel or to uh you know uh promote causes that are anti-israeli right and then you say okay well
*  who's funding it right so you look at these groups and you say okay where's the money coming from
*  the money's always coming from the same places right the the tide center right which is part of
*  the tides network which gets significant funding no surprise from soros's uh open society foundation
*  um you get uh westchester people's whatever action coalition um so you get these groups and
*  you get the legal support so all these people the activists who are getting arrested they can turn
*  to palestine legal which provides legal support to the activists and the ngo's that are engaged in
*  all this again you get they're getting their money from charities a lot of times the charities don't
*  know they're putting money into these groups right it goes into the rockefeller brothers fund
*  right and the rockefeller brothers fund provides money to these ngo's you know like justice for
*  you know palestine or whatever and then uh and and rockefeller brothers gets you know funding from
*  uh so open society foundation as well that guy that guy right well yeah and now his kid is even
*  more of an activist than george is right of course kid is yeah kid inherited it kid inherited it
*  make up for the fact that he inherited it by being extra woke yeah and he is and extra guilty
*  god for having all those billions you should feel guilty yeah yeah exactly yeah how can you live
*  with yourself young soros what you're talking about though is a very important point that this
*  is not organic and that this is this is what i was going to get to earlier when i was talking about
*  social media how much do you think foreign governments have an influence on certain trends
*  and certain things that people are talking and promoting and pushing and being a part of on
*  social media because i think it's a i think it's a big factor i think it's a big factor with a lot
*  of things and i think it's a big factor with all this the most insane woke shit i think they push
*  it as far as they can so that the stuff that's not as insane that was insane just a couple years
*  ago seems less insane now it seems more palatable and then they just keep moving the goalpost
*  i think you can do that through social media with kids you can kind of engineer what kids accept
*  oh 100 and and the the answer is yeah how much do they do they do a tremendous amount right look um
*  the iranian regime nobody's happier with these protests on campuses than the iranian regime
*  right and they've even come out the foreign minister um khamenei himself right the ayatollah
*  came out on his official x page yeah who knew and uh praises the protesters and they talk about the
*  oppression that the and the violent tactics of the police right and suppressing protests which is
*  which is crazy when you think about what the iranian regime has done to anybody who dares protest
*  inside iran yeah they executed a world champion wrestler over that they did that constantly
*  right and they're they're trampling of all rights not just women's rights everybody's rights right
*  so so it's bullshit but people you know i don't know people buy it i don't know how they have a
*  peripheral understanding of the workings yeah so the inner workings of all this stuff but then
*  the russians and the chinese they're all taking advantage of this as well right chinese bots have
*  been out there trolling around and and promoting um the chaos right if you were to switch on uh
*  television right in in moscow or in taiwan or or in beijing you'll get a lot of coverage of these
*  campus protests right this is this is ideal for them it's exactly what they want and it feeds into
*  their larger narrative of trying to um discredit democracy and say what a what a losing system it
*  is right capitalism and so you know but but again people are in curious they're busy they're trying
*  to just do their lives whatever they're not taking the time to sit and think where am i
*  getting my information from what's the validity of this information and if they don't do that
*  you know then to your earlier point yeah we're fucked yeah because it comes down to individual
*  responsibility you gotta focus on where your information is coming from and you know right now
*  um you know you could argue i mean that that whether it's the face swapping techniques whether
*  it's ai that that can mimic and whether it's for criminal purposes or whether it's for state
*  sponsored efforts to try to to to uh put the knife in into the american system or or the west
*  you know we are it's democratized misinformation right it's made it so that everybody can engage
*  in it not just state sponsors but everybody because all those apps are out there all the
*  abilities out there and you've got an incurious public for the most part that that doesn't take
*  the time and an unformed public they did most of them are not even aware that there's foreign
*  elements that have an influence on our culture yeah which is which is shocking if you think about
*  it right shocking but so few people are aware of anything other than what's going on in their own
*  life and what's going on at work well life is messy and it's tough and you're trying to raise
*  kids and and you know you're trying to put food on the table you don't have time and i talked to
*  some of my friends about this stuff and their eyes glaze over yeah they don't even want to
*  yeah i'm busy bro yeah but you know what it does it i mean look at look at the state of look how
*  dysfunctional we are right now right i mean this is this is remarkable you know at times and again
*  everybody wants to think it's always the worst time right it's not the worst time right we've
*  had worst times civil war i think was pretty bad um you know so we've had more dysfunction i suppose
*  at times but the technology speeds it along right and and and and you know we just have more people
*  so the potential for more of a shit show is there but um that is ultimately when people always talk
*  about well how do you how do you you can't you can't just use detection you can't be on the
*  defensive all the time trying to identify okay that's fake that's fake that's fake right you've
*  got to rely on people right to say ah you know what i'm not going to buy everything i read right
*  i'm going to pay attention and i'm going to think about it a little bit and i'm going to i'm going to
*  chill the fuck out and but it's not it's not in human nature apparently right now so yeah we've
*  got a problem and those nations particularly iran china and russia are having a field day right now
*  right this is we are making it very easy for them and think about it we got the fucking election
*  coming up in november yeah so think about what that means in terms of disinformation and it's
*  yeah it's it's remarkable we we live in a very interesting time i think we're going to be fine
*  it's a very resilient environment i suppose but so i try to be positive but it's fraught with peril
*  yeah yeah well let me ask you this from a perspective if someone kind of understands
*  all these different influences and all the things that are happening in these universities
*  what can be done to sort of like unwind some of this fuckery if anything at this point i mean
*  are we just gonna operate from here on out with this understanding that our kids getting
*  indoctrinated to this preposterous ridiculous way of thinking where they're taught these marxist
*  leninist ideas as if they make any fucking sense and they've ever worked anywhere and if they don't
*  always lead to totalitarian authoritative governments that take over and enforce all
*  these socialist policies which is a fucking nightmare that happens in every single regime
*  when they go socialism yeah so what can be done to sort of like unwind some of this bullshit in
*  colleges and balance it out a little bit like there's nothing wrong with having ridiculous ideas
*  as long as those ridiculous ideas can be challenged but if you're the only one that gets to talk
*  right and you just indoctrinate these kids and no one comes along and says hey you've never even
*  functioned in the fucking real world like this shit that you're teaching these kids unless they
*  go into academia they're fucked yeah or you're gonna ruin corporations with this ideology because
*  it just it doesn't jive with capitalism it doesn't jive with and oh yeah we're gonna tear capitalism
*  down okay well then what you fucking idiots then no one has any incentive to get anything done
*  well that's great for you because you've never done anything yeah so you think all these people
*  that did things even if you don't agree with them even if it's bill gates he still built that fucking
*  company that's his he did it do you want to be that guy then go do what he did if you don't like
*  what he did then you know you can talk about it you can protest about the idea that you should
*  everyone should have to give all their money away and there should be no billionaires there should
*  be no capitalism and all the money goes into and then who who's in charge and who gets to tell you
*  what you can do and not do who gets to tell you you can't have your money anymore who gets to take
*  your house away because it's too big shut the fuck up right this is like so short-sighted and
*  so stupid that it's so hard for me to believe that it's being taught in universities right or
*  the the idea now what they're saying is like you got a big house you got a couple extra rooms you
*  know what you should do yeah taking these fucking migrants yeah taking some murderers yeah that we
*  haven't we haven't bothered to vet that guy with a 13-tap dude on his forehead bring him in yeah
*  he's fine he's a nice guy he's trying to clean his life up that's why he walked here yeah and the
*  border's fine don't worry about it it's all good it's fine it's only like 20 percent chinese
*  that are of military age no that's the staggering number the staggering number of chinese have come
*  across the border in the past six months it's why it is it is fascinating because you think
*  what accounts for that increase they want to learn mma yeah yeah these are the best gyms a lot of
*  even the chinese champions that come over here to train really yeah so maybe that accounts for
*  what 20 000 of the no 26 000 yeah 30 30 those guys are future lma stars future ufc stars but i mean
*  you look at the universities and think yeah university is supposed to be a place where you
*  exchange ideas so that's great you want to talk about you want to have classes in in in
*  in marxism or whatever you want to that's great but you you're right you need to have that discourse
*  you need to be you know i again i keep reverting back to examples of the you know real world and
*  from my own experience you know my daughter went to undergrad and grad school and she kept her
*  mouth shut for most of that time right six years because she always knew as she said there was no
*  upside to her arguing in class right you know and she's a centrist right she's in that but that's
*  not popular either no you can't be a centrist on campus no because you can't say there's good
*  ideas on both sides so i know just fuck that they are not yeah terrible so so yeah so she she went
*  through school and that's that's a terrible thought yeah right particularly when you're paying for it
*  but she's she worked out fine she's great but she and she understood a joke right she got the joke
*  but it shouldn't be there right you shouldn't have to decipher that for four years you shouldn't
*  have to like oh let me put this through the bullshit filter right okay let me just get through this
*  class and figure out what's applicable and what i need for my degree yeah but unless you know i do
*  think there's there's some bounce back on on the corporate side with dei for example right i think
*  there are a number of companies out there just as with the sort of the climate you know change you
*  know i've watched i've watched oil companies like do this complete left turn saying we're gonna you
*  know we're gonna make a over half of our revenues from green energy in the future near future like
*  a couple of years from now and you think like it's not gonna happen but they have to play that game
*  for a while and then they come back and go it's not gonna happen so you know what we're doing
*  we're investing in all of this shit including fossil fuels so i think whether it's that or
*  whether it's the kind of the pushback on dei from corporations that are saying um you know maybe it
*  is a grift right maybe you've got all these dei grifters out there and they got it it's a cottage
*  industry they can make a lot of money off of this bullshit get a lot of government grants and all
*  this things so but i think there's some pushback universities i think are a tougher issue yeah
*  i don't think unless unless parents and kids just say i'm not going to that bullshit i mean look have
*  you seen some of these kids at these supposedly elite universities talk how the fuck did they get
*  into these universities because they must have passed at the application process is just really
*  about talking yeah yeah yeah could be well i i think you know you basically have to just memorize
*  what they're teaching you that's that doesn't require a lot of critical thinking yeah and then
*  when you have to think on your own and say what is from the river to the sea mean yeah what river
*  are we talking about what does that mean yeah what sea are we talking about and what does that mean
*  yeah what happens to the jews that live there where do they go they go back to germany yeah like what
*  are you saying that's an interesting um it's an interesting phrase i will say that you know it
*  you talk about kamas and the israeli conflict now and it's i mean there's there's a minefield here
*  actually one of my one of my managing directors for uh for my company portman square group for
*  all your information and security needs thank you um one of the managing directors said knew that i
*  was i was gonna sit back down with you and they said look i know you're probably gonna want to
*  talk about kamas is there any way you can do it right without pissing off people and that's cute
*  yeah i know that's what i thought right so you want me to talk about the israeli you know
*  palestinian issue without upsetting somebody yeah i don't think and she's a brilliant person
*  but i don't i don't think that's going to happen but i will say it is it's obviously it's complex
*  but it's complex in part because it's not absolute right and and everybody talks in absolutes when it
*  comes to this right it's it's it's it's kamas is and it's a palestinian kamas is a terrorist
*  organization so fuck them but it's a palestinian problem or it's the israeli problem you know what
*  if you look at their history right there's problems on both sides right and no and and yet we talk
*  about it like it's black and white and one or the other right and you're never going to get this
*  problem is never probably going to get solved in our lifetimes anyway but it is it is disturbing
*  when you hear some of the kids the actual students i mean try to explain what this is right and what
*  this problem is and and talk to me about the river to the sea which again you can say that phrase
*  you know in in in in 10 different circumstances it's going to be 10 different things to 10
*  different people right and that's legitimate you have to understand that that's okay i get it the
*  israelis view that is like you're you're talking for a destruction genocide of of israelis right
*  because that's a destruction of a group right not not a war crime or something not crime against
*  humanity genocide is your intent is to destroy the group right and so they they'll see that
*  palestinians some palestinians not kamas kamas has it in their charter they know what river to the
*  sea means right it's it's you know it's taking over that entire territory and you know fuck
*  israelis but palestinians can say it and it means something else it's a yearning for whatever
*  freedom for a homeland for it so there are variances in it but that never gets discussed
*  sometimes because people are just screaming at each other like every other fucking subject out
*  there right that and that is the issue right yeah and and then of course when you are on a college
*  campus and all this is being encouraged by these groups that are funded yes then you seem like if
*  you want to be a good person you have to be a part of this group you have to go there and be a part
*  of this protest we see a lot of that yeah yeah they're just there because they're they think
*  they're supposed to be a good person to be there and they want to make all their friends think
*  they're a good person they're carrying around signs and yelling out these things got the keffi on and
*  they're like hey look at me i'm in the encampment i don't know what the fuck i'm doing here but
*  meanwhile it is a fascinating time if they allow debates because if you could see a pro israeli
*  and a pro-palestinian debate like a real legitimate honest intellectual debate and discussing
*  all the various issues like from the beginning of the formation of israel to back in the history
*  of the land and then what's going on today all the treaties all the different things that have
*  happened all the different peace talks that would be a fascinating opportunity for people to hear
*  both sides of this conflict and and try to get a better understanding of it instead of just running
*  out there with signs and camping on the lawn it's like universities and these places of higher
*  education are supposed to be where these difficult conversations get sorted out exactly because you're
*  supposed to have the smartest minds and to bring in the smartest minds from either side there's
*  brilliant people that are pro israeli and brilliant people that are pro-palestine they're brilliant
*  and if you can get them together and have them sort out your details all the people in the
*  audience can get a better more informed understanding of how complex this conflict is and that is
*  supposed to be what universities are for that's what it should be it should be a place where people
*  can sit down and learn something about something very difficult which is international conflict
*  these crazy moments in history where we get entwined with military conflicts that are happening
*  all over the world and it's nowhere near you and it's it's complicated shit man and to just run out
*  there with a sign because these fuckers are organizing this on campus it messes everything
*  up it messes up everybody and to have like only one side's perspective heard messes up everybody
*  the whole thing's a mess man well i think that the the students for the most part again the actual
*  students who have an affiliation with the universities look you know the palette the
*  the pro-hamas groups the pro-palestinian activists they tend to view the students i believe as
*  essentially useful idiots right window dressing and it gives it a sort of a veneer of of as you
*  pointed out before sort of this organic grassroots movement that's sweeping the nation when in fact
*  there's this underlying infrastructure that's always out there right trying to take advantage
*  of opportunities like this and the chaos and then aside from that then you've got this other
*  30 000 foot problem where you've got the iranian regime and others who are promoting this and
*  pushing for it look you know hezbollah hamas they've got they got a lot of money right they
*  they they have i can't not not to disappear out of rabbit hole but the leaders of of hamas are
*  extremely wealthy right um you know ishmael hanyay and and marzouk and and uh mashaal and the other
*  cacts you know um they have billions of dollars right because for years people say well how could
*  that be possible well for billions for years and years now they have been receiving a great
*  deal of money conservative estimates from you know from from iranian regime hamas gets maybe
*  a quarter billion a year right cutter it appears gives them even more than that there have been
*  years when they've given about 400 million dollars to hamas for for a variety of reasons
*  right ostensibly and part of that money coming from cutter is is by agreement with israel right
*  because part of it is for over the years the idea that you're buying quiet buying peace right and
*  so yes and and so there was a process in place to try to track that money right that came in just
*  same with the palestinian authority from over in the west bank but that's a lot of money right not
*  to mention even the the money going to unruh right and this is sort of the same situation with ukraine
*  too right we don't really know where it all goes and some of it definitely goes in the pockets in
*  yeah yeah there was a guy did you see that guy i forget what what his position is in um ukraine
*  but he's driving around in a rolls royce this fucking six hundred thousand dollar in he's
*  driving around in a house he's driving around a house he's got a roll a fucking rolls royce and
*  he's got the only rolls royce in ukraine this one whatever it is yeah is it a specter is that what
*  is it a phantom maybe it's a phantom well you got i mean it's a fucking and so and that's been
*  but isn't it crazy it's like the scene in goodfellas yeah where the guy has the cadillac
*  he goes yes what what the fuck are you doing with him didn't i tell you didn't i tell you
*  that was a great scene what a great scene god um yeah and it's you got a video that dude driving
*  around in his rolls royce before i before i went too far was it that car um i don't know that's
*  are we saying this is false but this is okay no no this is a real recent one driving around
*  but it might be central bank governor that might be fake too it all might be fake yeah well um
*  ukraine politician ukraine politician rolls royce write that right in google politician
*  in ukraine rolls royce politician because this
*  videos go to videos oh i was news fake bbc news clip ukraine's ex-army that's from a month ago
*  yeah ex-army chief paid to leave ukraine now that's not it that's a different clip but this is but
*  this is a good example right i mean you're you really got to dig ukraine protesters discover
*  luxury cars allegedly belonging to president's son that's 10 years ago okay yeah oh yeah yeah
*  listen 2014 when the fucking coup happened well ukraine has always had problems with corruption
*  but i forgot i forgot what this guy's position was but he was driving around it's not russell
*  brand some guy i had no idea russell brand was ukraine is this it rolls royce specter that's
*  600 000 ukraine politician pay with us and your money look at his fucking car look at that car
*  sweet look at that car that's it that's the video bro that's a house that guy's driving around a
*  house god damn it is he driving in himself i wonder of course he is that's a bold move right
*  there of course he is it's a beautiful car you know a lot of fucking you drive that car
*  you stole that money god hard work well and that's that's again yeah when you talk about
*  like whether we're talking about money that goes to to the palestinian cause and gets filtered
*  through khamas and that's they better never carve off billions of dollars for themselves they're
*  living big lives in cutter and turkey but part of the problem with ukraine has been you know in
*  terms of well they've got they've got big issues right one of them has been explaining why it's
*  important to the american people right the the administration hasn't really accomplished that
*  uh yet right and trying to say why are we doing this right they should have been doing it from
*  the very start flags in congress yeah well they wave the ukrainian flags i don't know what you're
*  saying yeah well they didn't know what explained it explained it here we go just yeah but you
*  remember the very beginning everybody had a ukrainian flag on their front of their house
*  to see it in congress and they're passing that aid bill it's like oh yeah who handed those out
*  yeah yeah where'd you get those exactly did you guys get those from home yeah who's telling you
*  who's telling you to wave those got them from amazon this whole thing seems coordinated
*  you want to tell me about how this happened plus also where's the money go that's the other big
*  issue is the transparency and how are we spending this money how are we spending your money the
*  taxpayers money and look i fall down on the side of uh i don't want to see putin win and he will
*  win you know without significant support that gets to the point where he feels so much pain
*  he actually negotiates a settlement right we're not going to get to a victory in this war that's
*  bullshit the idea that ukraine is going to win the war and claim all their territory
*  bullshit it's not going to happen you think they're going to reclaim crimia or Putin's going to give
*  that up right he'll probably go to tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield before he does that
*  right and so you've got you've got to get but you've got to you got to hurt him enough so that he
*  says oh fuck it okay because if he's hurt enough that means at home he's facing some descent right
*  and that's the big thing for him he doesn't want you you know he just wants to hold on to power
*  you want your two versions of what's going on i hear the war has already been won by Russia and
*  Ukraine is down to like a minimum amount of soldiers they've lost half a million people
*  rough estimates like no one really knows what the real estimates are yeah and then i've heard other
*  stories where Ukraine is actually doing much better than people think and Russia has hemorrhaged
*  people because they're essentially just sending people into the front line they send in prisoners
*  and they're just using bodies to win this and that well both sides are are accurate both sides
*  are true right so yeah Ukraine has been hurting they have a they have a what Russia's got a three
*  to one manpower advantage in terms of population right what they can what they can do to recruit
*  and put more people on the battlefield and Russia has a no problem with sort of a meat grinder
*  strategy right just throw bodies at it right just and the stats on fatalities on casualties on both
*  sides are completely bullshit there's no transparency really and it's kind of understandable
*  why you don't want to tell the other side how many soldiers you've lost or injured
*  Zelensky came out a while back and said you know we've suffered 31,000 you know fatalities on the
*  battlefield it's higher than that and and it's higher on the Russian side right because of their
*  strategy and the way they just they you know Putin doesn't really care so he throws bodies at it
*  um the Russians are making headway on the east right and they are making an effort to push through
*  those front line defenses that Ukraine has up on the eastern side of Ukraine and you know the lack
*  of armaments the lack of munitions while Congress and the US couldn't figure out what they wanted to
*  do that was a decided problem for Ukraine right if that continued then yeah Russia will win they will
*  push through and they will eventually end up in Kiev and look Putin's already engaged in
*  shenanigans in Moldova in Georgia right he's he's they're working very hard behind the scenes in
*  Georgia right to to split Georgia away from the EU right and that's because they're worried that
*  Georgia could eventually you know be part of the European Union and they don't want that and so
*  they're engaged in all sorts of activity there off the radar which they do very well right
*  well disinformation and political uh influence campaigns um instilling personnel that are that
*  are there's a party there in Georgia the Georgian dream party or something like that's that's pro
*  Kremlin and they're pushing very hard on a variety of fronts right they're pushing a bill that's sort
*  of like a foreign agent bill which is it part of it's a Russian tactic right to um basically
*  you know a single out anybody who's got uh foreign influence or foreign involvement and that could be
*  NGOs it could be media independent media and the Russians have used that foreign agent bill very
*  successfully um so yeah but but my point is that it depends on your on your thought process if you
*  think that now okay Putin takes Ukraine who gives a fuck right and that's all that's all it's going
*  to happen he's not going to try to reconstitute the former Soviet Union in some fashion by going
*  after a couple other states right he wants a buffer zone with the west which is what the
*  Soviet Union was right he wants to rebuild that in some fashion not the same right but in some
*  fashion so my experiences and other people's are different and so that's why you end up with
*  differing opinions and you know god bless but you know mine is that he's not going to stop there so
*  what my my belief is you got to hurt him enough get him to the table and call it good and that good
*  may look a lot like the way things were you know and in 2022 when they started the invasion
*  and that's going to be unsatisfying to a lot of people but at least you end the fucking conflict
*  right and and fine that's where but i think that's where this goes the idea that you know
*  the only the only outright winner will be Putin if we back off and say we're not going to provide
*  you with certain armaments certain weapons to allow you to inflict enough pain to stop this
*  and it's this is a incredibly complex and dynamic environment because the US is the White House the
*  Biden administration is pushing very hard on Zelensky to not attack any targets inside of Russia
*  right the Ukrainian military is like well fuck it why aren't we attacking Russian oil refineries
*  right and energy infrastructure like the Russians are doing inside Ukraine that's been a tactic of
*  the Russian military for quite some time now right yeah just because it it impacts morale of
*  the population it demoralizes people so the Ukrainian military saying do that the White
*  House is saying no we don't want to escalate so don't do that right now the other side of that
*  coin is if you fuck over the Russian energy infrastructure what does that do to oil prices
*  around the world and what does it do to gas prices at the pump when you're in an election year
*  and I don't want to I don't want to I don't be a conspiracy theorist but but then you got the
*  Europeans and you know Macron is over there saying well you know if Kiev asks we you know
*  I can see putting French troops on the ground in Ukraine he was trying to distract from the
*  fact that his wife's a man right yeah
*  oh I like that no it's yeah wildest one yeah ever heard yeah the fact that Candace Owen is like I
*  stake my reputation on this like are you fucking sure yeah yeah is this where you want to go is
*  this is this how you want to be known I'm so confused by that one oh god I've tried I've tried
*  to look into that one I really have and to my own embarrassment I've looked into it yeah my point is
*  like this person this woman that he's married to even even even I can't believe it even if it's a
*  man yeah the real problem is they had a relationship when Macron was 15 yeah and she was 39 that by itself
*  is wild yeah because if it was the opposite it was a 39 year old man who was a teacher and a 15 year
*  old girl was a student yeah this would be horrific everybody would be up in arms well the greatest
*  line about that is uh what was his name Berlusconi right the old Italian uh uh prime minister
*  someone asked him what he thought of of uh Macron's wife and he says well he's got a good looking mom
*  doesn't he so anyway uh but very was this the guy oh no I did a little research on this MP this is
*  the story that came out was this was that okay this super dope he looks like a dude to be driving
*  around the world the story is he's super rich guy has a bunch of dope cars but I found a post on
*  what nine gag which is like many dope cars they found the vin number and the vin number was
*  is to a car from last year so I don't know that it makes maybe that makes sense that what do you
*  mean this is the plate the plate numbers to a car from last year and this story was saying that it's
*  for a new like a brand new car it's this yeah but those are hard to get the first electric
*  specter and yeah yeah but those are hard to get like there's 20 20 23s that are for sale right now
*  like you know it's like like when I got a if you go looking for one like I got a Nissan a gtr
*  I had to get a 2023 2024s weren't available right like when I got it so that could be yeah you get
*  a nismo and also if you get one of those rolls royce spectrums those are fucking hard to get dude
*  a brand new one that's a 2023 with zero miles on it could be what you're buying new and I'll tell
*  you one thing this guy could have you know he could have carved this money out corruptly from
*  a variety of sources over the years right so this is a lot of ways to mix the money yeah that's it
*  bottom line is I get bitches with me car look at this car that's a really good accent that's a
*  very good accent this is basically your house you know with the right this is multiple of your house
*  with the right disguise you could work the streets of of ukraine I can be a ukrainian
*  wrestler give me cauliflower here I walk around like I'm in a hunch like I'm ready to shoot a
*  double like like here in a hunch yeah yeah um I think that uh there's definitely a lot of
*  corruption over there and to deny that yeah I'm sure you saw that one thing where Candace Owen
*  was going back and forth with the New York Times when they were saying what evidence do you have
*  of Ukraine being corrupt she's like oh you mean your fucking newspaper stupid yeah she said these
*  different articles about the rampant corruption in Ukraine it's been I mean it's decades right
*  we've known that and we've known that and and but anywhere you've got you know vast sums of money
*  coming in for a variety of reasons which is again what I'm always astounded when people say oh
*  there's no way that that uh that the three top leaders of Hamas are you know worth 11 billion
*  dollars collectively I think okay well even if it take a tenth of that and you think about these
*  guys running Hamas which supposedly I mean they've been governing since what 2007 2006
*  supposedly for the benefit of the Palestinian people and they're sitting on billions of dollars
*  and you think and so that's why you know fuck Hamas and and I understand the Israeli perspective
*  which is we can't allow them to retain control I get that right I understand that operational
*  perspective right the problem is that you're you know you're not going to win the narrative
*  you're not going to win what's happening on the international stage and sometimes you know sometimes
*  the Israeli government can act like they don't understand how public relations plays out right
*  I mean this this like look at the past couple of days what's happened so Hamas wasn't going to
*  accept the ceasefire Hamas has turned down opportunities for a ceasefire right they just
*  and okay and then they say okay the other day uh 48 hours ago whatever they said we're going to
*  walk away from the negotiating table fuck that right knowing knowing that Israel is is ready to
*  do some you know limited operations in Rafa so because they're not stupid they've got a very
*  good intelligence network right and they've got a lot of and so they understand what Israel's about
*  to do right they say we're walking away from the negotiating table Israel says okay fine everybody
*  you know evacuate eastern Rafa you know we're going to engage in some targeted strikes against
*  Hamas targets that we've identified Hamas turns around shortly after it says ah we accept a peace
*  proposal a ceasefire proposal from Egypt and Qatar right so look at us we're accepting a
*  ceasefire proposal and Israel's moving on Rafa right that's a you know on one hand that's a
*  brilliant communication strategy right now you've won the day on the international stage and exactly
*  what they knew would happen just like what they knew would happen after the seven October strikes
*  they knew what was going to happen they knew that civilians were going to die right they understood
*  that and and again everybody's got their own opinion minus Hamas doesn't give a shit about
*  dead Palestinians in fact that's their currency that's how they that that's how they work the
*  game and so they understood what was going to happen Israel was in a bind they got to respond
*  they're in an urban environment it is fucked up right and too many people have died right
*  I don't necessarily believe the Hamas run Gaza Health Ministry in terms of their statistics
*  and also they don't separate out how many you know how many combatants were killed right they're
*  just like oh 34 000 people have died so people imagine oh my god 34 000 civilians well thousands
*  and thousands of those people are fighters they're Hamas fighters right again it's horrible I'm not
*  saying it's not it's awful right and both sides have have are problematic here but
*  what I am saying is Hamas has a much better communications public relations operation so they
*  knew what Israel was about to do they claim oh we accept the ceasefire the ceasefire was completely
*  uh different from what had been presented you know by Israel and to Israel right just during
*  the past 48 hours they say no this this thing is not what we've been talking about we don't accept
*  it so now they've moved in on Rafa and they've lost yet again the narrative on the world stage
*  so now it's now they're the ones who are causing problems anyway so it's it's kind of fucked but
*  again the point is it's also when all that money's sloshing around of course you're going to have
*  people who are benefiting from it and in this case it's it's people like you know Hanyay who
*  you know can sit and cut her you know with with with all that money and what are they worried
*  about they're worried about losing a revenue stream right they know that if Hamas is destroyed
*  you think Iran's going to continue giving them a quarter billion dollars a year or Cutter's going
*  to allow them to live this lavish lifestyle and give them money or they're going to continue to
*  be able to you know extract uh taxes from money coming in or from goods coming into Gaza you know
*  or or put tariffs on things coming in you know to the tunnels a contraband no so in part it's this
*  it never changes right where there's situations like this whether it's there whether it's Ukraine
*  wherever yeah you're gonna you're gonna get this right you're gonna get this level of corruption
*  and so I'm not surprised at all when when people are worried about or concerned about what's going
*  on with Ukraine and we give them another 61 billion dollars and how much is that is ending
*  up in pockets but I'd argue that that's part of the problem that the government the US government
*  is faced they haven't done their job they haven't provided as much transparency as possible and
*  accountability to the American public and so you lose the support of the American public who had
*  been just two years ago waving their fucking flags and putting Ukrainian flags on their Twitter sites
*  and all the rest of that bullshit yeah anyway what do you think happens to Gaza if you had a guess
*  yes
*  look this and go back to the Romans right putting down you know a Jewish uprising in Judea which is
*  essentially Jerusalem area right West Bank you know they call it the West Bank now and
*  you know Israel they still call it Judea do I think the problem is going to be solved no
*  um in the short term will the conflict end yes um but then what happens to all that area that's
*  been destroyed they got to rebuild it right and that's and who rebuilds well they've been they've
*  been trying to put together an Arab states coalition right of countries that would then
*  be responsible for a couple of things the rebuilding of the infrastructure and also
*  security right because again no ceasefire no permanent ceasefire is going to be accepted
*  that allows Hamas to be the governing authority there right so the US has been pushing very hard
*  to have the Palestinian authority right run by Mahmoud Abbas who's been in charge of the Palestinian
*  authority for god 20 years now and he's not popular in Gaza right they were they were kicked out I
*  mean they were well there's a there's been a rift with the Palestinian groups factions for some
*  time you go back to when was the PLL PLL was PLL was started in like the early 70s right
*  Yasser Arafat remember him looked a lot like Ringo Starr and they were never photographed
*  together so I still think there's something there I was going to investigate that on the
*  black files yeah small mustache yeah yeah it's costume they looked a lot alike look similar
*  yeah I would be able to tell if they were in a room together yeah but they never were is my point
*  well why would he be the fuck you doing hanging out Yasser Arafat well Arafat was a he was he
*  loved music um who doesn't he doesn't got the Beatles were great but anyway um so Yasser Arafat
*  PLO gets put together see what I'm talking about yeah but his nose Ringo's nose is clear he's more
*  Arab he looks more like Yasser Arafat than Yasser Arafat does doesn't he doesn't he maybe we're
*  running something here come on dog this is what but you see what I'm talking about look look pretty
*  fucking similar you changed the sunglasses yeah just yeah little cia disguise but Yasser could
*  not play the drums the way Ringo plays the drums you played dumb maybe played maybe didn't want to
*  throw everybody off two of my boys the oldest scooter and the youngest mugs they play drums they
*  played drums for a long time they're very good both of them mugs in particular loves the Beatles
*  right and and he'll tell you he said Ringo is completely underrated as a drummer right
*  a grunt man you know not in the drumming world they all know he's great but in the music world
*  he's kind of underrated period is an important part of the Beatles I never understood why they
*  decide that guy sucks yeah yeah what the hell he was never the Beatles come on what's wrong with
*  you he married Barbara Bach what do you want yeah well he did well um she's not related to
*  Catherine Bach is she do I sound like an idiot if I say who's Catherine Bach from the dukes of hazard
*  Daisy Duke dude that was Catherine Bach yeah bro she's she ain't no fuck as hot as the sun son what
*  was the other guy what was it there was like cooter cooter and skeeter and there's Bo and
*  Luke Duke and then there was Roscoe P. Coltrane he was the sheriff yeah I remember him yeah Roscoe
*  P. Coltrane but then there was a cooter in the garage damn it I knew there was a cooter in there
*  and then there was a boss hog that's right God they don't make was the man they don't make TV
*  like that anymore no you can't even show that show anymore because of the confederate flag on the
*  roof of the general e they have to all that right yeah they blur it out now yeah no you're right
*  do they handle that did they cgi that now so you can still watch that show because I think there's
*  gotta be car shows is that what they do yeah I think so because there's car shows where you can't
*  go if you got a general e because if you have a real like they used to do the oh one on the side
*  yeah yeah see okay that's what it used to look like yeah that's right amazon considers pulling
*  dukes of hazard from video because of the confederate flag but didn't they didn't they
*  cgi out the confederate flag for the show cgi out confederate flag yeah remove flag yeah google
*  remove flag remove flag consumer products divisions decided to cease licensing replicas of dukes of
*  hazard generally okay that makes sense yeah remove the flag warner brothers announces removal of
*  confederate flag from the dukes of hazard okay removing it oh from all from all merchandise
*  okay not on the show not in the old video yeah up until eight years ago they sold confederate flags
*  you know what they could do is they could they could if they want to renew the license on that
*  thing they just put an lgbtq plus whatever flag on top of there it is kind of tv land pulls dukes of
*  hazard amid confederate flag I heard that they were gonna put it back up and cgi the flag off
*  I like the people are apparently have enough time on their hands to worry about this shit I
*  think they're like you know what offends me well it's just fucking generally it's kind of bizarre
*  how they didn't think that was offensive in the 80s right right there's a lot of shows you couldn't
*  remember Starsky and Hutch remember Huggy Bear the uh the the I think he was a pimp on on Starsky
*  and Hutch you couldn't get away with that shit anymore that's right so yeah yeah yeah um so
*  anyway moving back to the PLO uh so back then part of the part of the rift between uh the
*  Palestinian Authority and uh and Hamas is Hamas was it came out of the first in first in Tefada
*  in like 80 whatever 87 but um they took exception with Yasser Erfah because he uh basically denounced
*  violence right as a way to attain you know the Palestinian objectives and goals and everything
*  he was like okay and he you know remember he was he was involved in signing some peace accords
*  madrid and oslo accords and everything so so Hamas you know in their charter basically is like no
*  jihad is the way to go violence is the way that we're going to our you know it's liberation not
*  negotiation they have all these sayings in their charter right about this and so anyway so there's
*  but there have been problems and and eventually they had an election in um in uh what the hell
*  what year was it 2006 i think in gaza right and fatah yasser erfah's party the PLO party
*  was up and was expected to win didn't win Hamas won uh and during the course of the next year
*  they actually got into a war right between Hamas and and PLO or Palestinian Authority and uh
*  Hamas booted them out so they they govern so when you think about Palestine or the Palestinian you
*  know state or whatever it is you've actually got two completely separate entities you've got Gaza
*  run by um Hamas and you've got the West Bank right run by Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian
*  Authority so is the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank are they popular there uh yeah they're
*  popular enough yeah yeah they're they're popular they continue to to govern right they continue to
*  be in charge and so is really objective that the Palestinian Authority control all of Palestine
*  no they don't see that's that's where it comes in the US uh Secretary Blinken and others have
*  been pushing this idea that somehow the Palestinian Authority will will be the governing body in in
*  Gaza um and uh you know Gazans look they don't they don't necessarily you know they don't want
*  that he's actually less popular Mahmoud Abbas is less popular now than he was even before the
*  7th October attacks and Israel is saying no look you know Abbas and the Palestinian Authority they
*  haven't even denounced the attacks of 7th October right we don't we don't want them it's it's like
*  in their mind it's almost like just trading one for the other right if they're the governing
*  authority so I think when you say what it's going to look like um you know it's probably going to
*  be and and Israel said we don't want to occupy this shit they stopped occupying Gaza in 2005
*  right they were like you know done now they still controlled the border and they controlled the
*  coastline right uh and the the one crossing there's basically two crossings there um
*  Karem Shalom crossing uh with Israel and in Gaza then there's a Rafa crossing um but you know
*  they're saying no we don't want them governing so it it could end up looking like a some type of UN
*  Arab States type of coalition right that then is there and they're responsible for security of
*  Gaza and they're responsible for you know the rebuilding effort um but he has a long ways to
*  go right to get there um so so Israel is not trying to take over Gaza they don't want it
*  yeah they got look you have to go by leveled it they kind of leveled it yeah they I mean they
*  look and and people cry genocide you know they're saying genocide you can debate the you know the
*  meaning of genocide but typically and in terms of of academia and you know and people that talk
*  about these things you know you've got war crimes you've got crimes against humanity you've got
*  genocide and they all mean different things right um Israel wants to destroy Hamas right there you
*  have to ask yourself is there intent to destroy all Palestinian people as a group to just get rid
*  of them is it like what they tried to do with the Armenians all those years ago or um you know the
*  German effort against the the Jews I mean is that is that what they intend to get to make this group
*  disappear or is there intent to destroy Hamas a terrorist organization um that has been attacking
*  them and continues to attack them and it's in their charter because it's in the Iranian regime's
*  objective and and their mind is to remove Israel you could argue what Iranian regime wants to do is
*  genocide right they want to remove Israel right that's pretty much the definition of genocide so
*  again it depends on how you but there's obviously a disproportionate amount of military power
*  um well yes oh again between the two of course yeah yeah and but you have to say okay are we
*  are we lumping Hamas into the the Iranian proxy network they built a belt of terrorist organizations
*  right whether it's a Islamic jihad Palestinian Islamic jihad or Hamas or the Houthis or the
*  Hezbollah of north they've created this network of proxies designed with the objective of removing
*  Israel at some point right because that's the stated purpose of the Iranian regime they you
*  know they want the destruction of Israel so you know you could argue well look all that together
*  that's the military power or is it just this one group now you know in a in a in a in a confined
*  sense yes of course Israel's got far more military power than Hamas as an organization right um and
*  again it doesn't you know it's not it's it's not one thing or the other it's horrible what the
*  Palestinian civilians go through and have been going through you could also argue that Hamas
*  knows exactly what they were going to go through when they when they instituted they instigated
*  the attacks they did get support and training from the Iranian regime so the Iranian regime knew what
*  was going to happen right so what do you think the state what is the purpose of the attacks the
*  attacks are not just to kill those 1200 people no it's not no you're absolutely right and it and and
*  part of it is tied to the desire to scuttle the Abraham Accords and the potential normalization
*  of of of relations between Saudis and Israel that really worries them right and Ismail Hanyay
*  right came out head of the political wing of Hamas came out after the attacks and talked about this
*  and glorified the attacks and also said that look this you know people our Arab brothers our Arab
*  states should realize that Israel is not um you know is is not uh you will have no peace basically
*  with negotiations and with relationships so he was clear in the way that he put it that you know he
*  was sending a message to the Arab states about this idea of normalizing relations with Israel
*  so uh that was part of it part of the desire was to was to tank those discussions which were
*  pretty well underway right and now we're back again right they they they kind of took them off
*  the table for a while but the Saudis and the U.S. have been having some pretty good discussions
*  recently over the normalization of all of this right and I think it's in the Arab states where
*  you know look Bahrain and Morocco and others all understand too that long-term stability down the
*  road is going to come from normalization of relationships and some long-term ability to have
*  peace which is part of the problem they don't want you know they that's why they don't take
*  Palestinian you know they're they're worried about the the Palestinian refugees right you say well
*  why doesn't Egypt open up the crossing and set up a refugee camp across the way from the Rafah
*  crossing well in part because they're worried about their own security Egypt's been building
*  a big wall they've been adding to their wall down along their border with Gaza Strip so
*  you know this look they they formed the PLO Egypt was in charge of the PLO all those years ago back
*  in the early 70s right you know they were essentially the leaders they put in place in
*  the PLO all those years ago were basically just puppets for Egypt right and part of the reason
*  why they were putting those people in place was because they wanted to minimize sort of the radical
*  Islamic extremist actions right and the acts that they took against Israel because they wanted
*  stability they did the the families down there right whether it's Qatar or the Saudis or the
*  Egyptians or whatever they're just as worried about radical Islam right and the potential for
*  them to lose control and to lose power as are the Israelis and others in a sense right not necessarily
*  from the physical sense but they've attacked you know Arab families before Arab leaders before so
*  it's a complex problem I guess what I'm saying is there's a lot of moving parts here and sometimes
*  it all just gets you know thrown into one simple minded argument right it's good or it's bad Israel's
*  committing genocide you know you know Palestinian people are terrible no it's there's so much
*  fucking more to this so again you know I don't know that there's any solution that that will be
*  long long term committed peace in the region in our lifetime but in the short term I think you know
*  the conflict when it's wrapped up I don't see how it ends with Hamas still being in control
*  of Gaza I don't I think that's a red line for the Israeli government now maybe Netanyahu doesn't
*  last as the leader of the government and somebody like Benny Gantz takes over and they're more
*  inclined to say now you know what just for the sake of some peace right now you know let's just
*  call it quits but do you think that's possible it yeah it could happen he's got Netanyahu's got a lot
*  of internal issues political issues right so but I think well that's something that we talked about
*  before the people protesting on the street for months hundreds of thousands of people protesting
*  on the streets about Netanyahu expanding power yeah with their courts yeah and I and I think
*  that if there's look if there's a change in government fine they do what they're going to
*  do I just I just think that you know from an operational perspective and this is just
*  operational I'm not talking about the moral the ethics of the whole thing of people dying all
*  this I'm just saying from an operational perspective leaving Hamas in place isn't going to create any
*  even midterm is it possible for them to get Hamas out it is possible they have to keep doing what
*  they're doing just bomb the shit out of everything well they do a lot of targeted strikes they do a
*  lot of yeah there's there's it's look it's it's fucking ugly right there's no you can't you can't
*  sugarcoat any of this and say well they're just so when I say targeted strikes I'm not saying it's
*  all very surgical and people aren't getting of course people are dying but and you're not going
*  to remove them you can't get down to zero sum here right it's like it's like counterterrorism you never
*  reduce the risk down to zero so when you're talking about Hamas you can't destroy them in the in the
*  concept of saying you know they're all dead right because the leaders are still like I said they're
*  fat and happy sitting in Qatar and Turkey and elsewhere they're hiding they're not even hiding
*  right they're guests this is how fucked up some of these middle east problems are they're guests
*  of the qatari government right they and we know they're there and so did they go there when the
*  conflict started no no no no these guys have been you know living abroad for years right they've
*  been living abroad for years and then and in part because look Hamas runs a network of businesses
*  and charitable organizations just like Hezbollah does Hezbollah's got a global presence right so
*  but they they're they're sitting over there in a country that is also one of our key
*  non-nato allies right so we have our largest middle east base there you know in Qatar and
*  you know so it's it's only just recently and recently it's like the past week or so
*  where the U.S. is is broached the idea of say look if Hamas doesn't accept a ceasefire
*  right then the qatari government needs to move these people out they need to expel them right
*  and whether the qatari government would do that or not because they're playing all sides right the
*  qatari government does you know they've hosted the Taliban they've hosted ISIS leaders nice parties
*  nice parties they're great parties the canopies are delicious it's a lovely it's a lovely time
*  in the conversation and so you know at the same so it is I'm just trying to paint the picture
*  that it's more complicated than somebody sitting on a campus at UCLA might imagine right right and
*  and and to your point it deserves more debate it deserves more intellectual open conversation
*  right not necessarily when you talk about who's right and who's wrong how about focus on how do
*  we fucking solve the problem right if if and the problem is maybe intractable if the problem is a
*  two-state solution then maybe you know this thing is just never never going to work because you know
*  maybe a two-state solution is the best idea but if one side or the other is not going to accept it
*  and both sides have pushed back against it at various times then you know what do you got where
*  where's it going the thing is like most people never get to hear this like wide-ranging perspective
*  like you just laid out with all the different factors I'm sure there's more factors but all
*  the different you know significant pieces that are in play here yeah and I think that's but you
*  the same thing happens with every major issue right because again if you turn on the news
*  um you get a three-minute piece of news about a major crisis happening right like the Ukraine
*  conflict and whatever so and you know not everybody wants to sit and listen you know to
*  to details about like an Israel Hamas or wants a Ukraine and or you know what Iran's doing with
*  their nuclear weapons program or whatever but um you know we we tend to we we we tend to have ADHD
*  right as a nation I think and so again people are busy people are just focused on other things
*  but it deserves more conversation it deserves more detail and not the bullshit that gets thrown out
*  there from one side or the other right sort of the hard edges and or the shit that comes in from
*  outside elements like the Chinese the Russians the Iranians who don't have our best interests at
*  heart right and you know so again we keep going back to the same thing if people aren't curious
*  and they don't take the fucking responsibility upon themselves to understand what it is that
*  they're listening to is it is it verifiable is incredible whatever get a balance of news don't
*  just sit and get in a silo and listen to shit because you agree with it right have a conversation
*  with somebody who disagrees with it's very interesting yeah it is yeah so it's very valuable
*  too if you could if you have the ability to just let someone talk and engage in them and not get
*  upset and angry and just why do you think that what do you think about this and just have I mean
*  that used to be of an admirable trait well I think that's why you know I'm blowing smoke up your ass
*  but that's why I think this your show works right is because you have conversations now you piss
*  people off because I think sometimes people have a hard time putting you in a box right and that
*  makes people uncomfortable if they think you know okay I know where he's coming from and then you
*  have a conversation where you're listening to something completely on the other side right and
*  you're not just saying well fuck you that's wrong you're saying well why is that right and you're
*  having people explain things that can piss people off right because everybody wants to identify make
*  a quick judgment and say I move on yeah yeah and judging is a lot easier than thinking it is a lot
*  easier it's super simple yeah it's very it's very fucking sinking is fucking complicated especially
*  when you're dealing with layers upon layers decades and generations of conflict like like you are in
*  gaza and palestine yeah israel it's nuts yeah I don't know I don't know where it's gonna I mean
*  again I think um I think the the us is in a interesting position they're not the key mediator
*  here right they're not the you know they can exert pressure on on israel to some degree but
*  israel's been very clear and said look we're gonna this is existential for us right if the shoe was
*  on the other foot if it was the us that was facing this sort of threat right if we were attacked by
*  mexico right our canada canada's a threat yeah but canada's too close yeah at least mexicans
*  speak spanish it's easier to that's that that makes us uniquely different yeah meanwhile there's
*  mexicans over here than there are canadians right yes I don't know I don't know if I trust the
*  canadians I think they're coming across the border at night when we don't see them I think they're
*  in a cult yeah that fucking trudeau's got them in a cult yeah the fact that they voted that guy in
*  again is mind-blowing yeah like how what are you fucking paying attention your your country's
*  literally falling apart and you guys are so wrapped up in one ideology or another you don't course
*  correct yeah you know it's like if newson was the governor not just the governor of california but
*  he was the president and he was running the same policies on our country yeah I don't know he was
*  he was thrown out there as I was like I mean now yeah they moved off of pete buddha judge and some
*  others but now he's he's him is still there winnable buddha judge is incompetent yeah he's
*  unwinnable well you could argue that newson also is incompetent 100 but that's slick fucker you
*  know I think they were trying him for a little while but then they decided to just run it with
*  biden again which is just absolutely wild absolutely wild well I was pretty convinced that
*  this was going to be the month they were going to remove biden I was like I don't yeah I was like
*  I think may I talked to tim dillon about it he put that idea in my head yeah and I think I was like
*  you know what that totally makes sense may seems like it makes sense because if you're going to
*  really get a new guy in place if you know biden is like you guys I got a problem as a thing
*  you know I'm going to be here on the sidelines I'm going to work really close with governor newson
*  and I think four more years pause pause yeah that was actually brilliant it's it's fucking
*  crazy it's fucking crazy that these people are gaslighting us but they can't they can't move him
*  out right if they move him out they got to move kamala harris out right or they've got to elevate
*  her to the top of the ticket which is nuts that's not going to happen well no one's you you have to
*  be the nuttiest fucking democrat and I know a few I know this one nutty democrat that I'm
*  guess I kind of friends or I see him I'll say hi but this this motherfucker is a kamala harris fan
*  you know thank you madam vice president like he's one of those how do you get to that point how do
*  you you're retarded yeah you just completely give in there's no critical thinking at all and you're
*  just fucking blue no matter who yeah you you ride or die well that's what I mean I I assume that
*  they've looked at the scenarios and they thought to themselves we can't have biden step down and
*  put somebody else at the top of the ticket so we've got to clear the ticket entirely right
*  because we can't run kamala harris as as the presidential candidate so and we certainly can't
*  bring in new some a white dude you know to run the top of the ticket and keep her in place right
*  that's right not an optic there also she's just not valuable in that spot she doesn't gain you
*  she doesn't get confidence that we'll have a great vice president if he kicks the bucket
*  and bro how are they keeping him alive yeah what are they giving him and where do I get it well
*  she'll be she'll be president yeah what do I get what he's on yeah I want to try it's an able-bodied
*  man of uh complete control of my cognitive functions I'd like to know what that fucking
*  cocktail's like I was gonna say the cocktail that they gave him before the state of the union
*  address whatever they gave him then yeah right that fired him up just long enough to make it
*  long enough boy he must have slept for a week after that I bet god I bet it's some high dose
*  stuff whatever it is and I bet it feels great yeah yeah in the moment and then I think there's
*  probably a there's probably a come down oh but uh yeah but no I so yeah so she she'll be president
*  this is my theory I know I've lost a bet with you before on on trump but I I worry that look I you
*  know I think you know the the republicans can't really go after biden's age completely only because
*  trump is what 78 right but he's not as no absolutely not compromised right and that's
*  and that's absolutely true but I just I think that what's gonna happen is that you you have to have
*  a perfect storm for trump to win in terms of the independence right and suburban moms and you have
*  to have enough people come back into the tent right to vote for him and I just I don't know
*  that I have enough confidence that that's going to happen so we end up with president biden and
*  harris again which means we will have president harris I hate to say that right you know no you
*  you wish well on everybody right good health and all that yeah but come on come on yeah please
*  are you kidding me it's not gonna two years into this this next 10 years but isn't trump ahead in
*  a lot of polls and he is he is but I you know again I don't I don't know that I'd make you
*  know bank on on polls nowadays I think it's it's I this is going to sound like I'm going off topic
*  but after the seven october attacks in in Gaza I think that the survey was done in maybe january
*  and february time frame they released it in march so a Palestinian research center based in
*  in where ramallah I think in in in Gaza I forget where it was but anyway they ran a survey
*  and according to this poll that they did of of residents of Gaza over 70 supported hamas's
*  seven october attacks right 70 over 70 supported hamas's attacks it was a minuscule amount that
*  thought that hamas was responsible for their troubles right it's like it's like less than 10
*  percent I think they thought that that that hamas was responsible for all the chaos now happening
*  right despite the fact of what they did but they supported what they did according to the poll
*  now you you peel that back and you think to yourself okay well first of all the the survey
*  was done in in Gaza so somebody knocks on your door and says do you support hamas's uh actions
*  on seven october what the fuck do you think I'm going to say right of course I'm going to say yes
*  it's kind of like if you walk up to somebody in in in san francisco on a crowded street and say do
*  you do you support president trump no you know so I don't know that people are particularly honest
*  at times in in in surveys and polls especially in this these circumstances in these circumstances
*  but but you're right most surveys most polls show him uh you know some points ahead and you know
*  don't get me wrong I you know I'd love to see less regulation you know we got all sorts of problems
*  on the economic front and you know one thing we could be doing as a government is is peeling back
*  some of the regulatory environment that's fucking us over right in in a lot of ways not just the
*  economy but it it impacts our national security down the road right how much when you you hear
*  about shenanigans when it comes to voting when you hear about like particularly corruption involved
*  with mail-in ballots it seems to be a sticking issue with people yeah how much of a security issue
*  is that like the mail-in balance thing yeah look if there's an opportunity for fraud or chaos
*  some people somewhere you know whether democrats or republicans or whatever if there's if there's a
*  fraud opportunity there will be an element that will try to play off of that right especially if
*  they think that it's imperative that this happened for this future of democracy future of democracy
*  it's oh my god i'm saving the country yeah despite what i'm doing so you know that's what you're
*  doing being very unamerican right exactly so voter corruption so i don't i don't have any
*  insight or insight information about you know to what degree there's a problem with with uh with
*  mail-in ballots and voter fraud but to me i tend to be a little more simplistic i remember a lot
*  of elections where you just show up you show your id you fill out the form and then by that evening
*  you found out who won right it didn't seem to be that complicated and now and nobody seemed really
*  disenfranchised right so i i would like to see us just go back to the normal way of voting right and
*  do we vote on it like how do you how does people how do people decide whether or not mail-in ballots
*  are appropriate because the reason why they were there in the first place was covet right right but
*  now that it's there and it's set up yeah now there's this resistance to get rid of mail-in ballots
*  but if if that is the thing that keeps us closer to corruption and it seems to be that's the thing
*  that's an element that you can fuck with right and you and you do this all the time in in uh in the
*  business environment or whatever you you look at your protocols in place you remove you know lack
*  of controls where you know fraud could seep in right it's a common thing you don't it's it shouldn't
*  be shouldn't be difficult but so then you have to look at it with some skepticism right are you
*  genuinely concerned that you know somehow there were vast swaths of the the population that were
*  disenfranchised and not able to vote right or just can't get themselves an id right which i think is
*  an insulting stance to take for a lot of people but you're not you're not i'm sorry you're not
*  smart enough to get yourself an id but you need one if you have a vaccine yeah but you need one
*  if you have a vaccine if you want to work yeah or from sam's club yourself you need one but you don't
*  need one to vote because that's not you know that's racist so yeah exactly or something so i think
*  you know to me it just seems like we should look at it from from a perspective of the way that you
*  would do it if you were running a business which is i want to minimize the potential opportunities
*  for fraud how do i do that it's very fucking simple seems fucking simple yeah you mean you
*  phrase it that way yeah so but they that's not it's not how they're how they're doing it right now
*  is that something that can be voted on that's the question uh i like who no idea decides leave it up
*  to the people you mean well who decides that mail-in ballots are still legitimate well i guess that
*  was that a federal or a state decision i think is i don't know that's a very good question um
*  yeah i who knows because i have friends that believe there was no voter fraud at all
*  and i have friends that believe that 100 Trump won yeah yeah i'm the same way i've got both sides
*  and you think okay well look someone's gonna be wrong well and and usually the answer is somewhere
*  in in you know in that range in the middle there's some fraud was it enough to like
*  fuck things over i who knows i don't know it's it's but again i keep going back to the operational
*  concerns which is just just minimize the potential for fraud mail-in ballots have always been mail
*  and ballots have been a thing right you're serving overseas or whatever uh but there was a protocol
*  for it and it was very straightforward and very clear and now you know the the concern over ballot
*  harvesting and and mail-in ballots and having you know months to get your thing having you know
*  uh weeks past before you know who won crazy yeah talk about uh instilling you know skepticism over
*  the credibility of your voting system yeah take take weeks to figure out who won a fucking election
*  is there a real danger that Trump could win but lose meaning that he could win the election but
*  lose his court case oh and literally have to go to jail while he's the president i mean yeah
*  this was the topic of discussion at the rogan house today was it well they were trying to figure out
*  like because yeah he could he could he could there's nothing that says he can't govern from jail
*  but is it possible they really might put him in jail is he in danger of actually being put
*  in a jail for these crimes of not what did he do exactly he paid a lady off
*  and i guess he did it in a secretive way or in a well he did it in the same way that arnold
*  schwarzenegger did it or they did it in the same way that a variety of people who are trying to
*  suppress a bad pr story do it right so i think the i think the trial that's going on right now
*  involving stormy daniels in new york uh was the least favorite trial of the democrats who are the
*  most keen to see him put in prison right they all felt as if this is probably not the one to start
*  with but they started with it because alvin bragg was dead set on on doing it right he just like i'm
*  going to throw this out there and you know a variety of other entities had looked at that
*  case and said we're not going to push it forward and so they've put this forward i'd i don't think
*  that there's anybody other than the hardcore never trumpers the the people that are just
*  desperate to see him in a in a jumpsuit uh who believe that there's any merit to it that the
*  analysts that you watch um across the board even the the the hard left ones they tend to speak in
*  caveats right like you know they're not completely convinced that this was the way to go so i don't
*  know but having said that um if he gets convicted and if there's like some you gotta go to prison
*  sounds so fucking bizarre how do we get to this point then uh i don't know of any any you know uh
*  i don't know if anything that says he can't you know continue to run or be you know elected is
*  what he's being accused of is this generally a crime that people actually have to go to jail for
*  no no there's anybody go to jail for that no they're trying to tie this in to uh to sort of
*  the campaign uh issue of campaign funds um influencing of the campaign that's what they're
*  trying to they're trying to tie it into well of course he's trying to suppress a story right that
*  he thought would be bad or that they thought his team thought would be bad uh for a campaign right
*  but that in and of itself so they got to tie it into how the funds were expended
*  they've tried this in the past um and again it's not like there haven't been countless dudes who
*  you know did the mess around and then had to pay to get the story suppressed right i mean that's
*  that there are pr firms that specialize in that sort of thing so i don't know i don't see that
*  this is gonna i don't see this is gonna tank him right there's probably other cases out there
*  is it a case where you know there's probably more cases right waiting they're gonna keep throwing it
*  at them yeah they've got a timeline of cases and look there's yeah the democratic strategists have
*  been you know they stick to a message they're very smart and they're very disciplined but they all sat
*  in a room somewhere and they looked at these various things they looked at the election
*  calendar and they looked at you know where the primaries are and they looked at when they could
*  maybe get these trials going and the idea being let's just keep this thing rolling keep him in
*  the news as being in a court right the idea that yeah the i look the idea that he's got to sit there
*  and can't leave you don't see that you know that's not a typical move right but now he's locked into
*  that court on whatever monday tuesday and thursday and friday or whatever so with the idea being he's
*  not out on the campaign trail right so but he's also in the news and his supporters think that
*  he's being unduly prosecuted right or unfairly prosecuted right and that it's a political
*  prosecution and that all they're trying to do which is essentially unamerican is
*  supple suppress their political rival right and that is a large number of people in the country
*  a larger number every day i think this just goes on as they gain more of an understanding of this
*  case like the problem is if you're a democrat and you support this if he does get in power now he
*  has this ability you have to understand there's a precedent's been set yeah and if you don't think
*  that biden has a shitload of things so let's say biden loses okay let's get really crazy
*  let's get really really crazy biden loses they inject him with stem cells for three years
*  and then they roll him out in 2027 like let's do it again let's do it again trump won the second
*  term we saw disasters of the business that was and they say you know what he's been sharper than
*  ever and you get these new york liberals who just gaslight the shit out of you i saw that video and
*  i'll tell you i'm pumped he's as sharp as a tack he's never been better sure he's old but that's
*  his superpower they tried that for a while his work ethic his work ethic looks fantastic he is so kind he's such a good man
*  he's the father of our country well i was so lucky i read an x post by admittedly a guy that works
*  for a consulting firm in dc right he's a democratic strategist but he wrote this glowing
*  thing about how oh biden's had this great couple of weeks man has he had a good couple of weeks
*  he's on fire yeah he's on fire look at what he's done in the middle east right and you think like
*  four more years well you could argue that part of our problem was we coddled the iranian regime for
*  three years and that's how things got to this stage and now and now what you know suddenly he's
*  had a good couple of weeks he's not they're not leading the charge on any ceasefire negotiations
*  right there in fact you could argue that they're making national security decisions related to
*  israel based on domestic policy concerns or political concerns right you don't want to lose
*  the youth vote you don't want to lose the arab american vote by being overly supportive of
*  israel so there is some concern here but isn't that losing the jewish vote then because jewish
*  we talked about this yesterday 70 percent of jewish people identify or vote as democrats yeah i know
*  and what's that all about i'm not i've never been quite clear on how that that number worked
*  right and so yeah it is interesting but but anyway i you know i don't want to say that you know
*  they're making too many decisions based on domestic political concerns but i think that they are
*  that's just the nature of the game right and so i don't think i'm being overly cynical but um
*  yeah what i was getting to was that if biden did if we went crazy in 2027 they got them on
*  stem cells and they put them in a hyperbaric chamber every day for four hours and he's sharp
*  as a dagger tackers look at him knife he's sharper than his uncle bozzy was imagine if trump goes
*  after him because there's a lot to go after if if they started uncovering the emails and the the
*  barisma stuff and the fact that he said he never talked to any of his son's business partners but
*  the but hunter biden's former partner said that at least 20 phone calls the fact that he allegedly
*  used a pseudonym when he was exchanging emails all that's nuts yeah all that is nuts well if that
*  if that was the case if now trump gets to go after him this is now we're dealing with insanity now
*  we're dealing with every time someone is president they have the power to prosecute their political
*  rivals for unnecessary means which is the whole argument of immunity right this is not the thing
*  that should be a thing that decides whether or not a guy gets to run for president no it's a that's
*  a very fourth world thing right and i probably get in trouble for saying fourth world people
*  oh my god how can you denigrate the fourth world well is that us are we fourth we're heading in
*  that direction i don't know if the first world anymore where are we right now i'm not sure where
*  we stand who's first world we're not that's what's scary recalibrate um maybe there are no first
*  worlds anymore but when you find out i mean we found out that the one percent of the world is
*  thirty four thousand dollars a year when you hear that you go oh that's why they're walking over here
*  that's why this is all chaos that's why this is all nuts yeah like yeah like this is first world as
*  crazy as it is this really is first world yeah well look i know i i'd spent most of my life overseas
*  and i met a lot of people in some very bizarre environments um and some and some sort of remote
*  areas and they all had this idea you know get to america right work hard and you you could do who
*  knows what right so it's still and it still continues to be a very dynamic and you know driving
*  element of of you know of people overseas i think we forget that sometimes right and and certainly
*  you know you could look at the campus protests and go to you well okay maybe maybe you know the youth
*  of today but that's not true either right because we can fall into that trap and say well the fucking
*  youth of today don't understand how you know great they have it and everything but every generation
*  has said that about their kids well not only that if you look at every generation has said that about
*  their kids for sure but if you looked at this this population of college kids and you could
*  remove these kids from their friends and with total immunity and at total anonymity
*  get their real opinions on all this stuff i guarantee you there's a lot of kids they say
*  some of this is so crazy and you can't have opposing opinions and we just sort of accept it
*  and we move on and it's what percentage of the kids are out there tense intense what percentage
*  of the kids are out there blocking the roads and protesting i bet it's a small percentage it's a
*  very small it's a lot of people and then there's a lot of people that go there that probably don't
*  even go to that school right right well i mean if you look at the arrest statistics so far right
*  you know what say it's not you know a completely accurate number about 2,400 arrests right campuses
*  across the country and the statistics are starting to show that you know upwards of half of those
*  arrests those people have no affiliation with the university they're not college students right
*  they're outside either agitators activists however you want to refer to them right so yeah i agree
*  with it it's not we're not talking about a lot and again i would argue that you know from the outside
*  activist perspective again whether it's you know students for justice in palestine or or you know
*  the other groups that are involved they look at the students themselves as just window dressing
*  and again sort of useful idiots but i will tell you one thing is you can get cynical sometimes
*  about the the state of of you know the youth however you want to call it the youths but then
*  i took i took my oldest boy scooter for his candidate visit at the u.s naval academy a couple
*  weeks ago that is a way to strengthen or reaffirm your belief in in where we are as a country right
*  when you see the kids that are there holy fuck right and i probably shouldn't say that when i'm
*  describing all the kids there but what great kids right they're still out there they're still out
*  and that's and that's the point yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of them what we're saying
*  earlier like you know oh the generation before i think this is the best generation it's just
*  there's so many morons yeah but in terms of just the sheer number of people that aren't
*  it'll surprise you there's a there's a lot of great people in this country yeah and we have
*  our problems and we're gonna always have problems but that one of the ways we find solutions is by
*  having problems and that's one of the ways we come to understandings and the the people that are
*  trying to stop you from discussing this that's the real problem the problem is not disagreement
*  folks the problem is people trying to stop people from discussing very important subjects and that
*  is look fucking all hail elon musk because that motherfucker stepped in spent 44 billion dollars
*  and shifted the entire the the whole like the environment of social media is very different
*  because x is the wild west yeah it's very different everywhere everything has to kind of relax just to
*  kind of keep up with it because the the whole power dynamic the whole bell curve has shifted
*  and now you got this one dude is like i don't give a fuck i'm gonna post ridiculous memes i'm
*  gonna talk shit i'm gonna say funny things and remember he was a darling of the left for
*  oh my god now he's a nazi it's crazy he's the worst having one of his cars was like a virtue
*  badge like my friend made fun of me because i had a tesla i was like dude i don't give a
*  fuck what you say if you get in this car you'll change your mind remember that south park episode
*  with the prius i don't see that one thank you there was a whole episode about people of south
*  park buying prius's and feeling incredibly super self-righteous it was fantastic it was almost as
*  good as their their their smacking it in san diego bro it is a thing in california it is a real
*  thing that some of my liberal friends that i know what you're doing you fucks you're waving a flag
*  that's not even a good car you don't even like the way it looks what are you doing yeah yeah get out
*  of here with that fucking stupid thing but now he's now yeah you're right now he's now he's a
*  nazi and see but the tesla thing made sense to me i'm like okay when you drive one of those things
*  regardless you get both things you get to feel like you're better because i'm out here doing
*  something amazing for the environment and then also you get a fucking time machine that thing
*  moves like a time machine it doesn't even seem real how fast those things are did i tell you
*  did i tell you when i rented a i ended up with a tesla i think i might i don't know if i told
*  you about that when i show up at a rental car place and i forget even what town i was in
*  and i hadn't asked for an ev right but i guess now they're kind of like they're pushing them out
*  them yeah so the guy says oh we you know we got a tesla for you i said okay fine so he hands me
*  he hands me the card right that little card something all right so he's out there in uh
*  whatever space 428 so i wander out there and i stand and it's and it's locked right so now
*  i'm standing there thinking well i don't have a fucking key i don't have a clue how to open
*  this thing right so a guy walks by and he goes oh you just tap the the the card on the on the car
*  so i'm out there like tapping tapping the fucking car the door handle tapping it all over no he
*  didn't tell me a little little panel right there tap it on that so i'm tapping the fucking car i
*  look like a monkey fucking a football and i'm just like what the hell and so finally finally
*  the guy walks over he goes what are you doing i said i'm trying to open the car
*  so he goes oh it's this he taps it car opens i go to say thanks very much man and he walks away
*  you know how he did it did you pay attention well i watched him he just hit that one spot on the on
*  the little panel there by the book and so i was like okay got it so i sat down in the car now i
*  don't have a clue how to start the fucker right so i had to google i'm saying i'm not gonna i'm not
*  gonna walk back all the way over there and say look i'm such an idiot so i sat there and i google how
*  do you start a tesla right right and i had to sit and watch this stupid video and it was fine and
*  then i will say yeah i was i was very impressed i loved it it was a great experience i had never
*  done that before yeah right and then bizarre how fast they are it was crazy right bizarre and and
*  then you know then you got to figure out how to charge it and that was a whole nother oh yeah and
*  you got to make sure that there's chargers available right and some places a fucking line
*  yeah you got to wait an hour to get on that goddamn thing right and we're gonna sit in there for an
*  hour and we're all going to drive electric vehicles when you don't we don't have the capacity yet
*  right i mean come on we don't have the grid's not ready for it yet no not only that the fucking
*  source of the minerals is a horror story yeah yeah oh uh i meant to tell you there's a great story in
*  uh which was well street journal today and i love when they have stories like this because i'm
*  thinking no no shit sherlock it's about um it's about access for the uh uh defense industry to
*  magnets right rare earth magnets which you need for everything submarines f-35s whatever think
*  about what you needed for i mean and magnets are also for obviously for a variety of everything
*  else household appliances and shit um 92 percent of rare earth uh magnets are controlled by china
*  right now right materials and and manufacturing and so now the u.s is suddenly realizing that
*  they've got an issue because a while back a handful of years ago they put in place a law that
*  will actually come into effect in 27 in a big way which says you know no magnets you know from
*  china where the materials or their processing or uh manufacturers in china so we don't have the
*  capacity why why can't we get them after 2027 from china well that's that's kind of when they
*  said that's it because we want to be in control of something this critical to a variety of things
*  right and so the cap well ability well yeah i mean we do uh look rare earth it's interesting rare
*  earth minerals are not they're not called that because of their rareness right they're they're
*  actually you know you could all your critical minerals are more difficult to get your hands on
*  but it's it's the refining process that that's kind of makes them difficult and we can get them
*  we could we could have this capacity we could we could have had the capacity for years and years
*  and years but we it's the regulatory policies right so it's like the mining industry in the
*  states is only there's more about it's almost dead because you know we put in place so many
*  regulations that say you can't no i can't do that it's bad for the environment well you know
*  what's worse for the environment is the way that they fucking mine these things overseas right
*  whether it's in china or africa or wherever else and so we've we've kind of shot ourselves in the
*  foot with this but they're now starting to catch anyway it's a good article wall street journal
*  if they're going to catch on like where do they get these is there a place where they can do it
*  where they don't ruin everything there's a another article i found right below it's talked about
*  mountain pass yeah which used to be a huge place said if it was oil it would be considered
*  saudi arabia is that where the donner party died uh yeah maybe between california and
*  avada says right here is that where they died world's number one source of rare yes bro
*  started in a gold rush and then production changed and things changed is it still the
*  number one source mountain passes arguably the best rare earth asset in the world whoa if it were
*  oil it would be saudi arabia let's start digging bitches yeah he was talking about the refining of
*  it and that's i think this article starts talking about yeah so we don't have the refineries yeah we
*  need to and so they're starting to put money into whether it's us or the austrians or the germans
*  or whomever they're starting to you know realize but good news is they figured this out but while
*  we were paying attention to whatever we were focused on china was dominating you know above
*  90 percent and knowing right strategically thinking ahead years ago thinking what's going
*  to be important right and so they did and they don't you know they're not playing the same game
*  in terms of regulations and environmental concerns and practices and that's a good thing we should
*  have environmental concerns i'm not saying that no we certainly should but yeah china's not having
*  these concerns no they don't have it one of the wildest things that you know these social media
*  bots you know who knows what countries are yeah using these but there's a lot of them that are
*  being run by foreign countries and they'll a lot of times be like real inflammatory about climate
*  change and if they're funded by china while china is building coal plants all the time don't they
*  have like hundreds of new coal plants that they're building yeah opening up i forget what it was two
*  a week or so new coal plants yeah and the epa just just crushed the coal industry here over the past
*  week and a half or so with some new regulations that are going forward in terms of you know what
*  you have to reduce your emissions by nuclear isn't that the solution it would i would say
*  that the solution is all of the above right it's everything right and you gotta and yes eventually
*  work towards something that makes you know sense on the green energy front but yeah nuclear is
*  certainly a big part of it but uh we we get in this mindset you know it's like everything else
*  we get one it's got to be all this or it's got to be all that it's like it's like the way that we
*  have we have arguments um but yeah you're right the people should look at like if you have a an
*  environmental uh activist group right and they a lot of times they'll want to shut down a mining
*  operation here in the states right and it looks like it's a grassroots it's like the campus protest
*  looks like it's a grassroots thing oh it's just a neighborhood organization that's against this idea
*  right you got to dig into it a little bit and then next thing you know you find that there's
*  there's outside elements involved because it's in their best interests and china's figured this out
*  we've talked about this before they figured out that the way to impact the u.s for their own good
*  was to impact local and state regulations and regulatory policies towards things like mining
*  right because it's it it it helps them in their cause to dominate the industry or to dominate
*  whatever that market is that we're talking about so you know again it's just a matter of you know
*  peel back the layers pay attention think about what you're what you're doing um i wanted i did
*  want to oh this article talks about the overbuilding of plants but they're going to run less frequently
*  to keep their capacity high and then it's asked like why and that they might just be doing it
*  just in case yeah in case what oh no i wouldn't that's you know well maybe that's their they're
*  preparing for their electric cars by the way china has the most advanced electric car suspension
*  that i've ever even heard of it's so good that you could drive over speed bumps and you could have
*  glasses balance on the hood well it sounds like that old saturday night live skit where they said
*  the ride was so smooth in the lincoln you could conduct a circumcision in the back so they had a
*  they had a rabbi in the back of a lincoln doing a circumcision to show how smooth the trans the
*  suspension was well this makes that look like a motorbike like like a motocross bike holy
*  shit these things go over everything and they stay flat they don't feel anything the car just
*  stays flat as it's riding over all these bumps it's nuts and if you see how it works like all
*  the different things that are moving around inside of it all the machinery that they've developed to
*  have this insane suspension it's crazy china is like really innovating right now in the field of
*  electric cars and in a field of cars period but their electric cars have made massive leaps
*  because just a few years ago i think elon dismissed a lot of their electric cars but now he's like no
*  no no these are like really legitimate and they've got they've got their version of a rolls royce
*  that's like a million dollars and you can't even get it yeah we've seen these chinese rolls royce
*  is they're insane yeah and they've also and part of that is because they've been strategic about
*  locking up uh critical minerals right overseas in terms of you know getting in there working with
*  countries to lock up that market and also to dominate completely the refining side of things
*  right they've got the confidence in knowing you know where they where they can take this and so
*  this is like okay we can dominate the ev market you know because we've done the we've done the
*  hard work ahead of this thing wow this is their the chinese version of rolls royce and it's supposed
*  to be sick like you get inside of you like oh my god this car is incredible but you can't even
*  get them in america yeah i like my jeep grand wagoneer better jeep grand wagoneers are great
*  but i would drive this dope ass chinese luxury sled this thing looks insane hey you know that
*  that uh thing you sent me about the manta yeah yes yes yes that's that's sea ship yeah the uh
*  looks like a ufo it's fantastic it's it's um uh it's that u uh underwater uh unmanned vehicle
*  that's it right there yeah yeah that's that's what i hope america is making without me knowing with
*  my tax dollars and we and we are here we are making shit like this look at that thing man
*  that is so cool like that is if you imagined like what was going to be like the kind of technology
*  this is in 2024 in like 1967 that would be right up there yeah like a spaceship that they use in
*  the ocean yeah and it's and it's fantastic because it is it's it you you can you know
*  manufactured thousands of them right and they're for very specific purposes they're long duration
*  unmanned vehicles underwater uh low power right so interesting they're doing this that that thing
*  called energy harvesting but they're getting it from the the gradient salinity in the in the water
*  and the change in saltiness in the water but it is fascinating but i part of this is explain that
*  how do they do that no i'd like to say that i'm a gradient salinity uh you know aficionado but i'm
*  not um but this is this is interesting because they were behind the curve in developing uh
*  particularly from a naval perspective these these uh new capabilities and we're seeing how the drones
*  and the unmanned vehicles from a naval perspective have impacted ukraine right and their ability to
*  attack the russian black sea fleet we're seeing what the hoodies are doing with them right and
*  we've been a little slow to the game and so you know it's interesting to watch now that they're
*  developing things like this which you can take apart and then ship someplace right it doesn't
*  need to travel underwater to get to where it's going right you just you ship it off you put it
*  together you assemble it you put it in and it's got a variety of uses and can carry payloads but
*  it's it is it is fascinating but there's a there's also we talked about ai and there's something else
*  that darpa's been doing because this is a darpa related project as well is something called ace
*  and they've just finished um an ai and machine learning dogfight they've created a it's like
*  x something x 62 uh which isn't yeah so autonomous now you you put two guys in there there's still
*  pilots in this thing it's a modified f-16 essentially that you you've got two guys in
*  there but they're not flying it so they've conducted actual uh dogfight scenarios against
*  a human crew f-16 right and it's it's remarkable this this plane is using ai and machine learning
*  to uh to dogfight basically and is it winning against yes yeah yeah and you know so you still
*  have a couple of guys in there but they're just there like an autonomous truck right they're just
*  there in case things go wrong right they can take control but it's it's unbelievable and in the
*  sensor tests yeah how what is the range well in the virtual tests well it's it's it would be the
*  range of of an f-16 right i mean it's you you've you've got um so the all the everything that's
*  computing all the that's all happening in the computer and it's learning on the plane and it's
*  making decisions faster than the human pilot can do it it's not connected to the internet at all
*  with sky with sky net or whatever the fuck that is sky net oh a starlink starlink sky net bro
*  starlink yeah no it's but i wanted to bring that up because that is that is to me that's
*  remarkable and yeah insane that's insane that it's doing it in real time yeah the jet it's crazy um
*  but it makes sense there's no margin for error it would get it perfect and they're in the virtual
*  tests that they did and the virtual tests they were undefeated against humans right so yeah you
*  think about what that means down the road okay so what do you think these drones are that people
*  keep seeing or these uaps i should say oh yeah some of them they think are drones they're like
*  hovering over ships right what do you do you think these are foreign if china can make electric cars
*  that advanced right and we can make drones that are pretty fucking advanced yeah what kind of
*  shit do they have well i think it's i think you're right i think most of the most of that uap sightings
*  and i think it's important to for them i'm glad the government and the defense departments finally
*  at least come forward to some degree to say look we've got we've got an interest in this we want
*  to investigate we want to know what these things are these sightings that we can't
*  readily identify off the bat look we were tricked out in the korean war the russians you know designed
*  the mig whatever it was the mig-15 maybe and we had no idea right so they they come out they roll
*  out the mig-15 against we were still using you know uh you know old rotor aircraft from um uh
*  propeller aircraft from world war ii in korea at the outset and we didn't know that the russians
*  had advanced material science to the point that they had so that they could build something like
*  this so it would be insane for us to think somehow that the chinese you know who have proven themselves
*  to be brilliant at reverse engineering other people's technology haven't figured out something
*  else so that yeah there's there's always this game of trying to understand how advanced they are and
*  i suspect some of the uap sightings are definitely probably chinese i don't i don't think the russians
*  necessarily but uh not that they wouldn't try or not trying but i i suspect the chinese are
*  further advanced on this and they've stolen a lot of technology from us over the years and we've
*  talked about that but um i think a number of the uap sightings that that get listed are just that
*  but that's why they do it that's why they have a an office now that you know they've admitted to
*  that investigates because it's a national security issue you've got to know if a hostile state
*  has created something that we are not aware of right propulsion or material science or whatever
*  it may be how much of that stuff could be kept secret and for how long do you think like is it
*  like is it equivalent in terms of like the physicists that are working on this in china
*  versus the ones that are working on it over here like is it possible that somebody made some sort
*  of a propulsion breakthrough well yeah anti-gravity or something yeah that was the thing we had this
*  lady um that went missing do you know that story yeah yeah yeah yeah um
*  she was but she was working on an anti-gravity device and she went back to china for a little bit
*  and then yeah but came back here there's been some talk about you know there's some various
*  people uh saboteur pice um and some others who have been working on supposedly on things you
*  know similar you know various propulsion systems anti-gravity you know um how do you you know how
*  do you change the laws of physics right and i don't know that if i don't know how long that
*  could be kept secret for right because could you keep it here for a little bit though yeah yeah you
*  could but at some point you know it's going to get rolled out and you know someone's going to get
*  wind of something it's human nature um and we're always trying we're always working just like the
*  chinese always working against us we're always working understand what they got and so you know
*  i'm not a big believer that you know you keep secrets of an immense nature like that for a
*  long period of time well if they did keep it a secret if that's what the tic tac thing was
*  that was 2004 yeah it's hard to imagine them having that complex uh propulsion system it's
*  so alien from what we we currently know yeah and have that 20 years ago and no one hears about it
*  now i know i know and that's that is a long time that is the i've been in conversation with some
*  folks who want to do a new series on on uaps right and you know i keep coming back to that incident
*  right yeah and fravor and the folks that were involved in those sightings as one of those things
*  right like if i had to you know because a lot of things can be explained away that one still is a
*  tough one right that's a tough one yeah there were a lot of eyes on target radars and and the and the
*  wingman and there was a lot of things here that just didn't add up the physical movement of it
*  if all the machinery works if all the sensors work if all the detection equipment all the the
*  if all that stuff is accurate that thing's doing something that no one's ever even seen oh no
*  absolutely no sign of propulsion system um speed of movement change of direction everything was so
*  bizarre um but that's again what we're what we're looking for and we're moving and eventually we
*  get in that direction right eventually you have an explainable technology that could create something
*  like that right back then like you said i know maybe 2004 is so long ago in terms of technology
*  yeah no i know right it sounds crazy but 20 years ago is a fucking totally different world well
*  there's that that exponential advancement of technology as you go along and as you create
*  things but which is really crazy if that was ours so if we if we had something like that in 2004
*  who where what how much money where'd you get the smart guys i don't think that would have been the
*  case because i think that that we wouldn't have heard about it because i think they would have had
*  a classified briefing with fragrance say you saw nothing don't worry about it you know it's all
*  done that's the case or do you think they allow some talk about it because a lot of the talk is
*  nutty anyway a lot of these people that believe in you you're right yeah i i am open-minded about
*  the idea to a certain extent but a lot of these people that they could be telling you bigfoot
*  stories it's like this same kind of folks there's people that just see shit and it makes it makes
*  their life way more interesting and then there's there's people that have really seen such things
*  i have good friends that have seen things so bizarre things yeah you've talked about that yeah
*  and i and i grabbed talked to a couple of pilots around iraq and they said we were flying nighttime
*  saw shit that we couldn't explain we had no idea what the fuck it was over the skies of iraq while
*  we were on a sortie and so yeah i i'm well then it gets to like tucker carlson territory
*  he believes they're like spiritual beings yeah yeah i'm not sure he thinks they're like
*  interdimensional travels or something skinwalker ranch and if that's true then the world just got
*  so much weirder imagine us trying to deny that this whole time but that's really what was going
*  on yeah although you know what it would help to explain a lot of things maybe and we could
*  at least it wouldn't seem like we're you know i don't know that yeah i i'm not you know me i'm
*  not i'm not a conspiracy theorist i don't believe that because i again i'm going back to your point
*  i don't believe that people can keep secrets for a long period of time right but what about the
*  Kennedy papers well there is that okay all right well or the one that we talked about this before
*  martin luther king yeah yeah that's the one that's the one that if if you're going to really dig in
*  i just you're never going to shift me off the position that there were
*  state local officials federal whatever involved in that it just doesn't make sense still um
*  you might have conspiracies are real exactly yeah some of them are real oh yeah yeah and and it's
*  and it's it's yeah you go back to the uip thing it'd be insane to say that there's no such thing
*  my favorite one is the roswell one because if that one's real roswell crash of 47 yeah yeah yeah
*  yeah i don't know that one i'm not yeah i don't know i don't know seriously i don't know you're
*  looking at me like it's an interesting one you just looked at me like come on bro you know come on
*  you know you wouldn't tell us that's the problem or would i no you wouldn't you wouldn't be able
*  to yeah but maybe if you wanted to give me more disinformation you can give me some some nuts
*  that's a whole there's a whole segment of society out there that believes that i'm just here to to
*  push disinformation right that's my job well you're here because you're a nice guy and you're a smart
*  guy and you actually know what you're talking about and so i don't i know what i read and i go
*  oh my god what does that mean and so i can have you in here and you can explain things from a guy
*  actually understands the comp you had the best explanation of what's going on in the middle east
*  i've heard yet yeah well thank you i appreciate do you mind if i do now on the heels of that do
*  you mind if i do a little shameless marketing oh there's some shameless marketing okay so you know
*  we've got the president's daily brief uh the podcast and that started up in september it's
*  done remarkably well despite me being the host uh yeah and uh so it's it's every morning every
*  afternoon it's it we touch on we hit the the top issues critical issues of the day international
*  stories conflicts whatever um and because it's done well uh that's the weekdays that they're
*  going to launch a um a weekend version extended weekend version on our youtube channel so we're
*  going to video so starting saturday may 18th we're going to take the pdb it's going to still
*  be during the weekdays on spotify and all your other pod podcast platforms but then on saturday
*  may 18th we start with this the situation report will be an extended version on youtube with video
*  we're going to have guests um and uh which leads me to my question of how do you interview guests
*  but it's going to be great news commentary we're going to have some very interesting people
*  same idea touching on critical issues and stories we're going to just stick with the facts we're
*  going to stay away from opinion right which i think is one of the reasons why the pdb has done well
*  um is that it's 20 minutes in the morning 10 minutes in the afternoon we hit the facts try
*  to stay away from opinion occasionally i might you know make some stupid remark but for the most
*  part it's just a little bit of context and then you know you get on your way bob's your uncle a
*  little bit of personality flavored in with a little personality yeah i try not to inject
*  too much because nobody wants that um but it's yeah it's good people need to hear these kind of
*  balanced perspectives on things i think it's very important that you provide it because you're
*  actually a person who really understands these conflicts it's because most of us it's the whole
*  idea behind it's so alien like what the hell's going on over there like it takes so long to try
*  to penetrate to just like oh so who's funding that now and then iran is doing what and then so
*  why do they want that oh there's a cords and what how do what do you cords mean and what happens oh
*  okay yeah like all that stuff is fucking complicated it's hard to find like a singular source where you
*  could just sit down and read it all and have it all make sense to you well it's and and i think
*  that's that was the reason why we talked about that that was the reason why i said okay i agreed
*  to do it was because they said look we want to stick with the news right we want to try to get
*  back to the old days here's the news and again it's always going to there's going to be a little
*  context or analysis in there but for the most part just give people what's happening tell them
*  what's happening don't tell them how to think about it necessarily just tell them what's happening
*  and the the president's daily briefs got a great it's got a great staff you know it's not like i'm
*  you know doing everything i'm just sort of like the the monkey crashing the symbols together
*  there's a very unfortunate sort of combining of the people that give you the news with people
*  that think they're activists you know or people that think that it's very important that you
*  stick to a very specific narrative and ignore information that's contrary to what your belief
*  system says right well if all you do is just say here's what's happening right here's what we know
*  is happening right and you don't try to again you don't try to tell people what to think and you
*  don't try to say okay we're going to approach it from a particular point of view and leave out half
*  of what's happening right right yeah so just and it's like that old thing you know there's there's
*  still some news outlets out there that that do a good job of of just presenting facts but most of
*  them you know like you pointed there is most of them are opinion-based right and you know if you
*  look at um if you sort of look at the the there's a survey that regularly looks at the news in terms
*  of objectivity right and it changes somewhat and interestingly your your show doesn't change much
*  right it's always kind of it's right up there in terms of because you're not you know other news
*  outlets disappear off of there or they change position in terms of relative objectivity right
*  but yours has been very consistent but you've got outfits like fox news or cnn and they'll drop off
*  the radar right because they become nothing but opinion right for a period of time then maybe
*  they self-correct and they realize we need more news we need more facts so they'll come back on
*  the survey and come up higher in terms of relative credibility of actual news so anyway it's yeah it
*  goes back to our original story everybody's got to be a little bit more careful um because it's
*  getting more dangerous out there in terms of disinformation yeah it's it's getting weird it's
*  getting weird when you know we've talked about this before but it's an important number that the
*  this guy who used to work for the fbi who analyzed twitter and said he believed that it was as much as
*  80 percent of them were bots seriously yeah i did not pull that pull that up jimmy it's crazy
*  because he might be right man like there's there's really sophisticated ones oh yeah yeah you know
*  there's and then there's ones that are very crude there's ones that is just like a bunch of letters
*  and a bunch of numbers right and it's someone just retweeting like patriotic things you say every day
*  and you know okay that i know what that is top cyber security expert claims that more than 80
*  percent of twitter accounts are probably bots and this is 2022 yeah so this was in the process of
*  elon buying this all this stuff was going on so that's interesting yeah they were looking at this
*  and they were saying like when did he buy it that's part of the catalyst i thought because he wanted
*  to find out right many were bought right but they they told him it was five percent i think you mean
*  old jack what's his name the guy that ran twitter yeah yeah yeah yeah but i think yeah elon felt
*  like they didn't base it on enough of an analysis they did based on a small number of accounts i
*  can't imagine it's 80 percent right i can't imagine that sounds crazy it does sound insane
*  i i'm sure it's higher than five percent sure sounds higher than five percent tweeted musk along
*  with the tag in the news article okay so dan woods global head of intelligence and cyber security
*  company f5 who spent more than 20 years of the u.s federal law enforcement and intelligence
*  organizations told the australian that more than 80 percent of twitter accounts are probably bots
*  yeah it's so nuts yeah it's somewhere between five and 80 if he's even if he's halfway right
*  even if it's 50 let's just say 50 40 let's even say 40 percent's crazy right 40 percent of robots
*  and then you and that but that is that's probably you're probably getting to to to accurate because
*  i think just the chinese alone right in the russians yeah they invest an enormous amount
*  of resource into this because they know it's effective right and they know how damaging it
*  can be and why wouldn't you right why wouldn't you why wouldn't you right and this cyber era
*  you know it's it's a way to influence people's opinions it really is it's crazy how well it
*  works yeah and if you can if you can just get like arguments going on twitter you know people get
*  engaged in those are the you do like start a fire and run away from it yeah yeah um can i ask you
*  one more question yeah uh what is your what would be your best advice for uh interviewing people
*  because like i said we're starting this show and it's going to have guests on it do you have one
*  thing that you've learned over the years in terms of talking to people and getting the best out of
*  what they say i think it's just a numbers thing i don't think it's one thing i think it's like
*  everything else like you you realize when you're being clunky like i do it all the time i really
*  i'm like yeah i interrupted too quick like i didn't know like when to step in when not to it
*  happens all the time and so you always got to like try to get the most out of your guest that's my
*  my idea when i go into a conversation is i want to talk to and we're going to talk to each other
*  but i'm just trying to get the most out of you you know i'm trying to encourage what you're saying
*  just like ask more questions i'm trying to just genuinely engage with what you're saying and get
*  the most out of you the problem with a lot of people when they host things is generally like
*  you want to talk and so if you want to talk you start talking yeah and then sometimes you talk too
*  much and then the guest doesn't talk enough and it's like it's a balancing act but i always go
*  into it like with the intention of like whatever this person's doing like help them make it the
*  best version of this discussion that i can provide okay yeah no i know what you mean about the because
*  like you go on a new show and yeah the question is five minutes yeah and you think okay well that
*  question includes a lot of the talking points that you producers asked me to send to you
*  so so all right then okay no that's yeah that that makes sense those shows are so limited man
*  yeah it's a real problem because if this is how most people consume complex information
*  it's too limited there's just your explanation of all the shit that's going on with gaza and israel
*  just just that alone that had to take 15 minutes right yeah yeah and you're making these like
*  summaries that are easily digestible well yeah you and they'll say okay you got you know we got
*  30 seconds left uh how are they going to solve the problem in gaza jesus christ so crazy it's just
*  like that format of a limited amount of time to talk about complex things right in this day and
*  age it just doesn't really make sense anymore but to tell people i mean whether it's that or whether
*  it's the you know i get my news from tiktok i get my news from x i get no that's the way to get it
*  tiktok's the way to get it yeah they're going to be the most honest there's definitely when you find
*  out the difference between american tiktok and chinese tiktok oh god chinese tiktok's doing it
*  right yeah it's all like science achievements athletic performances martial arts yeah there's
*  no way that zhi regime would never let their youth get on american tiktok you think you could
*  be a dude giving makeup tutorials and chinese tiktok they'll fucking find you they'll find you
*  no it's true and so that's always a thing when when i talk to my kids about it and and uh you
*  know i always tell them don't use tiktok don't get on tiktok and you know it's but they're gonna do
*  it they're gonna do it their friends are on it everybody's on it it's crack yeah it is those
*  kids are cracked out it's an incredible time suck which again they know right the chinese regime
*  knows they understand this but but think about tiktok in terms of its disinformation capabilities
*  going into an election right and the white house has a problem right because the biden campaign
*  team has been using tiktok and at the same time they're trying to say we shouldn't use tiktok i
*  think it's a danger it's a national security issue but we but we found it very effective for reaching
*  the young market right and so they're they have no grounds to stand on when they talk about a
*  national security issue they got a problem they got to figure that one out again not to not to
*  get overly political they're dancing with the devil uh yeah you made a deal with she she sorry
*  but if it's that's the thing is if like there's this little dance they can make you more effective
*  and make your opponents less effective that's a crazy manipulation of the way people think about
*  things and you don't you don't think that that's true but it's just like what what percentage of
*  what side are you getting if you're getting like 80 percent of your information that's very specific
*  to one ideology that's not good for anybody and kids aren't thinking about that it's been a
*  progression right it used to be from the daily show with john stewart that's where people young
*  people get in their news right now they've aged out and now young people are turning to tiktok and
*  and and they're getting their news and they're not thinking okay of course they're not thinking
*  about they're not thinking i wonder if the chinese regime is is is you know constructing this in a
*  certain way but of course they are and of course they understand the and and that's really the
*  danger people talk about the danger of tiktok is their ability to harvest uh personal information
*  right and that's a problem to some degree but the bigger problem is 170 million american users of
*  tiktok being vulnerable and reachable by a chinese regime that does not have our best interests at
*  heart by any means right so that's the bigger issue i think rather than the harvesting of
*  personal data which amazon and google and everybody else already has it right they got
*  they got all that shit so it's not you know yes it's a hostile regime and yes they're harvesting
*  your data but you know i think it's more of the i think it's more of the disinformation campaign
*  and the potential for that that is the is the problem with with tiktok because if you can't
*  control like if rather if you can control if you can control exactly what percentage of stuff gets
*  out like if someone if you can limit someone's reach like if someone posts something and it's
*  some right wing philosophy and they post that and they immediately tag it as such and limit its reach
*  but then you take the other one and you expand its reach whatever the contrary position is and
*  you promote it and you push it out everywhere how much of an effect does that have on young people
*  well and that's and that's the whole point of the game anyway is to is is you know you're suppressing
*  and you're promoting and and again you're doing it to an audience for the most part that is very
*  vulnerable yeah and so i yeah i i'm again i don't know that that they're going to ban tiktok somebody's
*  going to come in and view that as a as an opportunity buy right and i think so they will be able to sell
*  it even though right now bite dance is saying absolutely not we're not going to sell it you know
*  i think they i think they probably will right i don't see them banning it from you from app stores
*  so i mean think about the angst that would create amongst the tweens and the
*  well i think the fear is the language that's being used here though too right that this could be
*  interpreted as the ability to censor other social media sites sure yeah yeah yeah and that you really
*  can't give the government that power especially based on what they saw in the twitter files
*  yeah yeah you can't okay sir and yes yeah if you're if you're looking to suppress accurate
*  information because you don't like what what you think that's going to do for an election like
*  that doesn't seem like you should be able to do that yeah this this seems like that's that should
*  be that that's not good don't do that if you if you develop that's our organization that is allowed
*  to do that to all of social media by law you're in territory that's real slippery now because it's
*  just so ripe for corruption right and it always goes back to this which you talked about before
*  which is this idea that well okay if one president can do this to you know another former president
*  then the next one goes the next one goes and it's the same problem right hey it maybe sounds good to
*  us right now to to censor something or to uh suppress something but we're not going to be in
*  charge forever unless they've figured that out um how they can be in charge forever it's so dangerous
*  it's so dangerous that it's it's so ubiquitous it's so everywhere and you don't know how much of what
*  people are seeing is being manipulated right right well again you know not to not to beat a dead horse
*  but you know if people could take away one idea it's that you gotta it's incumbent upon you and
*  you know whether it's for you or whether it's for the sake of your kids to to be curious and to
*  actually make the fucking effort to understand what it is that you're seeing and reading and hearing
*  and yes it takes time and you know maybe it sounds daunting and you'd rather have the government do it
*  right but that's that's that's not a good idea right i think it comes down to individual
*  responsibility like a lot of things in life and i don't know that i'm optimistic about that as
*  being the solution but i don't see another way around it right i mean you we can detect we can
*  we can create apps to protect and be proactive you can do all those things which are incredibly
*  important but ultimately it comes down to the individual and if they don't take it upon themselves
*  yeah to go back to our earlier point then you know we're fucked yeah well i have uh hope
*  look at you look at you glass half full i'm a half full kind of guy these days i feel like
*  that's because you got kids it's also because um i i know that most people are good people
*  and that i think people get swept up in madness and i think they get swept up in tribalism and
*  that's a real problem with someone that says polarizing is trump right yeah and it's a real
*  problem because you have to accept the nonsense that biden is okay if you're on the left like
*  both of them are like they they they lock up like the fucking dolphins versus the raiders and people
*  get on teams man they're like fuck the dolphins yeah that's what it is it's just people people
*  get super fucking tribal it's in our nature we have to fight to avoid it yeah and the more extreme
*  that you get on one side the more extreme the other side gets and they because they think look
*  and again you get this this notion that i'm saving the country one side or the other right both sides
*  the heart edges of both sides feel like they're the ones that are trying to save the country
*  yeah and they have to win just like they want the yankees to win oh my god it's really like that it
*  becomes the number one team it's the biggest sport and you know that's why it's important to
*  have a big personality it's part of the whole stupidity of it all yeah and ai is going to save
*  us from that you think that yeah you don't believe you don't believe it you don't much better
*  government it's going to be much better government it won't even be controlled at all by people
*  it runs on its own algorithm that it created after it realized the flaws
*  in the way human beings are processing reality do you know what the u.s government's trying to do
*  right now they're trying to get china and russia to sign up to an agreement essentially an
*  international treaty that would ensure that ai does not uh alone run uh nuclear weapon systems
*  right and there is no treaty that prevents that right now there's no treaty that that prevents
*  uh taking the humans out of that decision making process oh my god so i mean the russians did during
*  the soviet union days so they're going to be playing like some kind of crazy world war chess
*  yeah yeah yeah with supercomputers yeah but right now it's the u.s is committed to this idea that
*  we're not going to take the human out but the russians and chinese have not then no one's going
*  to commit to that why would you commit to the have the best weapon of all time you already said that
*  these fighter pilots exactly can't compete with these things that are ai controlled that's nuts
*  yeah it's a it's a it's a problem i was about to say there's a statement of the obvious top gun
*  three is fucked what are they going to do i did not see what is top gun three going to do i didn't
*  see top gun two well you're unamerican sir did you watch it i watched a little bit of it
