# JRE MMA Show #148 with Bernard Hopkins
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3.0s)]
*  We're here. What's up? Pleasure to meet you, man. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8.0s)]
*  I've been a gigantic fan of yours for a long time, so it's a real pleasure. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=12.0s)]
*  That's what I've been hearing, Joe, but you know, I've also become a fan [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=16.0s)]
*  in the last couple of years before you came to Austin. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=21.0s)]
*  I go out to LA a lot to do boxing, promoting in West Coast, East Coast [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=26.0s)]
*  with the Golden Boy Promotion. I'm a partner of Oscar De La Hoya, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=31.0s)]
*  so good to be met and good to meet you also. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=35.0s)]
*  What is it like transitioning from being a fighter to being a promoter? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=38.0s)]
*  Because Oscar, yourself, Floyd, only a few fighters have managed [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=42.0s)]
*  to do that successfully like you have. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=47.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's not just walking into it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=49.0s)]
*  I sort of got groomed in my career based on, I'll say, the last eight, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=53.0s)]
*  nine years of my 30-year career. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=60.0s)]
*  I took on the ownership and responsibility of making the last decisions. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=63.0s)]
*  I hired people that can give me the right information. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=69.0s)]
*  Not a lot, but just a few people that can give me the right information [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=73.0s)]
*  about this particular fight. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=76.0s)]
*  For instance, Kelly Pavlik in Atlantic City, Oscar De La Hoya fight in 06, 06, 07. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=79.0s)]
*  And I groomed myself for this moment to be able to be independent, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=86.0s)]
*  but also learn the business. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=92.0s)]
*  And let me tell you, it is difficult. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=95.0s)]
*  It's difficult not doing a job per se, but it's difficult in a business, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=97.0s)]
*  in a street, in a street, in a street. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=103.0s)]
*  It's difficult in a business, in a structure of the business of boxing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=106.0s)]
*  The small family in boxing, whether they're here or there in a promotional setting [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=112.0s)]
*  or a commissioner setting, they would definitely try to discourage you [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=119.0s)]
*  by any means necessary. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=123.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can imagine, especially yourself, because you had had so many issues [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=126.0s)]
*  with promoters over the years, and you were so vocal about it, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=131.0s)]
*  unlike a lot of other fighters. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=134.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, because I was one, forced to do it, to fight back. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=136.0s)]
*  And then second, I looked at it as I didn't really have a choice, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=143.0s)]
*  even though I could have laid down, or got down to their demands. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=148.0s)]
*  But I understood one thing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=156.0s)]
*  My instincts of survival, but also not just being in the game, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=160.0s)]
*  I wanted different for myself. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=166.0s)]
*  And I had one bad experience, well, I had a couple of bad experiences, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=168.0s)]
*  but I had one, the first bad experience I had early in my career. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=171.0s)]
*  And I wound up getting out of that deal with Butch Lewis. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=176.0s)]
*  And I can mention names, not because he's deceased, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=180.0s)]
*  but I can mention it because I wound up being actually sued [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=183.0s)]
*  based on keeping me in check. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=187.0s)]
*  But I fired back, and I wound up counterpunching, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=190.0s)]
*  and got out of that situation, and spoke boldly about it, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=195.0s)]
*  and moved on to try to wake others up. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=200.0s)]
*  Not actually preach, but just bring it up about my situation. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=202.0s)]
*  If anybody recognized and experienced it, any fighter or anybody else, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=206.0s)]
*  they can grab some knowledge. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=210.0s)]
*  But that was the start of it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=211.0s)]
*  That was the start of it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=213.0s)]
*  My first professional fight, not first, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=215.0s)]
*  but my first championship fight was Roy Jones Jr. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=218.0s)]
*  And that fight was a parody fight. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=221.0s)]
*  It was a split, 1.4 split between me and Roy Jones. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=224.0s)]
*  I had the contract, I kept all the stuff, even to today. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=228.0s)]
*  I can go back and reflect and bring not only contact for what I'm speaking about, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=230.0s)]
*  but I kept it because I paid for it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=237.0s)]
*  It's called litigation. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=239.0s)]
*  And so I said to myself, how can it be a number? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=241.0s)]
*  750, 725 split, parody, the word parody. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=247.0s)]
*  And I get 80,000 when it's all said and done. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=254.0s)]
*  Now, remind you, I'm fresh out of the penitentiary. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=257.0s)]
*  88, 89, 90, 90. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=261.0s)]
*  I rebooted my career after losing my first fight. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=263.0s)]
*  Didn't box for 15 months. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=267.0s)]
*  So now we're in the early 90s. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=269.0s)]
*  And I rebooted myself back into reaching a goal that I eventually reached. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=272.0s)]
*  But the business part, it had me thinking in between those moments of climbing the ladder, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=279.0s)]
*  of being a contender, that this is more than just going in the ring and winning and not winning. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=290.0s)]
*  This was something that I had to learn quick on a job learning. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=299.0s)]
*  There's a lot of shenanigans in boxing. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=303.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=306.0s)]
*  You were... [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=307.0s)]
*  I mean, you got to support this unregulated, right? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=308.0s)]
*  Whether that means anything to people or not. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=310.0s)]
*  But there's no checks and balances there. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=313.0s)]
*  The people that set the rules break the rules. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=315.0s)]
*  I'm going to say that again. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=318.0s)]
*  The people that set the rules break the rules. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=320.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, where can you... [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=323.0s)]
*  Is that the thing that they said was going to go off? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=328.0s)]
*  This is happening. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=331.0s)]
*  Let's make sure it's not a real problem. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=333.0s)]
*  National test. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=336.0s)]
*  This is a national test. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=338.0s)]
*  See, I was thinking maybe again, that was somebody through boxing, they know it's ready to come out. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=340.0s)]
*  They took the business. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=346.0s)]
*  You know these people, man. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=348.0s)]
*  You got to understand that it's possible. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=349.0s)]
*  But the possibility of getting ousted, blackballed, in boxing, such a small circle of separate entities [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=352.0s)]
*  that will come together to oust that enemy. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=365.0s)]
*  So you got to understand the bulls-eye is still on my back for certain reasons. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=370.0s)]
*  Because now, even though I'm in a different position of not only power, but for my career, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=376.0s)]
*  what I stood up for is not like the past. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=384.0s)]
*  So as a promoter today, and Oscar Delahoye, go to more promotion. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=390.0s)]
*  The day we sign, the day we became partners, we don't become those who we despise. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=397.0s)]
*  Now that's deep. That was 20-something years ago. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=407.0s)]
*  You can find that anywhere out there in social media. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=410.0s)]
*  It's there. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=413.0s)]
*  We suited up and booted with contracts after signing. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=414.0s)]
*  And that was one of the statements that I continue to bring up 20-plus years later and be consistent about it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=420.0s)]
*  Now that doesn't mean that every fighter is going to agree to the business side that you have to represent as a promoter. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=429.0s)]
*  But one thing for sure, if your talent brings what you're asking and your representation, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=438.0s)]
*  whether they name themselves, which boxing does, manager, consultant, advisor. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=448.0s)]
*  I mean, I just named three entities that suck in the blood out of the ignorance of the lack of knowledge of especially young ones and the ones that don't want to learn. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=455.0s)]
*  I'm not a savior. I'm not running and trying to save anyone. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=470.0s)]
*  But trying to understand my job and my role before my lights go out is that I love the sweet science. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=475.0s)]
*  But I also understand that boxing gave me a way not to be rotting in the penitentiary or in the graveyard. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=486.0s)]
*  That's what boxing did for me. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=496.0s)]
*  It gave me that opportunity that I had to walk the walk eventually. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=498.0s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=502.0s)]
*  That I had to make sure that even though things can happen where you come up short in the square circle, that I don't give up. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=504.0s)]
*  And so having that mentality and being consistent over the years and still be able to talk in 2023, still know my name, my social security, all the numbers that matters, all the things that attach to me is a blessing. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=513.0s)]
*  I'm not bragging. I'm different. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=526.0s)]
*  Let them argue. Let them on the side. Whoever. Fans or no fans. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=530.0s)]
*  One thing for sure, most will agree that I'm different. Whatever that difference is, I take it. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=537.0s)]
*  But I'm different. And keeping the course of being that as time move on, fast approaching 59 January 15th, 1965. I'm knocking on the door, 60. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=544.0s)]
*  You look fucking great. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=556.0s)]
*  Well, ducking helps. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=558.0s)]
*  Hands up. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=563.0s)]
*  Come on, man. Come on. One thing for sure. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=564.0s)]
*  If you duck more than you take, you can be able to express yourself as time go on and you better be some worthy to your family. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=567.0s)]
*  Now, you're going to be worthy if you're there. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=577.0s)]
*  But that's not fun to me. I want to be there like I am now. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=580.0s)]
*  I got a 12 year old son, Bernard, right? Three generations with him. Right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=584.0s)]
*  So I want to be there. He's played football. Right? Don't like boxing. Right? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=590.0s)]
*  Threw gloves at him. I guess when he was eight months, he threw them back. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=595.0s)]
*  So my whole thing is like not save or not preach as I've been accused of a couple of times. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=599.0s)]
*  But it just in me. The spirits in me. The Muhammad Ali spirits is in me. January 17, January 15. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=610.0s)]
*  I know that I'm here for more than a purpose that I took that road. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=617.0s)]
*  I came through that road, some things in my life that I felt that it was needed, that I had to do. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=621.0s)]
*  I had to be that because that was that mindset. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=627.0s)]
*  Once again, not change your course on the conversation. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=630.0s)]
*  Once I understood my value and boy, you can appreciate this. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=634.0s)]
*  When I understood my value in that penitentiary at 17, when I got certified at 17, five to 15. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=640.0s)]
*  So track five out of 15 in state prison that leaves you the back time to walk off called parole. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=650.0s)]
*  They had a boxing gym there and all of the Pennsylvania prisons, which was 30 plus. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=660.0s)]
*  Had boxing in a penitentiary that was part of baseball, flag football, handball on the wall. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=670.0s)]
*  That spark. That flame came back from little short amateur career I had. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=680.0s)]
*  That's how I built my reputation up in my neighborhood. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=686.0s)]
*  I always fought, fight in the streets, fighting in school. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=689.0s)]
*  How old were you when you first boxed as an amateur? When did you first walk in the gym? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=694.0s)]
*  Nine years old. My uncle took me to the gym. My mother's brother. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=697.0s)]
*  My father had a brother that boxed too. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=701.0s)]
*  They all was my weight while I was all their weight when I started middle weight. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=703.0s)]
*  My uncle was on both sides of the tree. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=708.0s)]
*  Mother and father boxed that middle weight in the 60s, 70s, early 70s. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=710.0s)]
*  So it's in my DNA. Can't help myself. It's who I am and who I became. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=716.0s)]
*  But I got back to it when I went to the penitentiary. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=722.0s)]
*  So when you were an amateur, were you taking it seriously or were you... [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=726.0s)]
*  No, I wasn't taking it seriously. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=732.0s)]
*  You weren't fully committed. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=733.0s)]
*  I was eating everything that anybody else was eating at that age in the neighborhood and what was there. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=734.0s)]
*  I mean, I remember fighting and getting a trophy about this big. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=739.0s)]
*  It's always the same stance, right? Plastic trophy. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=743.0s)]
*  But to me, that was like a gold medal. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=745.0s)]
*  You know, they got the trophy showing everybody in the neighborhood and the elementary school I was at. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=747.0s)]
*  And then they take you to... I don't want to get no free commercials, but they take you to this... [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=753.0s)]
*  still around to get a hamburger, french fries, and you probably know. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=759.0s)]
*  They take you there. We happy. That was it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=763.0s)]
*  It was an amateur program, but it was like the PAL. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=766.0s)]
*  I don't know if they have it here in Texas, the PAL, Call the Police Athletic League. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=770.0s)]
*  It's big over there in the East Coast. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=774.0s)]
*  So the PAL lead was structured to get young black urban men that's on the corner or young boys to go to PAL. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=776.0s)]
*  Anybody can go there, but mostly it was in our neighborhood. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=788.0s)]
*  They would come to the gym and you can sign up for amateur boxing. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=792.0s)]
*  You could be an Olympic gold medal. You can do this and do that. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=797.0s)]
*  But I had family members. I was in my DNA. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=800.0s)]
*  Once I was taken to the gym by Artie McLeod. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=804.0s)]
*  We call him Artie, but it was Arthur McLeod. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=808.0s)]
*  Called him Moose, my mother's brother. Middleweight, badass. Look him up. Artie McLeod. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=810.0s)]
*  The streets took his career. Obviously based on what? Lifestyle. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=817.0s)]
*  The streets of Philadelphia. The blue collar town worker. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=824.0s)]
*  Philadelphia can make you or break you when it comes to making it out of there. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=828.0s)]
*  Not only sports, any entertainer, any success that you might have on your back in the community. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=835.0s)]
*  And again, there's love there. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=842.0s)]
*  But a lot of us don't make it out even though the talent was better than mine. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=844.0s)]
*  Just the trap of the streets. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=851.0s)]
*  The trap of the streets, but also what you're used to doing and what you're used to thinking. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=854.0s)]
*  Listen, until I traveled through boxing, tell you how much boxing did for me. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=862.0s)]
*  To travel around the world multiple times. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=868.0s)]
*  Meet multiple people from every class of life that I believe. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=873.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it's people I haven't met. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=879.0s)]
*  But from here to there to status or power or influence, influencers. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=882.0s)]
*  I say, man, the world ain't just no Philly. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=892.0s)]
*  The world is not just Raymond Rosen projects. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=897.0s)]
*  So I start understanding now, like even sitting there watching at that time, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=903.0s)]
*  how the fork and the spoon and the butter knife is on one side of the table. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=910.0s)]
*  And I'm looking at him, look, this guy is taking a nap and putting it on the floor. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=918.0s)]
*  I think he's putting it on his lap. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=922.0s)]
*  I mean, this might sound ignorant, but you got to understand from that mindset of what I'm saying. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=924.0s)]
*  Not understand my experience because some haven't. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=931.0s)]
*  But I start paying attention. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=935.0s)]
*  That was the key. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=938.0s)]
*  Just like in the boxing business, I start paying attention. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=941.0s)]
*  Then once I got to the point where I had a voice means I had to do something in boxing. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=945.0s)]
*  Nobody cares if you consider it nobody. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=954.0s)]
*  Ten in one because I lost my first fight in Atlantic City to Clinton Mitchell. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=958.0s)]
*  I was out for nine months out of penitentiary. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=964.0s)]
*  I wanted to get right back in the ring before I grabbed a kilo of cocaine [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=967.0s)]
*  like everybody was selling in the 80s and 90s. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=970.0s)]
*  That was the plan? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=973.0s)]
*  I had a choice to do one or the other. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=976.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=980.0s)]
*  Listen, anybody on the West Coast and East Coast know the 80s and the 90s era. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=982.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=988.0s)]
*  The 80s and 90s era in urban city was get down and lay down. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=989.0s)]
*  Are you in or are you out? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=998.0s)]
*  That's all across the board. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1000.0s)]
*  Growing up being the guy named Heads, my nickname. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1003.0s)]
*  That was Heads? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1008.0s)]
*  Street name Heads. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1010.0s)]
*  When you see me coming, I had the same energy. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1014.0s)]
*  I had the same discipline. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1018.0s)]
*  It's going to sound weird. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1021.0s)]
*  The same discipline that people might think they know me over the years. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1023.0s)]
*  Fans, non-fans, and people that do know me, it's the same discipline I had in a negative way. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1027.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1033.0s)]
*  That really, again, not trying to paint my...the work is there. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1035.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure if they're going to archives of any police district or whatever [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1038.0s)]
*  or archives in City Hall down in Philadelphia, they can...or Harrisburg, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1042.0s)]
*  the records never go away. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1047.0s)]
*  They think they might have to bring them up one day, but I won't let it happen. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1049.0s)]
*  Not on my watch. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1053.0s)]
*  So I took all that experience, and it seemed like a long time ago, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1055.0s)]
*  but it feel like to me I lived three different times on this earth. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1065.0s)]
*  And I ain't even bring up the two stabbings that I wear to scar today from the back [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1073.0s)]
*  and one underneath my left chest. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1079.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of times, never been shot, that I could have done something, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1085.0s)]
*  be the lamb or be the wolf. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1095.0s)]
*  And I recognize to be the wolf is much better than being a lamb. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1097.0s)]
*  That the person I took stuff from, that I went up and looked through them [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1103.0s)]
*  while they looking at me, could have had a gun and blew my brains out, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1108.0s)]
*  which I've lost a brother a year under me, Michael. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1115.0s)]
*  I'm 58, he been 57. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1120.0s)]
*  His birthday was January 29, 1966, my January 15, 1965. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1124.0s)]
*  Got an older sister, she's only a year older, February 14, 1964. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1130.0s)]
*  My mother been in labor for three years in a row. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1137.0s)]
*  With six kids, when it's all said and done, my mother raised six kids, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1140.0s)]
*  but I was raising three, maybe four. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1145.0s)]
*  If you ask her if she was here, God rest her soul. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1148.0s)]
*  But she got a chance, and thank you for letting me ramble on, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1152.0s)]
*  she got a chance to see in person my talents that she always knew I had [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1158.0s)]
*  since I was an angry bad boy in elementary school. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1167.0s)]
*  She been up there a lot of times, teachers meetings. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1173.0s)]
*  She got a chance to see me beat Felix Trinidad, 9-11 in New York City, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1176.0s)]
*  just had an anniversary months ago. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1182.0s)]
*  Well, last month. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1185.0s)]
*  She got a chance to fly in the air for the first time, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1188.0s)]
*  whether it's commercial or jet, both. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1195.0s)]
*  She got a chance to visit places that she didn't have any dream of doing. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1198.0s)]
*  I gave that tour, and she passed in, I believe, 59, 58. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1207.0s)]
*  I lost my baby off a year, but my mother passed before 60. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1214.0s)]
*  She was young. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1217.0s)]
*  Here I feel great, knocking on 59. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1218.0s)]
*  She was already gone. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1223.0s)]
*  But every time I've done something, and she know I did it, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1226.0s)]
*  never even asked me, she showed up. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1236.0s)]
*  Whether it's a visit, whether it's $10 on the books, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1241.0s)]
*  she never gave up on me. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1248.0s)]
*  She never turned her back, even though she always threatened me with the, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1250.0s)]
*  this is the last time. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1258.0s)]
*  Now, she might have waited two or three days, but eventually she came [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1262.0s)]
*  and did all she can, whether it's taking a second or third mortgage out on the house [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1268.0s)]
*  to bail me out with a $300 or $400 or $1,000 bail bondsman. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1272.0s)]
*  Come on, child. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1278.0s)]
*  Like, until it's over, what I mean by that is, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1281.0s)]

*  You let somebody tell you it's over. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1297.0s)]
*  If you let them plan your funeral based on what you can and cannot do, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1300.0s)]
*  I'm sitting here in front of Joe Rogan. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1308.0s)]

*  Question on both sides. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1330.0s)]
*  I know I'm a testimony to it, and I'm pretty sure, because I've done some research, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1332.0s)]
*  I'll always like to know who I'm talking to once I got some knowledge of who I am [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1340.0s)]
*  and who I need to be affiliated with, business or non-business. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1344.0s)]

*  It's here, and then it's the physical. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1360.0s)]
*  The art of war, sun-zu. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1365.0s)]
*  I challenge everybody to get one of those teaching books and go through it every now and then. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1369.0s)]
*  The art of war has always been a guideline for me. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1377.0s)]

*  I started pro at 25. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1392.0s)]
*  When I told you how people try to write your own destiny, where you're going, to the grave [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1395.0s)]
*  or to success because you said it, I gave them the middle finger. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1399.0s)]
*  I gave them the middle finger, not physically, I gave them the middle finger in action, in deeds, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1403.0s)]
*  which holds a lot more weight. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1409.0s)]
*  It does a lot more weight. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1412.0s)]
*  And I wanted to let them know that. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1414.0s)]
*  So when you got to prison at 17, did you get serious about boxing then? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1416.0s)]
*  No. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1422.0s)]
*  Was that like your outlet? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1423.0s)]
*  No. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1424.0s)]
*  The first year I ran around the jail, when I mean run around the jail, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1425.0s)]
*  I was basically an inmate while 41, 45. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1429.0s)]
*  I basically knew people. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1434.0s)]
*  I didn't know certain people. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1436.0s)]
*  And you literally, you team up with the people you know in your neighborhood. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1438.0s)]
*  That's important. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1444.0s)]
*  That's important to have what? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1445.0s)]
*  Backup. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1447.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1449.0s)]
*  You must have that. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1450.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1451.0s)]
*  The Asians was there. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1453.0s)]
*  The Caucasians was there. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1455.0s)]

*  The Christians was there. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1458.0s)]
*  Everybody had sets. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1459.0s)]
*  So you need that. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1461.0s)]
*  Now, once you get there, somebody know you. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1463.0s)]
*  And somebody will know why you're there and what you're there for. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1469.0s)]
*  Now, you could say you're there for one thing, but the same people that checks you in basically with the guard watching over them, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1474.0s)]
*  know your whole case. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1482.0s)]
*  They basically do the work. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1485.0s)]
*  The inmates not attending lifers who's been there and they moved up in the ranks because of their clean record in the institution. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1488.0s)]
*  And they'll look at, oh, he say he got a robbery, but he got a rape. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1497.0s)]
*  He's saying he got a homicide, but he got auto theft. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1502.0s)]
*  So the credibility, crazy as might sound, the credibility of what you're there for lays not all said and done, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1507.0s)]
*  but it lays a foundation how they approach you. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1519.0s)]
*  And yo, listen, even a county before you get state time, you got to be in the county, you go back and forth to court, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1525.0s)]
*  and over 12 months is considered state time. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1535.0s)]
*  One and a half to five state time. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1540.0s)]
*  That's the half that got you to state. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1543.0s)]
*  It's a different ballgame at Greater Fort State Penitentiary. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1548.0s)]
*  Maximum security. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1554.0s)]
*  It's a different ballgame. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1558.0s)]
*  Knowing somebody, whether they know your uncles or my dad, Bernard Senior, or anybody else in the neighborhood, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1560.0s)]
*  I know your father, I remember he used to fight in the projects. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1568.0s)]
*  OK, you really like, you like, is this guy really legit? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1573.0s)]
*  You got to find that out whenever you're going to find out there. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1578.0s)]
*  You got to find out later. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1581.0s)]
*  These are the things, and it could be legit, but these are the things that I've learned. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1585.0s)]
*  And most of them, the stuff that I know that in time it will help me once I got out and once I reach a certain level in life, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1591.0s)]
*  that I need to know certain things and I got to schooling in that situation, penitentiary. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1604.0s)]
*  Because to me, I'm in a penitentiary in society, just don't have a wall. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1612.0s)]
*  I don't have a wall here. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1619.0s)]
*  When I'm pointing here, I mean mentally, and I don't have a wall physically where I can see it. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1622.0s)]
*  But I know for a fact that being in this position that I've been in for 28 years, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1627.0s)]
*  this rounded off three decades based on the sweet science in the ring. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1635.0s)]
*  I started and when I retired six, seven years ago. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1641.0s)]
*  As I witnessed and as I experienced, that first half of that first part of life, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1650.0s)]
*  I just said I felt like I lived three or two or three lives, it's helping me now. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1659.0s)]
*  Because when you're in a position where people think they can go on the internet [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1666.0s)]
*  and think they can find out how much you're worth, what you're not worth, then your CPA, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1673.0s)]
*  your certified accountant know who you are. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1679.0s)]
*  That's your DNA when it comes to business, especially if you got a good one, the right one. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1682.0s)]
*  So you get approached with all kinds of agendas. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1691.0s)]
*  And also you get the ones, sometimes you get the spirit to come in people that come thinking that, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1696.0s)]
*  you know, no matter how you sound and all that, I'm not trying to sound smart. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1703.0s)]
*  How you sound smart, what that mean? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1708.0s)]
*  Certain words you say, tell me the definition of it. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1711.0s)]
*  Boxing always will have a stigma and I hate to say it, but it's true 90% of it. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1715.0s)]
*  We trust as fighter too many people that say that they are who they are [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1726.0s)]
*  and we give them a pass that they are what they say they are. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1735.0s)]
*  Because of that experience that I just broke down on you just now, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1740.0s)]
*  it prepared me without having any knowledge at will until I recognized it, being awareness, having awareness. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1748.0s)]
*  If I didn't have that experience that I just spoke about, 20 plus minutes, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1758.0s)]
*  I would be swallowed up like most of them. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1767.0s)]
*  I hear the Tyson stories even when he was on the show, been around him, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1771.0s)]
*  fought on the undercard many times in Vegas at the MGM, no, Mandalay Bay. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1775.0s)]
*  MGM wasn't even there when I fought on the undercard. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1781.0s)]
*  And I hear a lot of other names and I say to myself, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1786.0s)]
*  they say game, recognize game, how you going to kind of ex-convict? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1795.0s)]
*  Don't you know I had to talk to get off the block? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1801.0s)]
*  I am not going to where I say I'm going, I just want to get off the block. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1804.0s)]
*  And if I get off the block based on that guard letting me off [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1809.0s)]
*  because I say I'm going somewhere that I'm not really going, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1813.0s)]
*  you build up a skill setting on how to deal with people that you need to deal with. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1816.0s)]
*  The danger come in is when you do it to everybody. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1822.0s)]
*  The benefits of it when you in front of somebody that you know is full of shit, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1826.0s)]
*  that you know is looking right at you lying, and you saying to yourself, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1833.0s)]
*  how long this conversation going to take to be over? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1838.0s)]
*  But being in a position that I've put myself through, nobody gave me anything. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1845.0s)]
*  I have to have patience even though I don't have to or I don't want to at that moment. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1851.0s)]
*  Because society of what you've done, it becomes such great entertainment and historic. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1862.0s)]
*  You get the stamp that you're a celebrity and you're bigger than God. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1875.0s)]
*  I'm a believer. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1882.0s)]
*  I don't shy, I don't push it on the body, I don't bring it up. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1885.0s)]
*  Just to bring it up in the conversation to say would I agree to disagree. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1889.0s)]
*  So I believe in checks and balances. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1895.0s)]
*  I believe in all these things that deal with my situation, to balance out things that need to be balanced. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1898.0s)]
*  That keeps me on point to know who I am. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1911.0s)]
*  A lot of things I won't forget and a lot of things I will. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1916.0s)]
*  On purpose. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1920.0s)]
*  On purpose. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1923.0s)]
*  So I realized one thing, I realized this. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1924.0s)]
*  All I do now is being written or going to be written down as I go. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1931.0s)]
*  But when it's over, that story no longer be written by me. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1942.0s)]
*  It be written by somebody else. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1948.0s)]
*  I don't want that. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1950.0s)]
*  No. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1953.0s)]
*  You know what I want? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1954.0s)]
*  Why I have this time? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1956.0s)]
*  To write it myself. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1960.0s)]
*  And have that awareness to keep me not just in check but mindful that every step I make, every accomplishment, every failure, every obstacle, every challenge, whatever it is, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1962.0s)]
*  I must stand ten toes down on it at all times. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1981.0s)]
*  That shows again the consistency of Bernard Hopkins Jr. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1988.0s)]
*  Because anybody that understands and know or follow or know anything about me, because most people don't have the patience to do research, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=1995.0s)]
*  they want somebody to tell them who Joe Rogan is. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2006.0s)]
*  They want somebody to tell them most people who Bernard Hopkins is. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2010.0s)]
*  I learned not to be in that world of thinking. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2015.0s)]
*  I learned to do my due diligence before I stepped up to my opponent or adversary or any other person that breathes the same air of life that I breathe. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2019.0s)]
*  So did you learn this focus and determination and discipline? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2033.0s)]
*  Did you learn this because of prison? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2038.0s)]
*  Because you wanted to make sure this never happened to you again? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2040.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2042.0s)]
*  So that experience when you were 17, being locked up, that was, even though it was a horrible situation, pivotal to your growth. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2043.0s)]
*  What do you mean horrible situation? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2054.0s)]
*  Being in prison. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2055.0s)]
*  No, it wasn't. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2056.0s)]
*  It wasn't horrible. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2057.0s)]
*  No. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2058.0s)]
*  How so? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2059.0s)]
*  Because most of my friends I said was there. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2060.0s)]
*  Second, I wanted to get out. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2063.0s)]
*  Obviously, when I got caught, you know, when you get caught by the police or you get locked up, obviously you try and do everything to get out, whether you give an alias name, whether you try to. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2064.0s)]
*  I didn't do it. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2074.0s)]
*  But when I got there and I seen that it wasn't like it's promoted on TV, per se. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2077.0s)]
*  Case in point. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2086.0s)]
*  I had more friends there than I had in the neighborhood that's locked up. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2089.0s)]
*  Of course, they glad to see you because you're locked up with them. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2094.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2098.0s)]
*  The mindset, Joe, when you're there, you're not, you know, you're not thinking you're thinking every you got people that's for good reasons looking out for you. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2099.0s)]
*  Which means I got this. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2109.0s)]
*  You need this. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2111.0s)]
*  You got this. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2112.0s)]
*  You got a stinger remake. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2113.0s)]
*  You can heat some hot water up and eat some soup, whatever. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2114.0s)]
*  You learn to survive in that situation because I don't believe and I said this in multiple interviews. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2116.0s)]
*  Multiple interviews. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2123.0s)]
*  I did a lot of expressing myself over the 28 years of boxing. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2125.0s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2129.0s)]
*  It's not hard to find my voice. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2130.0s)]
*  I understand what I got to understand that without that experience, I wouldn't be here having this conversation with anyone else before you. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2133.0s)]
*  Let alone Hall of Fame. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2148.0s)]
*  Not alone today. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2152.0s)]
*  The oldest athlete. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2154.0s)]
*  Yeah, got Brady a couple of years. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2156.0s)]
*  They won a major world title. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2160.0s)]
*  Surpassing George Foreman. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2163.0s)]
*  Yeah, you were world class into your 50s. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2166.0s)]
*  There's only a couple of guys like that. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2171.0s)]
*  I was defending my title with 25, 30 year olds in my 40s. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2173.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2176.0s)]
*  Well, I remember when they wrote you off before the Kelly Pavlik fight. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2177.0s)]
*  I wrote a blog on my website about that fight because I was so blown away because I remember leading into that fight. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2181.0s)]
*  Everybody wrote you off first of all in the Felix Trinidad fight. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2188.0s)]
*  They thought you were too old then. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2192.0s)]
*  35. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2194.0s)]
*  Correct. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2195.0s)]
*  They thought you were over the hill. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2196.0s)]
*  Felix Trinidad is a young, incredible fighter. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2198.0s)]
*  There's so much emotions involved. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2202.0s)]
*  When you went to Puerto Rico and threw the flag on the ground, everybody was chasing you. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2204.0s)]
*  I mean, you sold the shit out of that fight. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2207.0s)]
*  But it wasn't a sell. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2209.0s)]
*  I know, but it did. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2210.0s)]
*  But it just happened. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2211.0s)]
*  It did. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2212.0s)]
*  It did. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2213.0s)]
*  But it sold like crazy and they were writing you off. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2214.0s)]
*  And you put on a master class. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2217.0s)]
*  I remember that fight. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2220.0s)]
*  I remember that fight like it was yesterday. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2221.0s)]
*  Just had the anniversary last month. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2223.0s)]
*  Whoo. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2225.0s)]
*  Because I was always a big fan. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2226.0s)]
*  And I was a big fan also of the fact that you were standing up to the promoters because I remember the people, like the HBO boxing people, they didn't like it. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2228.0s)]
*  They didn't like when you talked about all that stuff. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2235.0s)]
*  They thought you were wasting their time. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2237.0s)]
*  But you had an important message. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2239.0s)]
*  And so people were kind of looking to write you off. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2241.0s)]
*  So by the time you fought Felix Trinidad, it was one of those crossroads fights where many people thought Felix Trinidad is going to become an all time great. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2245.0s)]
*  Bernard Hopkins is 35. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2253.0s)]
*  You know, this would be a good win for Felix Trinidad. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2255.0s)]
*  And you just fucking boxed masterfully. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2257.0s)]
*  It was a beautiful fight. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2261.0s)]
*  It was a beautiful fight because it showed all the things I love about your style. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2263.0s)]
*  First of all, the intelligence, the defensive responsibility. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2267.0s)]
*  You never put yourself in bad positions. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2271.0s)]
*  Never. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2273.0s)]
*  The defense was always tight as Fort Knox. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2274.0s)]
*  And you start picking them apart. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2277.0s)]
*  And I remember watching going, oh shit. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2279.0s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2282.0s)]
*  It was just one of those fights where it was just so exciting. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2283.0s)]
*  It was so because, you know, even though I was a fan of yours and I was a fan of Felix Trinidad as well, it was watching it happen. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2286.0s)]
*  And you mean you watch it something special. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2293.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2295.0s)]
*  And that's the thing that athletics does for us and particularly fighting because it's so raw. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2296.0s)]
*  What it does to us is it shows us the potential that human beings have beyond what we expect. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2300.0s)]
*  You did that with Felix Trinidad and you were in your 40s when you fought Kelly. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2306.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2312.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2313.0s)]
*  How are we doing that multiple times in my career? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2314.0s)]
*  Kelly Pablack, I'd say 44, 45. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2315.0s)]
*  Which is another one. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2318.0s)]
*  I wrote that's when I wrote a blog about it. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2319.0s)]
*  Mike, do you understand how crazy this is? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2320.0s)]
*  They predicted I'd get knocked out on this one. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2322.0s)]
*  This one. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2324.0s)]
*  And I'm saying that I could do this. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2325.0s)]
*  That was after the Jermaine Taylor fight. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2326.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2327.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2328.0s)]
*  And people thought, oh my God, this kid. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2329.0s)]
*  I'm glad you said that. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2330.0s)]
*  Stop right there. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2332.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2333.0s)]
*  The two Jermaine Taylor fights, right? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2334.0s)]
*  Now I accept my losses, but those two, not losing sleep in 2023 over it, but I met and [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2336.0s)]
*  regret the lie. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2347.0s)]
*  What I mean by that is that Jermaine Taylor heist, Luther Beller used to work for HBO, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2348.0s)]
*  started Luther Beller Entertainment. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2356.0s)]
*  So he had Jermaine Taylor under the entertainment of Luther Beller. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2358.0s)]
*  So they wanted to use Jermaine Taylor to get me out of boxing because of, I generate a [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2362.0s)]
*  lot of enemies. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2371.0s)]
*  They've been my biggest supporters being my enemies to not go to fall asleep at the [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2373.0s)]
*  will or to underestimate anybody that comes in front of me, whether they're worthy or [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2378.0s)]
*  not. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2385.0s)]
*  Number one contender, number one, two contender. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2386.0s)]
*  That's another politics story that sometimes they pit people there just because of they [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2388.0s)]
*  can put people there. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2393.0s)]
*  Jermaine Taylor fight split decision win to Jermaine Taylor. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2396.0s)]
*  The second fight, which I believe was just as close as the first fight. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2401.0s)]
*  So Jermaine Taylor went 24 rounds with Bernard Hopkins, correct? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2406.0s)]
*  Lost his mind, haven't been right since. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2417.0s)]
*  They feed them. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2420.0s)]
*  They, the powers to be want the fans to believe the lie, which it was a lot of rumbling about [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2422.0s)]
*  who won that first fight. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2432.0s)]
*  A split decision, the champion doesn't get the split decision and not a favor, Bernard [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2434.0s)]
*  B. Jermaine Taylor. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2439.0s)]
*  But through four days in boxing, it goes away. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2443.0s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2446.0s)]
*  We fight the second fight because as a champion, I could put in a contract, hey, Spence and [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2449.0s)]
*  Crawford, Crawford wants to exercise that, that, that, that, you know, that clause. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2455.0s)]
*  That clause. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2460.0s)]
*  Correct. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2461.0s)]
*  So we got that second fight, decision loss. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2462.0s)]
*  They think it's going to make it a little better. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2466.0s)]
*  Not a split decision, a decision. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2468.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2470.0s)]
*  They wanted me to pack up and run. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2471.0s)]
*  Basically get the fuck out of here. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2473.0s)]
*  We got you. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2475.0s)]
*  They fed him the Kelly Pavlik because they wanted the fans. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2479.0s)]
*  They wanted you at that time, but you're a little smarter. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2483.0s)]
*  Not patronizing, keeping a, keeping a 100. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2486.0s)]
*  They put Kelly Pavlik in there with Jermaine Taylor and Kelly Pavlik did what? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2490.0s)]
*  Knocks him out after avoiding to knock out himself. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2499.0s)]
*  Correct? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2502.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2503.0s)]
*  Real close to going out. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2504.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2505.0s)]
*  So now they said, Hey, we want to, they want to clean up the mess. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2506.0s)]
*  I've been around this game 30 side Joe. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2516.0s)]
*  Trust me on this one. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2519.0s)]
*  They want to clean up the mess. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2520.0s)]
*  They still getting, they're getting hammered with the fight with me and Jermaine. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2521.0s)]
*  Now they put him in there with Kelly. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2526.0s)]
*  I thought he was going to walk him over. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2527.0s)]
*  Kelly stops him. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2528.0s)]
*  We're going to now and try to make things up when they back in. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2530.0s)]
*  Now we got to still make that thing up with Bernard Hopkins. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2534.0s)]
*  Cause Tom is not going to buried it because Bernard got a big mouth and Bernard's going [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2537.0s)]
*  to keep, Bernard's going to keep talking. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2543.0s)]
*  So let's pay Kelly Pavlik. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2545.0s)]
*  Hold up. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2547.0s)]
*  Let's put Kelly Pavlik in there with him and Atlantic city Joe. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2548.0s)]
*  He's going to get Bernard. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2555.0s)]
*  This is the first time Larry merchant who I had a lot of fun beating him up on the mic. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2557.0s)]
*  This is the first time we might just see Bernard gets knocked. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2563.0s)]
*  He going to get knocked out this fight because they wanted you to think that Jermaine tell [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2568.0s)]
*  us fight. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2572.0s)]
*  Some of them I said earlier, they wanted you to believe the lie. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2573.0s)]
*  They got to promote the lie and hopefully they look like a genius when it happens. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2575.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2581.0s)]
*  One of my best performance, not just in the ring, but one of my best performance or who [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2582.0s)]
*  I am, how I wouldn't let them write my death warrant or my exit warrant or who I am. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2588.0s)]
*  And they see the thing is they know who I am. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2598.0s)]
*  Oh, your enemy know who you are. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2601.0s)]
*  That's why they threatened by that. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2603.0s)]
*  They seen you coming Joe long time ago, but it's a time that comes and goes when they [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2606.0s)]
*  know they can't stop you right now. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2616.0s)]
*  At 2023 right now, faster person 2024 and I'm sitting up there having a conversation [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2623.0s)]
*  articulation, articulating everything I said and know what I'm saying dates and time. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2628.0s)]
*  They didn't expect that. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2632.0s)]
*  They didn't expect that. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2635.0s)]
*  They expect a voice recorder. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2636.0s)]
*  When we sit up here like the movie, Bernie dead, but alive, I'm here bigger than just [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2640.0s)]
*  who I became. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2648.0s)]
*  I'm going to say that again. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2649.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2650.0s)]
*  I'm here. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2651.0s)]
*  This one, it comes not overly spiritual, but this what I believe. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2652.0s)]
*  I'm here to prove to me, can't speak for anybody else that that would, that the historic [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2656.0s)]
*  chapter is, is, is the, is the second layer of foundation was to come that they better [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2668.0s)]
*  be aware of that they better be aware of because now this, this, that statement brings me to [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2679.0s)]
*  this conversation that need to be hit. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2688.0s)]
*  They need to be said. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2690.0s)]
*  And this is the best platform to spill it out on. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2691.0s)]
*  The boxing game, the business of boxing has to be met with a personality and a discipline. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2697.0s)]
*  No matter what the wind is blowing, which way it is blowing that I'm not going to give [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2708.0s)]
*  up. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2715.0s)]
*  And that's what the threat is. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2716.0s)]
*  And that's what the fear is. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2718.0s)]
*  And it's not fair. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2720.0s)]
*  Me personally is fair. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2721.0s)]
*  I'm not going to be afraid of what I know and what I can do and my consistency to bring [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2723.0s)]
*  the people together, whether they, the ones that really mean it, the good politician, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2726.0s)]
*  the people that's in the game of boxing, some commissioners, not all to understand that [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2737.0s)]
*  we need checks and balances in this business to the least to have law there to, as a strong [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2743.0s)]
*  structure to honor and go by. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2751.0s)]
*  And if there's any violation like anything else, you get test ties for it. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2754.0s)]
*  You got to pay. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2759.0s)]
*  You got to get punished in so many ways to do it. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2760.0s)]
*  So boxing like any other sport in America is the only sport that's not regulated by [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2764.0s)]
*  any entity other than itself. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2771.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2774.0s)]
*  You know, Joe, I used to always say to myself back then, there are so many, when they hear [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2777.0s)]
*  this, they're going to be, oh my God, there's so many non active, non active, active, excuse [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2784.0s)]
*  me, lawyers in boxing. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2796.0s)]
*  There's a lot of lawyers or, or, or can be lawyers. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2799.0s)]
*  They have, they went to law school, they got the law license, but they don't practice. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2805.0s)]
*  But they have knowledge of what they can do and what they can't do. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2811.0s)]
*  Do you understand what I'm saying? [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2814.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2816.0s)]
*  So already most of us are at a disadvantage, not at an advantage to know to do's and don'ts. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2817.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2831.0s)]
*  So, so, so, so yes, yes. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2832.0s)]
*  But most of the time we getting fucked. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2834.0s)]
*  And 99.9% you're getting fucked. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2837.0s)]
*  When you were saying that the Roy Jones Jr. fight, there was a 1.4 split and you made [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2841.0s)]
*  750 or whatever it was. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2847.0s)]
*  After all that, you, you only brought home 80. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2849.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2852.0s)]
*  How's that possible? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2853.0s)]
*  I had a, I had a contract. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2854.0s)]
*  Again, this was the ignorance coming, lack of knowledge. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2855.0s)]
*  I had a contract with a management team that sold me out with the promoter and the promoter [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2858.0s)]
*  again, Butch Lewis, God rest his soul. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2863.0s)]
*  He somehow convinced my managers at that time, Arise in Boxing, that he can do better for [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2868.0s)]
*  them in the long term. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2881.0s)]
*  Fighters come and go. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2882.0s)]
*  Managers and advisors stay around, whatever name they put themselves under. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2885.0s)]
*  And so I had a 60-40, when I said ignorance early, I had a 60-40 manager contract. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2890.0s)]
*  I have it to today framed in my office. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2897.0s)]
*  That's pretty crazy. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2900.0s)]
*  60-40 manager contract. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2902.0s)]
*  I kept that contract. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2904.0s)]
*  I framed it. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2906.0s)]
*  So these things, because it shows how far I evolved. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2907.0s)]
*  What's a standard contract? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2911.0s)]
*  What's a fair contract? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2913.0s)]
*  What you negotiate. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2915.0s)]
*  What is a good professional kit? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2916.0s)]
*  In boxing? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2921.0s)]
*  Yeah, like Jermell Trello for the Canal [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2922.0s)]
*  I had a contract with a management team that sold me out with the promoter and the promoter [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2935.96s)]
*  and the promoter. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2950.96s)]
*  I had a contract with a management team that sold me out with the promoter and the promoter. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2951.96s)]
*  I had a contract with a management team that sold me out with the promoter and the promoter. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2961.44s)]
*  the Golden Boy promotion. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2986.44s)]
*  Top ranked by Ram, been around 50 plus years, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2987.7200000000003s)]
*  just as long as Don King. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2990.2400000000002s)]
*  Right? [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2993.2000000000003s)]
*  Time is very, very short and limited. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2994.04s)]
*  Right? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2996.82s)]
*  Not saying they won't go out of business, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2997.66s)]
*  but the brand is there, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=2998.66s)]
*  but the energy and the strength, it's a new game now. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3002.0s)]
*  It's a new world order. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3004.84s)]

*  It's happening now in certain situations [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3012.14s)]

*  Everything has been flipped and turned around [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3014.76s)]
*  to survive surviving and the dead dies. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3016.76s)]
*  Boxing has no guidelines on what you can do, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3024.48s)]
*  how much you can take, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3032.32s)]

*  The manager job is to manage and look out [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3049.44s)]
*  by enemies necessary for the fighter. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3054.76s)]
*  The promoter promotes the event, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3058.06s)]
*  get sponsors, get the money, get the support. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3063.96s)]
*  And he and the manager go to the table [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3068.92s)]
*  and they have a conversation about what is there, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3074.08s)]
*  the minimum. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3079.08s)]

*  That was negotiated by a consultant [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3085.3s)]
*  that's really a promoter hiding in the closet. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3093.46s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3099.32s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3100.16s)]
*  Boxing, it's a great sport. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3103.64s)]

*  if you're gonna be preaching at church on Sunday. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3121.06s)]
*  Well, boxing has always been controlled by crime figures, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3123.2400000000002s)]
*  mob, crooked lawyers. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3127.44s)]
*  But that was then. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3130.1200000000003s)]
*  Now it's a different time and way to do it. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3131.1200000000003s)]
*  Those days with the envelope underneath the table, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3138.92s)]

*  The way it's being done now is based on favoritism, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3150.0s)]
*  who they want in, who they want out. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3158.36s)]

*  who they can make more money with, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3168.8s)]

*  How deep does it go? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3174.36s)]
*  How deep, as far as judges? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3176.36s)]
*  Because there's been some fights [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3179.2400000000002s)]
*  where Timothy Bradley versus Manny Pacquiao, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3181.32s)]
*  where the decision gets announced [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3185.6s)]
*  and everybody just goes, what? [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3187.56s)]
*  There's a few of those decisions where people go, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3191.4s)]
*  what is the line, what's the betting line? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3194.48s)]
*  Who's financially tied to this? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3197.12s)]
*  Who's the promotion? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3199.32s)]
*  I'll give you a recent one, Luma Chico. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3200.36s)]

*  Luma Chico, yo. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3203.96s)]
*  Like, the answer to that question [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3205.52s)]
*  is who they want to win and move to the next level, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3213.3s)]
*  because that's where they can make the most money. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3215.92s)]
*  And that's where they have the most control. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3218.2400000000002s)]
*  Hello. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3219.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3220.48s)]
*  So this is something that you really have to be [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3221.3s)]
*  a Harvard graduate to understand. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3224.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3228.2000000000003s)]
*  Like, this is like in your face, it's like, so what? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3229.04s)]
*  Like, I'm taking it to the point that deep. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3232.2000000000003s)]
*  Like, I know y'all see, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3234.28s)]
*  how about I do notice this is how the box, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3236.48s)]
*  this is boxing, no. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3238.56s)]
*  Well, you mean this is boxing? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3242.32s)]
*  You would hear reporters that been around [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3244.28s)]
*  just as long as the promoters, right? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3246.1200000000003s)]
*  Because they can get a free meal at the press conference, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3248.44s)]
*  or they can get somewhere, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3251.2000000000003s)]
*  they got their little perks, right? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3252.0400000000004s)]
*  They can get a little free condensate [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3254.0400000000004s)]
*  to wear around your neck, and then it's selling soap. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3255.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3257.96s)]
*  So when you're in that environment that's so tight, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3258.8s)]
*  when it comes to the community of it, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3263.26s)]
*  they can smell your fart. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3266.8s)]
*  You like that, right? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3270.6000000000004s)]
*  It's just crazy. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3271.44s)]
*  I mean, is that serious? [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3272.56s)]
*  And I'm saying to, you know, my small circle, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3276.44s)]
*  it's like, yo, you telling me that this judge, [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3281.56s)]
*  along with the other two judges, right, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3287.44s)]
*  it's three ringsiders, three judges, right? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3289.7999999999997s)]
*  Six eyes, six eyeballs that's watching this fight. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3295.96s)]
*  Nobody's drooling from the mouth, right? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3302.92s)]
*  Nobody got an oxygen tank, right? [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3305.08s)]
*  It's judging. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3307.7999999999997s)]
*  So we assume that the commission of their state, Vegas, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3308.64s)]
*  here, there, whatever, LA, whatever, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3315.7599999999998s)]
*  they assign these judges, they screen these judges. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3319.72s)]
*  Did anybody do a background check [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3323.52s)]
*  to see if anybody's mortgage is late, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3325.0s)]
*  or their car payments are late? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3326.48s)]
*  Right. Eight, nine months due? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3329.0s)]
*  Like, we need to understand the qualifications [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3330.7599999999998s)]
*  of being a judge, because lives of careers [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3335.48s)]
*  is at stake at that high level, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3342.68s)]
*  where not only you've taken something [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3346.8599999999997s)]
*  from that particular fighter, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3348.7999999999997s)]
*  but his family is wrapped up in that too. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3352.9599999999996s)]
*  They don't look at that. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3355.6s)]
*  Right. They don't care. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3357.56s)]
*  And so when it happens every now and then, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3360.08s)]
*  and not every 10, 15, 20 years, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3364.04s)]
*  whether it makes it right or not, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3366.92s)]
*  this is a consistency. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3368.72s)]
*  And also, from the previous decades, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3370.48s)]
*  and moments in history, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3375.52s)]
*  boxing still has that question. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3378.24s)]
*  Is boxing rigged before it goes down? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3383.0s)]
*  Is boxing controlled? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3386.48s)]
*  By the underworld, or the new underworld, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3391.04s)]
*  or the world of influence, or the world of power, [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3394.72s)]
*  or the world who they want to make more money off of. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3397.36s)]
*  It's about who they can make more money off of. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3399.72s)]
*  And look, I'm not gonna say I understand, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3401.64s)]
*  because if I say I understand, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3407.32s)]
*  then I feel that I am not gonna do nothing about it, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3410.68s)]
*  then I feel I'm part of the problem. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3413.92s)]
*  Because a lot of guys, and a lot of people [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3415.7599999999998s)]
*  in boxing business know what I'm talking is genuine, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3418.08s)]
*  and is straight up the truth, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3421.92s)]
*  but they would never do what I'm doing right now. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3425.08s)]
*  They just accept it. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3427.52s)]
*  Well. Or they just deal with it. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3429.2s)]
*  They don't talk out against it. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3431.3199999999997s)]
*  They keep their mouth shut. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3432.16s)]
*  They keep their mouth shut. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3433.36s)]
*  And not all, but there's some have things to lose. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3435.2s)]
*  Pay day. Pay day. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3442.2799999999997s)]
*  So, or positions of where they at, or what they do. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3445.88s)]
*  They don't want to lose whatever it is, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3453.56s)]
*  big or small to you, to them, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3456.1600000000003s)]
*  is their God or next to it. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3459.6400000000003s)]
*  That's how deep that is. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3461.88s)]
*  I witnessed it. I'm there on the front row. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3463.7200000000003s)]

*  based on a threat or based of silence you. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3487.92s)]
*  See, that's the power I was talking about early, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3496.7200000000003s)]
*  not the other power. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3500.6s)]
*  Some could be great. Some can be not great. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3502.44s)]
*  But the power of do for self [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3505.36s)]
*  and a power of being consistent [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3508.36s)]
*  and got there in spite of the black balling, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3511.7200000000003s)]

*  That was beginning of their demise, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3519.52s)]
*  who I became today in 2023. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3521.76s)]
*  And he still can talk and speak. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3526.52s)]
*  And he haven't forgotten nothing, only if he chose to. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3529.6s)]
*  That's when I say power. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3534.84s)]
*  Yeah, but that's your discipline. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3536.6800000000003s)]
*  That's your drive. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3539.44s)]
*  And that's so extraordinary [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3540.8s)]
*  that you were able to maintain that. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3542.32s)]
*  The Kelly-Pavik fight again, you're 44 in that fight? [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3546.2000000000003s)]
*  44, 45, yeah. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3549.04s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3550.0s)]

*  who's a knockout artist, at 44, 45, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3555.8s)]
*  and just put on a clinic. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3559.2000000000003s)]
*  Put on a clinic. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3561.0s)]
*  That moment there was around the time I became the alien. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3562.7999999999997s)]
*  When you boxed over three decades, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3567.68s)]
*  you got three brands. Yeah, you were the executioner, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3569.44s)]
*  you had a change into the alien. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3571.08s)]
*  Listen, I understood the time I hung around, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3572.72s)]
*  and I had to recreate myself. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3576.0s)]
*  I had to bring something to the press conference. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3577.7999999999997s)]
*  Joe, I know you won't ask the question, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3580.68s)]
*  but I'm gonna let you answer it. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3582.36s)]
*  But I had to come up with something. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3583.48s)]
*  Why? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3585.68s)]
*  Why, Joe, is because what? [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3586.92s)]
*  Every reporter that been covering me, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3589.2799999999997s)]
*  they got tired of covering me eventually. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3592.96s)]
*  Not based on what I've done and didn't do. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3595.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm making history. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3597.72s)]
*  They know it every time I fight. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3598.6s)]
*  They remind me every fight I win. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3599.72s)]
*  Now, you just did this, you just did that. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3602.2799999999997s)]
*  Ray Roberts, he couldn't do it, and you did it. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3604.7999999999997s)]
*  The Tarver fight, jumping up two-way classes. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3608.7599999999998s)]
*  Now, the Charlo brothers, right? [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3611.24s)]
*  You see what he tried to make history. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3613.24s)]
*  Went up to jump two-way class and fight Canelo. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3615.16s)]
*  I set records that's still there to be chased. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3618.2s)]
*  It's a blessing for me to sit back and have fun [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3623.72s)]
*  and have conversation. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3626.16s)]
*  But I understood again every moment, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3628.84s)]
*  every historic moment, every time that I can stay in the game. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3636.48s)]
*  Not because I needed the money. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3643.6s)]
*  They was paying me very well to leave. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3646.04s)]
*  They was paying me very well to leave because of what? [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3651.6s)]
*  I wanted to make sure that I established a historic record, [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3657.32s)]
*  that it would take decades to break them. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3662.4s)]
*  And that's what's happening today, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3664.56s)]
*  or an attempt to happen. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3666.6s)]
*  And so that to me gave me more drive to say, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3668.88s)]
*  I'm gonna stay around one more. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3674.88s)]
*  I'm gonna chase this dream. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3677.04s)]
*  I'm gonna chase that goal. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3677.88s)]
*  I'm gonna make this history [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3679.48s)]
*  because Ray Robinson didn't do it. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3680.4s)]
*  I'm gonna jump up two-way classes and fight Tarver. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3682.04s)]
*  How old were you when you fought Tarver? [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3684.7200000000003s)]

*  You know how crazy that is? [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3689.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3690.44s)]
*  In Atlantic City. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3692.1600000000003s)]
*  Again, this is- [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3694.12s)]
*  How were you able to do that? [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3694.96s)]
*  What separates you physically from all those fighters [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3696.7200000000003s)]
*  that deteriorated young in their career? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3700.6800000000003s)]
*  Is it your defense? [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3702.64s)]
*  Is it just technique? [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3703.6s)]
*  It was a combination as a recipe. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3705.12s)]
*  It was all above. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3708.3199999999997s)]
*  Break them down to you. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3710.16s)]

*  I'm talking about far as all around skills, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3805.04s)]
*  but one thing I did have, [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3807.12s)]
*  I had the room and ability to do what? [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3810.48s)]
*  To reinvent myself, to make sure that I don't be one way [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3813.8799999999997s)]

*  of the history of Philadelphia, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3829.28s)]
*  coming wham bam, thank you ma'am. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3831.12s)]

*  and now the main course was served. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3836.88s)]

*  I'm gonna know it without showing him [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3857.76s)]
*  I'm being leery of him. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3859.4s)]
*  And once I identify that, takes about two or three rounds. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3862.28s)]
*  Why you think they said he's a slow starter? [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3867.16s)]
*  He's boring the first four or five fights. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3870.12s)]
*  Joe, you watch me, you heard him say all the commentators. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3872.32s)]
*  They snoring around the fourth round, they snoring. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3875.6s)]
*  But then I understand what I have to do. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3879.0s)]
*  Turn up the gas. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3882.68s)]
*  Not only, yep, turn up the gas, but disarm them. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3884.2799999999997s)]
*  Disarm them mentally, which control from my perspective, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3888.36s)]
*  everything you do tomorrow, [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3892.8399999999997s)]
*  everything you do the next round, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3894.72s)]
*  everything you think about doing, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3896.52s)]
*  if I put doubt in your mind, [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3898.48s)]
*  and come to the ring prepared physically [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3900.88s)]
*  to take you to that task of whether you believe [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3903.92s)]
*  what you say, that's D-Block. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3906.96s)]
*  And then you take that experience, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3911.04s)]
*  which I've had, not bragging and boasting about it, [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3913.4s)]
*  but it's my history, it's part of my story. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3917.44s)]
*  Without that, I'm not here. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3919.4s)]
*  One of the enjoyable things I love doing [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3923.6400000000003s)]
*  before the fights start is when a referee, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3928.28s)]
*  Bernard come out, Jermaine tell everybody, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3930.76s)]
*  and then we're in the middle of the ring. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3934.56s)]
*  And he's giving you last rights, right? [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3937.3599999999997s)]
*  Last instructions of the rules he gave you in the dressing room. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3940.3999999999996s)]
*  I call it the last rights, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3943.7599999999998s)]
*  because you don't have to be alive when you leave out of there. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3945.0s)]
*  When that bell rings, your life could be in jeopardy. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3950.68s)]
*  So I wanted to say last rights. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3955.4399999999996s)]
*  So when they give us the last rights, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3958.3599999999997s)]
*  you heard the rules, you heard this, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3960.0s)]
*  it's too low, it's too high if you hit there. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3961.3999999999996s)]
*  And I'm looking at my opponent like me [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3964.56s)]
*  and you're looking at each other. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3965.9599999999996s)]
*  He looking at me, I'm looking through him. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3969.56s)]
*  I said it earlier. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3971.3599999999997s)]
*  And whatever he see, he won't speak, but he can't run now. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3974.2799999999997s)]
*  And as his bottom lip shiver, as we stare at each other [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3978.6s)]
*  for at least two seconds before he gives us the instructions [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3983.04s)]
*  to go to the corner and then the bell ring, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3987.3999999999996s)]
*  first round is on. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3990.3199999999997s)]
*  And ain't how fast and how good I start, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3994.2s)]
*  it's how I finish. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=3997.16s)]
*  That's how I beat my opponents in and out of the ring. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4000.6s)]
*  They front runners. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4010.3599999999997s)]
*  They run in 880s and they're like, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4012.9599999999996s)]
*  ah, I got a great time. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4014.56s)]
*  I'm like, okay. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4021.2s)]
*  We're not done though. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4024.72s)]
*  That's the patience. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4028.68s)]
*  That is knowing who you are and understanding [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4032.24s)]
*  that in doing that, you might have to taste some defeat. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4037.24s)]
*  But you always hear the sound bite, especially in boxing. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4042.68s)]
*  They love to use words because other people say it. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4045.3999999999996s)]
*  Dare to be great. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4048.7599999999998s)]
*  The actions don't speak the words, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4050.84s)]
*  they come out of their mouth most of the time. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4053.04s)]
*  And that's what separate the dos and the don'ts. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4056.28s)]
*  The dare to be great. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4061.48s)]
*  Correct. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4062.56s)]
*  And the belief in yourself at 44, 45 years old [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4063.76s)]
*  to still be not just world-class, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4067.44s)]
*  but one of the best in the world. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4070.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4073.2400000000002s)]
*  That was just, it was just extraordinary [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4074.08s)]
*  that you were able to keep that level of skill. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4078.04s)]
*  I just wanna talk to you about your lifestyle [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4081.0s)]
*  and your training and what was it about your preparation, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4083.84s)]
*  the way you lived, that gave you [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4087.88s)]
*  this incredibly long career. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4090.56s)]
*  My mother and father, Bernard Senior and Shirley Hopkins, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4093.48s)]
*  my mother, they lived, they had a different way of, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4098.88s)]
*  about that time, the way they lived. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4104.72s)]
*  I come up, I told you again, a big family, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4108.12s)]
*  four sisters and the rest boys. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4113.32s)]
*  I'm the second oldest. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4116.16s)]
*  And they both, my mother and father was dead before 60, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4118.28s)]
*  not because of an accident, not because of some violent crime [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4123.900000000001s)]
*  or anything like that, lifestyle. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4127.96s)]
*  I grew up around a lot of stuff. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4130.8s)]
*  I've seen a lot of stuff. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4133.72s)]
*  I used to watch my father take syringes [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4136.4400000000005s)]
*  and hide them up at the woodwork of the front of the door [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4138.72s)]
*  up top and I used to climb up through the chair [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4142.12s)]
*  and get it and hand it to my mom. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4143.92s)]
*  And she said, where'd you get that from? [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4145.280000000001s)]
*  And I used to say it and I realized [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4147.16s)]
*  I was starting something. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4150.16s)]
*  It had to be about maybe six, maybe seven. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4152.12s)]
*  And I realized I was starting something [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4156.14s)]
*  so I no longer used to see him put it up there [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4157.88s)]
*  or go up there and get it. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4163.12s)]
*  And so it's the lifestyle. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4165.0s)]
*  I've seen a lot of lifestyle that I knew [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4168.04s)]
*  and the history too of Philadelphia. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4172.68s)]
*  Any little success you get, you think you're a champion, [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4175.2s)]
*  no, you're a regional champion, you're a Pennsylvania [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4177.88s)]
*  champion, a lot of guys actually wasn't disciplined [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4180.16s)]
*  to take it to the next level. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4182.96s)]
*  They became stars in their own neighborhood. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4185.400000000001s)]
*  They became stars in their own city. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4187.74s)]
*  I wanted to be bigger than that. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4190.0s)]
*  And so in knowing it and saying it is one thing, [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4191.8s)]
*  but this has, as I speak now, as the conviction [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4197.96s)]
*  that I've continued to walk that walk and talk the talk, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4201.56s)]
*  that drove me to be able to never give up [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4206.64s)]
*  and never waver from what I believe. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4211.4400000000005s)]
*  So that there helped me stay away from the things [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4215.6s)]
*  that is right in front of your face most of the time. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4220.68s)]
*  When you win, they have after parties. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4225.280000000001s)]
*  We're Bernard, we're champ, we always pop up upstairs, [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4228.88s)]
*  he getting in the hot tub. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4231.320000000001s)]
*  I go right to my room. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4234.88s)]
*  I wasn't a monk, but I go right to my room [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4237.280000000001s)]
*  because 90% of people that's at that party, [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4239.72s)]
*  maybe half of them was rooting against me. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4242.4400000000005s)]
*  And then second, they either smoking, drinking, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4245.360000000001s)]
*  snorting or anything else. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4251.4800000000005s)]
*  I wasn't about that life. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4253.4800000000005s)]
*  I wasn't about that when I was a hoodlum in the streets. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4255.56s)]
*  I was about having things that I felt that my parents [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4259.280000000001s)]
*  didn't have enough to give us that life [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4263.120000000001s)]
*  that we just seen right three blocks from where we lived. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4265.820000000001s)]
*  And sometimes, especially in California, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4270.52s)]
*  you can make two turns and you in somewhere [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4272.72s)]
*  where you'd be like, hold up, who hit the lottery? [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4274.88s)]
*  So I wanted that life in a different way [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4278.12s)]
*  and got a chance to now have it and some [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4284.36s)]
*  through the travels and the time that I've been on this earth [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4289.24s)]
*  where those two life experience that I look at, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4297.0s)]
*  three lives that I lived, just the third one, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4302.639999999999s)]
*  that any of those times could have been over. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4305.5599999999995s)]
*  That kept me disciplined in between fights. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4310.08s)]
*  The years that I got, gotta have some credit, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4315.599999999999s)]
*  gotta give credit to that thinking and that experience [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4318.44s)]
*  of seeing my mother and father die before 60 [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4322.599999999999s)]
*  because of lifestyle. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4325.38s)]
*  My father had shot out a kid liver, shot his liver out at 57. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4326.5199999999995s)]

*  And it was already gone. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4338.36s)]
*  I reflect every now and then about that [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4340.6s)]
*  when I see pictures by getting certain things together [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4343.36s)]
*  about my life story. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4346.96s)]

*  All my siblings, except for my brother [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4358.18s)]
*  because he got killed. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4360.2s)]
*  The year I went to prison in 84, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4362.16s)]
*  my mother lost two sons, speaking of that. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4365.4s)]
*  Michael Derek Hopkins, I told you January 29th, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4369.14s)]
*  he'd have been 57, 1966. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4373.44s)]
*  The year 84, I remember it was the beginning of 84 [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4379.64s)]
*  because the Sixers last championship was in 1983 [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4383.36s)]
*  if you're a basketball fan. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4388.599999999999s)]

*  Shirley Mae Hopkins lost two sons in 84. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4399.04s)]
*  Talking about trauma. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4406.04s)]
*  That was a key, key, key [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4411.2s)]
*  to push an experience that I had to do something [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4414.32s)]

*  Still got years to do. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4431.16s)]
*  How many years do you wanna do? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4433.24s)]
*  Five, five out of 15. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4434.32s)]
*  Subtract five out of 15, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4437.799999999999s)]
*  the way the Pennsylvania Parole Board works. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4439.48s)]
*  If you get out on your minimum is five, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4442.04s)]
*  you can do the 15. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4446.42s)]
*  Get into a stabbing, get write-ups, [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4448.0s)]
*  do something in there that can be a crime too. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4451.32s)]
*  The five is the minimum, the 15th is the max. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4456.4s)]
*  So I had to walk a straight line amongst chaos. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4461.2s)]
*  No confusion. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4468.0s)]
*  Everybody, 90% of people there, they know why they there. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4470.0s)]
*  Fuck what they say. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4474.8s)]
*  They know why they there. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4477.04s)]
*  That moment, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4484.22s)]
*  after that first year of establishing myself [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4491.2s)]
*  filling out the environment of who you deal with, [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4499.2s)]
*  who you stay away from, who to snitch, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4505.72s)]
*  what guard, what CEO is good, what CEO is not. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4511.2s)]
*  Most of the CEOs live in the same neighborhood [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4517.04s)]
*  you grew up at. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4519.28s)]
*  It was the brother of your uncle, friend, [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4520.12s)]
*  who never had a felony, so he got a filler application, [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4525.88s)]
*  he got a job, man, he's the CEO. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4528.28s)]
*  I know your dad. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4530.32s)]
*  Okay, thanks. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4531.2s)]
*  Hey, CEO, can I get an extra commissary? [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4533.88s)]
*  Whatever, go ahead. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4537.12s)]
*  So you're not really protected by nobody [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4539.599999999999s)]
*  because anybody can sell you out or do a favor. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4541.7s)]
*  But what I'm trying to understand is just physically, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4549.7s)]
*  I understand that you didn't party, [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4553.04s)]
*  I understand that you were very disciplined, [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4554.679999999999s)]
*  but how were you physically able to compete at that level [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4556.92s)]
*  deep in your 40s? [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4560.66s)]
*  Because again, lifestyle, talent. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4562.32s)]
*  But everybody else falls apart. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4564.96s)]
*  Because everybody else is doing [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4566.68s)]
*  what everybody else been doing. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4568.0s)]
*  What were you doing different physically? [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4570.2s)]
*  Physically, I was always, even to the day, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4572.32s)]
*  I pay attention to what I put in my body is who I am, [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4576.92s)]
*  not what I actually look like. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4580.4s)]
*  And I understood that most people that I seen [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4582.4s)]
*  in my time in boxing, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4588.08s)]
*  Florida's disciplined the same way, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4592.32s)]
*  don't drink, don't smoke, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4593.839999999999s)]
*  and be sitting right there in the club [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4594.799999999999s)]
*  and everybody doing everything else. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4596.16s)]
*  You heard that before, it's all over. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4598.5199999999995s)]
*  You got those type people like that. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4600.599999999999s)]
*  But genetics plays, my grandmother lived in 99. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4602.4s)]
*  But then again, do I really take all the eggs [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4606.5199999999995s)]
*  and put in that basket [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4611.36s)]
*  because my father and mother died before 60. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4612.28s)]
*  So I would say the lifestyle, [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4615.2s)]
*  I would say the mindset or the teachings are both [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4618.679999999999s)]
*  hit, not get hit. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4624.04s)]
*  Read books a lot, do something to exercise your brain, [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4626.48s)]
*  take care of your physical body. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4628.92s)]
*  Dependent entry. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4630.92s)]
*  Dependent entry taught me more going there [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4633.62s)]
*  once I got there to understand what I wanted to do. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4637.44s)]
*  I wasn't just lifting weights in a weight yard [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4642.32s)]
*  and be swole up around a bunch of men for five years. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4643.799999999999s)]
*  I went and understood that A, after a year went by, [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4648.0s)]
*  they got a boxing program. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4652.5599999999995s)]
*  I wanted to get off the block to go to another block [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4654.2s)]
*  and the guard, CO, said, where you going, Y, 41, 45? [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4656.599999999999s)]
*  Hey, I'm going to the gym, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4659.759999999999s)]
*  but I'm trying to go on A block to hang out before count [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4661.679999999999s)]
*  to go back on my block. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4664.4s)]
*  If I don't do it, if I don't get over before count, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4666.4s)]
*  I get it right up. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4668.5599999999995s)]
*  So I was forced to go down to the gym [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4670.4800000000005s)]
*  and seeing people sparring, [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4673.04s)]
*  and I said, I want to be a part of that. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4674.92s)]
*  And I got my ass beaten lesson, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4678.0s)]
*  and I didn't like it, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4683.240000000001s)]
*  and I never been afraid to go in the gym again. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4684.240000000001s)]
*  30 years later, [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4689.88s)]
*  I said I would never go in a ring [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4693.400000000001s)]
*  or any situation ill-repaired or unrepaired. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4695.6s)]
*  I always go in there prepared. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4702.56s)]
*  That lesson that I said to you then, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4706.08s)]
*  and I say to you now, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4711.740000000001s)]
*  being in that institution, having that experience, [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4714.120000000001s)]
*  going in and in that gym for the first time [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4717.6s)]
*  and say, after a year went by, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4719.84s)]
*  and only by accident that I went down that gym [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4722.54s)]
*  because I was headed to another block, as I said earlier, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4727.34s)]
*  and then get down that gym [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4731.06s)]
*  because boxing was in the penitentiaries in that era. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4732.34s)]
*  We had boxing there attached to the AAU, [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4736.78s)]
*  which is the same thing they have outside. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4741.44s)]
*  It's to bring young fighters in there to fight us. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4743.34s)]
*  They're amateurs, have shows for the inmates. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4745.9s)]
*  You buy a ticket at the commissary, [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4749.9s)]
*  you go to the fights that Friday, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4751.78s)]
*  and inmates watch you, root for you. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4755.9s)]
*  I didn't like how I felt. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4761.0599999999995s)]
*  I wasn't prepared. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4763.74s)]
*  They didn't beat me because I wasn't better. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4764.82s)]
*  I got beat because I didn't run. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4770.259999999999s)]
*  I got beat because of the ego. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4774.9s)]
*  I got beat because as they say the word hater, [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4777.52s)]
*  that I go down there and say, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4780.0s)]
*  hey, you wanna get in there with him? [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4781.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah, come on. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4783.160000000001s)]
*  I used to box when I was in the streets. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4784.0s)]
*  That's the common talk. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4786.4400000000005s)]
*  I used to do this when I was in the street. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4788.040000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4789.92s)]
*  But those same old head trainers that double life [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4792.52s)]
*  or one life sentence or two life sentences, [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4795.4400000000005s)]
*  they spoke about me on Behind the Glory, Brian Gumbel. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4800.96s)]
*  Look it up. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4805.0s)]
*  It's out there. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4806.36s)]
*  They spoke about me when I visit that same prison [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4808.08s)]
*  in my early professional career. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4811.44s)]
*  Guess what? [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4813.78s)]
*  Doing what? [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4814.62s)]
*  Sparring for my Atlantic City preliminary fights [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4815.46s)]
*  when I was building my record [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4818.48s)]
*  to get to where I became a champion. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4820.04s)]
*  I became the USBA champion, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4824.599999999999s)]
*  which is a sister of the IBF World Championship belt. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4826.44s)]
*  I left that institution. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4832.12s)]
*  Anyone would have ran as far as they could. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4839.28s)]
*  They would have ran so far from that place [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4844.2s)]
*  and never wanna see it again. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4847.24s)]
*  But after six to seven months [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4851.28s)]
*  of coming from a first professional loss [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4856.0s)]
*  with Clinton Mitchell in Atlantic City, look it up, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4858.84s)]
*  I took off 89 and 90. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4863.16s)]
*  The streets was grabbing me. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4865.68s)]
*  I still had seven and a half years parole [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4869.2s)]
*  through the math, nine years. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4871.92s)]
*  I rebooted my first fight, I believe, was in 91, 90 and 91. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4877.08s)]
*  But that crucial moment, that year and a half, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4882.08s)]
*  if you look up my record, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4889.88s)]
*  you'll see Clinton Mitchell 89, inactive. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4891.0s)]
*  89 inactive, 90 inactive, 91. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4896.1s)]
*  What was happening in 16 months? [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4899.2s)]
*  I made a decision, meeting an old guy named Bowie Fisher, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4905.32s)]
*  Guy Rizisso. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4910.08s)]
*  He won a championship. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4913.5199999999995s)]
*  He should be in the Hall of Fame because of me. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4917.16s)]
*  I'm already in there. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4919.28s)]
*  I'm the only fighter he ever had. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4921.36s)]
*  Very few trainers go in the Hall of Fame [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4923.4s)]
*  with one Hall of Famer or fighter. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4925.0s)]
*  The fighter gets in, but the trainer might not. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4928.44s)]
*  And I'm not saying it's bad or good, [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4931.24s)]
*  I'm just saying that's how it goes. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4932.92s)]
*  He made a, and I made a bet. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4935.96s)]
*  You be in, this is out there, you be in the gym tomorrow [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4941.4s)]
*  and the next day and every day that we in the gym, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4947.34s)]
*  I will be here. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4951.24s)]
*  He heard young fighters come through. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4952.2s)]
*  He heard guys come through before. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4954.12s)]
*  Oh, can you train me? [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4956.08s)]
*  I'm gonna be here tomorrow. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4957.4s)]
*  He might come tomorrow, but they don't come. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4961.32s)]
*  To be a champion every day that the gym is open. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4965.96s)]
*  And we had a bet without even saying it's a bet. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4972.24s)]
*  He asked me to come and he would be there. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4975.16s)]
*  If I come, he said he would be there. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4980.12s)]
*  And it was sort of like, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4982.76s)]
*  and to the point we stopped even thinking about it. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4986.4s)]
*  We just repeated it to the reporters [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4988.66s)]
*  and everybody that talked to us. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4990.4s)]
*  That's how we met. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4991.96s)]
*  How long after your first professional loss [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4992.92s)]
*  do you hook up with Bowie Fisher? [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4995.4s)]
*  80, 90, 91, 92. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=4998.28s)]
*  So that's 16 months. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5002.84s)]
*  That's when you hook up with him. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5004.78s)]
*  And how long do you spend training with him [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5006.12s)]
*  before you have your next professional fight? [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5008.18s)]
*  All the way up to the train a dead fight. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5010.14s)]
*  So during that 16 months off, were you just training? [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5017.08s)]
*  Were you just improving? [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5022.44s)]
*  Yeah, but the training was fighting. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5023.76s)]
*  You have mandatory. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5028.36s)]
*  I had two fights, maybe three a year [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5031.24s)]
*  until you establish yourself. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5033.28s)]
*  Normally two a year once you get at that level [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5034.48s)]
*  of competition. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5036.88s)]
*  But yeah, I stayed in the gym. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5040.8s)]
*  You heard the saying, gym rat. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5043.36s)]
*  I was a rat in that gym. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5047.5599999999995s)]
*  I stayed in the gym. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5048.96s)]
*  And one thing else that I pass on [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5051.28s)]
*  to the Golden Boy Fighters today, [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5054.12s)]
*  because they come to me, they ask me, [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5058.78s)]
*  of course, why wouldn't they? [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5061.2s)]
*  Right? [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5062.8s)]
*  History normally repeats itself. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5065.5199999999995s)]
*  Watch old fights. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5071.84s)]
*  The old fights they're watching is our era. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5075.98s)]
*  Mm. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5078.46s)]
*  I say, not only that, go to the next era. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5079.66s)]
*  Go as far as back that you need to go [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5083.9400000000005s)]
*  to understand that what you think you're doing [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5085.7s)]
*  has been done already, but the beauty of going back [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5088.22s)]
*  and getting experience and add it to the land [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5090.9800000000005s)]
*  of time that you got. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5093.780000000001s)]
*  The land, you have land, you can build a stench [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5095.02s)]
*  until you're out. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5097.780000000001s)]
*  The land you have in your age [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5098.820000000001s)]
*  and the time you now are developing, [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5100.900000000001s)]
*  take knowledge from the cradle to the grave [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5104.02s)]
*  and take those recipes, put them together from the past [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5106.34s)]
*  and you add it to the foundation that you already have, [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5110.46s)]
*  which is you, your style. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5113.66s)]
*  It will be hard to adjust to a guy, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5117.82s)]
*  to adjust to be the guy that has more than one weapon. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5120.78s)]
*  And I don't mean their hands. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5126.26s)]
*  I'm talking about in their arsenal. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5129.900000000001s)]
*  In their arsenal. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5132.54s)]
*  It's hard to be the guy like that. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5134.0s)]
*  Joe Frazier, great fighter, Hall of Famer, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5137.04s)]
*  but never boxed like Ali. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5143.96s)]
*  He came forward even though [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5146.72s)]
*  it was to his disadvantage. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5151.34s)]
*  You in New York City at 12 noon, driving, [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5155.639999999999s)]
*  but you don't have reverse. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5158.72s)]
*  You gonna get jammed up. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5159.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5161.48s)]
*  You anywhere in there, [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5163.679999999999s)]
*  you anywhere in New York Times Square down there [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5164.679999999999s)]
*  and you came back up, you gonna have a problem. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5166.759999999999s)]
*  I guarantee you, take that concept into a fight. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5170.54s)]
*  You know that you gotta back up [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5175.799999999999s)]
*  or at least duck some of those, [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5177.839999999999s)]
*  but you still conditioned to go forward [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5179.44s)]
*  because you've been successful all the way up to now. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5181.7s)]
*  I never wanted that element of surprise. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5185.2s)]
*  So I learned how to box going forward, [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5187.299999999999s)]
*  sideways, from Philly. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5189.56s)]
*  I know how to go forward, [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5192.72s)]
*  but now I'll show you the boxing style. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5195.740000000001s)]
*  And I'm gonna show you. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5197.96s)]
*  So I gave my opponents fits [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5198.8s)]
*  on trying to find a strategy [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5203.0s)]
*  that I actually gonna stick with myself [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5206.06s)]
*  that they can beat me on. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5208.96s)]
*  And again, it was successful, very few, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5210.160000000001s)]
*  but some was successful and some got help. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5212.68s)]
*  But I have no, [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5217.32s)]
*  I have no reserve apologizing [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5220.88s)]
*  in anything that happened in my career that I've done. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5224.92s)]
*  And I say that at that moment, [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5228.12s)]
*  even though you didn't ask, but you brought it up, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5230.28s)]
*  the Tito, Trinidad. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5233.12s)]
*  I've been to San Juan maybe two or three times. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5236.12s)]
*  Do I know for sure when I went there and ate food, [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5239.84s)]
*  did somebody spit in the kitchen in my food? [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5242.92s)]
*  I don't know that, but I can tell you the love [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5245.28s)]
*  that I got, the response that I got. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5250.12s)]
*  And it's not the same generation, [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5253.2s)]
*  but it's always an OG hanging around, [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5255.5s)]
*  cigars, Panama hat, come right out. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5261.88s)]
*  Here's your Pernada, your BTO. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5265.5599999999995s)]
*  Yo, here I'm in San Juan, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5270.84s)]
*  and I got the generations all in between surrounding me, [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5272.24s)]
*  saying, [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5277.719999999999s)]
*  you was a great champion, sign gloves, [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5280.8s)]
*  sign my autograph, come on. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5282.76s)]
*  You really mean that, Papa, you mean to mean [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5286.92s)]
*  you threw the flag down, you don't like Puerto Rico, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5289.16s)]
*  so what are you talking about? [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5291.4s)]
*  We got a little San Juan in Philadelphia. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5292.36s)]
*  Every city got a little San Juan. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5294.639999999999s)]
*  I said, but at that moment, [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5297.2s)]
*  I wasn't getting respected. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5300.9s)]
*  He said, Don King promotion. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5304.219999999999s)]
*  I had to sleep business-wise [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5307.62s)]
*  to get the opportunity with Don for two fights. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5313.259999999999s)]
*  So I had a two-fight deal, the tournament. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5317.099999999999s)]
*  And I'm the oldest one in the tournament, [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5324.099999999999s)]
*  I'm the grandfather in the tournament [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5326.0199999999995s)]
*  that should be in your nursing home based on their, [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5328.22s)]
*  well, based on most fighters of your era [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5332.42s)]
*  when they got to that age. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5334.7s)]
*  Correct, but I understand how they thinking. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5336.3s)]
*  But the difference is I'm different, [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5340.76s)]
*  but I gotta prove it. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5343.02s)]
*  So now, [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5344.62s)]
*  the promotion starts. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5347.780000000001s)]
*  We in New York, HBO, blah, blah, blah. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5349.46s)]
*  Say hold up. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5354.54s)]
*  Oh. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5355.38s)]
*  T.O., Trinidad, has multiple followers. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5357.34s)]
*  He has a multi-million dollar contract with TV. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5361.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm the renegade. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5365.1s)]
*  I had a pendantary every time the commentators [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5366.5s)]
*  bring my name up, he did five years for this, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5369.14s)]
*  wrap five, so I understand the Robin Hood [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5371.7s)]
*  and understand the bad guy. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5374.58s)]
*  So you got the good guy in the bad car, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5375.78s)]
*  that's what sells, I get it. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5377.62s)]
*  But I ain't had to surrender to it. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5380.26s)]
*  I knew what their agenda was, now let me show mine. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5382.82s)]
*  In New York City, I said listen, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5386.5s)]
*  this is the first four city press conference. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5391.54s)]
*  I have 11 defenses. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5397.34s)]
*  I stopped at 21, 22 defenses. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5399.179999999999s)]
*  I had 11 at this time, I said look, I'm the champion. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5405.219999999999s)]
*  Tito's coming up the way to win my title. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5408.54s)]
*  Don King, [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5410.94s)]
*  presented me a deal with my [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5413.82s)]
*  advisor, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5418.099999999999s)]
*  representator, [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5420.259999999999s)]
*  for a two-fight deal, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5424.38s)]
*  to be in this historic, since Morris Marvin Hagler [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5427.139999999999s)]
*  underspurted tournament for the Sugar Ray Robinson trophy. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5431.0199999999995s)]
*  He don't pass that up, [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5436.54s)]
*  because this takes me to stardom. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5439.259999999999s)]
*  So I signed on. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5443.219999999999s)]
*  Press conference starts, New York. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5446.38s)]
*  Want me to play second? [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5450.62s)]
*  Tito is more known. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5452.259999999999s)]
*  Tito just beat Oscar De La Hoya by a split decision. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5453.7s)]
*  Controversial not split decision. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5457.7s)]
*  I'm letting everyone know that HBO, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5466.0199999999995s)]
*  Cary Davis, Ross Greenberg, [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5468.38s)]
*  the suits at HBO at that time, Mark Tafford. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5471.86s)]
*  I said, [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5479.18s)]
*  we going to Philadelphia from New York, [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5483.18s)]
*  then Miami, and then San Juan. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5485.78s)]
*  Promotional tour. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5489.14s)]
*  I'll anticipate the bullshit. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5493.02s)]
*  I'm thinking I'm going to play second, [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5496.68s)]
*  because Tito has much fan base than me, [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5498.88s)]
*  and the Latin market is huge, which okay, I know that, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5503.320000000001s)]
*  but still, I'm not surrendering. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5506.76s)]
*  You're still the champion. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5509.04s)]
*  And I'm Bernard Hopkins. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5511.76s)]
*  If y'all don't respect me, [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5515.280000000001s)]
*  when we go to this next city, [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5519.0s)]
*  because I threw the flag down in New York City, [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5521.32s)]
*  there's a park right next door, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5525.2s)]
*  across the street from HBO buildings in Manhattan. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5527.92s)]
*  Can't mention the name, now I can, [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5531.84s)]
*  but I don't remember the name, but it's there. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5533.52s)]
*  And we had the press conference there. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5537.12s)]
*  The flag went down in New York first. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5540.56s)]
*  They quieted it up real quick because [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5543.64s)]
*  they didn't want it to spread like it was supposed to. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5547.24s)]
*  But it was already out through some reporters that was there. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5551.68s)]
*  That was the first stop, New York City. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5554.0s)]
*  And they didn't respect me. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5559.0s)]
*  And I said to them, if we're going to do these next cities, [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5561.88s)]
*  and y'all don't worry about me, [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5567.4400000000005s)]
*  you're not being conscious of this flag going down again. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5568.76s)]
*  They didn't respect that I have 11 defenses, [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5575.92s)]
*  this is my division. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5578.64s)]
*  Tito's coming up to my division to make history. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5581.56s)]
*  You're going to respect me. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5586.16s)]
*  I'm going to be first, and I'm going to be last [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5588.400000000001s)]
*  through this tour that we're going to do. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5592.84s)]
*  I'm not going to play second behind, [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5596.68s)]
*  y'all trying to win the middle battle before it starts. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5598.16s)]
*  I'm not putting them up there like that. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5601.12s)]
*  Y'all can do it, but you ain't going to do it in front of me. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5602.84s)]
*  It's going to be a problem. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5605.12s)]
*  Now we can do this press conference, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5606.2s)]
*  we can go to Philly and we can go to Miami [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5607.68s)]
*  and we can go to San Juan. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5611.0s)]
*  I know it just like it happened yesterday. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5613.320000000001s)]
*  I said, but one thing for sure, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5615.360000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to apologize [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5616.8s)]
*  because that's what they wanted me to do. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5618.08s)]
*  Where I come from, you don't punch a man [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5620.56s)]
*  or take his money until you say sorry the next day. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5622.280000000001s)]
*  You don't do that. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5625.08s)]
*  You take it and you stand on it. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5626.12s)]
*  And if you see him again, you take it again. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5628.200000000001s)]
*  I said, I'm not going to apologize. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5630.84s)]
*  Y'all can wait, we can go. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5632.56s)]
*  So I want to go. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5634.280000000001s)]

*  I'm outnumbered, correct? [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5816.52s)]
*  They got to calling certain names, you know, [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5819.32s)]

*  Trinidad got away from the podium. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5899.48s)]

*  He's waving the flag in this video, he's waving the flag. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5918.0599999999995s)]

*  Don was fighting me not to get, [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5948.74s)]
*  I grabbed the flag from his hand. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5951.54s)]
*  We tussled three, four minutes, three seconds, excuse me. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5954.0199999999995s)]
*  And literally for a second was quiet. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5960.459999999999s)]
*  When that flag hit that ground. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5965.86s)]
*  It is right here. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5970.419999999999s)]
*  Don telling me back up, I'm pointing my finger at Tito. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5974.0199999999995s)]
*  I snatched the flag out of Don's hand, [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5978.84s)]
*  his eyes opened up, everything is when, [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5980.4s)]
*  the fans from the front was already coming down. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5983.32s)]

*  So they was taking me up to the balcony [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5989.28s)]
*  where I had to jump down in between the bleachers. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5992.16s)]
*  I had to get down to the dugout, basically, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=5996.68s)]
*  to get free, to get away, because they was coming up. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6001.52s)]
*  They was taking me up because they was coming [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6004.9400000000005s)]

*  And the only way to get down was to jump down [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6016.44s)]
*  like the dugout that you go through. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6021.639999999999s)]
*  And this is after you threw the flag down? [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6024.12s)]
*  Of course, the flag went down. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6025.96s)]
*  When the flag went down, they were just coming. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6027.639999999999s)]
*  And somebody hit me there, whoever the guy was, [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6032.32s)]
*  Nazeem Richardson is behind me with the Kufi, Sharif, [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6038.4s)]
*  all my guys, two of my guys, [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6044.44s)]
*  the rest of the people just hit me on my back [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6045.759999999999s)]
*  and throwing things at me. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6051.74s)]
*  So they're just trying to now actually get away [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6052.92s)]
*  from the crowd that's coming up. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6056.28s)]
*  Where I'm going, I don't know. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6057.679999999999s)]
*  I jumped down at the opening, [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6058.719999999999s)]
*  and that's when the sheriff or the police said, [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6061.759999999999s)]
*  look, that way. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6065.74s)]
*  He wasn't helping. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6067.099999999999s)]
*  So we found a room, locked ourselves in a room, [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6069.0199999999995s)]
*  holding the door. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6074.0199999999995s)]
*  Now we're trying to lock the door, [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6075.08s)]

*  They pushing the door, we holding the door. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6078.9s)]
*  We gotta hold this door like this. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6080.78s)]
*  Anybody that remember that moment [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6083.54s)]
*  after they hear this podcast, it rained. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6087.719999999999s)]
*  Look, we all know how the tropical storms come [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6092.94s)]
*  over there in the islands. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6095.66s)]
*  It rained so hard around the time that we needed [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6096.780000000001s)]
*  to get out of there and get straight to the airport, [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6103.9400000000005s)]
*  which they took us motorcade, cops on both sides [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6107.4800000000005s)]
*  with fans and cars riding on the side and behind us. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6110.7s)]
*  It was like 95 on the East Coast. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6116.3s)]
*  It was like I-10 crossing West Coast to the East Coast. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6118.76s)]
*  They was on our ass going to the airport. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6121.46s)]
*  That moment, that moment that I got on that airport, [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6126.54s)]
*  got to the airport and got on that plane, [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6133.3s)]
*  that moment and the weeks to come [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6137.14s)]
*  before September 29th, 2001, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6141.58s)]
*  Tito had to train from my perspective. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6146.82s)]
*  Now said this leading up to the fight [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6151.82s)]
*  when I had interviews and mentioned it [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6153.46s)]
*  because the flag was brought up, of course, [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6155.78s)]
*  in the riot that I caused and instigated. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6158.099999999999s)]
*  Tito had to hit that bag with that thought of hitting me. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6164.54s)]
*  He had to train and run. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6168.82s)]
*  He had to be reminded because he always stayed in San Juan [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6171.66s)]
*  and train. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6176.3s)]
*  He rarely went to camp if he ever went to camp to train. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6177.14s)]
*  He stayed in San Juan. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6180.54s)]
*  He's the hero even to today. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6182.18s)]
*  And Tito had to hear something from whether his siblings, [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6184.38s)]
*  cousins, uncles, next door neighbor, [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6190.54s)]
*  whoever, wherever he was at for training camp in San Juan, [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6193.46s)]
*  someone was reminding him. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6198.58s)]
*  The name that they was calling me is Diablo. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6202.0199999999995s)]
*  They was calling me all kinds of stuff [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6206.58s)]
*  and I wore it like a badge of honor [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6209.26s)]
*  because I wanted to send a message [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6211.82s)]
*  and I wanted him to go through those four or five weeks left [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6216.86s)]
*  because on 9-11, they rebooted to the 29th. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6220.74s)]
*  I wanted him to think about me [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6226.58s)]
*  every time he preparing for that fight [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6230.58s)]
*  because someone's gonna remind him [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6234.22s)]
*  even if it's a guy that he's getting groceries from. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6236.18s)]
*  And I wanted him to think about what I did [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6242.740000000001s)]
*  and what he has to do. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6247.62s)]
*  So now taking that strategy of art of war [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6249.06s)]
*  because I wanna fight a guy that's mad at me, [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6255.18s)]
*  not a guy that trained and planned [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6257.34s)]
*  and got a skill set of how to beat me. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6259.42s)]
*  Give me that angry man every day. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6265.78s)]
*  I love the angry guy because he's going off emotions [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6268.66s)]
*  and I'm going off intellect and boxing. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6273.7s)]
*  Business the same way. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6277.5s)]
*  If you can get him mad, you can get him done. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6280.34s)]
*  The intellect, the strategy, [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6286.14s)]
*  you trying to hit me and knock me out every time. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6289.14s)]
*  The risk is always if I get hit, I'm done. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6292.54s)]
*  But I take that because I bank on what? [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6296.9400000000005s)]
*  Defense makes a good offense. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6299.7s)]
*  A defense make a good offense. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6301.9400000000005s)]
*  A good defense is a good offense because of what? [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6307.1s)]
*  You have to earn every day. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6311.1s)]
*  But you have to earn everything you get [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6313.14s)]
*  when you hit Bernard Hopkins, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6316.18s)]
*  the executioner, the alien, the bhop. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6317.5s)]

*  and they started asking questions. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6347.78s)]
*  I said because I'm a fucking alien. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6349.38s)]
*  And I instructed my guy, Sharif, [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6352.82s)]

*  that my consistency and it's just who I am. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6496.86s)]
*  I'm not a late-nighter. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6501.1s)]
*  I push myself to get rest early [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6503.26s)]
*  when I'm doing fights in different time zones. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6505.7s)]
*  As I leave here, I'm headed to Vegas. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6508.7s)]
*  To do what? A fight. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6511.9s)]
*  Undergo them boy promotion. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6513.66s)]
*  So I know how to take that same, [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6516.339999999999s)]
*  to relate on the questions that you just asked me. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6520.86s)]
*  I know how to take those moments of rest. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6524.219999999999s)]
*  I know how to take those moments of being active. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6527.82s)]
*  I know how to take those moments [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6531.379999999999s)]
*  on how to take care of myself like I'm fighting, [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6532.66s)]
*  but I'm not anymore physically. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6535.9s)]
*  This is a different type of [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6538.7s)]
*  resume for me to do. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6544.62s)]
*  So I have to go ahead and do what? [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6547.58s)]
*  Keep my mind straight, answers and questions. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6550.62s)]
*  Well, questions is coming from everybody, [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6554.58s)]
*  is looking how you answer it to see [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6557.9800000000005s)]
*  if they can fill something in that gave them information. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6560.58s)]
*  You know, I look at some of the politicians [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6563.58s)]
*  and I say sometimes they ask the questions [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6569.18s)]
*  just to give you a lot, but nothing. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6571.0599999999995s)]
*  Right? Yeah. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6575.7s)]
*  In boxing, there are small percentage [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6578.42s)]
*  that legitimately ask you a question [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6585.9s)]
*  because they don't know. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6588.86s)]
*  And then most of the time, [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6591.18s)]
*  you gotta at least be under the impression [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6592.78s)]
*  that they're trying to connect something [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6597.46s)]
*  that they already know. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6600.58s)]
*  For instance, hey Bernard, what do you think about [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6603.0599999999995s)]
*  Ryan Garcia suing Golden Boy? [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6605.62s)]
*  Oh Bernard, what do you think about [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6611.66s)]
*  Oscar is not [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6617.38s)]
*  telling the truth about something. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6618.46s)]
*  My head is always on a swivel, on the block, [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6627.34s)]
*  but having your head on a swivel in this perspective [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6632.46s)]
*  is not looking because they see me looking. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6635.78s)]
*  You know who they are when they know you're not looking [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6638.82s)]
*  or they think you're not looking, put it that way. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6641.7s)]
*  That's who they really are. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6646.02s)]
*  Not when they're in your face most of the time, [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6648.34s)]
*  not when they're in your presence, [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6650.34s)]
*  but when they know that you [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6651.9800000000005s)]
*  or they think that you're not paying attention, [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6653.18s)]
*  that's who they really are. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6655.26s)]
*  I'm watching them, not even looking at them. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6656.46s)]
*  D block. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6660.46s)]
*  I know it's on my right, right here in this studio. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6661.900000000001s)]
*  I know it's on my left. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6664.42s)]
*  Obviously I came in and I scanned it, [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6666.34s)]
*  but right now I know it's to the right and the left, [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6668.1s)]
*  but I don't know what's in back of me. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6671.5s)]
*  So I constantly, constantly put those messages out there [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6674.14s)]
*  when it's needed because they no longer can say [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6684.78s)]
*  I'm the paranoid one. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6689.7s)]
*  They used to say I was boxing to try to justify [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6690.78s)]
*  that I'm speaking the truth, [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6693.74s)]
*  but if they could convince most who listen what they fed [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6696.22s)]
*  and move out on what they fed, [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6700.42s)]
*  whether it's newspaper, TV, I don't even watch TV no more. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6702.3s)]
*  I'll be living in another country if I did. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6707.34s)]
*  Then the advantage is to them, not to you. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6712.900000000001s)]
*  But once you start doing something [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6718.34s)]
*  that boxing business people don't like, [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6719.9800000000005s)]
*  why you think you're seeing those fighters [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6723.9400000000005s)]
*  having nervous breakdowns in the ring crying, [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6725.3s)]
*  heavyweight contender? [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6728.18s)]
*  Having breakdowns on the side of the ring [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6730.9800000000005s)]
*  because there today, [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6737.26s)]
*  people that talks about Don King [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6742.38s)]
*  and he all what I know he is, [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6744.820000000001s)]
*  I have testimony to that. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6748.9800000000005s)]
*  You ain't got to convince me, [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6750.78s)]
*  but he ain't the only Don King out there of personality. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6751.78s)]
*  And track record that some might think that [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6760.38s)]
*  there's only one mind and one entity [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6767.78s)]
*  that did extraordinary job whether you like it or not. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6772.42s)]
*  They came from, just think about Don King's history. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6776.860000000001s)]
*  Here's a guy, few hours from New York, [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6784.42s)]
*  I mean Philadelphia, excuse me, Cleveland. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6787.98s)]
*  Take the system, [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6794.66s)]
*  the law and broke some. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6799.5s)]
*  And had that long 50, 40, 40 plus something years [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6805.5s)]
*  to do with the rules that was set way before him [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6810.58s)]
*  and use it the way he'd done for so many years. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6821.5s)]
*  Oh Bernard, you sound like you're patronizing, nah. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6829.06s)]
*  I'm just telling you he done something [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6832.14s)]
*  that's normally not done for a period of time [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6835.7s)]
*  from a culture that looks like me, that's my point. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6844.78s)]
*  That's extraordinary. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6850.0599999999995s)]
*  Normally it's the mob. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6852.62s)]
*  From Vegas all the way to Boston, [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6856.62s)]
*  Philadelphia and every city in the state, [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6859.22s)]
*  I mean state in the United States. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6861.66s)]
*  To take those openings and opportunities [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6866.66s)]
*  to have a long extended decades of a run like that. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6876.5s)]
*  Now I know he was in his own 100%. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6886.62s)]
*  Boss, but you get to the point [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6896.099999999999s)]
*  we ever run like him so long. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6899.62s)]
*  You get to pay your way out of paying somebody [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6903.099999999999s)]
*  the first to start off. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6905.139999999999s)]
*  I'm pretty sure the Muhammad Ali's suddenly listening. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6909.3s)]
*  I'm pretty sure the 80s, early 80s, the 70s. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6914.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm pretty sure they had the guys with the suit and tie [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6920.06s)]
*  sitting there. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6927.38s)]
*  I still think that suddenly listening [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6928.860000000001s)]
*  could have got up from the right hand from Muhammad Ali. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6931.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that seemed like he was acting. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6934.02s)]
*  That's Lewis in Maine, right? [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6938.34s)]
*  Correct. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6939.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that seemed like the fix was in. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6940.660000000001s)]
*  And you talk about the fight with Domenchenko. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6944.94s)]
*  You talk about the Haney fight that I'm pretty sure [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6950.179999999999s)]
*  you see the same way I see who won that fight. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6957.0199999999995s)]
*  And other fights, maybe one or two more [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6961.86s)]
*  that was kind of bizarre in the last few months. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6963.62s)]
*  And we briefly talked about it [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6968.86s)]
*  and we got on something else which, [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6970.379999999999s)]
*  how me and your mind I think works up in here [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6972.58s)]
*  for a couple of hours now. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6974.54s)]
*  I got to understand how this thing is working out [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6976.14s)]
*  in the conversation of corruption, period. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6981.78s)]
*  Period. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6992.62s)]
*  There need to be, brought to the forefront, [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6994.14s)]
*  there need to have a light. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=6998.18s)]
*  Flash on the roaches. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7002.9s)]
*  And then they'll try to scatter [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7006.26s)]
*  and you just gotta crush them [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7007.7s)]
*  before they get to their destination of retreat. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7010.86s)]
*  Yeah, this is long about conversation [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7017.5s)]
*  that we got into corruption. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7019.62s)]
*  But what I wanted to bring it back to [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7021.06s)]
*  was like you were saying it was your lifestyle. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7022.82s)]
*  You're saying it was your discipline [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7026.58s)]
*  but it was you put in your body [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7029.54s)]
*  what you needed to survive and thrive. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7032.18s)]
*  Need to live, not to die. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7035.66s)]
*  You didn't fuck around, you didn't drink, [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7037.1s)]
*  you didn't smoke, you didn't party, [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7038.82s)]
*  you always got your sleep. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7040.18s)]
*  Don't eat bad food, don't mess with sugar. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7041.14s)]
*  I read everything, I read everything. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7044.38s)]
*  You read books on nutrition. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7046.38s)]
*  I read books, everything. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7047.22s)]
*  I read the back of the label of the stuff [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7048.26s)]
*  that I was purchasing. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7050.1s)]
*  I take my Maltese. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7052.46s)]
*  I never got into, I don't even like needles. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7054.58s)]
*  Better long shots. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7058.34s)]
*  B-12s, I take B-12s. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7060.42s)]
*  I used to get the B-12 shots for energy [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7061.9400000000005s)]
*  to lose in weight whether it was water weight or not. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7064.9400000000005s)]
*  I got two and a half, 3% body fat. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7071.22s)]
*  Probably up to a three now. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7073.900000000001s)]
*  So the sponge gets to the point where it is what it is. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7076.82s)]
*  Now you're burning muscle. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7081.9800000000005s)]
*  Bingo. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7083.78s)]
*  Now you're losing nutrients. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7084.66s)]
*  You were one of the first fighters that I ever heard [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7086.06s)]
*  that was eating organic. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7088.54s)]
*  Yes. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7089.299999999999s)]
*  And I was like, oh. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7090.259999999999s)]
*  To today. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7091.46s)]
*  As an ex-fighter, again, these things make me feel good. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7092.98s)]
*  And these things, listen, I know how hard I need to work [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7098.379999999999s)]
*  when I need to work. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7101.9s)]
*  I know when I need to just blow some dust off my body [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7102.82s)]
*  a little bit just to get a little warmed up. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7107.0199999999995s)]
*  So every day I'm not going hard. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7108.66s)]
*  To today I'm not going hard. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7110.419999999999s)]
*  I don't hit the bag, I ain't hit the bag since I retired. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7111.54s)]
*  I ain't been in a boxing gym, for what? [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7114.0199999999995s)]
*  My stuff is weights to keep the muscle that we lose [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7117.18s)]
*  at a certain age every two years, year and a half [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7120.14s)]
*  you lose certain percentage of muscle. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7122.5s)]
*  I'm just trying to keep that depth. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7125.3s)]
*  I'm gonna look good in my suits. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7127.02s)]
*  You understand? [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7128.66s)]
*  What do you do now for working out? [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7130.22s)]
*  Well, I do some running twice a week. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7132.74s)]
*  I do a long distance run, three and a half, four miles, [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7136.900000000001s)]
*  depending on how my crew can hang in or how I feel. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7140.02s)]
*  But three tops. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7143.900000000001s)]
*  I do A80s, I do running blow it out. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7146.66s)]
*  A80s, I used to do that with Mackie Showstone. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7148.9s)]
*  Shout out to Mackie Showstone from New Orleans. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7152.54s)]
*  He worked with a couple of greats even, to tennis. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7155.78s)]
*  So Mackie taught me a lot. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7158.66s)]
*  He let my guy video eight weeks of training in New Orleans. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7161.0599999999995s)]
*  He worked with Holyfield, correct? [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7165.98s)]
*  He worked with Bo, Riddick Bo. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7167.58s)]
*  He worked with Roy Jones Jr. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7170.82s)]
*  when he went up to heavyweight to fight John Ruiz. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7172.94s)]
*  He worked with Dow Strawberry, [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7176.5s)]
*  the Hall of Famer baseball player. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7178.139999999999s)]
*  And he was one of the first guys to do [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7179.98s)]
*  a lot of unconventional training. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7182.74s)]
*  He worked with me, yes. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7184.179999999999s)]
*  He worked with me to build me up from 160 to 75 [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7185.54s)]
*  to the two weight classes we talked about. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7188.66s)]
*  So, and he's still, he's gotta be in his mid 70s now [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7191.0199999999995s)]
*  and great shape. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7196.099999999999s)]
*  I believe he's still in New Orleans. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7198.099999999999s)]
*  We made history together. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7199.78s)]
*  And one thing he did, I had a guy, right? [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7201.0599999999995s)]
*  But his job was in my camp was to film everything. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7204.0599999999995s)]
*  Whether we having an off day, which we do on Sundays, right? [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7209.58s)]
*  Some Saturdays if I'm peeking. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7213.62s)]
*  If my training boy, Fritz, will see me sparring, [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7215.66s)]
*  he'll say, well, we just did nine rounds. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7217.5s)]
*  He ain't even breathing. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7218.98s)]
*  And he's sharp on the seventh, eighth and ninth. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7219.82s)]
*  We gotta take a break, take two days off. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7222.94s)]
*  So we have our sparring partners fighting. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7226.179999999999s)]
*  So I have a guy named Linwood. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7229.139999999999s)]
*  He was basically like I camp entertainment. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7232.34s)]
*  Heavy guy, like the E, that's where he carries the camera. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7238.14s)]
*  Camera quarter is big. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7240.9400000000005s)]
*  And he filmed the off days, the sparring, [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7243.3s)]
*  the training that Mackie gave me the permission to use. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7247.82s)]
*  Everything Mackie was building me up to be quick [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7251.82s)]
*  as a middle, just like a middleweight. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7255.66s)]
*  Don't lose none of that. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7257.38s)]
*  But have the structure of a light heavyweight, [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7258.900000000001s)]
*  slash cruiserweight, which at that time was 190 and is 200. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7261.9400000000005s)]
*  Mackie Shorstone taught me above and beyond [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7268.42s)]
*  from a science and from his view to add on to mine. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7275.1s)]
*  And today I pass that on to young fighters who ask [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7280.62s)]
*  or show them the video. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7285.34s)]
*  Bingo. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7288.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, different things he did. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7289.5s)]
*  Did a lot of unconventional stuff. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7293.38s)]
*  Unconventional stuff. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7294.74s)]
*  And you might look at it and say, [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7296.46s)]
*  what this guy's doing boxing? [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7297.3s)]
*  You don't punch like that in the ring. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7298.46s)]
*  But the explosiveness that he was telling me moments [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7300.14s)]
*  of my explosiveness, like there, jumping off that [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7303.38s)]
*  and jumping on that has a lot to do with being in the ring [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7305.7s)]
*  when you're moving. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7307.86s)]
*  And a lot of doing like that counter right there, [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7308.86s)]
*  that counter right hand, that counter right hand. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7311.14s)]
*  These are the things that he used to be the X15 [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7313.42s)]
*  because he got that service mentality [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7317.02s)]
*  and he's telling you about the bombs [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7319.22s)]
*  and they come in, how you have to get in that mentality [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7322.700000000001s)]
*  of being at war. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7326.900000000001s)]
*  Like the off days on a Sunday, Mack used to come [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7330.620000000001s)]
*  to Big Bear where I was staying at Oscar's facility [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7336.3s)]
*  at the time. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7339.22s)]
*  Gordon Boyd was promoting the fight. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7341.540000000001s)]
*  And he would come and he would say, look, [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7344.7s)]
*  I'm gonna fly out there. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7348.5s)]
*  We're gonna go to the base and we're gonna be gonna get [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7350.58s)]
*  in some number of, I can't remember, [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7354.26s)]
*  one of them fire fighting planes. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7357.74s)]
*  He did the same thing to Roy Jones Jr. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7360.78s)]
*  Me and Roy got in the Hall of Fame at the same time [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7363.179999999999s)]
*  two years ago. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7367.58s)]
*  So he has the same experience. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7368.98s)]
*  He has the same experience. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7372.3s)]
*  We talked about it. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7373.54s)]
*  Mackie taught me, you said the unconditional way [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7374.54s)]
*  of training coming in, showing you, building you up maybe, [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7378.58s)]
*  doing this, doing that, but he took it to a sort of [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7382.820000000001s)]
*  like a mental, you're at war, you have to be certain ways [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7385.58s)]
*  at certain time in the fight. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7392.1s)]
*  You might get cut, you might get in survival mode [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7394.74s)]
*  but not show that you're surviving. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7398.14s)]
*  How do you fight when you're tired? [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7400.06s)]
*  How do you fight when you're tired? [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7407.14s)]
*  Do you fight to survive means you fight just [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7408.860000000001s)]
*  to keep the guy off you because you don't want him [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7413.02s)]
*  to hit you anymore. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7415.14s)]
*  That's fighting to survive. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7416.14s)]
*  Or do you learn how to survive and still kick ass? [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7417.820000000001s)]
*  I learned to do that. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7423.900000000001s)]
*  When you see inside, [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7425.06s)]
*  I was brutal inside with my opponents. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7430.18s)]
*  I'll beat them and hit them every way they can imagine [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7435.26s)]
*  to break them down. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7440.54s)]
*  They call it, as the fighter would say, [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7442.740000000001s)]
*  I filed him or he hit me here, he hit me there. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7447.780000000001s)]
*  Old school, old school. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7452.26s)]
*  If the referee is in the ring and we're fighting, [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7455.620000000001s)]
*  we are fighting. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7460.820000000001s)]
*  Well, it's boxing. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7463.14s)]
*  No, we are fighting. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7464.06s)]
*  When you fight, they set the rules. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7467.860000000001s)]
*  You make the rules when you fight. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7472.860000000001s)]
*  And if the referee sleep at the wheel [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7477.06s)]
*  and a referee don't see that you complaining [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7479.14s)]
*  about something that he didn't see, then that's on you. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7485.0s)]
*  Because the same thing I do to you, you can do to me. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7487.98s)]
*  So once you start telling the referee [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7491.299999999999s)]
*  that I did something to you, [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7493.54s)]
*  I already got your heart now, you want help. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7494.98s)]
*  See Joe, we always going back then, [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7499.58s)]
*  and we can be what you eat, what you don't eat. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7501.179999999999s)]
*  You look great, what's your secret? [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7504.099999999999s)]
*  No, I don't have a secret. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7505.5s)]
*  You miss your diet? [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7507.099999999999s)]
*  No, it's not that, that's a lifestyle. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7508.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm gonna go back to this. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7509.66s)]
*  Especially in sports, any sports. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7513.179999999999s)]
*  This right here is so important. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7517.98s)]
*  The mind. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7524.299999999999s)]
*  Our soul and still wrapped up into the mental [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7525.66s)]
*  because this controls everything. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7532.219999999999s)]
*  This controls this. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7537.299999999999s)]
*  This body doesn't control this. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7541.299999999999s)]
*  They used to call weightlifting guys airheaded [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7544.42s)]
*  because they see this and they walking around, [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7548.02s)]
*  but where's the strategy book? [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7552.46s)]
*  Where's the playbook? [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7554.700000000001s)]
*  You don't have none. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7557.06s)]
*  You just bring in a sawed off shotgun to a fight. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7558.580000000001s)]
*  And I'm coming with multiple opportunities [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7565.22s)]
*  to get you out of here in sports. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7567.580000000001s)]
*  Now if you hit me, you hit me. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7572.38s)]
*  I know that's the risk, [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7575.38s)]
*  but I got a better chance from getting you [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7576.62s)]
*  and I got more opportunities how I get you. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7578.66s)]
*  That is important to me. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7581.82s)]
*  So when you talk about your overall biological age, [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7584.5s)]
*  how much of it do you think has to do [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7588.0599999999995s)]
*  not just with the lifestyle, [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7589.9s)]
*  but with being defensively responsible? [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7591.0199999999995s)]
*  Because you never really took beatings in your career. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7593.46s)]
*  You had good fights, but there was no beatings. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7597.42s)]
*  You were always defensively responsible. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7601.42s)]
*  Yes, because I want to be able to have life after boxing. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7603.5s)]
*  And you maintain that discipline while you're fighting [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7607.46s)]
*  even in the heat of a battle. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7609.54s)]
*  I maintain that discipline to not overreact [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7610.7s)]
*  and get excited even when I'm the hunter or being hunted. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7615.7s)]
*  Even if you look at that photo, [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7621.78s)]
*  that video that you just showed [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7622.98s)]
*  of you landing that right hand, your chin is tucked. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7624.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7627.46s)]
*  You were always tucked. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7628.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7630.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7630.860000000001s)]
*  And that habit, I was taught that. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7631.700000000001s)]
*  How was I taught that? [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7637.660000000001s)]
*  In prison, everybody wanted to see their work. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7641.620000000001s)]
*  They call it admiring your work. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7647.580000000001s)]
*  You up, chin up, and you, you looking all good. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7649.46s)]
*  Even hitting the bag. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7652.9800000000005s)]
*  The way you hit the bag is the way [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7654.22s)]
*  you're gonna hit your opponent. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7655.5s)]
*  Your stance has a lot to do. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7657.34s)]
*  Whatever you do outside the ring, [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7658.86s)]
*  you gonna do in the ring. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7660.139999999999s)]
*  Did you keep something on your chin, like a tennis ball? [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7661.5s)]
*  Tennis ball. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7664.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7665.139999999999s)]
*  Not only do you keep it on your chin [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7669.099999999999s)]
*  when you're hitting the bag, the bag don't have arms. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7670.74s)]
*  You gotta visualize that bag got arms. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7673.9s)]
*  But try doing it when you got a guy [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7676.78s)]
*  that can fight at least 60, 70% to give you some good work. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7679.259999999999s)]
*  And you gotta have that. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7684.7s)]
*  And every time you drop it, you gotta do an extra round. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7685.74s)]
*  I got some rounds in. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7689.7s)]
*  Brother Nazeem, brother Nazeem. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7691.86s)]
*  Brother, you seen the yellow shirt with the Kofi, brother? [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7696.179999999999s)]
*  Correct. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7698.62s)]
*  Yeah, give me one more, soldier, give me one more round. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7701.0199999999995s)]
*  All right, because you know, [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7705.66s)]
*  I ain't gonna say I ain't got it. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7706.5s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7707.7s)]
*  Put the ball under my, and we rumbling. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7709.94s)]
*  Now, it don't mean the guy knocked the ball out. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7713.0199999999995s)]
*  It's possible, but you let it go. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7718.099999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7721.78s)]
*  And I'm punching and ducking and getting hit, [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7722.82s)]
*  but that ball better be there when the bell ring. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7727.139999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's so hard. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7731.139999999999s)]
*  How many guys train like that? [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7734.5s)]
*  I haven't, I passed it on. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7736.5s)]
*  I passed it on, I mentioned it. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7739.7s)]
*  I passed it on a tennis ball. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7741.9s)]
*  We call it the tennis ball. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7743.94s)]
*  Ryan Garcia could use that advice. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7746.1s)]
*  A lot of the times he'll stand straight up. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7749.3s)]
*  It's too late. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7751.62s)]
*  Yeah, too late? [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7752.46s)]
*  Yeah, I know he says, this young guy's too late. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7753.94s)]
*  Why it's too late, I believe, [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7758.38s)]
*  because of the arrogance of saying what you need to do, [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7762.82s)]
*  knowing what you need to do, [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7772.18s)]
*  knowing what you need to do and doing what you need to do [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7773.7s)]
*  and be consistent about it is a whole nother conversation. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7777.22s)]
*  So either they do that or they don't. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7784.5s)]
*  And if they don't, [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7786.38s)]
*  they're never gonna make it all the way. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7787.38s)]
*  Anybody they fight, they recognize it in discipline, [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7789.98s)]
*  the wait to that time come and be real about it, [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7793.94s)]
*  will be victorious. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7799.22s)]
*  This doesn't say that championship of the world [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7800.82s)]
*  will escape him or he will never achieve that. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7809.66s)]
*  Absolutely, he will in this era, especially. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7813.299999999999s)]
*  No disrespect. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7820.179999999999s)]
*  But in the same token, bad habits or a bad habit [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7822.62s)]
*  one day will kill you. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7831.299999999999s)]
*  I didn't need or kill your career. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7836.66s)]
*  I didn't need to be burnt four or five times [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7842.0199999999995s)]
*  once I got of knowledge that I didn't like that. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7848.38s)]
*  I went through all the juvenile system in Pennsylvania, [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7854.94s)]
*  then state in 17. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7859.54s)]
*  And I say that because once I got a taste [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7863.5s)]
*  and understood my value and understood what I need to do [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7866.58s)]
*  to be successful, now I'm here. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7870.78s)]
*  I mean, the same dream talking, [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7874.5s)]
*  this getting up, put network in, [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7877.7s)]
*  understand that everybody ain't gonna be for you [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7883.54s)]
*  and everybody ain't against you. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7886.7s)]
*  But how you get the better of both, [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7890.46s)]
*  you let the adversaries of the other side, [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7894.06s)]
*  you let the opinions negative or not. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7896.54s)]
*  You have a contest amongst those who say, [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7902.7s)]
*  why you wanna do that? [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7905.54s)]
*  It's impossible, no, that can't happen. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7906.7s)]
*  You're going to a two way class, [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7909.14s)]
*  man, you're too old, you're still fighting. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7910.62s)]
*  What about them guys? [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7914.54s)]
*  What about congratulations that I wanna? [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7915.86s)]
*  So I look at all these things in reflection sometime [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7919.66s)]
*  and I say to myself, I'm so glad [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7922.7s)]
*  I didn't take people advice. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7924.82s)]
*  Well, it's just so amazing that you didn't listen [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7927.5s)]
*  to anybody and it almost like it's steeled your resolve [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7929.86s)]
*  because when they were telling you, [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7933.58s)]
*  you were too old for the Kelly Pavlik fight [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7934.74s)]
*  and you knocked him out and then you continue to fight [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7936.78s)]
*  at a world class level after that, [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7940.3s)]
*  it's like he's not even done yet [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7942.86s)]
*  because everyone else, I mean, if we go back [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7944.86s)]
*  to some great fighters that when they, [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7947.54s)]
*  I was always a big boxing fan, like way back in the 80s. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7950.74s)]
*  When those guys hit 34, 35, 36, 37, [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7955.94s)]
*  decline is coming. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7961.54s)]
*  It's basically over and some of them even before that, [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7962.38s)]
*  some of them, you just expected to see the decline [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7965.54s)]
*  and the decline with you never came. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7970.339999999999s)]
*  Never. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7972.38s)]
*  Never came. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7973.219999999999s)]
*  Never came. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7974.34s)]
*  And even in your last fight, like when you fought Joe Smith, [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7975.54s)]
*  when you went through the ropes. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7978.46s)]
*  Who's fighting this Saturday? [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7979.3s)]
*  Yeah, he's fighting this Saturday. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7980.34s)]
*  Fighting Zoto, that's what I'm going out to promote. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7981.18s)]
*  That, going through the ropes like that, [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7982.9400000000005s)]
*  scared the shit out of me because like, [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7984.860000000001s)]
*  what was below those ropes? [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7986.5s)]
*  Was that just cement? [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7987.9400000000005s)]
*  Did you just fall right on the cement? [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7989.5s)]
*  Yes. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7991.02s)]
*  What the fuck was going on there [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7992.06s)]
*  that they didn't protect the fighters more? [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7994.06s)]
*  One of the things of safety that has been elevated [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=7996.580000000001s)]
*  to a level than 20 years ago. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8001.1s)]
*  But to me, there's more need to be done. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8004.14s)]
*  I'm not the only fighter either got knocked out of the ring [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8008.740000000001s)]
*  or fell out of the ring. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8011.38s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8012.34s)]
*  But it should be patterned across that ring. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8013.780000000001s)]
*  100%. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8017.02s)]
*  Even wrestlers that wrestle in college [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8018.660000000001s)]
*  and sports professional wrestling, [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8021.9400000000005s)]
*  they have a pattern that... [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8025.700000000001s)]
*  In case someone goes through the ropes. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8029.98s)]
*  That can take some of the shock of the damage. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8031.419999999999s)]
*  Did you lay in on your head? [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8033.259999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8034.179999999999s)]
*  God damn. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8035.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8036.46s)]
*  It looked terrifying. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8037.299999999999s)]
*  And you always flirt with falling out that ring, [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8038.379999999999s)]
*  you a couple of feet up in the ring. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8043.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8045.0599999999995s)]
*  You paralyze yourself, you can chip something, [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8046.66s)]
*  you can die, anything can happen. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8048.78s)]
*  I was very fortunate, stayed in the hospital [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8052.139999999999s)]
*  to the next morning, did x-rays. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8054.62s)]
*  Obviously, when I left LA, [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8056.82s)]
*  the fight was at the forum. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8062.259999999999s)]
*  I got checked out by my personal doctor [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8063.94s)]
*  and was very, very fortunate to be in great shape after that. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8068.46s)]
*  Very fortunate. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8076.139999999999s)]
*  But again, I'm not expecting everything [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8077.099999999999s)]
*  to be in a checkbox of A plus, A plus, A plus. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8082.820000000001s)]
*  But little big important things. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8088.54s)]
*  Little thing is, A, I know y'all see this, a floor. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8092.58s)]
*  Seamen floor. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8096.38s)]
*  You hit that, your head gonna crack like a coconut. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8097.3s)]
*  Right. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8099.46s)]
*  Again, to me, [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8102.5s)]
*  majority of the people that surround boxing [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8107.5s)]
*  is not around for boxers itself. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8110.78s)]
*  They're around for money. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8115.0199999999995s)]
*  Correct. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8116.34s)]
*  And clout. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8117.179999999999s)]
*  And clout. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8118.82s)]
*  When you fell through those ropes, man, [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8120.219999999999s)]
*  it scared the shit out of me. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8121.62s)]
*  Because I was watching the way you fell, [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8122.78s)]
*  and I'm like, damn, did he just land on his head [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8124.9s)]
*  on the concrete? [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8126.58s)]
*  Backwards too. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8129.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, backwards, right through the ropes. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8130.219999999999s)]
*  And the ropes seemed loose. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8132.0199999999995s)]
*  They weren't tight, they was loose enough to, [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8133.66s)]
*  actually, you could see the stretch of the rope [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8136.82s)]
*  when I tried to grab it. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8139.9s)]
*  I tried to see, I tried to grab it with the right hand. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8140.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8142.9s)]
*  The fact that you fell that way, [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8143.74s)]
*  I mean, that is fucking crazy. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8145.299999999999s)]
*  I mean, that is a crazy way to fall through the ropes. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8148.259999999999s)]
*  See, that's the shot I took, and I'm back up, [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8151.38s)]
*  I backed up, and I'm getting pushed back, and boom. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8153.5s)]
*  And look at the guy, he just rolled out of the way. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8158.099999999999s)]
*  He got out of the way, and let you fall right on your head. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8160.98s)]
*  And that was the big thing too. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8164.219999999999s)]
*  That's like a four foot drop. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8165.94s)]
*  That's a big drop. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8167.66s)]
*  I'd say five to four, yeah. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8168.5s)]
*  But if you look at where how the guy just stepped away, [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8169.7s)]
*  didn't even put his hand up, watch this. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8174.379999999999s)]
*  That guy could have caught you. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8175.86s)]
*  Of course, look, he ran. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8176.86s)]
*  Did you ever see that guy again? [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8179.099999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8180.339999999999s)]
*  What the fuck, dude, wherever you are. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8181.179999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying he's not around. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8182.78s)]
*  Wherever he is, what the fuck. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8184.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't even know what he looked like. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8185.379999999999s)]
*  How do you not catch Bernard Hopkins? [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8186.66s)]
*  But now, since you showed that, [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8187.7s)]
*  he's not gonna even come to the fights anymore, probably. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8189.42s)]
*  He shouldn't come to the fights. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8191.5s)]
*  He got out of the way. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8194.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8196.14s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8197.46s)]
*  He could have saved you. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8198.3s)]
*  Yes, from falling. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8199.38s)]
*  Yeah, could have saved the back of your head. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8200.5s)]
*  And possibly the fight would have went on, [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8203.02s)]
*  because I would have got back in the ring. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8204.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8206.94s)]
*  Did you know going into that fight [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8208.42s)]
*  that was gonna be your last fight? [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8210.74s)]
*  No. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8211.9s)]
*  You were 51? [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8213.94s)]
*  51. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8216.42s)]
*  51. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8217.24s)]
*  I mentioned that it was gonna be my last fight, [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8219.42s)]
*  but I didn't know, [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8223.5s)]
*  because if I would have got past Joe Smith, [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8225.22s)]
*  I couldn't tell you right away [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8232.58s)]
*  that an opportunity of history [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8234.66s)]
*  would have made me think about the next and then got out. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8237.1s)]
*  But it was promoted. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8240.66s)]
*  As your last fight. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8243.22s)]
*  Correct. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8244.06s)]
*  And my family, people that were around me, [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8244.9s)]
*  we was all locked in on the last historic fight of my career [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8250.699999999999s)]
*  with Joe Smith, who I never, even to that moment, [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8258.74s)]
*  unestimate him. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8263.82s)]
*  I knew he was young, strong, big. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8265.46s)]
*  A big light heavyweight. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8269.46s)]
*  Right? [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8271.94s)]
*  I'm not a big, you look at me right now, [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8272.779999999999s)]
*  I'm not a big light heavyweight. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8273.619999999999s)]
*  But I started out as a heavyweight. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8275.859999999999s)]
*  I started out as a light heavyweight in my career. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8280.54s)]
*  If you look at my record in the weight, [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8281.380000000001s)]
*  I melt down to 60, [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8283.060000000001s)]
*  because that's where my training said, [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8285.94s)]
*  you a middleweight. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8287.060000000001s)]
*  You got a little fat there. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8288.78s)]
*  You been in prison, that's water weight. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8290.460000000001s)]
*  You gonna eat better, you gonna run better, [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8292.380000000001s)]
*  atmosphere is better. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8294.58s)]
*  I start slimming down. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8296.02s)]
*  Oh, you right. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8297.060000000001s)]
*  Middleweight it is. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8298.78s)]
*  So I melt down. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8300.78s)]
*  I did the opposite of the rules. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8301.62s)]
*  I melt down to 60. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8306.060000000001s)]
*  Normally you come up two weight classes [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8307.900000000001s)]
*  to being in the weight division, [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8310.900000000001s)]
*  because you grow into that weight [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8312.300000000001s)]
*  or you eat your way into that weight. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8313.74s)]
*  That moment to outside of the rainbow family [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8319.300000000001s)]
*  was a moment to say that, but we know. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8328.460000000001s)]
*  As fighters, we know when it's time. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8334.019999999999s)]
*  Did you feel? [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8339.22s)]
*  I ran out of things to do, far as history making. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8340.22s)]
*  Because even though I wanted to do something, [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8344.099999999999s)]
*  I'll beat that, winning, [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8347.339999999998s)]
*  like I've been successful most of the time, [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8351.419999999998s)]
*  that day to be great is real. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8356.699999999999s)]
*  And what's different, what was I thinking [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8359.26s)]
*  or what was different that night until it happened? [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8366.26s)]
*  Until it happened, and that's the difference. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8371.62s)]
*  Because you don't count yourself out until you're out. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8375.66s)]
*  And then I looked at it as time went on. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8381.1s)]
*  You and I have been having a conversation [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8388.82s)]
*  for a few hours now. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8391.380000000001s)]
*  Like I played in the NGU for a 58 year old, right? [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8395.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8398.380000000001s)]
*  With three decades under my belt of boxing, right? [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8399.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8401.54s)]
*  It doesn't seem like I'm slowing down anytime soon, right? [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8402.380000000001s)]
*  No. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8404.82s)]
*  I really sat home, [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8406.5s)]
*  weeks after the fight was over with, [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8410.82s)]
*  and steady taking, because you know, [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8413.9s)]
*  the opportunity of the opportunists, [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8416.26s)]
*  seeing an opportunity to try to make that fight my life [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8418.78s)]
*  at the end. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8424.9s)]
*  I said to them, some industry or the atmosphere out there [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8427.94s)]
*  that had one of the fruit tans to throw dirt [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8435.78s)]
*  on my grave of legacy. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8442.66s)]
*  I said, y'all forgot something. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8444.82s)]
*  Or y'all wanna forget, but I'm not gonna let you forget. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8450.099999999999s)]
*  If you look at my life up to now in boxing [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8457.3s)]
*  and starting off before I became a champion in boxing, [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8462.46s)]
*  I said I lost my first fight as a pro. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8469.539999999999s)]
*  I lost my last fight as a pro. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8474.939999999999s)]
*  Everything in the middle is a story, [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8480.619999999999s)]
*  motivational, never give up story. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8484.46s)]
*  But you should be worried about what I do next, [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8488.98s)]
*  because the way I started shows ain't the way I'm an in. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8492.22s)]
*  So in this third or fourth chapter of my life, [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8499.779999999999s)]
*  at a young 58, fast approaching 59, [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8503.66s)]
*  the way I started shows that my character doesn't say [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8509.38s)]
*  I'll submit to the way it's gonna play out or end. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8512.86s)]
*  So now the fight is different. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8518.1s)]
*  The fight ain't in the ring physically. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8521.46s)]
*  The fight is around a powerful, [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8525.06s)]
*  controlling, and that's boxing attitude [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8527.9s)]
*  when things blunt in your face. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8532.98s)]
*  That the fight I got now is the fight of Satchel Page [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8537.539999999999s)]
*  in his era in baseball. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8540.82s)]
*  The fight I have now is the fight that Jim Brown, [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8543.9s)]
*  Muhammad Ali, Bill Russell, and a lot of other greats [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8546.3s)]
*  at that time stood up when they needed to stand up [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8549.3s)]
*  at that moment for their cause. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8551.82s)]
*  I'll put them on notice before I'm putting them [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8553.78s)]
*  on notice again just because it's fresh [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8555.58s)]
*  that they gonna hear it again. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8559.900000000001s)]
*  That this fight is different than the fight [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8563.140000000001s)]
*  that got me here. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8566.94s)]
*  This fight is about here, discipline of patience, [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8569.18s)]
*  knowing how to use the fight to the best of my ability. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8574.900000000001s)]
*  Knowing how to use and strategize your chessboard [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8580.619999999999s)]
*  and the pieces that's on that board. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8587.9s)]
*  If they willing to do what's been done [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8591.66s)]
*  for so many centuries, all the way up to now, [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8594.94s)]
*  then the only thing I needed more for this fight [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8601.06s)]
*  is my health and my memory. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8605.02s)]
*  They better hope I keep it. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8608.04s)]
*  And that's the warning. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8612.32s)]
*  The warning is that I am the Satchel Page of this era. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8616.32s)]
*  I'm gunning for that legacy. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8621.800000000001s)]
*  I'm the Muhammad Ali when he spoke of his era [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8624.12s)]
*  for things that he spoke very calm, [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8627.04s)]
*  never called me a nigga. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8629.12s)]
*  He said that in the 60s in this country. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8630.76s)]
*  That was one of the reasons why he was so important [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8635.4s)]
*  culturally. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8638.96s)]
*  And that's why my idol, other than Marvin Hagler, [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8639.92s)]
*  when I say idol, I'm talking about idol [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8643.8s)]
*  and not idoling him as my god, idoling him as an example. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8646.0s)]
*  That there are some in any aspects of life [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8650.64s)]
*  that will risk it all. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8654.64s)]
*  And those who listen and hear this [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8658.0s)]
*  and have already said it, I've done. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8660.119999999999s)]
*  Listen, if it was 50 to 100 million dollars [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8662.88s)]
*  made in my career, they'll play the game [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8667.16s)]
*  and eventually they'll trick me out of it later. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8671.0s)]
*  That was left on the table because of this. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8675.24s)]
*  Not because of the emotions, because of this [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8679.199999999999s)]
*  and then because of this and then because of that. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8682.08s)]
*  Because once I understood I wanted to keep my mouth closed, [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8685.519999999999s)]
*  I said, oh, this is how it is. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8687.8s)]
*  But I needed power before I speak. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8689.72s)]
*  I needed to be world champion. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8692.2s)]
*  And my first world championship fight [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8696.039999999999s)]
*  that we didn't talk about was Roy Jones Jr. in 1993. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8698.08s)]
*  RFK Stadium, I told you about the memory. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8701.52s)]
*  Under the Riddick Bowe, the heavyweight champion [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8704.6s)]
*  fighting Jesse Ferguson, he was the main event. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8706.92s)]
*  I was the co-main. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8709.8s)]
*  Roy was the house fighter of HBO. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8711.52s)]
*  Multi-million dollar contract. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8714.36s)]
*  I was known as the guy from Philadelphia tough, [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8718.039999999999s)]
*  come give some work from the penitentiary. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8721.12s)]
*  You gotta have a villain, you gotta have the nice guy. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8726.720000000001s)]
*  And Roy gave me a lesson. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8733.36s)]
*  A lesson of what? [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8737.44s)]
*  I wasn't ready. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8739.480000000001s)]
*  Boy, when I got that opportunity a year and a half later, [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8741.720000000001s)]
*  the IBF, same title, vacant by Roy Jones Jr. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8747.72s)]
*  Roy went up to 168, the next weight up. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8756.199999999999s)]
*  I'm in line as the number one, number two contender. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8760.32s)]
*  I fight in Segundo Mercado in Quito, Ecuador. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8764.439999999999s)]
*  He can push that fight up here. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8768.539999999999s)]
*  See the first fight with Segundo Mercado, [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8769.96s)]
*  which means second in Spanish. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8772.679999999998s)]
*  I called him second at the press conference. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8774.76s)]
*  You will never beat me, I'm first, you're second, Segundo. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8777.04s)]
*  Your mother knew you was gonna be second all your life. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8779.960000000001s)]
*  So we go to Quito, hostile environment. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8785.4s)]
*  Quito at that time was at war, conflict with Peru. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8790.84s)]
*  But I was sold out by a promoter [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8797.880000000001s)]
*  to get more money to bring me there [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8801.68s)]
*  to fight an Ecuadorian in Ecuador. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8806.6s)]
*  Joy, I get knocked down two times, [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8811.14s)]
*  got up, fought my way back up, finished the fight. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8813.28s)]
*  Here I'm in Ecuador being sold out by a promoter. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8821.28s)]
*  I get to Ecuador 11 plus thousand feet above sea level, [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8826.2s)]
*  probably higher than Denver, Colorado. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8832.76s)]
*  Couldn't breathe the first second round [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8838.68s)]
*  after I exhausted myself to the max early on [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8840.32s)]
*  and fought my way with Segundo Mercado [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8845.12s)]
*  for the first fight we had. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8849.58s)]
*  And get a draw in Ecuador, fighting an Ecuadorian, [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8852.1s)]
*  I take it. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8856.02s)]
*  I won the fight, they would have killed me. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8857.7s)]
*  That's what the rumor was. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8860.460000000001s)]
*  If you would have got that decision in Ecuador, [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8862.5s)]
*  even though I fought my way back from seven to 12th, [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8869.94s)]
*  almost had him out, if you look at the video, [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8873.94s)]
*  in a very hostile environment, [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8877.54s)]
*  if they would have gave me that fight, [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8881.78s)]
*  we wouldn't have left Ecuador. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8884.74s)]
*  So they call it a draw. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8888.18s)]
*  The IBF mandated that the fight must happen in 120 days. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8891.78s)]
*  They had to get the work right away, [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8902.42s)]
*  but the energy was different than going to Ecuador. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8905.42s)]
*  Don King wasn't sure of Segundo beating me in America [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8909.66s)]
*  if he couldn't beat me in his hometown in Ecuador. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8922.22s)]
*  So the promotion was kind of froggy. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8926.98s)]
*  But we went through the process [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8930.76s)]
*  and I became champion in Ecuador, [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8932.62s)]
*  I mean, in America, in 95, [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8937.060000000001s)]
*  knocking out Segundo Mocardo and land over Maryland, [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8945.7s)]
*  and then defending that title for 12 years. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8952.54s)]
*  That was the first IBF title I had. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8956.5s)]
*  Yeah, the IBF title based in New Jersey, [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8960.18s)]
*  East Orange, New Jersey. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8963.98s)]
*  That IBF title was the title I had [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8967.939999999999s)]
*  all the way up to the 20th in defense. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8972.779999999999s)]
*  That was the first title. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8974.26s)]
*  And the politics and the confusion of boxing, [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8976.06s)]
*  there are so many belts, [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8980.3s)]
*  which makes it limited to be under-spruited until, [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8983.16s)]
*  under-spruited today is being talked about [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8989.779999999999s)]
*  more than ever now. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8992.26s)]
*  Did you watch the fight the other day? [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8994.34s)]
*  Which one? [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8996.3s)]
*  Canelo and... [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8997.14s)]
*  Yes. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8997.98s)]
*  Did you see they picked the screen up, Bernard Hopkins, [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=8999.539999999999s)]
*  as the last or the reboot of the under-spruited? [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9002.9s)]
*  And then they had all the other names. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9009.22s)]
*  In the full belt era, [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9012.42s)]
*  in the full belt, full belt era, [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9014.859999999999s)]
*  my name is up there first. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9019.14s)]
*  Now Showtime, even though I've been on Showtime [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9020.619999999999s)]
*  more than I've been on HBO, [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9023.06s)]
*  but the politics ain't there for me [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9024.98s)]
*  because of the players they work with. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9026.5s)]
*  I get it. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9027.939999999999s)]
*  But it was hard for them to try to cut that out. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9029.539999999999s)]
*  They couldn't. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9032.519999999999s)]
*  I sat home and I laughed. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9033.359999999999s)]
*  I had laughed, man, I thought I had muscles. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9035.1s)]
*  I laughed, I said, because I know for a fact [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9036.939999999999s)]
*  that if they can take that name and share less light [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9043.939999999999s)]
*  on Bernard Hopkins, [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9048.22s)]
*  then it was great. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9050.199999999999s)]
*  And even though you didn't ask this, [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9054.439999999999s)]
*  my case in point is this, all stuff I told you earlier. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9056.4s)]
*  What I just said now, the Ryan Cross, he and Tate fight, [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9061.56s)]
*  we was the second promoters. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9066.0s)]
*  They picked up the bigger money, big fight. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9067.76s)]
*  It was a PBC, right? [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9071.96s)]
*  Card. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9076.18s)]
*  Al Hayman card. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9078.02s)]
*  I ain't afraid to say his name. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9080.02s)]
*  They tried to oust me. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9084.78s)]
*  You follow my, they tried, I put everything, [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9087.1s)]
*  I waited for about two weeks. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9089.460000000001s)]
*  Strategy, Art of War, Sun Tzu. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9091.58s)]
*  I waited. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9096.300000000001s)]
*  You didn't ask, but you let me talk. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9099.86s)]
*  They slayed us when they come to the dressing room. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9103.44s)]
*  You heard about that? [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9105.720000000001s)]
*  Oscar and them didn't come to Ryan's dressing room. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9107.939999999999s)]
*  We abandoned them. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9109.18s)]
*  I don't know if you heard, we supposedly abandoned them. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9110.26s)]
*  We looked like dish bags, right? [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9113.02s)]
*  We looked like scumbags. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9114.38s)]
*  He loses now, the promoters, you know, [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9117.66s)]
*  and if you got any other agenda, [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9120.1s)]
*  any other agenda from whatever you got it from [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9121.82s)]
*  or why you have it, this is your time now [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9124.02s)]
*  to show yourself. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9127.66s)]
*  So I waited, waited, waited. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9129.9s)]
*  And credit to Joy, my assistant slash fiance, she said, [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9131.62s)]
*  I got all the video, you didn't know I was videoing [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9143.1s)]

*  Strategy over emotions. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9194.98s)]
*  Let's put all this together, take a deep breath. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9196.62s)]

*  But I said, listen, we're being hammered. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9228.26s)]
*  And she said, I know, I know. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9233.660000000002s)]

*  So he said everything he needed to say. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9245.539999999999s)]
*  Now we gotta come with, what do you mean not in this corner? [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9252.02s)]
*  What do you mean we was missing? [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9255.06s)]
*  What do you mean we didn't show up at the press conference? [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9256.1s)]
*  They wouldn't let me in the fucking ring. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9258.5s)]
*  If you go to my Instagram, you'll see they, [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9260.58s)]
*  no, you can't, they block me from getting in the ring. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9263.699999999999s)]
*  What they expected, what they expected from me, [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9266.98s)]
*  watch this move. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9271.14s)]
*  Thank you, producer, great guy over there. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9272.82s)]
*  Watch this move, Bernard can't come in the ring. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9275.14s)]
*  Bernard can't come in the ring. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9278.82s)]
*  Tom Brown, that's Al Heyman's flunky right there. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9279.66s)]
*  He's a promoter license and Al Heyman hides behind him. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9282.5s)]
*  So his name is Tom Brown. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9286.019999999999s)]
*  Al Heyman hides beyond him because by the Muhammad Ali [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9288.34s)]
*  act that I stood up for, it doesn't cover advisors. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9291.179999999998s)]
*  It doesn't cover consultants. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9296.82s)]
*  So now those lawyers, [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9299.7s)]
*  cause he has a Harvard law degree, Al Heyman. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9301.42s)]
*  He hires promoters, especially Tom Brown, [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9308.380000000001s)]
*  who come from the Goossens in Denver, Colorado. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9311.78s)]
*  Known very well. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9314.740000000002s)]
*  He sat next to me. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9316.7s)]
*  He said, here, Joy and me. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9320.060000000001s)]
*  I switched seats with Joy because I told her, [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9322.820000000002s)]
*  Tom Brown is the eyes and ears while we sit in there. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9326.1s)]
*  They had controls of the tickets. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9330.34s)]
*  They had control of the show [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9332.5s)]
*  because they're the leading promoters, PBC. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9333.78s)]
*  So I was quiet ringside. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9341.86s)]
*  All the fighters from their side was behind me. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9346.18s)]
*  So I was in their row. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9349.300000000001s)]
*  That's the seats, the section they put me at. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9350.74s)]
*  Even Oscar was to my right. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9352.78s)]
*  They had me right near the corner, churn buckle. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9356.94s)]
*  Because if you look at any Golden Boy fights, [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9362.5s)]
*  I'm always in the middle because we have control [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9365.26s)]
*  and the fighters always look out. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9367.74s)]
*  They got trainings, don't look at me, but they do look. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9369.9s)]
*  Sometimes the fight mode come in and I can't help myself. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9373.02s)]
*  I'm learning to be more subdued [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9377.460000000001s)]
*  while I'm sitting watching as they promote her. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9380.54s)]
*  So they had my seat where the churn buckle, the corner. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9383.980000000001s)]
*  So you couldn't see. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9395.900000000001s)]
*  So, yes. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9397.42s)]
*  So I watched from my seat, [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9399.26s)]
*  leaned to the right, which I had a slightly better view. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9405.7s)]
*  Slightly better view. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9409.94s)]
*  But those moments of the art of war, [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9413.86s)]
*  this ain't complaining. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9418.1s)]
*  They was prepared, but I was prepared too. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9423.94s)]
*  They knew I was coming. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9428.86s)]
*  They knew the energy I was bringing. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9429.900000000001s)]
*  See, I wasn't coming. [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9434.02s)]
*  Listen, Oscar personality is not my personality. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9436.1s)]
*  That's the best way I can explain it to you. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9443.5s)]
*  If I see something, I'm gonna speak on what I see. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9450.46s)]
*  I'm not gonna run and tell somebody [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9453.22s)]
*  what I can do and say myself. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9457.5s)]
*  To me, that's a man. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9459.74s)]
*  They was prepared because we did business. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9462.06s)]
*  Before Al Heyman branched off to do his company, [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9465.42s)]
*  he took 80, 90% of Golden Boy fighters [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9475.82s)]
*  because those fighters, including Floor Mayweather, [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9478.82s)]
*  was under what? [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9480.939999999999s)]
*  Golden Boy. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9481.779999999999s)]
*  So he took, per se, if you're in the music business, [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9484.22s)]
*  he took his catalog. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9486.939999999999s)]
*  He took his catalog and started PBC. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9488.5s)]
*  I didn't go. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9499.94s)]
*  It's some bad blood. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9501.66s)]
*  Because everybody know the situation, even to today. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9504.14s)]
*  Oscar definitely understands and know it. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9509.78s)]
*  I was a nail in the coffin. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9514.78s)]
*  If they would have got me to leave based on a contract [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9518.74s)]
*  that they gave me to leave, what was in it for me? [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9521.5s)]
*  And I seen that it was crowded over there at PBC. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9528.78s)]
*  And I still, even to today, understand [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9538.26s)]
*  the process is always a risk, but I'd rather be on this side [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9542.42s)]
*  even with the baggage. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9547.86s)]
*  They wanted to predict our demise. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9553.9s)]
*  We gonna be in federal court in six months. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9559.98s)]
*  Oscar remind me all the time, [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9563.14s)]
*  you remember they said this, partner, [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9564.9s)]
*  they're not gonna last six months, he gonna see. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9568.22s)]
*  They came back door, they thought, [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9572.74s)]
*  trying to poison the waters. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9577.62s)]
*  So there's just a bunch of dirty business [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9579.3s)]
*  that goes on through the seas. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9580.94s)]
*  Filthy, dirty, that's a good word. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9582.34s)]
*  Filthy. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9584.06s)]
*  So 20 plus years later, [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9585.460000000001s)]
*  a lot of things in changing inbox, [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9592.38s)]
*  and they ain't breaking news, but a lot of people don't know. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9594.22s)]
*  A lot of bait networks, one already left. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9598.1s)]
*  HBO's gone. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9600.74s)]
*  This is what I was leading to. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9602.86s)]
*  As a whole churn, as you aware of the churn, [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9607.62s)]
*  you haven't been in Austin a year yet, have you? [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9614.66s)]
*  Three years. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9616.66s)]
*  Three, I'm probably there, three years, right? [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9617.5s)]
*  Three years, right? [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9619.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9620.42s)]
*  But it was a reason to change from there to here. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9623.06s)]
*  I assume. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9627.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9628.62s)]
*  Boxing is changing and have changed even more. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9630.54s)]
*  So one left for 40 plus years, HBO, correct? [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9636.18s)]
*  And you being a boxing fan, I know that kinda hurt it. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9641.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9644.060000000001s)]
*  My prediction is [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9646.94s)]
*  that Showtime is finally ready to pack it in. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9651.900000000001s)]
*  That's not good. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9656.740000000002s)]
*  But it's not a death sentence [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9658.7s)]
*  for those who pull their bootstraps up. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9659.880000000001s)]
*  And if you don't have no boots, find some, [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9663.22s)]
*  because this is a man thinking game, not checkered. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9666.099999999999s)]
*  Do you think the future is in streaming? [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9670.38s)]
*  Showtime will pack up boxing only. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9672.099999999999s)]
*  I'll be surprised if they got another year left. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9678.58s)]
*  That's unfortunate, because that leaves Dazon, [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9682.66s)]
*  that leaves ESPN Plus, it's not as many options. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9685.38s)]
*  Now that's where the creativity has to get in play now. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9689.86s)]
*  You say you are who you are, this goes for everybody. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9696.5s)]
*  It's all, we all got blood on our hands or something, [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9701.300000000001s)]
*  hold up. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9704.54s)]
*  This is where the creativity now kicks in. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9707.94s)]
*  You say who you are, you on the block now. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9711.900000000001s)]
*  You say who you, okay. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9715.7s)]
*  First of all, you're doing too much talking, [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9718.14s)]
*  so you ain't real. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9719.3s)]
*  You gotta get tried right away. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9720.9s)]
*  This is the trying time now. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9722.46s)]
*  Let's see who now can sink or swim. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9724.22s)]
*  Golden Boy also, all of us. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9727.779999999999s)]
*  So now this separates the men from the fakes. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9730.46s)]
*  Now if you've been frauding, [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9733.8s)]
*  if you've been frauding, hiding behind, [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9736.1s)]
*  and you had a time limit when you go on exit [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9738.5s)]
*  and you prepare yourself, [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9740.42s)]
*  then that's one thing that should work good for that person [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9742.82s)]
*  that thinks that way. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9746.1s)]
*  There are fighters on the other side that got [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9748.58s)]
*  to pay every time they fight in any other entity. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9752.38s)]
*  Joe Rogan has a promotion boxing. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9757.94s)]
*  You got 10 fighters on your side. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9759.619999999999s)]
*  Just say I'm Golden Boy, I got fighters on my side. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9763.5s)]
*  You ain't seen, because you hire somebody [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9768.5s)]
*  to do your business for you so you can hide behind the scenes, [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9770.58s)]
*  but you have knowledge of law [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9773.98s)]
*  so you know how to manipulate certain things. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9776.9s)]
*  So if you risk having a contract Monday, [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9780.44s)]
*  but knowing things can change as time go on, [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9785.94s)]
*  you wanna tie your Campbell, what do you mean? [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9788.9s)]
*  Well, if the well runs dry, [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9792.279999999999s)]
*  if that fighter goes and fight at another house, [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9796.58s)]
*  another promotion that you ain't no longer controlling, [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9800.1s)]
*  the fighters now start to look at the contract [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9805.24s)]
*  and say I gotta give up 35%, [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9808.44s)]
*  I gotta give up 40% of my purse, [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9810.16s)]
*  even though Barbara Am is doing a fight, [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9813.279999999999s)]
*  Golden Boy is doing a fight. [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9816.359999999999s)]
*  That's what promoters do. [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9819.14s)]
*  Now you're realizing that the wrong time. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9821.46s)]
*  Nine out of 10 at the telling in your career, [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9824.06s)]
*  whether you're in your 30s, you mentioned it, [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9826.92s)]
*  the age, normally 30, 34, 35, [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9828.46s)]
*  you normally packing up ready to roll out, [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9830.94s)]
*  trying to get a couple of pities here and there. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9832.76s)]
*  But there's a real bad taste in a lot of business people, [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9835.16s)]
*  TV and also fighters that realizing everything was great, [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9842.72s)]
*  you bought your car, you're out, [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9849.24s)]
*  don't you gotta upkeep? [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9850.44s)]
*  You gotta keep that lifestyle [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9853.08s)]
*  or you gotta understand how to live different. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9855.16s)]
*  And that's the shock that they're seeing now [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9859.08s)]
*  that they've been manipulated, bamboozled. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9861.52s)]
*  And the only thing, which is not only, [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9866.779999999999s)]
*  but the only thing that some would say [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9871.0s)]
*  to justify the Don Kings of this era, [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9877.68s)]
*  they got paid. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9886.119999999999s)]
*  They got paid, you give ignorance money, [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9887.08s)]
*  they gonna be more ignorant than they was [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9893.16s)]
*  when you gave them money and what after they gave them money. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9896.48s)]
*  They ain't gonna be smart because you gave them money. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9898.32s)]
*  Other than the business of boxing though, [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9900.88s)]
*  how do you feel about the sport? [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9903.6s)]
*  How do you feel about the sport today? [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9905.56s)]
*  Like the caliber fighters? [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9907.48s)]
*  I'm sure you must be a fan of Terrence Crawford. [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9909.36s)]
*  Yes. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9912.36s)]
*  One of my favorite guys to watch. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9913.2s)]
*  Yes. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9914.02s)]
*  Phenomenal. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9914.86s)]
*  Best switch hitter since Marvin had it. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9915.7s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9917.679999999998s)]
*  We tried to promote that fight and he had a choice [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9918.519999999999s)]
*  like we all do and he chose to do what he needs to do [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9920.64s)]
*  and he was successful with it. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9923.72s)]
*  Absolutely a technical, technical, serious, mentally strong [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9925.439999999999s)]
*  and definitely can be around as long as he want to. [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9934.099999999999s)]
*  Bad ass. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9941.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's a bad man. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9941.839999999998s)]
*  And there's a good crop of people like that today. [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9943.099999999999s)]
*  Tank is another one. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9946.939999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9947.779999999999s)]
*  Phenomenal fighter. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9948.599999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9949.439999999999s)]
*  Look, Kidd Austin is right on the hills, right? [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9950.259999999998s)]
*  Kidd Austin. Bruce Dennis. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9952.82s)]
*  Correct, Bruce. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9953.66s)]
*  And let me tell you, look, [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9954.82s)]
*  I can promote a lot of fighters. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9959.06s)]
*  You're expecting me to mention a whole bunch of names. [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9960.46s)]
*  Got this week's Zoto making a comeback [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9962.9s)]
*  after getting dominated, right? [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9965.619999999999s)]
*  Real bad overseas. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9967.699999999999s)]
*  But that was the first shot in the CIA bounce back now. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9971.439999999999s)]
*  This is the career going forward. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9974.46s)]
*  Morgia, we got, it's a lot of talent, [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9976.939999999999s)]
*  even on other side of the street, the next house, [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9980.3s)]
*  next promotional house. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9983.3s)]
*  There's so many fights, but you know what Joe, [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9984.699999999999s)]
*  doesn't mean squat if they don't get made. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9989.099999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9992.14s)]
*  You and fans around the world want to see the best, [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9992.98s)]
*  fighting the best. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9997.279999999999s)]
*  I did a segment for four episodes [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=9999.3s)]
*  of interviews, interviews rather, not episodes, [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10004.82s)]
*  on fight news, talking about fights that need to be made. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10010.38s)]
*  And the first one out of the gate, [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10015.339999999998s)]
*  pitting the pressure, running its mouth here, [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10017.16s)]
*  was Tank Davis and Ryan Garcia. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10021.0s)]
*  It's there. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10023.619999999999s)]
*  How did you think that fight was going to play out? [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10024.46s)]
*  I thought the fight was going to play out. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10027.46s)]
*  And I anticipated the fight playing out [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10029.46s)]
*  where Ryan will use all the attributes that he have [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10031.94s)]
*  to his best ability. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10035.460000000001s)]
*  What I mean by that is stay out. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10036.68s)]
*  Length. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10039.68s)]
*  Stay outside. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10040.74s)]

*  Right. [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10160.44s)]
*  He shows you something that is like an illusion. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10161.76s)]
*  Might not be the first time once he tried you [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10167.44s)]
*  and you go for it, but it's coming. [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10169.52s)]

*  one punch knockout power too. [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10178.44s)]
*  He's just such an interesting fighter [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10180.48s)]
*  because his style is so different from everybody else. [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10182.12s)]
*  He's so conservative in the early rounds. [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10184.24s)]
*  Throws so few punches and he lets you work. [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10186.56s)]

*  and you're always afraid of that power [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10191.48s)]
*  and he's just moving in, trying to find that opening [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10193.12s)]
*  where he just gets in there on you. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10196.2s)]
*  Your mind is burning energy. [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10197.68s)]

*  You physically burning energy [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10200.24s)]

*  you know based on what you've been hearing [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10207.96s)]
*  through the whole press conference [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10209.88s)]
*  and through the whole fights he had before then, yourself, [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10211.08s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10216.039999999999s)]
*  See, power rules everything around you. [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10216.88s)]
*  One thing about power, you can lose all the fights, [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10221.72s)]
*  all the rounds in that power. [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10224.08s)]
*  Come on. Yep. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10225.96s)]
*  Right, that would make the Foreman's, the Mike Tyson. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10226.96s)]
*  John DeWalder. [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10230.68s)]

*  I got one shot [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10235.4s)]
*  and it's over. [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10239.2s)]
*  I can be losing a whole 90, [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10240.880000000001s)]
*  I can be losing over to the 12th round [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10243.16s)]
*  and hit you with that power. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10246.64s)]
*  And to get to the 12th, 11th, 10th, ninth, eighth, [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10250.08s)]

*  But does it upset you that this guy jumps in front of Usyk, [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10447.68s)]
*  jumps in front of Joshua, jumps in front of anybody else [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10451.28s)]

*  You know how I feel? [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10465.6s)]
*  Because I love Francis and I'm happy that Francis [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10466.44s)]

*  If Usyk is not available, [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10495.24s)]
*  I think that Tyson Fury would beat him [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10497.72s)]
*  with about Wilder. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10502.039999999999s)]

*  And not a big heavyweight, right? [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10532.56s)]
*  In some cases, you'll think a blown up cruiserweight. [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10536.640000000001s)]
*  Right? [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10539.6s)]

*  They gonna make millions of dollars. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10543.8s)]
*  That fight there is more credibility [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10545.56s)]
*  and more, I guess, [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10548.84s)]

*  He can't secure that big fight. [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10573.88s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons why? [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10576.64s)]
*  Dangerous. [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10579.56s)]

*  They want the bag, of course, [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10601.88s)]

*  the fights that they have a better chance on winning. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10611.48s)]
*  And when you tell most of them of this generation [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10616.92s)]
*  about history, [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10622.0s)]

*  Stressed it out better than anybody. [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10668.380000000001s)]
*  And part of that time, you gotta look at the time [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10669.22s)]
*  I started late as a pro. [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10672.94s)]
*  Not as an amateur, but as a pro. [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I3hBXRrxdQ&t=10675.3s)]
