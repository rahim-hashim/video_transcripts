# Joe Rogan Experience #1568 - Tom Green
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 20, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wk6SL4ofG0)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  Hello eccentric character known as Tom Green.
*  Joe, how are you?
*  You're the wild man living in a van now.
*  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
*  You are that eccentric character.
*  You go from being a television and movie star to being a wild man
*  traveling the land with your vagabond dog that you got from another country.
*  She's a rescue from the Bahamas?
*  Yeah, Charlie, yeah, she's a rescue from the Bahamas.
*  She's goddamn adorable, by the way. I love her.
*  She's beautiful.
*  And you are this eccentric character now. Look at you.
*  I guess so. I feel like maybe, I feel like in some ways what I'm doing right now is the most normal thing I've done in my life, but it is actually kind of crazy too.
*  It's crazy compared to people, but I think it fits you like a glove. I really do.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you know, I like going out into the wilderness. I always have.
*  Yeah.
*  And I've been out in this van that I just got, which is amazing, and I'm going pretty hard with it.
*  Is this the first time you've been tested since you got tested the last time on my show?
*  I got tested one time between, but that's another interesting story.
*  Let's hear it. What happened?
*  Well, my ex-wife asked me to come on her talk show, and I hadn't talked to her in 15 years.
*  Oh, Drew?
*  Drew, yeah.
*  Oh.
*  Was that a trap? Did you get nervous?
*  It was nice. It was nice. We had a good time.
*  That's cool.
*  But I had to get tested to do the show. But it was interesting because, you know, it was a very sort of interesting thing because we hadn't talked in 15 years.
*  At all?
*  At all. And then all of a sudden, got a call from her saying, hey, welcome to the new show. And her new show is really pretty wacky. She's getting really kind of...
*  I like how you put your hands out for wacky.
*  Oh, yeah. She's definitely pushing it in a very sort of... I mean, I'm enjoying the show. It's very funny what she's doing. Very, very over the top, some of the things she does on there.
*  That's representative of her as well?
*  It reminds me a lot of her when... well, I mean, it is her, yeah, for sure.
*  What she really is, like who she really is.
*  I think so, yeah.
*  As you get older, you tend to be able to figure out who you really are better, like with you, like doing this van thing.
*  I'm the guy living down by the river in the van.
*  It makes sense to me. When you told me you were going to do that, I'm going to travel across the country and just drive around the van with my dog. I was like, I could see you enjoying that.
*  Yeah. You know, it's a whole world, man. It's a whole world that I didn't even know about. Like I didn't know... in Canada, it's called Crown Land. Here it's called BLM Land, Bureau of Land Management Land.
*  I'm sure you know all about that from hunting and going out into the wilderness.
*  I didn't really know about Bureau of Land Management Land, and there's certain apps that will show you all the fire roads, all the remote places that you can go and do dispersed camping, go boondocking.
*  Does your van have off-road capabilities? Can you drive on rugged trails?
*  Yeah, pretty good. It's not an off-road vehicle. It's a Ram Promaster 2500. It's a delivery truck that they convert into...
*  A lot of people are doing that these days. My friend Tim Poole did that. I believe he got a Ram as well. His was a Ram, wasn't it, Jamie?
*  I think it's a Ram as well, and he did the same thing. He turned it into a bug-out van.
*  So the Ram is wider than the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van, which you see a lot of. It's wider, so I can actually sleep full widthwise. The bed's widthwise at the back.
*  But it just kind of happened pretty randomly. I saw this clip online of these guys in Arizona who convert the vans. I called them up. They were on Shark Tank. These guys are called Boho. This van's called Boho. They're really cool dudes.
*  Boho? Like B-O-H-O?
*  Yeah. And by the way, they are like... They love that I'm here right now. They're your biggest fan. They literally watch every episode of your show. So they're going to take a shit right now. They're probably really happy that I'm mentioning them on the show.
*  But they were on Shark Tank. These two young guys, they started this company where they bought Ram Promasters. Totally independent thing. And they do this great carpentry. They build out the inside. It's all cedar.
*  Do you have images of your van online?
*  Yeah. That's the inside of the van there. And see I got my studio.
*  I like the wood. That's nice.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. And see I got my speakers set up. And the thing that's kind of cool about this in the Mojave Desert. There's Charlie chillin'.
*  Look at her.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  So when you say you have your studio, so you're doing your podcast from the road.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And how are you doing it? Whenever you feel like it, you just fire up the podcast when you've got something to say.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, that thing looks killer in there.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  See?
*  Oh, you got a little kitchenette set up. And how are you cooking?
*  There's a vent.
*  Oh, you got an awning.
*  And I'm shooting these drone shots too, which are pretty fun.
*  Dude, you're rolling drones. Look at this.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is the Mojave. Check out all those Joshua trees burned. Those are burned Joshua trees.
*  Oh, wow.
*  But so, you know, it's kind of like, you know, I've always been into the techie kind of building out studio stuff, right?
*  So that's when I found out about these vans.
*  The thing that really kind of piqued my interest is the battery and solar technology that exists now.
*  So there's two solar panels on the roof and in the back I've got these batteries.
*  OK, they're really called battle borne batteries.
*  They're like really solid like they use them in sailboats to go around the world basically.
*  And there's four of them and the solar panels are charging them constantly.
*  So I've built I've got my computers. I've got my cameras. I've got my drone.
*  I'm charging batteries all the time. I've got a refrigerator in there.
*  So I can have, you know, cold beer, right?
*  And and it's sweet so I can go out into the middle of nowhere and have virtually unlimited electronic capability and stay there as long as I want until I run out of food.
*  Wow. And so those solar panels, how efficient are they?
*  Like will they power your studio and all that stuff where you don't have to use your your engine?
*  You don't have to start up and use gas. Exactly.
*  Are you running diesel in your van? No, no.
*  But that just that just happened to be the way it went because that van was available and I've got that one.
*  But how is the gas mileage? It's pretty good.
*  I'll tell you one thing, though. I am always filling up like I never let it go below three quarters of a tank because just in case it gets I never know where I'm going every day.
*  That's the like I got weird stories over the last six weeks where I've just been like not sure where I'm going to sleep.
*  And it's the sun's going down and then I end up going down a crazy road.
*  And then the first night I got stuck in the Mojave Desert because I looked up on this app dispersed fire road.
*  I'm thinking, oh, that's pretty cool. You know, I get there.
*  There's a sign that says tortoises crossing. Careful. I start driving out to the desert.
*  I'm 200 yards in. I get stuck because it's the soft sand gets stuck in the soft sand.
*  So I've been a little more careful. But but get out and get stuck in the soft sand called AAA.
*  AAA comes to the desert. I was 100 yards from the from the from the freeway.
*  It was like I hadn't gotten into it yet. It was it was so pathetic.
*  It was hilarious because I've been planning for months, you know, and then all of a sudden I'm like I'm seeing the free.
*  So can I before we get into your adventure? I want to I want to get more into this van.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So you started it out with just buying this van.
*  Is it a new van or did you buy it? So you bought a brand new van and then you bring it to these boho guys.
*  Yeah. And these guys, what do they do? They ask you, what are you planning on doing?
*  You plan on using this as a studio? Like your idea from the jump was to do your podcast on the road with no no plans other than your own whims.
*  Right. So when when you do something like that, how do you know what you're going to need?
*  You didn't really have any experience in like off-roading or that kind of not really living out of a van.
*  How did you know what you're going to need? Like did you research it? Yeah.
*  So well, there's there's a couple of categories of research.
*  One was just building the studio itself. So I built the studio at home first.
*  That's just the nitty gritty technical stuff. You know, what kind of microphones, what kind of amps and preamps I'm going to use.
*  I have some amps that use tubes. I got rid of those because I figured the tubes had rattled out in the dirt road.
*  So boring techie stuff. But but as far as the survival and the food and the and all of that and the van, they've been real great.
*  Like I built my studio equipment into a road case and I know I knew that I thought, well, that could fit under the bed.
*  And then we sort of planted over. There's a little door that opens and you can access it under the bed.
*  We've wired all the cables through the walls and it's pretty efficient.
*  So you had everything you need to do a podcast down into one box. Yeah.
*  Just pull that box out and then you're ready to roll. It's actually it's actually permanently housed under the bed.
*  So I just I have a table that pulls out that table. I was sitting at there and just under there.
*  The door opens, microphones plugged in and away you go.
*  But the other side of it is like a lot of the video stuff, too, like the drone, the cameras.
*  Like I've got some new cameras that I'm kind of messing with that are exciting to me.
*  And so so I'm kind of out there. The thing that I was thinking, I was thinking, am I going to get bored out here?
*  Yeah, that's what I was going to ask. I'm all alone or lonely.
*  I'm not going to get bored or lonely. Yeah. And I haven't because I've populated the van with stuff to do.
*  So when I get bored of the drone, then I'm making music, too.
*  So I've made a it's a recording music studio to kind of music.
*  Well, I'm doing some sort of different stuff. I've got my acoustic guitar.
*  So I'm going to start doing some some country rap type of you're going to go on tour.
*  Country rap. I call it crap. Joe, it's a country. You're going to go on tour.
*  Maybe maybe as a singer. Wow. Yeah, I could see that.
*  No, I don't know. I don't know.
*  I mean, I probably maybe incorporated into my stand up or something like that.
*  You know, I was a rapper when I was a teenager. So yeah, I remember. Yeah.
*  So so to get back to this build out. So you get it where you're ready.
*  You still have your house in L.A., right? And then you decide, all right, let's do it.
*  You start the car up and you go. Where did you go?
*  I drove out into the Mojave Desert. That's the first place with the destination was Utah.
*  And so I started by going out to the Mojave Desert.
*  And what what type of what time of the year was this?
*  This was, I guess, six or seven weeks ago, I guess.
*  I've been on the road ever since. Wow.
*  I haven't been. It was great. Just eating out of your van.
*  Yeah. So that was part of planning like the food.
*  So I've got these big rubber made containers in the trunk. Four of them.
*  Do you have a refrigerator? I have a refrigerator. Yeah.
*  That's so is that solar powered as well? It's runs off the electric system.
*  So the solar is charging the batteries and the batteries run the electric for the whole van.
*  All the lights are LED. So it's very, you know, effective, efficient.
*  And the fridge is also high efficiency cooler, essentially.
*  So is it like one of those rollout coolers that people have under one of the seats?
*  It's called a Dometic cooler because there's a lot of guys who do.
*  What do they it's not they don't call it off roading.
*  They call it when they go out into the business, I don't think they call it that either.
*  That's that's the van life term for what people are doing with these vans now, but where they go off grid and.
*  I think it's a Filipino word from the U.S. military brought that.
*  There's a lot of people that plan.
*  They get a kick out of meticulously planning like a five hundred mile venture
*  mile venture through the off road, through the wilderness with these like off road.
*  I forget why they call it trekking.
*  God damn it.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's like there's I got into it for a while.
*  I went down a rabbit hole.
*  There's tons of videos on YouTube of these guys over landing.
*  Sorry.
*  That's what they call it.
*  Over landing.
*  So I'm not going.
*  You know, I don't have extra fuel, so I've got my tank of fuel.
*  So I usually when I get off the main highway, I make sure I've got full tank and I've never
*  I've gotten close to running out of fuel.
*  Have you thought now that you've had this thing for six weeks, you've been doing this
*  for six weeks to make revisions?
*  Like like maybe have some exterior fuel canisters, maybe put an extended range gas tank in.
*  I love these questions.
*  Yeah.
*  Overlanders do all that stuff.
*  So there's like, yeah, definitely, definitely.
*  You know, the thing is, is this van is is yeah, I could.
*  I mean, look, I'm amazed how remote you can go just and this is what I kind of talk about
*  on my social media and some of the videos I make on YouTube.
*  I'm sometimes sort of telling people like, hey, you know, if you're like sitting around
*  and you're bored and you're angry about shit, you want to you can just get in your car and
*  drive out to these beautiful places.
*  You know, the last week I was on the top of a mountain in the Lincoln National Forest,
*  right on the border of New Mexico and Texas.
*  And I mean, there's drone shots where it's just nobody for like seems like 100 miles.
*  I could I drove for an hour up this two lane paved highway and didn't see a car the entire
*  time driving there.
*  And then you get up there and you find a place to camp and there's there.
*  It's hunters are up there.
*  So there's lots of dispersed spots with fire pits.
*  You're up there all by yourself and you get up in the morning and I make coffee with this
*  gas powered kettle.
*  So I'm not eating my battery.
*  And you know, I got all these propane tanks.
*  I got a Coleman stove.
*  I'm cooking with my Coleman stove.
*  I got lots of cans of beans.
*  I'm eating a lot of spam and ragu.
*  I remember you gave me some shit about the ragu last time.
*  It's pretty good.
*  The ragu.
*  I don't think it gave me shit.
*  I was just kind of joking around with you.
*  Yeah.
*  But like, you know, I'm eating a lot of canned food because part of the part of what happened
*  was this started from the whole quarantining.
*  Right.
*  I got all this canned food for the house and I was just cooking for myself.
*  And then I thought, you know, I could just take this out, take this on the road.
*  You're spending a lot of time with no people.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Like, did it feel weird coming here?
*  There's all the people, security people here and Jamie and Jeff and me.
*  Did it feel weird?
*  Yeah.
*  All these people.
*  Mm hmm.
*  What does it feel like?
*  You know, it's interesting because you start to feel a little bit.
*  And I think this is probably something that maybe is affecting everybody with the quarantining
*  and the pandemic and all that stuff.
*  Maybe not.
*  Maybe, maybe certainly not everyone's in their van.
*  But you start to get to the point where you think maybe I didn't get social anxiety coming
*  here because like, I know you guys are getting all tested and all that stuff, but I have
*  a little bit, you know, I have a little bit more paranoia about getting this virus than
*  the average person.
*  Because of cancer?
*  Because of the fact that you have cancer?
*  I think so.
*  I think so, yeah.
*  Makes sense.
*  So, you know, cause I just don't, it's not even that I feel like I'm more susceptible
*  to it.
*  It's just, I really hate being sick.
*  When I had cancer, I was in the hospital for six weeks.
*  It was like painful.
*  I just hate it.
*  I hate that loss of control, you know?
*  So, so, but no, I mean.
*  Are you taking care of yourself like vitamin wise?
*  Are you taking supplements?
*  I think I'm eating pretty healthy.
*  I don't take.
*  With your spam and ragu?
*  But I mean, like there's a lot of vitamins in that.
*  Slow down.
*  There's a lot of vitamins in that stuff.
*  No.
*  Look, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm exercising.
*  Are you getting any fresh vegetables?
*  I'm doing a lot of walks.
*  I'm doing a lot of walks.
*  That's cool.
*  I'm going deep into these woods.
*  That's good.
*  Are you getting any fresh vegetables at all?
*  I have canned corn.
*  I have a large quantity of canned corn.
*  Canned corn is barely a vegetable.
*  I was told corn, rice and beans is enough for subsidence.
*  Yeah, you can stay alive.
*  Your heart will stay beating.
*  I'm just trying to stay alive.
*  I'm just trying to stay alive.
*  No, I want you to take care of yourself like vitamins and nutrients and like corn is very
*  little of that.
*  I have onions.
*  That's not going to last a long time.
*  And potatoes.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, there's a little bit of potatoes.
*  And potatoes.
*  You kind of live off of potatoes.
*  They last a long time.
*  I have, I mean, full disclosure, just to be clear.
*  I have done a few, you know, curbside pickup at Walmart and I've got oranges.
*  So I've got oranges.
*  Oh, so you won't go inside.
*  Yeah, not really trying to not to go inside.
*  I have gone inside a couple of times, admittedly.
*  You're nervous about going inside of Walmart.
*  I did do it once.
*  Yeah, because it was late and I was quite hungry.
*  But you're hardcore with this fear of the virus.
*  I'm not sure how much.
*  Yes, I am.
*  I am sure that I am.
*  But I also am enjoying, not enjoying.
*  That's the wrong word.
*  I am.
*  I'm just trying to see if I can do it, too.
*  I'm trying to see if I can do it.
*  Is it possible to go remote off the grid and just sort of be disconnected from the luxuries
*  that we're used to having in life of being able to go to a Walmart and grab any food
*  you want, you know?
*  I think I'll have some sushi, you know?
*  OK, I think I'll grab a plate of fresh cut steak.
*  I mean, it's kind of interesting to kind of go out into these places that are incredibly
*  remote and beautiful and to cook on an open flame.
*  I brought a fishing rod.
*  I haven't caught anything yet.
*  Have you done any fishing?
*  I did a little bit, but I honestly haven't had a lot of time.
*  How are you getting your licenses?
*  Online, online.
*  Online, yeah.
*  Yeah, I also, I did bring a shotgun as well.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  For protection or for birds?
*  Well, I have been hunting, but I have not actually seen an animal yet.
*  No animals at all?
*  No.
*  Are you bringing your dog?
*  That might be a part of the problem.
*  No, I don't bring the dog, actually.
*  I don't.
*  So when you say you go hunting, what are you hunting for?
*  Well, in my mind, it would be for birds.
*  I have a bird gun.
*  What gauge?
*  It's a 12 gauge.
*  That's a big gun for birds.
*  Is it?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I guess so.
*  It's a Benelli.
*  For ducks, I guess.
*  Maybe.
*  I don't even know what I'm doing, Joe.
*  I don't know.
*  But what birds are you targeting?
*  Well, I'm not really, honestly, I honestly have it just because I feel like when I'm
*  going in bear country and when I go walking deep into the woods, I kind of feel a little
*  nervous.
*  So I've got my bear spray.
*  I've got my hunting knife.
*  I've got my hands.
*  You ready to rock?
*  I'm ready to rock.
*  But I honestly just like to walk in the woods and I like to go deep out into the woods and
*  I bring a compass with me and I go way out.
*  I have the system to not get lost.
*  A system?
*  I have a system.
*  What's the system?
*  Well basically, so like last week I was up on this mountaintop in the Lincoln National
*  Forest and so there was a sort of a long straight, I'd call it like a ravine or something.
*  So I just walked straight along that ravine.
*  I knew that would lead back to the van.
*  And I followed that until I, probably a mile or so, until I hit a landmark that went that
*  way.
*  It was sort of a limestone ledge that went straight.
*  So I don't go so far that I'm going in circles, right?
*  But I'm always keeping very good track on those landmarks and I just know that okay
*  I walked a mile down to this ravine and this ravine to this limestone ledge and I'll walk
*  a mile that way.
*  Do you find yourself way more aware of where you are because you have to be responsible
*  for yourself and because you are alone, off-grid, different than you would be that if you were
*  with a bunch of friends wandering around you probably wouldn't be paying that much attention?
*  I love it.
*  It's my favorite thing.
*  I really do love it.
*  We talked about it before, how I used to go on canoe trips in Canada when I was a kid.
*  This is the first time I've ever done it alone.
*  I've never done camping alone before.
*  Who goes camping alone?
*  But there's something even really extra special about it.
*  I have a lot of friends who really enjoy it.
*  And to clarify, I do bring the dog with me on a lot of these walks when I have the shotgun
*  but I have no intention of firing the gun because I don't want to hurt her ears.
*  But if I ever went with the intention of possibly firing the gun then I leave her in the van.
*  You have to worry about coyotes with her.
*  This happened a couple nights ago.
*  It was really kind of interesting.
*  Dogs are so smart.
*  We should let everybody know she's a little doggy but she's adorable.
*  Say hi, Chopper.
*  Hi, sweetie.
*  She was sleeping, you could tell.
*  She was like, dad, I was just sleeping.
*  The other night we were surrounded by them, multiple times we've been surrounded by them
*  in the van at night.
*  So it was sort of late at night and I had a campfire going and we just heard more than
*  I've ever heard actually.
*  There must have been like 30 or something out there.
*  And they were howling.
*  And for a moment she barked and then I said, quiet.
*  And then she sort of realized.
*  I could see her realize because she barks at everything.
*  There's a video I put up on my YouTube which is pretty funny because we saw a javelina,
*  you know, wild boar.
*  They'll kill your dog too, man.
*  We were in the van.
*  So we were driving down this road.
*  This was in New Mexico.
*  And I'm getting my camera to get this shot of this wild boar.
*  It's not really a javelina.
*  It's not really a pig.
*  It looks like a pig but it's not.
*  It's a peccary.
*  It's a different kind of animal.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I think it was a wasn't a wild boar.
*  It was a javelina.
*  Yeah, I think it was.
*  Yeah.
*  I'd never seen one before.
*  Where was this?
*  In New Mexico.
*  Yeah, they have one in the Gila National Forest.
*  Gila, Gila, Gila, Gila.
*  So she's so cute.
*  So she starts barking at it.
*  Look at this.
*  Yeah, there it is.
*  Oh, you have video footage of it.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And you'll see, since she starts barking and then it runs off.
*  They're vicious little fuckers.
*  They killed Stan Hope's neighbor's dog.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah, there it goes.
*  It's interesting that it's by itself.
*  Yeah, so actually later, just out the road, we drove by a river.
*  Look at her.
*  She barks and then she yawns.
*  She's so well taken care of.
*  She's not worried.
*  Good job pulling that video up, Jamie.
*  That's pretty impressive, you guys.
*  Wow, look how beautiful that is.
*  Yeah, so that next shot there.
*  God, look at the landscape.
*  So this is the deer.
*  She scares the deer away here.
*  And that is just outside of Las Cruces, New Mexico.
*  You got a few deer out there.
*  Yeah, there's a lot out there.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's not actually my good lands.
*  That's in New Mexico, huh?
*  That's in New Mexico, yeah.
*  And she's barking at the deer?
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  When was this?
*  How long ago?
*  This was a week ago.
*  They might be in season, son.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  When I'm out for my walk, I've got my hunter orange on.
*  Do you have a license to shoot deer?
*  Do you have a tag?
*  I don't know.
*  No.
*  I just have a small game license just for New Mexico.
*  If you got a deer, do you know what to do with it?
*  Well, I have no intention of shooting a deer because I'm by myself.
*  I mean, what am I going to do with it?
*  Well, you don't have enough refrigeration.
*  But I do have Steve Rinelli's book on small game preparation.
*  Oh, really?
*  Oh, that's awesome.
*  I loved your episode of that, by the way.
*  I just did one with him a couple of days ago.
*  A new one?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, nice.
*  Yeah.
*  How long ago was that?
*  Five days ago?
*  Five episodes ago?
*  Week?
*  Yeah, he's awesome.
*  I particularly like the—
*  Look at that little face.
*  Look at that little face.
*  Look at her.
*  She's so cute.
*  First thing she did to me is bite me.
*  She can run up to me, wag at her tail, and bit my fingers like she just wants to play.
*  She's still teething a little bit.
*  How old is she?
*  She's about, sorry, six and a half months.
*  She's so cute.
*  She's so playful, too.
*  Yeah.
*  But, yeah, so like full disclosure, though, like I've never really hunted before.
*  I'm not a hunter.
*  I've never hunted before.
*  A lot of fishing.
*  Grew up fishing.
*  Did a ton of that.
*  But I just, I do like, I just, there's something about being all alone in the middle of nowhere
*  at night surrounded by coyotes that I'd be lying if I say it wasn't a little bit scary.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  It's a little bit scary.
*  There's something about those alone trips that people say you do sort of an inventory
*  of your life and start assessing your behavior and who you are and you're alone for so long
*  that you're forced to sort of think about what you've done and are you happy with your
*  choices in life?
*  Are you happy with your job?
*  Are you happy with your relationships?
*  Yeah.
*  Is that what you're experiencing, too?
*  Yeah.
*  My friend Aaron Snyder, he's been on the podcast before, he owns Kofaru.
*  It's a big backpack company.
*  They make like really super high-end hunting backpacks and he spends hundreds of days a
*  year in the woods by himself.
*  Yeah.
*  Either by himself or with other people hunting and he goes on these long backpacking solo
*  adventures hunting where he goes deep into the woods many, many, many miles and by himself
*  with just his camp on his back.
*  That's it.
*  That's the thing that he always says is that you get in there and then once you get back
*  to civilization you want to call ex-girlfriends and apologize, call friends and mend fences
*  and just sort of give you an inventory of what you've been.
*  I think sometimes we get caught up in momentum in life.
*  Life is a series of things that you have to do.
*  You wake up in the morning, you have to be at work at a certain time, you try to get
*  to the gym, you try to get this and then you have phone calls you have to make and then
*  you have to sync your calendar with the other people you're working with and then there's
*  this and that and then you're planning for in two weeks we have that meeting and this
*  and that and ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba and you get so caught up in momentum you never stop
*  to take a breath and look at yourself and look at what you're doing and go is this what
*  I like?
*  Is this what I want to do or is this something that I'm just am I on this like sled that's
*  flying down the side of this snow-covered mountain?
*  I don't know exactly how I'm going to get off of it.
*  And you made me think of something.
*  A lot of the places I've been, no cell service.
*  And so it's three days and like maybe a text will fire out but there's no video, there's
*  no reading YouTube comments.
*  No reading YouTube comments.
*  How nice is that?
*  Yeah.
*  There's been a few days where I'll get the cell service and then immediately check the
*  YouTube comments.
*  And then I'm on it more than a yeah.
*  I know.
*  We talked about this before.
*  I want to try to adopt that.
*  What is it?
*  Post and ghost.
*  I want to try to adopt that because I have sort of gone the opposite approach.
*  I'm like kind of interacting very much with those comments.
*  Well, I'm sure the fans like that.
*  The nice fans.
*  I find it kind of a fun creative exercise.
*  Like sometimes I'll have you know a hater or whatever and then I'll get into a little
*  thing with him and it's fun.
*  But for the most part I've created kind of a very positive thing.
*  But like what's fun is just getting away from it from the phone.
*  But like you said is exactly what it's been like going through that.
*  I just love it out there.
*  What have you learned about yourself?
*  Definitely that I've been on my phone too much.
*  But I think one thing that I've learned is that I actually do pretty well being alone
*  actually.
*  I was worried that maybe I would not be able to like I thought one of the things I was
*  thinking when I started this whole process of planning is plan for several months getting
*  the van getting all the stuff ready.
*  I thought what if I get out there and I can't stand it.
*  You know what if I go two days in.
*  But I got to go home.
*  I need my shower in my bed.
*  But I actually after a couple of days I just start to really kind of get very relaxed and
*  you start to kind of feel a very nice connection with nature I guess.
*  I mean you know I'm going to bed at eight at night.
*  Waking up at 5.30 in the morning.
*  You know making my coffee as the sun is rising over a mountain.
*  And so I'm watching the sun rise and it's cold.
*  It's cold in the morning up there man.
*  So especially when I was up in northern Utah like cold.
*  But there's a whole system to keeping the van warm and stuff too.
*  But so.
*  Why don't you have a system to keep in the van warm?
*  Well so the first few weeks I didn't have this proper insulation on the windows.
*  So I ordered this stuff for the van windows.
*  Do you glue it to the windows or something?
*  Magnets.
*  It's magnets.
*  You just take it off.
*  It's a nice thick sort of padding.
*  So you heat up the van inside and then you put that up and it keeps the temperature?
*  I put it on first.
*  I just put it on.
*  I put it on.
*  It covers the windshield, the two front passenger, all windows.
*  They're completely sealed.
*  And then I start the engine and I run it.
*  I don't run the gas out.
*  I run it for 10 minutes.
*  The thing heats up and then I just don't open the door.
*  I do that right when it's time to kind of crash.
*  How long does it keep it warm for?
*  You know it's warm until I fall asleep and then I wake up in the morning freezing my
*  butt off.
*  But no it's not too bad.
*  I don't think this would be something that you would want to go out in the winter in.
*  But you know this time of year it's and down here in Texas it was nice the last few days.
*  It's been nice.
*  He's got a video.
*  He's living out of his van too doing the same sort of situation.
*  He's very organized, got the whole deal.
*  But he's doing it in Colorado.
*  And he's in the middle of the winter covered in snow and does all these detailed things
*  like how he gets out of snow, what he does, and how he stays warm.
*  I imagine it would be a lot less simple up in that kind of temperature.
*  Well just camping in cold weather is rough.
*  You have to have the right insulated sleeping bag.
*  You have to make sure that you have...
*  Down booties.
*  That's my new discovery.
*  On the internet, this is what's hilarious about the world we're living in now with the
*  internet and having access to everything.
*  Before I left I started researching, oh here's a guy talking about winter camping.
*  Down booties.
*  There's these little feathery down things.
*  You put them on your bare feet at night and you wear them in your sleeping bag and your
*  feet are warm.
*  So I start seeing all these little things that I...
*  Oh that'll help.
*  These little products.
*  You go on Amazon, shows up at your house the next day.
*  Your supplies start building up.
*  But I have these down booties and I've got nice Merino wool undergarments and things
*  like this.
*  Is it Merino wool?
*  I was hunting stuff.
*  Merino wool is great because when you get wet it doesn't make you cold.
*  If you get wet in cotton and then you get cold you're in trouble.
*  The issue is if you're going somewhere and you're hiking and it's cold out.
*  Even though it's cold out, if you're hiking and you're wearing a lot of layers you're
*  going to sweat.
*  But if you sweat and you're wearing cotton you're in big trouble.
*  Because as soon as you cool off that wet cotton freezes.
*  It feels terrible.
*  But wool is different.
*  Wet wool keeps you warm.
*  You can be in wool and it gets wet.
*  It's wet still.
*  It's not the most comfortable thing but you're warm.
*  It's very interesting.
*  I guess because it's like an animal fiber.
*  It's been relatively comfortable.
*  It's been a few nights where I've been a little colder than I would have liked to have been.
*  And a lot of the places I've been right now it's no fires because of the dry.
*  But the last week I was in a place I could have a fire so I kept a nice campfire going.
*  Were you in Utah?
*  Where were you?
*  I was in, that was up in the Gila National Forest.
*  No that was the Lincoln National Forest.
*  So you went to New Mexico and then you drove your way up to Austin.
*  Well first, actually first, so one of the most beautiful places I went by the way was
*  in Utah.
*  I went to this place called the Valley of the Gods.
*  Oh I've heard of that.
*  On the Navajo reservation there.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  Yeah?
*  Oh there's a video of that.
*  There's a video of that drone shot.
*  That is, it's like, they shot all the John Wayne movies out there in Monument Valley
*  and then just down the road is this place called the Valley of the Gods.
*  Look at this place.
*  Ah man.
*  So look, all alone right there.
*  That's you.
*  Look at that.
*  That's your drone footage.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  And you know, a big part of this for me is also looking for places that are going to
*  photograph well, you know, because I enjoy photography and video.
*  So do you have all this stuff on TomGreen.com?
*  Is this on your YouTube channel?
*  I put it on my YouTube channel, yeah.
*  And then I link it to my website.
*  Yeah, it's on TomGreen.com too, yeah.
*  So I get these shots.
*  You see Charlie chilling out there.
*  Charlie is like intrigued by the drone.
*  Like the first ten times I've flown it she just sort of, see she's going under the van
*  because she hears the drone coming.
*  Did you call her Chopper and Charlie?
*  No, I'm just, not Charlie, yeah.
*  Did someone call her Chopper?
*  Did I just call her Chopper?
*  I don't know, maybe, yeah.
*  That's a good, that's your new nickname.
*  That's your new middle name, Charlie Chopper.
*  Why did I call her Chopper?
*  Did someone else call her Chopper outside?
*  Yeah, Charlie, Charlie, yeah.
*  Named after Travels with Charlie, the John Steinbeck novel, Travels with Charlie.
*  And if you see on the van, see at the back, you can't read it, but there's a blurry word
*  right above the rear wheel.
*  It's Rossinante, which is what, yeah, right there, which was Steinbeck called his van,
*  Rossinante, which is named after Don Chiodi's horse.
*  So there's multiple layers of homages there.
*  But look at that shot, isn't that amazing?
*  It is amazing.
*  I love your shirt too.
*  It's a very lumberjack-y shirt you're wearing in there.
*  Oh yeah, it's warm, it's warm.
*  The last shot of this video, I don't know if you can just scroll it ahead.
*  God, that's so pretty.
*  The last shot of this video, I waited for sunset.
*  Oh, here's how I take a shower.
*  So you can just go out there and camp anywhere you want, just pull over and camp.
*  Yeah.
*  Now, do you have any concern about running into serial killers?
*  Well, that's why I got the shotgun, Joe, but you know.
*  You look like a serial killer.
*  Yeah.
*  Like you look like, like if I was going through there with my family and you were like, how
*  Hello, and you're just waving.
*  I'd be like, oh, fuck.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Who's this crazy guy?
*  Who's this crazy guy?
*  You know, look at the last shot right after this.
*  So there's this sunset.
*  I kind of like, look at those, those buttes in the background.
*  See that?
*  The shot after this one, just let it, just let it roll.
*  You'll see it.
*  Let it roll.
*  You'll see.
*  But there's, I kind of like to wait for the sun to get these nice shots.
*  So this is the shot here.
*  Watch this drone shot is pretty cool.
*  So and to kind of get these interesting images, you'll see the sun will go.
*  Now what do you strap on the drone?
*  Is it built in with cameras?
*  It's got a camera on it.
*  So this is just not even a super, look, watch the sun disappear.
*  And then, and then the music that's playing is music that I made in the van.
*  It's a score.
*  You could, you can play the audio if you want.
*  It's my music, but it's a score.
*  I'm doing this sort of ambient score.
*  What kind of drugs are you getting?
*  You know, nothing too crazy.
*  But so I see the sun pops up.
*  This is like ocean music.
*  Yeah.
*  This is like music that I expect to hear about like a documentary on whales.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's kind of a Brian Eno influence type of vibe.
*  Are you doing a video whenever you feel like it?
*  Are you doing them on a schedule?
*  I kind of just, I'm always shooting stuff and then I'll edit and sometimes I'll, the
*  first, the first, the first month I didn't post as much because honestly, I was just
*  trying to figure out how to survive out there.
*  And now I've got a good system.
*  So I think the videos are going to start coming a little more fast and furious now.
*  Cause I got a moment we were like, what the fuck am I doing?
*  I need to go back to LA every day.
*  Every day, every single day I get up and say that for, for real.
*  And I'm not even exaggerating.
*  Every day I get up and go, what the fuck am I doing?
*  But you keep going.
*  Yeah, because I have, I have some, I have some things on the agenda that I want to
*  accomplish in the next month in Texas.
*  When I leave here, first of all, I don't know where I'm sleeping tonight.
*  OK, I don't know where I'm going tonight.
*  But I'm, I'm, I'm, I have a few little interesting tricks for that too.
*  But if I ever get stuck in a bind, right.
*  I've been driving and I haven't found a nice place like that.
*  I'll go to just a straight up truck stop and I'll wedge in between a bunch of 18
*  wheelers crash, get up in the morning and, you know, start finding my destination.
*  What I've been finding is I get on these sort of this sort of pattern where I'll
*  go a couple of days where I don't find a place like that, you know, that's like,
*  but every three or four days I'll find a place kind of at that level of beauty.
*  And then once I'm there, I'll stay there for four or five days and just really
*  get into it.
*  I'll shoot a lot of video.
*  I'll edit and I'll create some music and I'll create some things.
*  And then when I get back to cell service, I'll post and then I go look for the
*  next spot.
*  So my agenda when I leave here today is I want to go around Texas and go find some
*  ghost towns and ghost towns, lots of ghost towns in Texas.
*  Lots of really there's apparently there's 500 of them, you know, 500 ghost towns
*  back in the silver mining and gold mining days when they built the railroads.
*  First of all, the silver would dry up, the town would dry up.
*  So there's these towns that are just, you know, dilapidated, broken downtowns in
*  the middle of the-
*  Didn't Kim Basinger buy one of those?
*  Mm hmm.
*  She did.
*  Yeah.
*  She did.
*  Right.
*  In Georgia, right?
*  I think so.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And I want, she must be losing her marbles.
*  Like why would she buy a ghost town?
*  Yeah, I don't, I don't know, but you know, there's a real sort of beauty to it
*  because, so there's two things I've been doing that I've found I really enjoy.
*  And they're new things, so I can't speak to them like with total detail, but I'm
*  you know, next time I talk to you, I'm going to have a lot more information about this.
*  The other thing is native ruins of like, like there's, there was unbelievable
*  amount of native American ruins out there in the desert of New Mexico.
*  The reason I was in the, in the Gila national forest, I went to the, the
*  cliff dwellings that were built by-
*  The Anastasi?
*  Yeah.
*  Those, the Anastasi is in Colorado and this, but it looks just like that.
*  It's exactly like that.
*  And so there's-
*  Are they the Navajo then?
*  They were the, the Magolan Indians they were called in 1280.
*  They built this.
*  Whoa.
*  And so that video is, that was a clip of that.
*  1280?
*  Yeah, there's a clip of that in the Arizona one.
*  There's a clip of that.
*  And these are like, first of all, very remote.
*  That was right actually where we saw the javelina.
*  It was right after I went there.
*  There are 50 rooms in this thing built out of stone up on a cliff.
*  Uh, they've created it.
*  So, but it was built in 1280 and then not discovered by the Nat, the
*  park ranger told me this, uh, last week.
*  Yeah, right here.
*  Wow.
*  That's just sitting there.
*  Not discovered.
*  Not discovered until 1874.
*  Holy shit.
*  Right?
*  1874.
*  And so they discovered this and, uh, it wasn't until a few years later
*  that, uh, Roosevelt theater, Roosevelt made it a national monument.
*  So in the period between 1874 and I think 1907, it got looted a bit.
*  When they found it, it was full of pottery.
*  It was full of all this artifacts and stuff that got looted.
*  That's gone.
*  But there's some things in there that were really interesting that they
*  did discover, like they discovered, uh, McCaw feather.
*  This is, this is pretty beautiful place.
*  This is wild.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're, this is all drone footage, right?
*  No, this is me shooting with my handheld camera.
*  So you're allowed to walk around up there.
*  Yeah.
*  So they have a nice, uh, it's really set up nice.
*  It's a, there's a, you drive in on a nice paved road and then there's a
*  national park, uh, facility, state park or national park.
*  It's the Gila national forest facility there.
*  Um, national park facility, I believe.
*  But, uh, and, uh, there's some, some, uh, rangers there and some, some
*  people with knowledge of the history and then they have a nice maintained
*  path that walks up.
*  So,
*  were there people up there looking at it with you?
*  There was on that day, uh, I saw the sun was kind of going down there
*  and there were two other people.
*  And they walked up ahead.
*  I mean, yeah.
*  National monument.
*  Yeah.
*  Gila cliff, cliff drawings.
*  Yeah.
*  And the Gila wilderness, the Gila wilderness is where they have some of
*  the best elk hunting in the world.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  There was a lot of hunters out and, uh, and I saw some elk.
*  I saw some, yeah.
*  You hear them screaming?
*  I didn't, I did not, but, uh, but, uh, that's, they, they were, the thing
*  that I noticed about the elk, which was just the one time I saw them was they
*  were, I was driving, so I was driving a very remote sort of, I'm not going, I'm
*  not taking any interstates.
*  I never take an interstate all the way from LA, the whole way to here.
*  I maybe was on the 10 for like maybe a couple of miles just to get from one
*  highway to another.
*  So you take the smaller highways and then you see like these towns, these
*  places that, you know, went away when the railway was built somewhere else.
*  So when they put the interstate somewhere else, the town dried up.
*  And then there's these, these towns that are just kind of half alive and fledgling
*  towns and it's just a real beauty there to it.
*  Right.
*  So, you know, from a photography standpoint, you know, like there's a lot
*  of nice architecture and things that is just really interesting.
*  So, but, uh,
*  So you consciously made a decision in the beginning of this journey
*  to not take any interstates?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause I want to, I want to go find these places that are off the beaten track
*  and, and, and, and photograph them really.
*  But so I was coming around a corner and there was a herd of elk and they were
*  sort of in the distance and they were running, like playing with each other.
*  Have you ever seen that?
*  Like one was running and then they were running around.
*  How long was this?
*  Oh, like seven days ago or something.
*  Oh, okay.
*  So it wouldn't be the rut.
*  Um, the rut is in September.
*  Yeah.
*  They were running.
*  I didn't sometimes they late rot in October.
*  Yeah.
*  So what one, it was one was running and I thought they were horses for sure.
*  Cause I just thought, well, I've never seen them.
*  Then it was fast, really fast, like across this was a sort of farmer's field.
*  And they're playing with each other.
*  Yeah.
*  And then I, then the car pulled up, I pulled up my car and they, you know,
*  they really stopped and looked at me and walked off into the woods.
*  But, but, uh, yeah, it was, it's, uh, it's, it's beautiful out there, man.
*  But yeah, ghost towns.
*  That's, that's where I'm going after this.
*  I'm going to go try to find some ghost towns and, uh, and photograph those.
*  And, and I'm writing, you know, I, I, I write in the van.
*  I'm working on things that I'm working on, you know, uh, you know, I'm not
*  just completely off the grid.
*  I mean, I'm writing an animated series right now that I'm sort of working on.
*  So I, I'm on my computer sometimes.
*  An animated series.
*  Yeah.
*  There's this, I, I'm working with this great company out of Ottawa, my
*  hometown called mercury film works.
*  And they're, uh, they actually animate Mickey Mouse and all sorts of stuff for
*  Disney, the big, big animated, uh, uh, company.
*  And so I'm writing a, a fun show about, uh, a crazy kid who likes pulling pranks
*  and, and, uh, you know, and so about you, yes, it's called little Tommy green.
*  Oh boy.
*  How on the nose is that?
*  It's like a Dennis the menace, you know, but he goes out and do
*  impulse pranks on his parents and does a lot of the kinds of things I did.
*  So, but, uh, but, you know, so I'm writing that and, uh, and just kind of,
*  you know, it's interesting.
*  I found that like, I can kind of do everything that I would do at home in
*  the van, you know, with this electrical system, you know, so it's pretty neat.
*  You seem like you're in a good place.
*  Like, it's seems like it's been tricky, but you, I mean, I'm getting the
*  impression that you're really enjoying this.
*  I am.
*  Yeah.
*  Is this going to extend?
*  How long are you going to do this for?
*  This is, this has been a, this is a very good question.
*  Um, is this your new life?
*  It's possible.
*  Really?
*  I'm not selling my house or anything.
*  And then I think what I'll do is, I mean, I bought the van.
*  It's, I didn't rent it for a quick one-off trip, you know, and, and, and
*  I've put a lot of time into it and I am enjoying it and, uh, you know, one
*  thing is I've always loved photography.
*  I I'm bringing a Leica, uh, film camera as well.
*  So I'm shooting a lot of still photography as well.
*  And it's nice to have something to take a picture of, you know, it's
*  nice to go somewhere interesting.
*  So I'm enjoying that.
*  Um, but I think that, I think that what I'll probably do is, you know, when
*  life gets back to normal, whenever the fuck that is, right?
*  Yeah.
*  What is normal anymore?
*  Yeah.
*  Um, part of my plan is to, you know, when I start touring again, doing stand
*  up again, I think I might take a few less airplanes, uh, in, in the future
*  and be in the van a little bit more.
*  And so I say, if you have a gig, if you decided to stand up in Utah,
*  you might drive there.
*  I'm thinking I might start to talk to, you know, the way I book it about sort
*  of doing more of a road trip type run of like in a straight line as opposed to
*  go home and, you know, Seattle this week and Boston next week, maybe do an
*  East coast run or do, so, so I'm thinking that it might be something that I do.
*  I mean, I, uh, I, I'm not, I'm not moving into my van full time, but I
*  definitely do do love it.
*  You're moving in that direction.
*  It seems like,
*  look, it's interesting.
*  What you say, I believe is true because, uh, yeah, get in there, fella.
*  Um, by the way, this is the way I make coffee too.
*  I make coffee with this thing.
*  This is not a endorsement or anything, but it's pretty cool.
*  Product's called a jet boil.
*  Yeah.
*  I use jet boils.
*  Those are great.
*  Huh?
*  Yeah.
*  They're great for hunting.
*  Yeah.
*  So, cause I don't want to use my battery.
*  So I boil up my water and then I make my coffee and then I pour it into a thermos
*  coffee all day and the hot coffee and the thermos.
*  It's amazing that it stays hot.
*  So I was thinking about that technology, thinking about that exact thing.
*  I'm going is the techno has thermos technology changed since in Canada, I was
*  a kid, you'd take a thermos to hockey because we play outside on outdoor rinks
*  and you'd bring a thermos of hot chocolate.
*  We didn't.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, when I was a kid, we used to ice fish and we used to bring hot coffee
*  out onto the lake.
*  Yeah.
*  I never did much of that.
*  It's, uh, it's fun.
*  It's not as fun as regular fishing, but when you're living in a place like
*  Boston and we're in the hut on the, no, we're just out there.
*  Yeah.
*  What were you fishing for?
*  A pike or trout?
*  Usually trout.
*  Yeah.
*  Pike too though.
*  Yeah.
*  Pike are pretty active in cold weather.
*  You do much fishing these days?
*  I do when I can, when I can.
*  Yeah.
*  Just unfortunately, ever since I moved to Austin, it's been kind of playing
*  catch up and getting everything set up and you know, just I'm still not totally
*  moved.
*  I mean, I moved in, but I'm not totally settled in, but I'm pretty close.
*  Yeah.
*  Didn't catch much trout growing up.
*  Mostly large mouth bass and pike was where I would, what I would fish for.
*  But, but yeah, thermos technology, I don't know if it's changed, but it's amazing.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeti flipped the game on its head.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeti coolers are amazing.
*  I have a Yeti cooler that I take when I hunt and you can put ice in that Yeti
*  cooler in the summer and seven days later you'll have ice.
*  It's bananas.
*  They're crazy.
*  I, I took a video that I put on my Instagram of, uh, we shot deer in Hawaii,
*  shot access deer in Hawaii.
*  Put the, you know, they, they put the thing in the cargo, the seal up though,
*  Yeti and got it all the way back to LA, left it outside overnight.
*  Then the next day at noon, I opened it up and it was filled with ice.
*  Like rock solid ice.
*  Okay.
*  It's crazy how good those things.
*  That's better than, that's better than, I just have a regular thermos for my
*  coffee, but that's pretty amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know how the coolers are way better.
*  The thermoses are better.
*  Those, uh, you know, Yeti makes those tumblers.
*  They'll keep your coffee hot, like literally all day.
*  I don't know what they're doing some voodoo, but it's fucking amazing.
*  I loved in the, I love the, uh, the sock foot, uh, walk in when you did the,
*  when you were with Steve.
*  Oh yeah.
*  When you're sneaking up on deer, you got to take your shoes off.
*  You've done before.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, my friend, Remy Warren calls it an SOS, a shoes off situation.
*  Like when you're, when you're closing in on, uh, particularly on mule deer,
*  mule deer are very sensitive to predators.
*  Elk are not nearly as sensitive.
*  Elk hear a lot of noise.
*  The elk are a big animal.
*  And, you know, they're worried about mountain lions and bears and stuff like
*  that, but you know, they're, they're a little less worried than the smaller
*  animals are so mule deer are particularly worried.
*  So they're very jumpy.
*  They're always like, like listen around and their ears are twisting.
*  And if you snap a branch, they'll, they'll pop up and start running.
*  Was that a, obviously that was a fun day with you and, uh, Steve out there, but
*  like, what was, was that must've been, that was in Nevada, was it?
*  Yeah, that was in the Nevada high country.
*  We were hunting mule deer.
*  We struck out.
*  Yeah.
*  But, uh, I got real close a couple of times to deer.
*  Just didn't really get a shot.
*  Did you feel, is it kind of sort of nice sometimes when they get away?
*  I mean, cause you feel like,
*  it's a luxury because I'm living in a first world country and I have
*  access to food and I'm not starving.
*  And, you know, so it's a, it's a luxury that I can enjoy the
*  fact that they got away.
*  Cause this is something that I've been grappling with a little bit, because
*  like I said, I'm not a hunter or haven't, but, but now I am hunting, but I
*  haven't actually seen anything.
*  So I'm just looking, I'm just saying when I'm saying I'm hunting, I'm
*  just, I'm looking for something.
*  You're looking for birds.
*  Right.
*  And in my mind, I'm thinking, okay, gross or quail.
*  I could probably, you know, wrap my head around that.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause first of all, you know, I'm eating raw onions and, and, and
*  canned beans out there and I'm cooking onions, but you know, I'm, I'm, I'm,
*  I'm, that would be pretty tasty, you know, and I saw chicken.
*  Out there, you know, a nice wild chicken.
*  But the thing is, is I also kind of know I'm never going to find one because I
*  don't know what I'm doing.
*  Right.
*  So like, and I don't have the, I think you really need dogs that are
*  trained to roast the birds out.
*  So not necessarily.
*  Yeah.
*  No, you, you, you, there's a lot of birds that you can get if you just,
*  so I've done some research.
*  Okay.
*  So I went to, I went to, uh, this was a top of a mountain.
*  Where was this?
*  Uh, this was on the road for a while, but it was, you know, the, I know the, the,
*  the dusk, the dusty gross is native to the, the certain elevation in the way,
*  way, such plateau.
*  That's where I was the way, such plateau in Utah.
*  And, uh, I went up there.
*  I don't think that's how you say it.
*  What was, I'm sure.
*  I think that's it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I just, I just read the sign when I drove up the road.
*  I know.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're in the Aspens.
*  And so, you know, I walked up, but there was a moment where I was walking through
*  the Aspens looking for the, uh, the dusty gross and, uh, you know, didn't see
*  one and then there were three beautiful deer standing there like, as far as Jamie
*  away, looking at me, standing there with my shotgun, looking at him.
*  I'm just like, I don't know what I'd do with you guys, but I'm pretty hungry
*  right now, but I'll let you guys, uh, let you guys go and keep looking for my bird.
*  But, but, uh, so I don't know.
*  I don't know that I would ever have even really want to shoot a mammal, a
*  mammal for some reason.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if I, but you eat them.
*  Yeah, no, I know.
*  And I've, I've heard you talk about this and I agree with it too, but, but, but,
*  but I just don't know if I'd be able to do it.
*  I don't know.
*  You would definitely be able to do it if you had to for food.
*  Yeah.
*  And I'm sure you would develop a different sort of a relationship with the
*  animal.
*  You would think that you're, you're very appreciative of them, but you'll, you'll
*  develop this real predator prey relationship with animals if you need to survive.
*  You know, I've talked about this many times, but unfortunately I'm going to
*  talk about it again.
*  There's a fantastic series that vice guide to travel did, um, back in the
*  day, it's quite a few years old, at least eight years old, I think it's called,
*  Hindmo's Arctic adventure.
*  And it's a guy, um, I think his name is Hindmo Couth.
*  I think that's his last name.
*  And he lives up in the middle of nowhere in Alaska.
*  And he actually has a license to be in this particular area or a permit to be in
*  this particular area that no one else can ever have a house in there again.
*  He's like grandfathered in.
*  Yeah.
*  And all this guy does is, uh, go out and subsistence hunt.
*  So he goes out and hunts caribou.
*  He goes out and he fishes and that's all he does.
*  That's, that's his whole life.
*  And this guy has this incredible connection to, to life and to, to his food.
*  And, but he's also very articulate, intelligent man.
*  So when he talks about it, he's able to talk about it in a way.
*  This is the guy right here.
*  Wow.
*  So he's got all of his food and it's frozen.
*  So that's his cabin.
*  That's where he lives.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's been out there since I think since the seventies, man, and super,
*  yeah, I think so super fucking healthy and really robust.
*  This guy, um, didn't find out about nine 11 until quite a while afterwards.
*  And I think he found out from a photograph.
*  Yeah.
*  And he lives up there.
*  It's like one of those with his wife.
*  Japanese soldiers they found in the woods.
*  Sort of the sixties, you know, right?
*  Right.
*  That's still not the war was going on.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But this guy, he's got a really interesting way of describing what he
*  thinks is great about this life.
*  Wow.
*  Wait, what's, where do I find this?
*  This is, it's a vice guy to travel.
*  Oh, yeah, there it is.
*  Surviving Alone Alaska.
*  Hi, hi Mo.
*  Uh, H E I M O Korth.
*  That's how I say it.
*  K O R T H.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  I watched that show alone, actually, which I loved.
*  If you ever watched that show, that show was amazing.
*  So I kind of was, that was something I was getting in my head and there were the,
*  I don't know if it's the latest season, but the one guy who got the moose and
*  Jordan Jonas, right?
*  That guy, that's the guy who's been on the podcast.
*  Yeah.
*  And he like made a fishing net out of rope and I was like, I was incredible,
*  but, uh, no, it's just something, something amazing about it for sure.
*  But so yeah, yeah, it's, and by the way, like, first of all, I, I, I, I, I
*  believe I said congratulations already, uh, off camera, but how cool is this man?
*  Congratulations.
*  Buddy.
*  I, uh, you know, I'm super, uh, I, it doesn't make sense to say proud of you
*  because I mean, what the fuck does that mean?
*  But you know, like I am though.
*  I mean, like I just, I think it's so cool.
*  I sent you a text right after the, after you announced your Spotify deal.
*  I was just thinking like, nobody has ever done that before, you know, like,
*  like in the history of all broadcasting, you know, I said, you know, Johnny
*  Carson was the guy who we all looked up to back in the day, had everybody watching
*  him, it was a different world.
*  Television was, you know, three networks.
*  Everybody watched Johnny.
*  He was a guy who became this very successful person off of traditional media.
*  But to do what you've done is just so incredible.
*  And I just, congratulations.
*  You know, it's definitely something that, you know, I, I, you know, we talked
*  about this before, but I always thought, man, you could do that.
*  You could do that.
*  You could be the biggest show and not be on network TV.
*  I always believed that.
*  And, uh, thank you for, for, for, for proving it because it's like, it's so cool.
*  And I love the studio by the way.
*  It's well, thank you for being a pioneer man, because you gave me real pioneer.
*  Now I'm living in a log chopping wood for dinner, but you were a pioneer of this
*  because you gave me the seeds of the earliest ideas about doing a podcast.
*  Well, you've been very kind of with, with, when you've said these things to me
*  over the years and last time, but, but you know, what I, what I find amazing
*  about it that I never was able to figure out, I was into the technology and I
*  was never really able to figure out what is so amazing.
*  What I've watched you figure out is you've really made a show that really
*  captures the interest of people, you know, a huge population of people love
*  what you guys talk about on the show.
*  And that's what's, what's really cool.
*  You know, uh, you know, just, just, I mean, how did you determine that?
*  Like, you know, I, I just watched your interview with Kanye.
*  I just watched your interview with Alex Jones and I'm just, I'm just seeing all
*  these subjects that I see swirling around and I'm going, well, that's the kind
*  of stuff that like, when I go down a rabbit hole on the internet, like I
*  want to, I want to, you know, learn about these things.
*  Was there a moment where you realized, oh wait, like if I talk about, you know,
*  X, Y or Z that's really capturing people's attention or was it just,
*  it was just what you were interested in?
*  Never for a second.
*  Never for a second have I said, this is going to capture people's interest.
*  Never.
*  Everything has been like, Ooh, I want to talk to that guy.
*  Oh, that guy said he was in a Navy, a Navy jet and he was tracking a UFO
*  commander, David Fravor, Ooh, I want to talk to him.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, Bob Lazar said he worked on alien technology in area S four.
*  Oh, I want to talk to him.
*  Oh, this guy said he saw Bigfoot or that guy says he's working on life extension
*  and figuring out how to lengthen your telomeres or this guy knows how to, you
*  know, whatever it is, whatever they're, they're figuring out the age of the
*  universe or people are just, you know, people that are writing books or people
*  that are, you know, former military people or people that are whatever they are.
*  If I find them interesting, I like people.
*  I'm a big fan of people.
*  I like talking to all kinds of different people.
*  I like the way their brain thinks.
*  I like comparing the way people's brain thinks.
*  I like, I like sort of like just seeing how they view the world.
*  Cause the way you view the world is the way you personally view the world, but
*  it's very much influenced by the things that you've found attractive about the
*  way the other people that you've run into see things like we are not.
*  Individuals in the sense that we're autonomous, completely alone, without
*  any influence whatsoever from the outside world, we are, we have multi influences.
*  We're constantly being influenced by our environment.
*  That's why you're in, where you live is so important.
*  And one of the things that I found in moving from LA to Austin is that where
*  you live, it makes a big impact on the amount of stress you have and how you
*  feel, I feel so much better here.
*  Just right away, disconnected from Hollywood, disconnected from, you know,
*  traditional forms of show business, but also the people here, the people here
*  are different, they're more relaxed.
*  They're regular people.
*  Chappelle and I were having a conversation about this last night and it was like,
*  we were talking about how like people here in Austin, they're real people.
*  They're not people that are trying to get famous and people that are trying to,
*  you know, get on television shows and do movies.
*  And this is a weirdness to that life.
*  And some of the people that do that are really cool.
*  It's rare and nice when you run into a guy like Chris Pratt, who is a super
*  famous guy, he's in the movies, but could not be more genuine, could not be more
*  down to earth, could not be more normal and friendly, super great guy, just
*  happens to be a big movie star.
*  But that's rare.
*  Most of the people that want that life, they're all kind of wacky and fucked up.
*  And you, you, you're in their world with their energy and they infect all the
*  people around them.
*  They infect people that are in the service industry, managers, agents, this
*  is this fucking hive of weirdness.
*  Out here, there's none of that.
*  There's none of that.
*  And almost immediately I felt a lowering of stress level, almost immediately.
*  And then the people that you deal with, like whether it's someone who's working
*  at the counter at Walgreens or a restaurant, they're so nice.
*  They're so friendly.
*  And so because early on in your show, you had the confidence to just do your
*  own thing, right?
*  You, you create your own thing.
*  You didn't have, you know, these sort of tentacles coming down telling you,
*  oh, you can't interview that person.
*  Yeah.
*  That, that allowed you to just talk to the people that you found interesting
*  and you happen to be interested in interesting shit.
*  Yeah.
*  But in the beginning, nobody wanted anything to do with it.
*  That's what's hilarious.
*  Like my agent in the beginning didn't want to have anything to do with this podcast.
*  Then what they were like, what are you doing?
*  Wasting your time.
*  Like, right.
*  Because back then, like 2000 people were watching or listening.
*  It was nobody's listening.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember with mine, I was trying to tell people, this is going to be the thing.
*  I know they're like, get the fuck out of here.
*  We're busy with movies, kid.
*  They're busy.
*  Yeah.
*  So luckily in the beginning, when I maybe could have used a little help getting
*  guests or doing things or getting advertisement or something like that,
*  they didn't get involved because if somebody got involved, they would have
*  definitely told me to not do things that have turned out to be very successful.
*  Like I'm sure they would have told me to not interview controversial people or
*  to not interview people that you're going to get, you know, you're going to get
*  criticized for specific topics or, you know, specific people that are writing
*  books that may, you know, ruffle a bunch of people's feathers.
*  And I want to know what they think.
*  I want to know why they think the way they think.
*  I want to ask them questions.
*  And there's a lot of people that don't think you should do that.
*  And, you know, and they'll, they'll be the gatekeepers to your, the
*  infromu information that you take in and the conversations that you have
*  and you distribute and it's not good.
*  That's not like, if you talk to someone and it was a mistake, well, now you know,
*  but at least you know, you talk to them.
*  If someone tells you it's a mistake to talk to someone, but you want to talk to
*  them and then you start thinking, Oh, let me run it by Mike and the team.
*  And then the team will sit around and think about their mortgage.
*  They sit around and think about whether or not you could get in trouble.
*  And that could, that could eventually lead to them having a decrease in their
*  income and then they start to fucking play it safe.
*  I've seen that man.
*  I've seen that with standups.
*  I've seen that with people.
*  Like there's people that, you know, they have podcasts and they have a bunch of
*  people that are there at the studio, telling them to talk about different
*  things, telling them to pick different subjects, telling them let's move on.
*  Like I've seen that I've seen in the middle of a podcast, someone say, um,
*  let's, let's move on.
*  You guys are on this subject.
*  Let's move on.
*  Who the fuck are you?
*  Let's move on.
*  Some, some guy standing on the outside that gets some sneaky paycheck that he
*  doesn't really deserve is now saying, let's move on holding a clipboard as if
*  it like, like, what are you doing?
*  Get the fuck out of here.
*  It's two people talking.
*  And if they decide to move on, they'll move on.
*  But people that like, bring up this, bring up that, like bring up this.
*  Who are you?
*  Why are you here?
*  But that's what they do.
*  If you've ever gone to like, I went to, I did, um, what's that guy's name?
*  The, the sports guy, Bill Simmons.
*  I did his show on HBO.
*  He's a great guy, really interesting guy.
*  And I love the way he does his podcast, but I did his HBO show, dude.
*  And you're surrounded by people.
*  It's me and him sitting in the booth just like this, but there's fucking people
*  there and there's people there and there's people walking around the set.
*  It's distracting.
*  And there's people standing around.
*  They got notes and clipboards and there's camera people everywhere.
*  You're like, what?
*  This is not necessary.
*  Yeah.
*  You have a hundred people here or 20.
*  You have 20 people here.
*  You need one.
*  You need one person.
*  And then managing all of those people becomes a bigger priority
*  than actually the content.
*  And then you have inter office politics take place.
*  You have relationships with people.
*  I mean, not, not even, I don't mean relationships like boy, girl,
*  boy, boy, girl, girl.
*  I mean like boss friends and yeah.
*  And then weirdness egos, egos.
*  The boss got ego and then, oh, they, then they're mad at the, the talent
*  because the talent is getting more attention and then it's everyone's.
*  Yeah.
*  No one would have ever let me do this show.
*  They would have never.
*  Yeah.
*  No one would have ever let me.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's not by design that I did it this way.
*  It's not like I see what they don't see.
*  And I'm going to do this.
*  It's like, I didn't want to listen.
*  I was like, so get out of here.
*  Fuck off.
*  I'm going to do what I want to do.
*  You had that confidence in, and just straight up sort of, just sort of, you
*  didn't give a fuck and you just did it.
*  Where do you think that came from?
*  How do you think?
*  Fear factor money.
*  Right.
*  That helped.
*  Fuck you.
*  Fear factor.
*  I had a little bit of fear factor money in the bank where I'm like, if this
*  shit completely hits the fan, you know, I can just sort of live off of that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And also I don't, I've never been very good with the whole, uh, boss, someone
*  telling you what to do.
*  If I did that, if I was good with that, I would never become a standup.
*  I would have never done most of the things that I've done.
*  And I certainly would have no, no, thank you.
*  I'm good.
*  I certainly would have never been able to do the podcast this way.
*  If I brought people aboard and there was a certain point in time where people,
*  we were talking about it before the show, the people did want to come on board.
*  And then I started getting offers.
*  I've had offers where people wanted to buy half the podcast.
*  Yeah.
*  Like pretty generous amounts of money.
*  Yeah.
*  And I was like, this is not, I don't think this is wise.
*  This is not wise.
*  Yeah.
*  It get weird.
*  Spotify was the first offer where they came around.
*  They said, we don't want you to do anything different.
*  We just want to license the show.
*  How do you decide what you're going to ask people?
*  You just go on with the flow.
*  Do you research on stuff?
*  Cause I, I, I really loved some of the questions you asked Kanye.
*  I trying to remember what they were, but I mean, do you sort of plan in advance or
*  are you kind of just sort of.
*  Cause well with Kanye, we had talked about doing a podcast for a long
*  time, but I was worried that he was going to come off.
*  I remember your first question was why do you want to do this?
*  Right?
*  I just thought that was when he was running for president.
*  Yeah.
*  I thought it was such a great question.
*  Cause it's like, you know, why do you want to run for president?
*  But everybody would ask that question.
*  Yeah, but it was just, it was just right into it.
*  It was just great.
*  You know, well, I'm a fan of his music.
*  I've always been a fan of his music.
*  And I think that the way he communicates his sort of manic style of thinking and
*  constantly creating and doing things, it's why he's so successful.
*  I mean, that's the, this, this like stream of consciousness that he has is also why
*  he's so prolific as an artist.
*  Like, I mean, he is all of his albums are good.
*  He doesn't have a dud.
*  You know, you go from one album to the next and they're all like, he's got this stream
*  of creative ideas that are constantly running through his head and he talks
*  sometimes in these streams where they don't end.
*  He goes from one subject to the next subject.
*  And so I was curious as to like how I was going to talk to him.
*  And I wanted to make sure that we can do it in a way where other people are going
*  to appreciate there's a great value in the way he thinks.
*  And then if you get it in sound bites or you get it in some weird thing where he
*  says something and people get mad at him and they boom or something like that,
*  like you're missing who he really is, who he really is, is him all day.
*  It's not him in this 32nd chunk where you don't like what he said.
*  Guess what?
*  He probably doesn't like what he said either.
*  Okay.
*  He's fucking streaming.
*  He's just going, he's running with these thoughts and ideas, but that's also why
*  he can boil those thoughts and ideas down these amazing fucking songs.
*  You know, like this is, that's what I wanted to get out of him while we were
*  talking because people were trying to medicate him and people were trying to.
*  And I'm like, I don't, if you have a choice between this medicated,
*  overweight Kanye who doesn't get anything done or manic crazy Kanye,
*  he says wild shit.
*  You want manic crazy Kanye.
*  Cause manic crazy Kanye is the one who makes amazing music.
*  And I've been around him.
*  He's a nice guy, man.
*  He's a really genuinely nice guy.
*  And when the cameras are off, same thing.
*  He's a nice guy with all the staff and everybody.
*  He's cool.
*  Like he's genuinely cool.
*  But whatever you want to call mental illness, that's the problem.
*  It's like when you call it mental illness, well, well, you've got to give it medicine.
*  He's got mental illness.
*  You've got to give him medicine.
*  Do you really?
*  Because that mental illness is making some pretty amazing shit.
*  Right.
*  Like, look at his fucking catalog.
*  Look at all the music he's made.
*  That's all because of mental illness.
*  No, whatever you call an illness is a particular style of thinking that he has
*  that's sort of nonlinear and it's wild and it's all over the place, but it's also very focused.
*  I found in that interview though, that, you know, I've seen him interviewed quite a bit,
*  but that was one where everything he said made a lot of sense.
*  He's certainly done a lot of,
*  put a lot of thought into a lot of the stuff he was talking about with everything from,
*  you know, reorganizing the way civilization works.
*  I mean, it takes a little bit of thinking to come up with how to reorganize the entire way civilization works.
*  But that was one of the things that I thought was really good about the interviews.
*  You do get a chance to see, like, this is not just a crazy person who buys his own bullshit.
*  And by the way, when he's like the braggy stuff that he kind of does and talks about himself,
*  first of all, he's being honest about where he is.
*  He's sort of reaffirming who he is, but also he jokes around.
*  Like he was joking around about it.
*  He was showing us this video that he had made for his wife, for his wife's birthday.
*  And it was really emotional. It was very beautiful because he made a hologram of her dad.
*  And he wrote the script for all this.
*  Oh, he did?
*  Yeah. And he wrote the script for all the things that the hologram was telling her.
*  It's really intense.
*  And you know, you can do that now.
*  Like they can take your voice and for you and I would be easy for them to do it because there's hours and hours and hours of us talking.
*  So they would take this voice.
*  God, can you imagine what they could do?
*  They already have.
*  There's they've they used me as an example for one of these companies in Canada.
*  They used me as an example for how well this deep fake technology works because there's 1500 fucking plus podcasts of me that are three hours long.
*  So you take these these sounds that come out of my mouth and then you can make me say anything, literally anything because every noise that I'm capable of making I've made.
*  Right.
*  So you use this catalog of sounds that my voice can make.
*  And that's what he also did with that hologram.
*  Because, you know, Robert Kardashian, there's all the cases and all the different times he's been interviewed on television.
*  There's a great catalog of his voice and you can have him speak to her.
*  Yeah.
*  But even in then, like he has him say that, you know, and your genius, genius husband.
*  But he was laughing when he said it and showed it to us.
*  He was laughing.
*  He thought it was funny that he had them.
*  Yeah.
*  He had Robert Kardashian call him a genius, amazing, genius husband.
*  He thought it was funny.
*  Like he's not just it's not just ego.
*  It's not just crazy.
*  It's also there's brilliance there.
*  He's a complicated person.
*  It's nice to hear that because, like, you know, it's interesting.
*  I don't know how the media can sort of reframe a person.
*  Right.
*  And they take away nuance.
*  Yeah.
*  People are nuanced, man.
*  People are really complicated.
*  You decide to decide that a person is this person because of one sentence they said one
*  time or because of one thing that they did where they maybe wish they didn't or because
*  of one concert they did where people booed them or whatever.
*  Whatever you pick about Kanye that people decide he's this.
*  People just love to put someone in a box and categorize them and just decide that they
*  want to dismiss them.
*  And this is the problem with cancel culture.
*  Right.
*  It's like we have this idea of of things where we want to boil them down to almost a tweet,
*  you know, things that are like enormously complicated.
*  A man who's lived 40 plus years of his life and in that life has experienced heartbreak
*  and sorrow and success and failure and friendship and betrayal and all these different
*  things and all the creative passions that you've poured out into your work and they
*  want to just boil you down to a sentence or two.
*  And it's crazy.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's crazy for the person doing that and trying to boil someone down.
*  It's crazy for people to read it and accept it.
*  It's so negative.
*  It's one of the most negative things about social media is that we want to categorize
*  someone by individual tweets or individual statements.
*  People are fucking immensely complex, immensely complex.
*  And to deny that, to deny that is it's it's very disingenuous.
*  It's dishonest.
*  It's bad for our understanding of us.
*  It's bad for our understanding of who we are personally as a human.
*  When when someone decides to define you based on a sentence or call you, they know Tom
*  Green is just a bump a bump a bump.
*  And then you read it, you're like, oh, shit, I am.
*  Yeah.
*  But like we were talking about, I don't believe it.
*  Well, that's why the comments are negative.
*  You know, when you're reading comments, you read one person's typed out thing that's
*  negative about you and you're saying like, oh, I can't help myself.
*  Like, oh, yeah, that that is all up.
*  There's a real issue with the way human beings are taking in other people's opinions.
*  It's not that there's anything wrong with taking in people's opinions, but people's
*  opinions are supposed to be shared like this.
*  But you and I are sharing opinions like you tell me something and I tell you something
*  and I say, did you mean this?
*  And you're like, no, no, I meant that.
*  And you're like, oh, OK.
*  Also, you think that you're like, yeah.
*  And then we're like, oh, then we get each other.
*  We're talking. But it's an exchange.
*  It's very rare that you can just nail something with a sentence or two.
*  And also, there's not you're not limited by time as in normal television.
*  There's oh, we've got seven minutes before the commercial break.
*  So we've got to get to this and this and this.
*  And then you never really end up talking about anything.
*  That's been the best part about podcasting without a boss is that no one has ever told me.
*  Like it has to be 45 minutes long.
*  It has to be in here and let's edit out the parts that weren't as good.
*  Let's chop this up and make that like.
*  Why? Yeah, why?
*  So are you going to go back to L.A. at all?
*  Are you going to keep the studio there?
*  I'm going to fly over it in a plane when it's on fire.
*  You're not going to have what about the comedy story?
*  When Gavin Newsom donate, when he detonates the nuclear weapon that he has under his his death.
*  What about stand up?
*  Because they decide that they're going to kick him out of office.
*  It's going to have a suicide vest on.
*  Yeah, I do miss the comedy store, but the comedy store is not the comedy store anymore.
*  It's not open. Right.
*  But when it opens up again, you're going to if it's if is the word.
*  L.A. is on a 10 p.m. curfew now.
*  You know why? Because Covid has a Betty by time.
*  Covid after 10 p.m., it comes out and it attacks people.
*  But before 10 p.m., we got vaccine coming right when the vaccine next year, it'll open up again.
*  And why 10 p.m. That's so arbitrary.
*  You tell me you can't catch Covid between six and 10.
*  Look, there's going to be some sort of a thing that happens after 10.
*  People are more vulnerable.
*  They get drunk and put your guard down.
*  It's nonsense, man. It's nonsense.
*  These fucking assholes are imposing rules on people that close their businesses down.
*  You still drinking on the show? You want to drink? Sure.
*  That's what you want? OK.
*  I'll have one. Yeah. Am I getting you nervous?
*  All this crazy talk of Covid?
*  No, you just mentioned alcohol and I thought, hey, you still drinking on the show?
*  Yeah, we can have some booze sort of.
*  Jamie, let's get us some whiskey, some Texas whiskey and some glasses.
*  No ice. We're going like men today. No ice. Fuck it.
*  What kind of whiskey you drinking here in Texas? Whatever we have.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You have a favorite?
*  I've been drinking Bushmills.
*  That's good stuff. I like Buffalo Trace.
*  Oh, yeah, we had that last time. It's a sponsor.
*  And they've been around since before America started.
*  Ah, OK. They've been around since 1773.
*  I see. And it's really good.
*  They won like Whiskey Maker of the Year 2020.
*  Yeah. Bushmills is my grandfather's Irish heritage.
*  You know, real shit. Northern Northern Ireland. So, you know,
*  my friend Josh Barnett has a great whiskey as well.
*  God damn it. I don't have a bottle here.
*  I'm trying to remember the name of it. It's like War Master.
*  It's like a smoky whiskey. It's very good.
*  He brought it last time he was on the podcast.
*  Yeah, I drink I drink in Scotch to Balvini Scotch.
*  I like so much.
*  You're getting hammered out there in the woods by yourself.
*  In the woods. I don't have the Balvini in the woods.
*  I bring me. I got a lot of mini bottles like airplane bottles.
*  Oh, I got a fridge full of those. Do you? Yeah.
*  Why don't you just have a big bottle and glass once you open it?
*  You know, you don't really want to open bottle of booze in your van.
*  We drive around.
*  So you just drink them one at a time and then you have an open container.
*  And that's my idea. I came up. Oh, that's right.
*  You can't have an open container in a car.
*  Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
*  Yeah, exactly. So I just got a bunch of little ones.
*  That's right. Quite smart, sir.
*  So it's a healthy pour on my friend. So my brother.
*  Thank you. Come on.
*  We're in Texas.
*  This is still Austin straight bourbon whiskey.
*  Local stuff. Oh, legit. Right.
*  Very nice. Yeah. Very good.
*  Whoa. Bourbon.
*  That's this. I don't drink alone.
*  That's corn, right? Bourbon is corn.
*  Yeah, I don't drink alone.
*  So, you know, no, I'm a social drinker.
*  I don't think I ever do.
*  I guess. But yeah, I smoke weed alone, though.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  But I like to do that before I write. Yeah.
*  Yeah, I heard Carlin talk about that.
*  I mean, red or something.
*  He talked about how he let me get this right.
*  I get it. He wrote first and then he would write to polish
*  one he would drink and when he would drink,
*  when he was coming up with ideas and he would polish it up with some weed,
*  I think. Oh, really?
*  Or maybe it was the other way around. But yeah, he definitely would
*  punch it up with with pot.
*  He said he would smoke pot and then punch up the material.
*  It's interesting. Like, how are you supposed to write totally straight?
*  You know, I write in the morning a lot.
*  Totally straight. Right.
*  Yes. You're kind of got that energy.
*  But I get a lot of times they're just it's just a scaffolding,
*  just a framework and then pots like I got an idea.
*  Then I smoked the weed and the weeds like I got an idea.
*  Yeah, I feel like it's cheating sometimes
*  because the ideas aren't really mine.
*  They're the weeds ideas.
*  The weed is like, listen, no, it's just relaxing your mind
*  and taking you away from your distractions and allowing you to just kind of relax
*  and think of things that you might not have thought of if you were distracted
*  by all the seriousness of life. Right.
*  I think it's more complicated than that.
*  I think your body is interacting with molecules
*  that it doesn't come in contact with in the regular world.
*  And these molecules have a spiritual connection to the universe
*  that you're not able to access without them.
*  That's what I really believe.
*  Wait, say that again.
*  I think the molecules of marijuana in particular, when you smoke pot
*  and you just get this, there's a there's a connection
*  that you get with the universe that's not available when you're sober.
*  Right. When you're when you're sober, I think that your feelings are
*  in some ways deadened.
*  They're deadened by an accumulation of life experience
*  and overwhelming burden of your existence and your friends
*  and your bills and your obligations and your life.
*  There's all these things going on and all these things sort of like
*  squash and deaden your sensitivity.
*  And then. Yeah.
*  And then everything just
*  whoa, everything opens up and then you have access to thoughts
*  and ideas and feelings that you're just not available without the weed.
*  Right. Yeah, absolutely.
*  It's it's a beautiful thing.
*  That's a beautiful thing.
*  Yeah, I remember the first time I was on your show.
*  How many years ago was that at your old house?
*  Wow. I think that's back in the day.
*  I think we were pretty high for that one.
*  I think we got too high a lot of times for those shows.
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's right.
*  And you'll just last time I was here, I was like, oh,
*  I don't really like to smoke when I do the thing because I kind of get quiet.
*  You know, get nervous.
*  We were talking about the election yesterday and I got I did it with Don Allen
*  and Dave Chappelle come on. I got way too high.
*  I'm trying to think of what I really think about the election while I'm doing it. Yeah.
*  Like on one hand, I'm like, I hope people are more relaxed.
*  Like the people that hated Trump, I hope that they're more relaxed
*  and I hope everybody just like maybe maybe the country can heal together.
*  But the other side, like the people that think that Trump got robbed, like they're angry.
*  And it's like it's almost like people are more separated than ever before.
*  And, you know, and there's a lot of people that like there was no election interference.
*  There was no election fraud.
*  I'm like, I think there's always election fraud.
*  Always. The question is, how much of it is there?
*  Have you dealing with hundreds of thousands of workers?
*  Like we were talking about it yesterday.
*  Like, what is the number of election fraud?
*  Is it what's the percentage? It's not zero.
*  Is it more than zero? Most people think it's more than zero.
*  Yes. Like, so what's the number?
*  Is it only like a thousand episodes of fraud in the whole country
*  over millions and millions and millions of votes?
*  And it's really non, you know, in terms of like the overall effect.
*  It's it's quite possibly it's that.
*  Yeah. In my opinion, I don't I don't know.
*  I mean, I just I haven't done anything to research it,
*  so I wouldn't be able to tell you for sure.
*  But I just worry about the state of the country in terms of like this
*  polarization between the two sides, the red versus the blue,
*  because I think it's mostly bullshit.
*  I think mostly people are just Americans and we need to just like whoever is in office.
*  Now, let's just like let's support them and hope they do the best.
*  Because one of the things we were saying yesterday was that
*  I feel like when Trump was in office, people literally wanted the economy to tank.
*  So that he would be a loser.
*  They wanted things to go bad because they didn't want him to do well.
*  They would rat like I was saying, if you gave a lot of hardcore people
*  that were Trump haters the choice, would you rather have the country do
*  fantastic and have Trump's all of his ideas
*  turn out to be the best for our our culture, our economy, joblessness, everything.
*  Everything's doing great.
*  But he's bragging these on TV.
*  Or would you rather have everything tank and he goes to jail?
*  Fuck him. Put him in jail.
*  I think there's a lot of people that would say that they would rather the economy
*  go to shit and Trump wound up getting put in jail and removed from office
*  than him being a winner and being successful.
*  It's very strange because he's such a polarizing figure that we
*  we would rather him fail.
*  And then the United States, not we, some people would rather him
*  fail and the United States be in a real bad situation than him kick ass
*  and do amazing in the United States, booming.
*  But this asshole that you hate is like the hero.
*  What you do here is amazing because you have this sort of very
*  broad audience of people on both sides on your show.
*  And you have found a way to, I guess,
*  not polarize it so badly that half the people don't want to
*  pay attention. I don't think we do have two sides.
*  You don't. I think it's a lie.
*  I think we have America.
*  I think we have, you know, we're saying that somebody wanted to write
*  something about you, like a negative comment about you on YouTube.
*  I like that, by the way, that you don't have two sides.
*  I like that because I've been thinking a lot about that lately because I've been
*  I've been, you know, I don't know if you can see in some of the videos.
*  I became I got my U.S. citizenship last year.
*  I think I told you that. Yeah.
*  Well, they let me in after 20 years.
*  But but so, you know, I got my U.S.
*  flag that I hang from my awning in my videos and beautiful.
*  It's a beautiful thing. You're out there.
*  And part of what I've been doing with, you know, my photos and my
*  podcast and my traveling is I really part of what it is, is I just want to show
*  my little audience at this time that's tuning in.
*  I want to show them how much there is to celebrate in this country.
*  It's beautiful out there. Yeah. So beautiful.
*  It's rare to people don't go out there.
*  So it's beautiful. Yeah.
*  Believe it. So, you know, I'm I'm I'm flying the flag.
*  I'm very proud to be an American. Right.
*  I am very proud to be an American.
*  I'm proud to be an American.
*  Well, at least I know I'm free.
*  All right. Right. Yeah.
*  I am. I am. And I'm also proud to be Canadian.
*  I was getting a little grief. Save that.
*  Save that. You were doing great.
*  I put a little Canada.
*  I've said in Canada that I think countries countries are bullshit.
*  I think you guys are basically northern Americans.
*  I got mad. I go, we're all North America.
*  Yeah. You go. You're Canada.
*  I go. This is no different to me than being from fucking South Dakota.
*  Come on. We're all humans on Earth.
*  I agree with this nonsense. Yeah.
*  You just have a different king. Yeah. Yeah.
*  But no, it's it's it's it's it's interesting because, you know, I,
*  you know, everybody on social media has to kind of,
*  you know, if you're putting information out there,
*  you end up now having to deal with
*  getting drawn into this argument, which is frustrating to someone like me
*  because, you know, I just want to take some cool pictures and tell some jokes
*  and have some fun.
*  And all of a sudden, oh, I said something that indicated I believe this or that.
*  And you're everyone's mad at you.
*  So, I mean, I find it pretty incredible how you've found a way of navigating that.
*  Well, I don't know how I did it.
*  I mean, I think being honest is one of them.
*  And then also, I don't believe in the two sides.
*  I share a lot of opinions from both sides.
*  Like, I do not have an ideology that is neatly tucked into the left or the right.
*  Well, didn't you endorse Bernie?
*  Yeah, I love. So I love all of his ideas about helping community.
*  And I think this is a problem.
*  This is a problem that people that think of themselves as right wing don't
*  they don't want to look at the good aspects of someone from the left.
*  Someone from the left like Bernie, first of all, he wants to absolve people
*  of student debt.
*  I think if it's possible to spend trillions of dollars in these never ending wars,
*  it's also possible to absolve people of student debt.
*  I think getting people in debt for hundreds of thousands of dollars
*  when you're fucking 17 is crazy.
*  Exactly. When I was 17, I was a wild person.
*  I was barely a man.
*  I was I was crazy.
*  And for 17, 18 years old to have a person like me and give them
*  saddle them down with hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt
*  is going to follow them to their grave is crazy.
*  And that's a giant percentage of our population.
*  I don't know what it is, but millions of people are saddled down with that kind of debt.
*  Right. It's too much money.
*  And it's crazy. And it doesn't make any sense.
*  Education could be something that we make for free.
*  I think we can use our tax money in better ways
*  that benefit the community as a whole.
*  And I think one of them is by giving people the access to education
*  where it doesn't cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Right.
*  Well, I think we could do that.
*  Like in Canada, that is a left wing perspective.
*  Right. Yeah. But I also like guns.
*  And I think you should have guns.
*  And I think I'm a firm supporter of the Second Amendment because I know crazy people.
*  And there's people that are bad people.
*  They're violent and they're broken and they want to hurt other people.
*  And I think you should be able to protect your family. Yeah.
*  And I think you should be able to protect the loved ones that you have nearby you.
*  And this is a this is a real situation that comes up.
*  We wish it didn't.
*  Everybody that has a gun hopes they go to their grave
*  and never have to pull the trigger on a person. Yeah.
*  But but but guess what?
*  Better to have it and not to need it than to need it and not to have it.
*  Absolutely. Now, we can pretend all day that the world is a perfect place.
*  And you're never going to need a gun.
*  But you and I both know that's horseshit. Yeah. Right.
*  So this is a that's an opinion I share on the right.
*  I'm a I'm a firm believer in the Second Amendment. Yeah.
*  And then you get the First Amendment.
*  I would think freedom of expression and freedom of speech is one of the most
*  liberal core tenants that you could you could ever ascribe to that side.
*  Like the left has always been pro First Amendment.
*  The ACLU literally started out defending fucking Nazis, right?
*  Like saying that, like you have to defend everyone's ability to express themselves,
*  even if their their beliefs are abhorrent,
*  even if they're the most disgusting beliefs in the world.
*  Your ability to express yourself should be a part of being an American.
*  And the way we combat bad speech is not by silencing people,
*  it's by better speech and more speech.
*  And that's that's how we've figured out the way human beings
*  interact with each other from the jump, from the beginning of this country.
*  And so that right there is sort of like what we were talking about earlier
*  when we were talking about how you had the confidence and autonomy
*  with your show to do what you want to do and what you believe.
*  Politically, that's what you've also done, too.
*  You know, you like this, you like that.
*  These are things that are on obsidents.
*  Why is why do these why do these issues
*  just get divided so clearly divided and where it's like, well,
*  I can't want health care and a shotgun.
*  Right. Come on. Right.
*  I kind of like like not having to worry about getting sick.
*  And also, I want to go hunting.
*  I mean, what's the what's the fucking deal?
*  You know, I can't 100 percent. Right.
*  I couldn't agree with you.
*  Because you had the confidence and autonomy to be able to just say it
*  because you didn't have all those people around with the clipboards and shits.
*  I don't say that because we're on this channel or that channel.
*  And this is our message here.
*  That's a lot of it. Right.
*  And it's also that I don't need a job.
*  I don't need I think one of the things and you can speak to this. Right.
*  When you're working in Hollywood, you're always wanting to make sure
*  that you're not saying anything that's going to exclude you from being hired.
*  Yeah. Right.
*  Like the if you if you want to work in television, you must be liberal.
*  Yeah, you must.
*  Or you keep your fucking mouth shut.
*  Yeah. If you want to get a job on television, like you don't really have many.
*  You can't be a right wing pundit on the side and also work on a sitcom.
*  They don't want you. Right. Right.
*  Or can you be down the middle, though?
*  Like you're down the middle, right?
*  You're not a right wing pundit.
*  You're not a left wing guy.
*  Can you can you can be down the maybe but even then, they'll be upset at you.
*  That is contrary to what they believe.
*  And then and then then you're in trouble.
*  You can be. Yeah, you can be.
*  I mean, it really depends on how how open minded the people
*  and how desperate the people are that are hiring you.
*  Like people get desperate.
*  They get they get panicky.
*  You know, they feel like
*  people get attacked for almost nothing.
*  And then they fire them, you know, because they don't want blowback.
*  This is a this a big part of the whole Hollywood experience now.
*  Like who was it wasn't Natalie Portman?
*  Who was the actress that got in trouble because she play in witches?
*  They were mad at her because she played a witch with three fingers.
*  Like, who is it?
*  It's a new movie.
*  It's so dumb. She apologized.
*  She literally had to apologize.
*  Why? Anne Hathaway. Thank you.
*  Why? Because because she played.
*  It's in the book, the original book, right?
*  Would describe this witch.
*  Here it is.
*  Anne Hathaway apologizes for a portrayal of limb difference.
*  Limb difference.
*  I and Hathaway has issued an apology for the pain
*  caused to people with limb differences by her character in HBO Max movie.
*  The witches. Yeah.
*  Based on the Roald Dahl adaptation,
*  Hathaway portrays the evil Grand High witch who has three fingers
*  on each hand that resemble the congenital disorder.
*  I don't know what that is.
*  It's a hard word.
*  Ectrodacty. It's an impossible word to say.
*  Ectrodactyly. That word is impossible to say.
*  They need to come up with an easier word for that.
*  It's it's crazy.
*  People are looking for people for things to be offended by.
*  And this is this is this is but Anne Hathaway should have said.
*  I played a witch.
*  Yeah, that witch had three fingers.
*  Yeah. I mean, no offense to you.
*  Yeah, it's like no need to apologize.
*  And if you want an apology from that, you you're probably a fucking asshole.
*  And, you know, I'm sorry if you have three fingers.
*  I mean, I'm sorry if you have a disease that resembles that.
*  There may be some benefits to that, too.
*  I don't know what they would be, but what would they be?
*  So that was probably we could probably try to come up with.
*  We could probably try to come up with some funny benefits to that.
*  That's her character, Jamie.
*  Listen, I sort of understand what it's like when you have something like that,
*  you know, because I have one testicle, right?
*  So, you know, people will sometimes like make a joke about that.
*  And I'll go I'll feel like, oh, sorry, because you have to one test.
*  Yeah, because I had that testicular cancer. Right.
*  And then someone will make a joke about it.
*  Ah, you know, and then I'll be like, oh, geez, right.
*  It's not that fun having, you know, having surgery and having one of your testicles.
*  Sorry. Not trying to bring it down here, Joe.
*  But I'm just saying so it's like what happens now is the the Internet.
*  The Internet sort of now one person
*  with three fingers is, you know, obviously saddened by that.
*  It might not even be real.
*  It might be it might be someone looks at her and goes, you know what?
*  I think she should apologize for people that don't have all their fingers.
*  And they get mad. It might be someone with five fingers.
*  It's saying this. Exactly.
*  Someone with five fingers assumes the three fingered person is offended.
*  Tweets it. Exactly.
*  And then the people with the clipboards at the office have to react.
*  They're going to get canceled.
*  There's a there's a there's a retraction statement from Anne Hathaway.
*  Meanwhile, it's actually probably good for the movie.
*  Yeah. Right. Because now people I heard about it from my mom
*  because my mom recommended it to my daughters.
*  She's like, I think they wouldn't enjoy this movie.
*  Now, if they'd just given her 17 fingers or like 10 fingers.
*  Right. No one's got that.
*  So no one would have been offended. Right.
*  Like that would have been weird anyways.
*  Like a fucking like a like a garden rake. Yeah.
*  Ten fingers on each hand.
*  No one's offended.
*  There's no condition where you got ten fingers on each hand.
*  Too few that people get upset.
*  And now are we going to get in trouble for sort of giggling about this?
*  I don't know.
*  What if you have three arms on each side with people who worship Shiva?
*  Get upset at you. Yeah, exactly.
*  Which is very what I love the.
*  Presence of Ganesh, all of this.
*  Remover of obstacles.
*  Is that what? Yeah.
*  What's up, Jamie?
*  I'm reading an article talking to someone that seems like they were on the upset
*  side and it says that it seems like they're more mad that the character
*  has this disability and they're also a villain.
*  Not just that they have the disability, it's that they made them bad.
*  Well, isn't the character like not a human? It's a witch.
*  Yeah. They have fucked up teeth and they're bald
*  and people are mad that they're bald also. Oh, me too.
*  So I forgot I'm mad now.
*  I'm bald. Yeah, I'm pissed.
*  I don't like when people make fun of bald people, Tom.
*  It's not right. Oh, really? It's rude.
*  I am bald and I am mad.
*  And Hathaway's bald in that movie. Fuck her.
*  You think it's funny being bald?
*  Do you get mad about it? No, no, not at all.
*  You don't give a fuck. I have a good shaped head.
*  I'm super lucky.
*  I don't have a flat flat back of my head.
*  She's kind of hot as a bald chick.
*  I dated a bald chick when I first moved to L.A.
*  She was a singer from.
*  You got like a good bald head, though. Thank you.
*  Like not everybody does.
*  Not everybody does.
*  You got like a lot of people with weird heads.
*  You got a good bald head.
*  Like it's like almost like it's almost like
*  it's supposed to be bald.
*  It's almost if you if you had a full head of hair,
*  you'd be better off to shave it.
*  Oh, I tell you right now, you ever think about when you had perfect?
*  You know, I should shave it. It looks better.
*  Well, I do think that back when I was really freaking out
*  that I was losing my hair, I should have shaved my head early on.
*  But I was really worried that I would never get work.
*  You know, that's freak out when.
*  Yeah, I got hair transplants.
*  I use minoxidil. I did the whole thing.
*  I have a stupid scar in the back of my head, like a big smile
*  from hair transplants from the 90s, because I was in choke.
*  I was all of a sudden working and I was like, Oh, my God, my hair's falling out.
*  Fuck. What am I going to do?
*  And I was thinking I got to do everything I can to keep working
*  because all of a sudden I was making all this money.
*  I was never making before I was on television and
*  that TV hair. Yeah, you need TV hair.
*  And then once I shaved my head, I was like, Oh, my God, this is the best thing ever.
*  Like I don't have to ever go to a barber.
*  Oh, I just every couple of days, they're like,
*  they hit it with the buzzers and then I'm good.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Well, mine's thinning, you know, so you can shave that bitch.
*  We're going to do. I don't know.
*  It's getting a little crazy.
*  But you kind of look good as like a wild, crazy man
*  with the hair all fucked up.
*  I like it. I like your hair like that.
*  It's getting a little crazy.
*  You you can like get by with your hair all fucked up.
*  You look good with like as a guy who has like a sock hat,
*  who takes it off and steps into the restaurant on a cold day
*  and sits near the fireplace with all fucked up hair.
*  It's kind of good. It works.
*  I like having the headphones on.
*  I made a choice not to put them on earlier because I thought, Oh, well,
*  you had your cowboy hat on. Yeah, but but but this is better.
*  I like this.
*  It it locks you in.
*  Like you always say, well, you're right across from someone.
*  Why do you wear headphones?
*  The reason why is that it locks you 100 percent in the conversation
*  and you're really aware of talking over each other, which, yeah,
*  everyone has a tendency to do.
*  I was conscious of it, but I've done enough of this over the years.
*  I knew to play the mic right.
*  But I was missing this this part of it.
*  Yeah, you know what?
*  Like when people don't want to wear the headphones, I'm always like, hmm.
*  OK, I did want to wear them, but I also didn't want to take off my cowboy hat
*  right away because we're in Austin.
*  We're wearing that around.
*  You all I saw your videos.
*  There's dust on it. You know, it's real dust.
*  I got that. I got this at the Stetson factory about five years ago.
*  And it's a real Texas hat.
*  So, you know, I wanted to.
*  It's John B. Stetson.
*  I debated not wearing it when I came in because I thought, oh,
*  walking with a cowboy hat on it.
*  I said, you know, but but then I thought, you know, shit, we're in Austin.
*  You know, I got to got to honor your move to Austin.
*  Where my friggin Stetson.
*  God damn it. Right.
*  Cheers. Cheers. My friend.
*  Excuse my language. Sorry. But no.
*  Thirteen silver dollars by culture culture wall.
*  Talks about having a John B. Stetson.
*  Wakes up in the snow in a ditch.
*  I got my health. My John B. Stetson got me a bottle for a baby's bluebird wine.
*  Hmm. And I look up.
*  I left my stash somewhere down in Preston, along with 13 silver dollars in my mind.
*  Nice. You ever heard of culture wall?
*  I have. I've not. We'll play some after the show.
*  Oh, I wish. What?
*  That's right. He's Canadian.
*  Yeah. And Jamie turned me on to him.
*  Jamie is my source because I'm an old man and Jamie's a younger man.
*  Jamie turns me on to good music.
*  Oh, culture wall. It's a singer. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I was beautiful. Poetry.
*  I thought it was a poet or.
*  Dude, he's he's a guy that.
*  Like a Leonard Cohen, who's also Canadian.
*  He's he was 21 and he has this song called Kate McKannon.
*  And you listen to it.
*  You would swear to God is an 80 year old man
*  who's been drinking and smoking his whole life.
*  It literally doesn't make any sense.
*  Like you hear the song and you're like, what the fuck?
*  I wish we could play it.
*  Oh, that's him. Oh, young, young guy.
*  Yeah. Oh, young as fuck.
*  Here's the. OK, OK. Want to hear something crazy?
*  I feel better about not having heard of him.
*  I thought he was like some classic Canadian artist that has been around for 100 years.
*  Oh, no, no, no. Where's how did that?
*  But but now I'm glad that you're showing me this.
*  Want to hear authentic? This cat is. I love this.
*  We try to get him on the show.
*  We contacted his agent.
*  This is what the agent said.
*  He works as a ranch hand in Texas.
*  Over the summer. Damn.
*  And when he's done, we'll get a hold of you.
*  I bet he's from Calgary.
*  He's from Alberta, Alberta.
*  Yeah, Calgary, Alberta, because that's where that's where we got the Alberta.
*  Canada is like the Texas of Canada.
*  Yeah, Calgary, Stampede.
*  And so I was right. He's yeah.
*  Yeah, he's a cowboy, Canadian cowboy.
*  Shout out to my friend, John and Jen, that my friends, John and Jen live up there.
*  Yeah, Alberta. That's cool.
*  I love Alberta.
*  It's great. Saskatchewan. There he is.
*  Yeah. Oh, wow.
*  He's from Swift. You know what? That's cool.
*  I'm from Swift, current Saskatchewan.
*  He's only 25 now.
*  My grandparents met in Swift, current Saskatchewan on my father's side.
*  That's a tiny little place. How they meet.
*  I don't know that story.
*  I think everybody knew everybody in Swift, current back in the early.
*  It was probably 20 people living there at the time.
*  But this guy comes down to Texas in the summer and he works as a ranch hand.
*  Yeah, summer.
*  And then they're like, he's not going to be done anytime soon.
*  This is like literally like you try to get in touch with them for like publicity.
*  We were blowing them up. I blew blew him up on Instagram.
*  When I had when Donald Trump asked me to host a podcast with him and Joe Biden,
*  I put it on my Instagram and with with his tweet and the Colter Walls lyrics.
*  For the The Devil Wears a Suit and Tie, I put a quote from one of his lyrics
*  and just threw it up there. Oh, it's his lyrics.
*  Left it like that. Yeah.
*  Just just just for just so people would listen to the songs.
*  So when an up and coming artist is he up and coming artist?
*  Oh, yeah. When an up and coming artist
*  says they can't come on the Joe Rogan Experience,
*  the biggest podcast in all of the world.
*  That must just make you want him to come on this show so much.
*  Unless you must make you like him so much more.
*  I appreciate it.
*  Man, he's got the same fucking.
*  I love his music, but I love authenticity.
*  Right. So if that's who he is.
*  Literally a ranch hand. He doesn't have time.
*  He's tending to the cattle like look, whenever he wants to, he's he can come here.
*  This is like, yeah, come on.
*  Have some more, baby. Let's do it.
*  Like Dave Chappelle came on yesterday.
*  Dave Chappelle and I have been friends since. Oh, really?
*  1990. Dave was here yesterday. Yeah.
*  Wow. I've never met Dave.
*  But he's always like, Joe, eventually I'm going to come on your show.
*  Eventually. Was that the first time he was on? Yeah.
*  And he came on because Donnell was here and he just dropped in and hung out for,
*  what was it, like an hour? Yeah.
*  And then we're eventually.
*  I shouldn't probably say this on the show, but I'm going to anyway,
*  because we've been drinking.
*  We're going to Dave and I are going to do a residence here. Yeah.
*  Yeah. We're going to do a bunch of shows here. Oh, really? Yeah.
*  Could I do a spot?
*  Come into five minutes or something. Fuck. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Oh, my God. Yeah.
*  I would love to. Fuck. Yeah.
*  I've never met Dave. He's a great guy. You'd love him.
*  Love to meet him. He's super genuine. Yeah.
*  He's as genuine as it gets. He's right there.
*  He's he's there's no bullshit with him. He's right there.
*  He's right there with you.
*  But that's the same thing.
*  Like, Mike, whenever you ready, I'm here.
*  You know, like the Kanye West things like it was almost the opposite.
*  I was like, I like him too much.
*  I don't want to fuck him up.
*  I don't want him to like he was like
*  when the first time he wanted to come on the podcast, it was he was
*  recently unmedicated, like he had done this concert
*  where he said he supported Donald Trump and everybody booed him.
*  And the next thing you know, he's in a mental institution.
*  Remember that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right.
*  He was on that's concert. Yeah.
*  Of them is and then concert a while after that.
*  He said he wanted to.
*  He wanted to he wanted to talk about things, but nobody wanted to do it.
*  Or people were afraid to have him on.
*  And I said, I'd be willing. I put on Twitter.
*  I wouldn't have you on.
*  And we could talk about whatever you want for as long as you want to.
*  And then it became this giant thing.
*  And then him and I had a conversation on the phone.
*  And I really enjoyed talking to him.
*  But my hesitation was purely that I didn't want to fuck him over
*  because I do think he's I mean, for lack of a better term,
*  I think he's a special person.
*  I think he's a he's there's a rare diamond, right?
*  Like, it's it's hard to make a Kanye West.
*  It's like there's a few people that I know like that,
*  like Joey Diaz, it's hard to make a Joey Diaz.
*  You don't get a lot of Joey Diaz's in this life.
*  You get one or two ever.
*  And when I see a person like Kanye and I see how sensitive he is
*  and I see all these people that are trying to chop him down all the time
*  and I made fun of his fucking sneakers, I mean, Jamie,
*  Jamie gave me a pair of Yeezy's and I was making fun of him.
*  But I make fun of everything. I make fun of me, too.
*  Mm hmm. But I was like, I don't want this guy to have a bad time.
*  So I resisted having him on. Really?
*  Yeah. Even though I knew it would be a big show, like ratings wise,
*  I'm like, I don't want this guy to say something where people get mad at him.
*  And I would rather him just making music.
*  And I really got into his music like pretty pretty deep after.
*  I mean, I always loved to shit like Gold Digger's classic.
*  I always love a lot of his shit all day.
*  He's got some classic shit, right?
*  But after he did after he and I had that conversation, I really got into it.
*  And I was like, man, I don't want anything.
*  I don't want this to be negative.
*  And then I started getting messages from his people.
*  And even some of his people actually got in contact with my wife and like,
*  we don't want Kanye to say anything crazy and having it ruin him.
*  And and I was like, let's just leave it alone.
*  Is your wife involved with producing the show? Zero.
*  How did they get in contact?
*  She knows somebody who knows somebody who knows somebody.
*  It's like a multi chain step.
*  Yeah, it wasn't even but it was like I was like, all right, let's just leave it alone.
*  Yeah, I'm just going to enjoy his music.
*  I'm like, just let Kanye be Kanye.
*  And then when he was running for president and then he was
*  and then he reached out to me a bunch and he's like, and I'm like, all right,
*  let's just do it. And then he and I had a conversation on the phone
*  and he sounded like super stable and and well, I think creative.
*  You you accomplish what you set out to do because I thought he was
*  and I felt that I saw a side of him that I've never seen
*  because he really was able to have the time and space to say what was on his mind.
*  He seemed to be in a very good place on your show.
*  Like he was I've seen him on TMZ and stuff kind of like scattered, but he was great.
*  And I'm a huge fan because I think he knows that I respect him.
*  Yeah. Yeah. So he felt comfortable.
*  Sometimes you see he's got a little bit of a wall up.
*  Right, right, right. Right.
*  It's like waiting for this attack.
*  Yeah. Right. He knew there's no attack coming for me.
*  So I think that helped.
*  He knows I love his music and he knows I think he's a unique human.
*  He's a unique human.
*  There's a lot of people. I love hip hop because I know I saw you
*  tweeted something about Gangstar recently.
*  Love Gangstar. Gangstar.
*  Dude, I didn't know Joe like Gangstar. Oh, my God. Yeah.
*  Because, you know, when I was a kid, I was a rapper and I made rap music and stuff
*  and I made beats. I still make beats.
*  But I like just doing it.
*  But I Gangstar, man, like that was, you know, back in the guru step in the arena.
*  You know, I was so bummed out when Guru died.
*  Yeah, that was a bummer.
*  But I'm a big fan of DJ Premier.
*  Yeah, I'm a big fan of a lot of that East Coast.
*  Yeah. Early. The boom bap.
*  Yeah, there's so much good shit for that.
*  His beats are like that boom bap hip hop.
*  Well, there's just there's a grittiness to East Coast early hip like cool G rap.
*  Yeah. It's in New York.
*  Yeah. Giant fan.
*  And the streets.
*  I still occasionally I'll listen to that song.
*  Cock blocking.
*  Cool G rap. Cock blocking.
*  Yeah. Some great fucking songs, man.
*  Streets of New York, man.
*  That's a great song.
*  I love East Coast hip hop. Yeah.
*  Tribe Called Quest. Yeah.
*  Low End Theory is my favorite album of all time.
*  If anyone ever asked me what's my favorite album of all time, I say the low end theory.
*  Tribe Called Quest.
*  If I had to pick one rapper that I'm well, I don't know.
*  Biggie is pretty top on the list, but also Nas.
*  Like there's something about Nas's lyrics, like Nas has the best lyrics,
*  like Nas's lyrics.
*  I'll go back over his lyrics like like that revert rewind song
*  where he does the whole story backwards.
*  Like, come on, man.
*  He's so good. He's so creative.
*  And his his lyrics are there.
*  His dad was a jazz musician.
*  OK. And I think that's true.
*  Jazz or blues?
*  His dad was a musician.
*  Yeah. Like a like a professional,
*  well respected musician and Nas sort of, I think.
*  Sort of embodied that ethos and put it into hip hop, you know,
*  because like one thing I remember from Mow better blues,
*  you remember that movie? Yeah.
*  The movie where I remember being like real.
*  When Denzel Washington was like,
*  it wouldn't even fuck his girlfriend because he had to practice.
*  I was like, wow, that's dedication. Right. Right.
*  And I remember thinking like the dedication that a blues musician has
*  or a jazz musician has where they're just constantly practicing
*  their instrument is so much different than a stand up.
*  Or the same. Yeah.
*  What's it stand up or very similar to?
*  I sometimes think stand up.
*  I mean, but so much of us are sort of like jazz. Right.
*  Yeah. But fuck ups in that we don't practice like they do.
*  They'll practice for hours and hours every day.
*  You getting up on stage every night, man. That's practicing, man.
*  Yeah. But you should practice before you get up on stage.
*  Most comics don't.
*  Yeah. Well, how do you do sitting in front of the mirror?
*  Tell jokes, writing, writing, writing, going over your nose.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, I'm just I'm saying, you know,
*  I feel like because I feel like.
*  I mean, what do I know?
*  But like, you know,
*  you know, it's it's it's the space between the notes, right?
*  That's what they talk about with jazz.
*  Right. The space between the notes.
*  You had a COVID test.
*  That's the same thing. Yeah, we both did, bro.
*  That's the same thing with stand up.
*  It's the space between the jokes, even.
*  It's a space between the ideas.
*  Like stand up is the thing that requires.
*  A lack of discipline sometimes.
*  Like stand up is not just it's like jazz.
*  And any time you're playing a musical instrument,
*  you must be proficient.
*  Wait a minute. What is that?
*  Marijuana. No, but I mean, what comes from Dono Rollings?
*  That's some good shit.
*  It's good. Sure.
*  That's good for now.
*  I've got to monitor.
*  I'm going to I'm going to monitor that hit.
*  And good call. Yeah.
*  Stand up requires almost a lack of discipline to be.
*  Wild enough to say some of the shit that we said,
*  but also discipline to go over your notes,
*  discipline to look at all these ideas and try to structure them in a way
*  that's going to resonate with the audience.
*  And then also discipline to like think about the set and what went wrong,
*  what went right and try to reevaluate.
*  And so the words in stand up and the ideas,
*  that's where your fingers are on the piano. Right.
*  That's that's the technical side.
*  And then the spaces between the words and the rhythm
*  and the timing with the audience. That's where.
*  Yeah. Also your head, right? Yeah.
*  Like where your head's at, because I, you know, like, I mean, again,
*  like I've had a, you know, I've I've I've enjoyed making music over the years.
*  I wouldn't say that I'm that good at it, but I definitely love doing it.
*  And you can pull up, pull up my video from 1992 of when I was a kid
*  in Canada, I made a rap album.
*  And to me, it was like, I love this.
*  I love that it was sort of like the technology.
*  Like I loved I loved like I got a sampler.
*  I worked all summer as a mowing lawn so I could buy a sampler, a used sampler.
*  And then I started sampling records, listening to Gangstar.
*  And I want to try to do that, you know?
*  And and so.
*  Oh, so but, you know, man, like
*  yeah, there this is that's me in the red jacket.
*  When I was 18 years old and, you know, this was our album.
*  That's 1990, 1991.
*  That's the yellow jacket. Look how skinny I am.
*  I'm one 18th of a megapixel camera.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's it's a bad upload.
*  We actually shot it. So shot on film, actually.
*  That was shot on 16 millimeter film on a steady cam.
*  There we go. Yeah.
*  There me in the grocery store.
*  Are you friends with these guys anymore? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, Greg's Greg Campbell is the other emcee.
*  He's a great rapper. What's he doing now?
*  He is in Ottawa and he's he's actually killing it as a real estate agent up there.
*  And he's doing a great job. He really is killing it.
*  Like, I mean, it is he's so Mr.
*  Big Stuff. He called himself after he's he's he's an incredible rapper, actually.
*  Does he call himself Mr. Big Stuff when he's selling houses?
*  You should, man. You should. Good idea.
*  Show up with a clock and you still has.
*  I'd like you to meet Greg someday.
*  He's still got like an incredible energy about him.
*  And I feel like in a lot of ways, like
*  I like I learned a lot from him. We were kids, you know, but we met in high school.
*  We were skateboarders and he was other skateboarder.
*  My squeeze a couple of years younger than me.
*  Like he's like and when we were like when I was 17 and he was 15,
*  we went to New York and made a made a goofy record.
*  So wow. And he's got there.
*  There we are. That's Greg on the right.
*  And that's my Geordie Ferguson, who I've happened to talk to.
*  He was our DJ in the middle.
*  And but Greg on the right in the glasses.
*  Where are you hilarious? That's me on the left.
*  Cut the fuck out of you.
*  That's not you. See, it says.
*  Let me see your face. Look at me.
*  Barely you see it says bones on my hat.
*  That's because that's from Powell Peralta Skateboards.
*  I just but I was bones, MC Bones, because I was skinny.
*  Bones rocking the microphone.
*  I'm like a king on the throne.
*  Only thing is, I stand alone.
*  Know I'm saying, Joe, I do understand.
*  Get it. This was our pizza commercial we did.
*  We did a pizza.
*  We did a local pizza commercial.
*  You can play that. Amazing.
*  Yeah. And what's the is the pizza company still around?
*  The pizza store was for a grocery store chain called Loeb.
*  Look at you. You play this.
*  You can play this video.
*  Can you play that when you play that with the music we wrapped in it?
*  Yeah. Check this out.
*  Organized rhyme on time with the cool food.
*  Nine ninety nine. I feel fine. Don't be a fool, dude.
*  Used to be soft. It was lost.
*  Do you do the pizza commercial as a rapper?
*  Look at me. Nineteen.
*  Did that kid really need glasses or was that a prop?
*  Uh, I think that was me.
*  That kid right there. Where?
*  The other one right there with the black.
*  No, no. Greg needed glasses. Yeah. OK.
*  Those were real. Yeah.
*  I really distrust people with fake.
*  Real man. We keep a real organized.
*  Right. If you found someone
*  that was wearing fake glasses, they weren't glasses, but they weren't prescription.
*  Oh, yeah. Wouldn't you get a little uneasy?
*  They're trying to be like John Lennon or something or.
*  I don't know why I would get uneasy.
*  Mm hmm. Yeah. Why?
*  I I require glasses now for reading.
*  Oh, do you really? That started three or four years ago.
*  And I know how it started. How old are you?
*  I am. Guess.
*  Thirty. No. Twelve.
*  I'm bad at this. I'm forty nine.
*  Wow. You look great, dude. No.
*  Well, you do. That's very nice of you.
*  Everyone online tells me I look old.
*  Stop reading. Look how old he looks.
*  Listen, if I was 20, I'd say that shit, too.
*  This guy was old as fuck.
*  But as an actual person that's near your age.
*  Yeah. I think you look great.
*  Yeah. Thank you.
*  You look great, too. Thank you very much.
*  Um, what? How did we get to this?
*  What were we talking about right before?
*  Well, who was the guy with the glasses? Greg had glasses on.
*  Oh, we're so. So I have glasses now.
*  I wear glasses only for reading my phone.
*  And I know how I know how I got.
*  I know why my glasses went.
*  My eyes went bad. Why?
*  And I saw actually said this in the other day in your show.
*  You said make it bigger for my old eyes.
*  You said, right. I was like, I know how.
*  That's what happened to me. Yeah.
*  You got old. I thought you're going to tell me about something important.
*  Like, like, yeah, like chemical exposure or something.
*  I know how it went bad. No, I just got old.
*  No, I do have a thing. Oh, OK.
*  It's a real thing. This is what it is.
*  When you wake up in the morning and it's still dark,
*  don't look at your phone until you've turned the lights on.
*  And that fixes everything?
*  No, that's when you damage your eyes.
*  Looking at your phone in the dark.
*  I felt them break. I felt my eyes break.
*  Yeah. Maybe they lift and wait.
*  Maybe your eyes are lifting weight.
*  No, it's in the dark. The bright, the bright light of the.
*  Pussy ass eyes that are scared of matches.
*  I think it's I think it's when you look at your phone in the dark is what makes it makes it go.
*  Imagine if you looked at difficult like the eyes are so much different than a lot of parts of your
*  body because like if you lift difficult things with your legs, you get bigger legs.
*  But if you look at too much shit with your eyes, they break.
*  Yeah. Yes.
*  Right. You don't think so?
*  Dude, I'm a doctor. That's true.
*  That's true. That's what I'm saying.
*  Like legitimate. No, first of all, they're going to break no matter what.
*  Right. And part of it is apparently your legs break down eventually as you get older.
*  They're already breaking down.
*  But I think it's also like there's a thing about looking at something
*  that's always a certain distance from you on a regular basis over and over and over again.
*  I don't think we're supposed to do that.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  Yeah, I think especially in the dark.
*  But when you wake up in the morning, it's dark and there's a bright thing.
*  I believe it accentuates the speed at which it's not good for your eyes because it's the
*  your eyes are exposed in photography. You expose for the darkness.
*  Your irises are a certain point.
*  And then all of a sudden you hit it with this bright light.
*  That's what broke. I felt it break.
*  I remember the day it went out of focus.
*  I was in the morning. I was looking at my phone.
*  Okay. Anyways.
*  I don't like to be overly optimistic about some shit that I barely understand.
*  But I think that super smart dudes are really on the ball when it comes to vision
*  and therapies for vision deterioration.
*  I had a guy, Andrew Huberman, who works on that specifically.
*  And he was talking about they're going to be able to put injections into people's eyes.
*  And then I'm absolutely butchering this.
*  But then do something with virtual reality that actually improves
*  the way your vision is.
*  I remember seeing that.
*  Oh, I don't like the way that it's rewarded.
*  But they can bring our without the laser eye surgery. I haven't had that.
*  Scientists have reversed age-related blindness by deliberately infecting the eyes of the virus.
*  This is exactly what Huberman was talking about.
*  A small and this is from 2017.
*  And preliminary clinical trials found that injecting a common cold-like virus in the eyes
*  of age-related macular degeneration patients, one of the leading causes of blindness in the US,
*  it can halt and even reverse the progression of the disease.
*  So it could reverse.
*  Wow.
*  So these people are way smarter than you and I, Tom.
*  They're different kind of humans.
*  They're out there trying to fix problems with cancer and age and telomere length and
*  mental deterioration and all the things that plague all of us.
*  They're out there working on it while we're talking shit.
*  We're just here talking shit.
*  And you're bringing attention to it, Joe.
*  Yeah, but yeah, absolutely.
*  But I mean, like, seriously, like, yeah, that's that's that would be I would get that.
*  My friend, I would get that.
*  I would get that injection because I hate I can't stand that's blurry when I look at my phone.
*  It's so annoying.
*  Is it blurry when you look at your phone?
*  Oh, yeah, for sure.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay, good.
*  I feel better.
*  Yeah, like if I look at my phone, like I can read it.
*  I heard you say that on the phone.
*  It's not perfect.
*  I heard you say that on the show the other day and I actually felt like.
*  Dude, if I put glasses on, it looks great.
*  I was like, oh, good.
*  Like, yes.
*  I put these bitches on.
*  I have glasses like I should go get my glasses out of the van.
*  I can see everything.
*  Put a camera out by the van.
*  I'll show you the van.
*  My van's here.
*  I'm having fun.
*  I can't.
*  This is first of all.
*  Thank you, Joe.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  My pleasure, brother.
*  And thank you for like legitimately inspiring me.
*  Not bullshit.
*  Your show was one of the first things that I ever did where I thought, oh my God,
*  you could do this on your own.
*  When I went to your house and you had these wires going through your living room and then
*  you had a server room and me and Red Band were like, holy shit, dude.
*  What's up, Red Band?
*  Part of what got me interested in doing a podcast was going to your spot.
*  Thank you for the inspiration, my friend.
*  But I appreciate it.
*  I think we're all in this together, man.
*  But you no doubt without any question.
*  You helped me a lot because you gave me a thought that I didn't really have before
*  that some guy could be so ahead of the curve that you were doing this in like 2000 and
*  like what, four?
*  What were you doing?
*  What you?
*  You have given me the inspiration of saying, oh shit, it actually could work.
*  It works.
*  It does work.
*  Joe fucking did it.
*  Yeah, but I got the idea.
*  A lot of it was for you and the rest of it was from Opie and Anthony.
*  You know, I think you're inspiring so many people because the thing is that's the hardest
*  part about being creative or being an artist or whatever you want to call it.
*  A comedian, a writer, a musician, all these things, right?
*  You dream something.
*  So the idea of not quitting, right?
*  That's like really the thing because like everybody kind of sort of second guesses
*  themselves and says, okay, maybe I shouldn't just be doing this, you know?
*  I'm mentally ill, Tom Green.
*  I don't let things go.
*  No, it's beautiful though, man, because it's great to see.
*  I mean, here we are in first of all, the UFO studio, which I love, and I wanted to ask
*  you some questions about it.
*  Okay.
*  What is the inspiration for this incredible Chinese restaurants?
*  No disrespect.
*  Love Chinese restaurants.
*  Oh, wow.
*  I didn't actually didn't even notice that until now.
*  I'm joking.
*  I hope people don't get mad at me for that.
*  No, they won't.
*  I love Chinese restaurants.
*  It does feel like that.
*  It's not negative.
*  No, honestly, it was this was the whole idea behind it.
*  Matt Alvarez, who's a guy who built it, and I were thinking like what to do with this space.
*  There was a circular space like this.
*  The shape of the space is already there.
*  And I was like, that'd be kind of cool to have a podcast in there.
*  And then we found out that they have these sound panels that look like this,
*  and you can make them in different designs.
*  You can choose what designs you get.
*  I'm like, oh, those would be kind of dope as like things on the wall.
*  And we just put it together.
*  And he did it all within five or six weeks of the time we decided we're going to move here.
*  So it happened so quick.
*  So what he's done with all this design and everything is we just ran with it.
*  Wasn't anything that was thought out.
*  People like, God, it's weird in there.
*  Like, yeah, I get it.
*  Yeah, it's weird.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  I like it.
*  But this is not the end.
*  This is what I needed to get in here.
*  This is like think of this as a spaceship that takes us from the LA podcast studio
*  to the Texas podcast studio.
*  The Texas podcast studio is under construction currently.
*  So when all that's this is our spaceship.
*  This is not the Texas podcast studio.
*  We're in a spaceship.
*  We've traveled from one podcast studio through this.
*  Spaceship into the next.
*  This is not the ultimate destination.
*  This is the spaceship leading us from one studio to the next.
*  I thought I was in the studio.
*  So there's a new studio coming.
*  When's that going to be?
*  When Odin blesses us with his praise.
*  We have to wait.
*  No one's bringing back Odin.
*  Imagine if you wanted to bring back Greek gods.
*  You're like, let's just go back to the classics, guys.
*  Thor, Athena.
*  Come on.
*  Let me ask you a question.
*  If this is the spaceship and the new studio, is it going to be in closed environment?
*  Like I like this is kind of really interesting to me.
*  Do you like it better?
*  Yes.
*  Now that I'm sitting here, before I might have said, you know, well, you know, he's
*  still fucking roving.
*  He could have as much space as he wants.
*  But he could put himself in a big, giant thing, Coliseum kind of place with background,
*  deep, deep background.
*  But the thing is, like, no, because I always think about depth in photography.
*  I think about depth.
*  But then when you as far as the experience, when you're in an intimate conversation with
*  one person for an hour, you're sitting there going, oh, we're going to talk to each other
*  for an hour.
*  It's kind of nice feeling like there's not people back far in the distance.
*  You know, it's kind of I think it creates an interesting environment, like just
*  acoustically.
*  It's really cool.
*  Ecstically, that's nice.
*  That's what I have to say.
*  We are where there's less space, which makes us somehow or another more intimate with the
*  same amount of distance.
*  So is it going to be an enclosed space or is it going to be a larger room?
*  It's going to be a both would be good, by the way, for the difference.
*  It's going to split the difference.
*  I think between this one and the old one, but just be more normal, I think less distracting.
*  This is awesome.
*  I like it, too.
*  But I don't know if it's necessarily perfect.
*  It's just fun.
*  It's fun to be able to make.
*  Look, I'm not a big designer, but it's fun to just do different shit.
*  It'd be fun to have a green screen behind me and be in space every day, like different
*  galaxies floating behind me.
*  Like we could do a lot of shit.
*  So what is that that you think that it is that it is in people where we drive ourselves
*  to kind of create this vision we have in our mind?
*  You know, like you it's it's it's like you have a vision in your mind.
*  This is not even the end of the vision.
*  This is the beginning of the new vision, right?
*  This is this is not even the studio.
*  I thought it was in the studio.
*  Spaceship.
*  This is just a spaceship.
*  This is the first time anyone's hearing this because the first time I've ever said it.
*  Because it's the first time I thought of it.
*  There is no other studio.
*  This is the next studio that's taken us to the next studio.
*  There is going to be another studio.
*  This is really as a spaceship.
*  Like if you could look at about that would be a metaphor, right?
*  Is that a metaphor?
*  Technically now and listen, I'm not going to ask any more questions about the new studio
*  because I want to do.
*  Well, it's just different shit, man.
*  I want to do I want to do a bunch of different things, but I do want to do some
*  where it's a room that's 100% green screen and I want to figure out like what we have to do
*  to be in space.
*  I want to do a conversation in space.
*  Yeah.
*  So one of the rooms I want to do I want to do like a full circular green screen.
*  Can you start that again?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You want to do room interview in space?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Do a room where I say like you and I.
*  Tom Green, Joe Rogan.
*  Yeah.
*  Sitting at a bar table.
*  Yeah.
*  A circular bar table.
*  Oh, you want to have like.
*  Oh, I would share just hanging talking to each other.
*  Okay.
*  Just two microphones and bar like very intimate behind us all green screen in space.
*  Okay.
*  So when you see the podcast, it's just us in space.
*  So that's what I love that.
*  Is that really what we're where it's going?
*  The problem would be you wouldn't see that it's in space.
*  You just see green.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Is that weird?
*  We can do that.
*  Well, what I'm saying.
*  We do that.
*  Right.
*  I think I told you about we could do what you're saying.
*  Yeah.
*  It's not green.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no.
*  What would it be?
*  It's actually there.
*  No, I think I just I think I thought of it projected around you.
*  I think I think I thought of an idea.
*  Is that better?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's better.
*  It's not cheaper, but it's better.
*  Oh, just paint this room green.
*  You could just spray paint this room green.
*  Yeah, you could do that.
*  So you could have it like green so you can do that.
*  But also you have the intimacy of the like Anthony Cumeo from Opie and Anthony.
*  His whole thing is green screen, right?
*  He does like green.
*  You didn't go with me.
*  He has a setup where if you go to his channel, go to go to see if there's a clip of him.
*  Like it looks like he's like in front of a window that overlooks like this spectacular.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just it's just a green screen.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  It's indoors.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  What's up, Anthony?
*  How's it going?
*  Those guys from Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton, when those guys would have you on the podcast
*  or their radio show rather, I say podcast because it really was the first podcast.
*  Yeah.
*  I think Opie and Anthony was the first podcast.
*  Yeah.
*  Because it was sort of structureless.
*  They split up.
*  They split up.
*  They did split up.
*  Unfortunate.
*  They needed a mediator.
*  There he is.
*  So that's all green screen behind him.
*  Maybe you think they'll ever get back together.
*  Fuck, it would be amazing.
*  Listen, sometimes people when they work together for long periods of time,
*  they just get on each other's nerves.
*  Yeah.
*  They hate each other.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  But what they had...
*  Every band.
*  They can't hate each other 100%.
*  What they had when those guys were together, when everything was rocking and rolling,
*  it was a great fucking show.
*  It was a great show for comics because we would come in and they taught me how to be
*  just...
*  They taught me how to just hang like on a radio show where you didn't have to think like,
*  oh my God, this is like this really structured program.
*  There was no structure.
*  It was Ari Shaffir and Bill Burr and Patrice O'Neill and Rich Voss.
*  It was fucking chaos.
*  It was so fun.
*  It was so ridiculous.
*  And we would look forward to it.
*  Like I remember I'd smoke a joint and then drink coffee or we would take pot lollipops
*  or something.
*  And we would be on our way to Opie and Anthony like Ari and I.
*  And it would be fucking six o'clock in the morning.
*  We're exhausted.
*  Did a show last night.
*  But we were so pumped to get there.
*  Because we knew maybe Colin Quinn was going to come by.
*  All these different comics were going to be there.
*  And it was just a hang, man.
*  It was just a hang.
*  Everybody was just laughing and goofing on each other.
*  And it was, you know, sometimes you'd have four or five comics in the room.
*  And there's so many people that were obviously in America and the world who remember where
*  they were when at that time listening.
*  They were all the listeners, right?
*  Listening to that.
*  You know, there's this whole...
*  There were some moments that were the most...
*  One of the craziest things I've ever seen in my life happened on that show.
*  Where they had an eggnog drinking contest.
*  And this dude, Paul from Winnocki, Pat, Pat from Winnocki.
*  Pat from Winnocki is a dude who won their eggnog drinking contest and then vomited in
*  another man's mouth who was leaning over a garbage can.
*  Surrounded by comics.
*  Bill Burr, Ari Shaffir, me, Opi, Anthony, a bunch of staff.
*  Threw up in this dude's mouth.
*  The dude, Pat Duffy.
*  He leaned over a garbage can and opened his mouth like this.
*  Look at this.
*  So he's leaning over this garbage can.
*  He's got his neck over this.
*  And this other guy, Pat, who's behind him, is at the end of the line.
*  He's probably done...
*  How many shots do you think you did, Jamie?
*  Do you remember?
*  I had close to 20-ish, maybe more.
*  I don't know.
*  I had a night like this once at the Rivoli Theater in Toronto, actually.
*  But he keeps downing these shots of eggnog.
*  And he also has diabetes.
*  So he really has to throw it up.
*  You really can't keep it in his body because it's so much sugar.
*  It might kill him.
*  This is a crazy scene, man.
*  What year is this?
*  Oh my God, wait.
*  Early 2000s?
*  Look at this.
*  Where are you?
*  I don't know.
*  I'm in there somewhere.
*  Okay.
*  That might be me filming right there.
*  Is that me?
*  I think that is me.
*  That's me on the mic filming.
*  It was just...
*  The 90s were weird.
*  Everybody has a flip phone.
*  I have a flip phone.
*  And watch him throw up in this dude's mouth.
*  Ready?
*  Look at that.
*  Okay.
*  Hello.
*  Wow.
*  That's one of the craziest things.
*  Whoa!
*  How much?
*  It keeps going.
*  Dude, it's cartoonish.
*  It keeps going.
*  What was he eating that day?
*  Eggnog, bro.
*  You're not listening.
*  Look, look, look.
*  Oh my God.
*  Whoa!
*  I'm seeing this for the first time.
*  I think he's got more.
*  He's got more.
*  Wait.
*  He's got another one of them.
*  It's like the meaning of life.
*  The final scene of the meaning of life.
*  I think he's got one more.
*  It's...
*  Look, look.
*  Preposterous!
*  Preposterous amounts of eggnog.
*  Wow.
*  In this guy's mouth.
*  And look.
*  The splat...
*  It's the Dexter scene.
*  This is Dexter.
*  Look at the ground.
*  It's covered in plastic.
*  Everyone knew there was going to be throw up.
*  This is a radio show.
*  Do you understand how crazy this is?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  The video only came from cell phones.
*  There was no show on video.
*  I know.
*  This is how bonkers radio was back then.
*  And so those guys gave a chance to guys like Ari and me and Joey Diaz and all those guys
*  who, out of that group that were doing those radio shows early in the morning,
*  and you would do that show and you'd go, why can't we do this?
*  And that was a seed too.
*  So between you and them.
*  And then the fact that Adam Corolla went right from radio.
*  He went to doing his own podcast and a bunch of other people did the same thing.
*  I was like, okay.
*  It's...
*  Look, Charlie just got up, by the way.
*  That's a beautiful thing.
*  Chopper.
*  I'd like to say...
*  My name's Chopper, bro.
*  First of all, Joe, thank you.
*  What's up to Opie and Anthony.
*  Salute.
*  And Charlie just woke up.
*  Let me just get Charlie.
*  Charlie, what are you doing?
*  Maybe you can come up here and say hi.
*  This is never going to work.
*  People always want to bring dogs in the podcast.
*  You watch.
*  My dog is on the podcast for like five seconds.
*  Charlie is chill.
*  Check it out.
*  I'm sure she's chill.
*  Watch.
*  Definitely won't interfere with the conversation at all.
*  Ignore her for a second.
*  Okay.
*  Check it out.
*  Talk about Marshall...
*  What am I ignoring?
*  Marshall...
*  You're saying...
*  Marshall May Rogan?
*  Yeah, that's his name.
*  Why are you saying ignore her?
*  Well, just because you thought she was going to interrupt the conversation.
*  Just joking.
*  Just joking.
*  She's adorable.
*  She won't.
*  She's pretty good.
*  She's a sweet little dog.
*  Isn't she interesting?
*  She's very sweet.
*  Energy.
*  Well, she's very calm, which means she's loved.
*  Look at the way she's embracing you.
*  That's a loved dog.
*  I do love her.
*  She can tell.
*  Look how she leans into you, man.
*  When Marshall, when you pet him, he leans into your leg.
*  It's the sweetest thing.
*  He's trying to stay in contact with you.
*  Yeah, so I mean, I've had two Siberian Huskies for 15 years before Charlie.
*  But this is new relationship.
*  You're seven months old, Charlie.
*  You're seven months old.
*  You know what's fucked up, man?
*  It's like you could look at things almost in two different ways.
*  You could be a reductionist person.
*  You could say like, well, you know, the weird thing about dogs is
*  it's really what mankind has done to wolves.
*  Like they've taken them and subjugated them and then
*  fucking genetically mutated them to be some thing that sits in your lap
*  that relies on you to stay alive.
*  Like, man.
*  Yeah, but you can't fix that.
*  And dogs are real and they're real right now.
*  And you could have a dog like Charlie.
*  Yeah, well, I think about that because like we were out there and the coyotes are out there.
*  And like, dude, like I really am living out in the middle of the woods.
*  It's really kind of crazy.
*  Like, like for real, like that's actually what we've been doing for the last six
*  weeks. And it's ridiculous, but it's really fun.
*  And I'm loving it.
*  And Charlie's loving it to Charlie's adorable.
*  We go for a walk in the woods every day.
*  She's so sweet.
*  And she's having a good time.
*  She gets crazy.
*  She gets a little crazy.
*  She gets her zoomies.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I love when they do that.
*  She goes nuts.
*  And then especially at her age, right, it can get frustrating.
*  Well, you got to run with her or do something with her, throw a ball to her.
*  Yeah, no, she and she'll instigate all that stuff.
*  So, so yeah, so yeah, I do want to, I do want to worry.
*  I worry about her.
*  I worry about I'm sure you love her.
*  We're out in the middle of nowhere.
*  So she's got a GPS tracker on her collar.
*  Yeah, I put tape over my phone number on the dog tag before I came to the show.
*  But my personal cell phone number is on there.
*  You don't want to get them dick pics.
*  I just didn't want didn't want it up on the thing.
*  So I thought about that.
*  Yeah.
*  If you did have it up, how many dick pics do you think you'd get?
*  Okay, well, let's take the tape off for a second.
*  I'll give them a cell phone number.
*  Let's see.
*  I love dogs, but it is crazy what we did the wolf.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy.
*  Did we do it or did they they saw an opportunity?
*  They saw campfire.
*  They saw a bunch of fresh cooked meat.
*  Delicious.
*  They go go in be cute.
*  This is the same argument that predatory women use when they steal men's money and divorce them.
*  When a hot lady marries an old billionaire.
*  Yeah.
*  Same sort of logic.
*  Well, do we really do it to them or do they do it to themselves?
*  Did they come close to the campfire?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, did they want the love?
*  I think that's what it is with dogs.
*  So they just evolved from that, right?
*  I think they for sure did for a while.
*  They were close to us.
*  And then once we started capturing them and keeping them in our houses and shit,
*  the ones that survived are the ones that the most obedient, the ones that were the most
*  compliant, the ones that didn't give us a hard time, the ones that just wanted love.
*  I think about that sometimes when I'm hanging out with my dog, he's the sweetest thing in the world.
*  I love him to death.
*  We have these little hug sessions in the morning.
*  Every morning when I wake up, I go, hello, sir.
*  Hello, sir.
*  He's like, oh, he's like so excited to see you.
*  He's such a sweetheart of a dog.
*  But I'm like, he couldn't survive on his own.
*  He's this fluffy thing that's amazing.
*  He's full of love, like a love sponge.
*  But that's not an animal that survives as an animal.
*  He's essentially a carnivore.
*  I'm feeding him food.
*  I have to feed him.
*  But as long as I do that, he'll stay this sort of sweet, compliant, well-fed thing.
*  But wild dogs kill people.
*  Some lady got killed by a wild dog like a week ago.
*  There was some article I saw.
*  I think it was a lady got killed, or maybe it was an old man.
*  But someone got killed.
*  Do you remember it, Jamie?
*  Charlie.
*  Somebody got killed by a wild dog.
*  Oh, today.
*  Today.
*  Today.
*  Florida man killed by pack of wild dogs.
*  Florida man killed by pack of wild dogs today.
*  Today.
*  Why is it always in Florida these things happen?
*  Because it's the best spot on earth.
*  It's Aliens Amusement Park.
*  Aliens of Greece.
*  It's always in Florida, man.
*  I wonder if it's in the air.
*  Imagine if that's what they prove.
*  Like you go to Florida.
*  Yeah, get in there, buddy.
*  I don't want to like.
*  Imagine if you go.
*  I don't want to make a fool of myself here.
*  They prove that if you go to Florida, like your IQ drops 3%.
*  And your inability to say no to meth goes up by 1,000%.
*  You can drink too much sometimes.
*  But I mean, Joe, it's an honor to be here having whiskey with you.
*  It's an honor to have you, brother.
*  I'm for real legitimately.
*  I've said it before and I'll say it again.
*  You are one of the reasons why I do this.
*  So thank you very much.
*  I mean, when you when you were doing that show out of your house
*  and you had me over as a guest and I remember sitting at your table going,
*  look what Tom Green did.
*  This is amazing.
*  You made your own thing.
*  You made your own show.
*  And you were doing a call in talk show with a desk.
*  Listen, I appreciate it, Joe.
*  You don't have to say it.
*  That's it's just it's true.
*  It's so cool, man.
*  Just being here and just, you know, this whiskey is pretty damn good.
*  Like really good.
*  Pretty damn good.
*  Especially when you're drunk.
*  This is still Austin straight bourbon whiskey.
*  When you're drunk, it's like it's not it's not clear what actually is good.
*  What was the first what was the first drink you had when you were a kid?
*  Well, I remember you start drinking.
*  When do you start drinking?
*  I remember how old were you when you started drinking?
*  High school kids.
*  High school.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember when I first got really fucked up on Jack Daniels to the point
*  where I couldn't smell Jack Daniels for like years.
*  I have that experience with wild turkey.
*  Wild turkey and makers mark.
*  I have that.
*  Yeah.
*  I threw up in a cab when I was like 15 years old.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember that.
*  Yeah.
*  Same 15.
*  Listen, I had wild turkey was my first bourbon
*  experience and did not end well.
*  But yeah, wild turkey will fuck you up.
*  Right.
*  That stuff is seriously potent.
*  Isn't it?
*  Isn't it like a higher percentage of alcohol?
*  It's like a moonshine.
*  What happened was my friend Phil and I, who was my best friend growing up,
*  we went we went on a camping trip one time.
*  This is what kids in Canada do when they're in their 20s.
*  And they're not skateboarding.
*  Hey, let's go take a walk about.
*  We brought a canoe and we said let's paddle out to that island out
*  and we'll bring some beer.
*  We'll bring some whiskey.
*  We'll light a fire.
*  We'll hang out.
*  And it'll be fun.
*  Anyways, we went out.
*  I flipped the canoe on the way.
*  The beer sunk to the bottom of the lake.
*  All we had was our bottle of wild turkey.
*  So we didn't have the beer.
*  It was not a good thing.
*  But damn, dude.
*  Canadian life is a different life.
*  That's why people are nicer up there.
*  You guys have more weather.
*  You have to deal with more shit.
*  You have to like band together more.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Yeah.
*  The winters kind of kept you down a little bit as a country.
*  There's a certain reality that Canada has that the rest of North America doesn't have.
*  It's like in the winter, it can get real crazy.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And so like what I mean, you were saying ice fishing, right?
*  Yeah.
*  You did ice fishing.
*  I didn't do ice fishing, but like that it was just walking to school was going ice
*  fishing.
*  Yeah.
*  Like you're four and by the way, you know, it was the 70s, right?
*  I was born in 1971.
*  So I was walking to school as a five year old in 1976.
*  You know, it's like, oh my God, in the winter with a hat on by myself.
*  Wolves are out there.
*  Yeah.
*  So Jesus Christ, Tom Green, we got eaten by a wolf.
*  Yeah.
*  And look, Charlie just went to sleep, went right back to sleep.
*  Isn't she such a sweetie?
*  She's definitely a sweetie pie.
*  She's so loved.
*  You could tell the way she leans into you.
*  That's a loved dog.
*  It's a unique situation because of the pandemic and the fact that I've got, you know,
*  we're all isolating and I've got nothing else to do other than go at my van with this new dog.
*  And she was rescued by a rescue from, they're called Thrive in San Diego.
*  And this is what they do.
*  They find dogs in the Caribbean and Mexico or this is, she was born in the Bahamas
*  and they bring them over.
*  That's dope.
*  And I just, you know.
*  Well, you got a good one, man.
*  It's kind of like, it's kind of weird because like I just kind of got super lucky because
*  it just sort of happened.
*  Like I knew I needed a dog because this has been a weird year.
*  I miss having dogs.
*  You know, I didn't have a dog.
*  It's also cool that she's young enough so that you can teach her the dogs.
*  Like sometimes people adopt dogs and they're grown.
*  And when you adopt a dog and it's grown, it's more difficult road to kind of train them
*  and get them.
*  So she was three and a half months when I got her.
*  Two months.
*  She had actually been rescued by someone else and then they couldn't keep her and I got
*  her three and a half months.
*  So, but yeah, she's, she's a very good, very good puppy.
*  And I've had Marshall since he was like six weeks old.
*  Yeah.
*  So he, how old is Marshall?
*  Tight.
*  He's almost four.
*  Oh, four.
*  Okay.
*  He's the sweetest.
*  I've never had a golden retriever before.
*  Yeah.
*  Just a different thing.
*  Like when I see him, it's just, we just have this little love session.
*  So me and him, a man dog love session.
*  Yeah.
*  A Charlie has a Instagram.
*  Look at her in pictures.
*  Charlie the pot cake dog.
*  Charlie is called a pot cake dog.
*  What's that?
*  So she's rescued from the Bahamas in the Bahamas.
*  They call this the street dogs that are running around the strays.
*  They call them pot cake dogs because they go to the local people, cook them,
*  they feed them the burnt rice from the, from the, from the, and that's why they're called pot cake
*  dogs.
*  So that's what Charlie is.
*  She's a pot cake dog and, and she's a,
*  Steve has a dog that has a similar type story.
*  Right?
*  Doesn't he?
*  Yes, he does.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  His dogs hit the lottery son.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  What's up, Steve?
*  Shout out to Steve.
*  Yeah, man, dogs are just like, it's a really interesting thing because part of me knows
*  that this is a wolf that was manipulated.
*  It's ancestors are manipulated into this thing.
*  Yeah.
*  But part of me is like, yeah, but there's nothing I can do about that right now.
*  Like he's alive right now.
*  So he's my, my snuggle buddy.
*  Yeah.
*  Like a little buddy, a little buddy.
*  And he puts his paws up in the air, lays on his back and a rub his tummy.
*  I love them, but it's, it is, it is strange.
*  It's, I'm not, this is not a judgment.
*  This is just an observation.
*  It's so strange that people did this to wolves.
*  They took a wolf and turned it into a French bulldog.
*  A French bulldog came from a wolf.
*  Right, right.
*  A wolf.
*  Right.
*  Well, I mean, but I mean, there's no justification for that.
*  The wolves cooperated.
*  Yeah.
*  Think about it.
*  Wouldn't, wouldn't.
*  Oh, that's a tough one.
*  Well, I don't know.
*  It was probably, it was probably a lot of fun for them.
*  I'm sure.
*  I don't think we need to.
*  I would think they probably had a lot of fun doing that.
*  I mean, maybe why would they not have enjoyed that?
*  Well, they needed food.
*  Probably.
*  I mean, no, being intro, what I'm saying is I'm trying to come with like a bit, like
*  you're being introduced.
*  We'd like you to, hey, German shepherd, we'd like you to meet this,
*  you know, Irish Wolfhound.
*  Oh no, no, I'm not interested in that.
*  No, of course they were interested in that.
*  It was probably, probably, okay.
*  Now we're getting weird.
*  Okay.
*  Well, I think like German shepherds are tough dogs.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, Belgian Malinois is a dog that's like specifically designed to attack human beings.
*  Like those, you ever seen those, those meat missiles, those little small little,
*  they look like German shepherds, but like dark evil, like almost demonic eyes.
*  Yeah.
*  They will fuck you up, man.
*  Those Belgian Malinois.
*  Yeah.
*  But that is a dog that's specifically bred just to attack people.
*  But most dogs are bred to be really nice to people.
*  So you're saying it's unethical that they.
*  No.
*  Set animals up with each other like that because.
*  Not saying that.
*  It's like manipulative.
*  No, here's what I'm saying.
*  Okay.
*  If they didn't do it, those fucking things would be eating us.
*  Right.
*  This is what people have to understand.
*  Like wolves will fucking eat you.
*  I'm not saying we should kill the wolves.
*  I love wolves.
*  I love the.
*  I had two Siberian Huskies for 15 years, so I lived with basically lived with two wolves.
*  I have a wolf on my phone.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  That's a wolf.
*  Wow.
*  That is.
*  That's my.
*  Wow.
*  Hey, can you pull up a picture of Annie and Steve?
*  Fascinated by wolves.
*  Check out for Annie and Steve.
*  I had two dogs that looked like that for 15 years living.
*  But well, they were beautiful animal.
*  I'm fascinated by wolves.
*  I don't know.
*  It's not that I don't like wolves, but the reality of wolves is they would fucking eat you.
*  The reason why we like dogs is because we've gotten dogs into a position where we control them
*  and they're not free.
*  If dogs were free, they would kill you like that person that died today.
*  Right.
*  Who's the person that died today?
*  65 year old man got attacked and murdered by stray dogs.
*  Where today?
*  Where was it?
*  South of Tennessee.
*  Florida.
*  In America.
*  Another Florida issue.
*  That's more than one Florida.
*  Right.
*  Was that the same Florida he was talking about before?
*  That's the same story.
*  So we already brought this up.
*  That's how drunk we are.
*  There's Annie and Steve.
*  Those were my dogs for 15 years.
*  Steve on the left in this photo and Annie on the right.
*  And that's in LA.
*  That's up in Burbank.
*  They were good girls.
*  They were good girls.
*  Dogs are great if you feed them.
*  Yeah.
*  You ever have a feral cat?
*  I've had cats but I'm not sure I've had a feral cat.
*  I had a feral cat once.
*  His name is Jack Tamsie.
*  Like the boxer.
*  What do you mean?
*  Feral.
*  Wild.
*  Like you found it and then you adopted it?
*  Well, my friend Laney found it as a kitten and she gave it to me.
*  She captured a bunch of her and her boyfriend trapped them underneath this house.
*  Okay.
*  And then they raised it.
*  I think my parents found a cat at the side of the road.
*  Lucky.
*  Shout out to Lucky.
*  Shout out to Lucky.
*  Lucky is no longer here.
*  Rest in peace, Lucky.
*  What happened to Lucky?
*  Well, she lived 19 years.
*  Wasn't that Lucky?
*  That's Lucky.
*  19 years is very lucky.
*  Good name.
*  It might have been 18 or something.
*  That is fucking old for a cat.
*  They found her at the side of the road.
*  My mother.
*  Oh, she got hit?
*  My mother married.
*  No, no.
*  She found her when she was a baby.
*  Yeah.
*  So my parents, Mary Jane Green and Richard, Joe, I want to give a shout out,
*  and to my brother Joe.
*  Okay.
*  They are, you know, they found Lucky.
*  But first of all, I love you guys.
*  Great to see you.
*  My mom and dad and my brother are strong support system in my life.
*  And, you know, I love them.
*  So they're excited that I'm here.
*  So I'm excited that they're excited.
*  Yeah, they are.
*  Yeah, I am.
*  But no, so it's cool, you know, but
*  I, here's a funny story.
*  So I talked to my mom on the phone.
*  Okay, well, like this.
*  In the van.
*  In the van.
*  As I run over Charlie's head with the rolling.
*  No, I.
*  You talk to your mom on the phone?
*  Every day, every day.
*  Like, I got the phone up on and I'm driving.
*  I'm like, not every day, but when like if I'm drive,
*  usually when I'm driving and I'm trying to find another spot,
*  it's kind of fun.
*  I have my friends on the this.
*  What's cool about the phone is on the speaker.
*  I can call my friends.
*  I'm driving around.
*  I'm talking like, hey, where should I go tonight?
*  You know, like, and you go look for these places.
*  But my mom, Mary Jane Green, Mary Jane Green, by the way.
*  That's my mother's name.
*  I believe you.
*  Mary Jane Green is not a great name.
*  Yeah.
*  So Mary Jane.
*  He said it's like it's preposterous.
*  There's no way you're listening to me.
*  Mary Jane.
*  Yeah, she didn't even really, I don't think,
*  make the connection to the weed reference of it until like later.
*  You know, like, did she partake?
*  I don't think my mom was a big Mary Jane Green partaker, actually.
*  But it's funny that her name is Mary Jane Green
*  and she wasn't a big Mary Jane Green partaker.
*  It's almost sad.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But right.
*  Like if she was a pothead, she'd be legendary.
*  Yeah.
*  She was not a pothead.
*  My mom.
*  Mom's still around?
*  My mom is still around.
*  It's not too late.
*  Yeah.
*  I think we envision a second career for your mom.
*  I could see her being open to it.
*  I want to see your mom with one of them giant, like,
*  LED pot flag chains hanging from her neck, like one of them flashing.
*  It could happen.
*  It could happen.
*  Imagine.
*  It could happen.
*  My mom's really cool.
*  My mom's really cool.
*  Like she'll, she, she, it could happen.
*  I don't think that, I don't think she's.
*  Why wouldn't you start a marijuana company with your mom's name?
*  I mean, we've talked about it, but I don't, you know, we've talked about it.
*  Mary Jane Green?
*  Yeah.
*  Salute.
*  Yeah.
*  Mary Jane Green.
*  Yeah.
*  Come on.
*  We've talked about it.
*  That shit's perfect.
*  Yeah.
*  Why wouldn't you do it?
*  I don't really know how to do that.
*  You need to contact lawyer people that understand how to make that a reality.
*  I literally don't know how to.
*  You need to get some lawyer folk.
*  I don't know how to start a marijuana company.
*  Well, you need some venture capital folk and some lawyer folk that know how to navigate
*  the legality.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause it's legal in states, but not in all of them.
*  California is legal though, where you allegedly live.
*  And so Texas, not legal.
*  Not legal.
*  So then.
*  Yeah.
*  Exactly.
*  So, but California.
*  Legal.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's almost worth the taxes.
*  It's like one way or another, no place is perfect.
*  But it's obviously eventually going to be legal everywhere within.
*  It really should be.
*  Within like what?
*  The only reason why.
*  Two years and two or three years or something?
*  The only reason why it's not is because we have a distorted idea of what it is.
*  And it's the, if the quicker it would be made legal, the quicker people would be able to do
*  legitimate research on it and find out why there are these adverse reactions that some
*  people have.
*  Cause that's the only thing that bothers me.
*  Reifer madness.
*  Yeah, but that's not real.
*  But there are certain people that have like real issues with pot that other people don't.
*  Okay.
*  And it's a-
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah.
*  Schizophrenia is one of them.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Yeah.
*  It's, there's a guy, right?
*  He's an author who came on this.
*  He's a journalist and he came on this podcast to debate Mike Hart, who was a Canadian doctor
*  that prescribes weed.
*  Like he's, he does a lot of work with, you know, medical marijuana patients.
*  Yeah.
*  And Alex Berenson wrote this book on the dangers of marijuana and the, it's like it resonates.
*  It sounds very real.
*  And we've all known people, like I've known three or four people that tell stories about
*  having some experience when they're on edibles and then all their friends say they snapped
*  and they were, they were, you know, they, they barely recovered after that.
*  Some people are fragile with their, their, their chemical, I don't mean to say fragile,
*  but they're vulnerable in their chemical makeup.
*  Do you remember the first time you got high and realized?
*  Not really the first time, but I remember the first time as an adult,
*  cause I really didn't do it for a long time until it was about 30.
*  And then I started getting high again,
*  but I only got high between 30 and whenever I first started doing it, like a handful of times,
*  like four or five times my whole life until I was 30.
*  I'd never smoked.
*  Maybe a little more.
*  I was not much.
*  I never smoked marijuana in high school.
*  I was, I was, I was straight edge kid.
*  I drank quite a bit actually, to be honest with you.
*  Standard.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a good kid.
*  Yeah.
*  Out there drinking.
*  Drank a lot, but, but, but then, yeah, so later in life though, you know, it's,
*  I discovered it and it was fine.
*  I just, I think it's very important that kids' brains develop before they get too much of
*  anything, too much of alcohol, too much of marijuana, too much of anything.
*  When you're a kid, that's what's fucked up about this.
*  Like, I don't want to tell anybody what to do, but when you're a kid and this is like, again,
*  I said, I got drunk for the first time.
*  I was like 15 or 16, like really bad threw up in a car and a cab on the way home.
*  Like I'm, I just don't think if you, I think there's something that's going on
*  that you can't think of while it's happening with the development of your brain when you're
*  15 years old.
*  There's a bunch of shit going on that you really don't understand.
*  And I think in some way it's up to the people that have gone through it to protect you from
*  the potential negative aspects of all your bad decision making.
*  Absolutely.
*  And that's one of them with drinking and pot and drugs.
*  It's you want to tell the kids, look, I know I don't want to tell you what you can and
*  can't do because I don't want you to develop this need to rebel against me.
*  But you're doing something to your brain before it's done cooking.
*  And you're also doing something that's incredibly difficult for people to manage that are
*  mature, well-developed adults.
*  You can give well-developed adults Adderall.
*  A lot of them are not very good at managing that.
*  A lot of them.
*  They get real wacky with Adderall.
*  They start taking it all the time.
*  That's well adjusted, educated with responsibility adults.
*  They can get hooked on Adderall.
*  What the fuck do you think is going to happen to a 15 year old that starts drinking or
*  doing coke or smoking pot?
*  Your brain's growing.
*  Yeah, I agree.
*  I'm not even done.
*  I think drinking is a fun act of rebelliousness as a teenager.
*  But maybe that's probably where it should end.
*  I think in a sense, you'd be better off if you could mentor your children to understand
*  what drinking is and mentor them in a way where you teach them about the dangers of
*  over drinking.
*  You could do it in a way where you don't even have to get the kids drunk.
*  You just let the kids know, let's listen, I am a person.
*  You are a person.
*  I am older than you.
*  I'm not better than you.
*  I've just lived longer.
*  I am just trying to tell you for your own safety and good that you need to learn how
*  to do this because if you just start drinking with no supervision when you're 21 years old
*  or 18 in some countries, you're going to fuck yourself up.
*  We would both be way better off me not having to worry about you.
*  And you, with understanding the consequences of your actions,
*  if we sat down and talked about how to drink.
*  It's a complex thing.
*  There's a lot going on.
*  It's not just like you're out in the world.
*  You're inebriated.
*  Absolutely.
*  It's also like physically you got to know what's the dose.
*  You're a 90 pound woman.
*  You can't drink 18 drinks.
*  Your body's not going to be able to handle it.
*  Like a 400 pound man has a much larger gap than a person like you or I.
*  They got a lot more room, a lot more wiggle room for how much alcohol they can consume.
*  You got to start slow.
*  I definitely figured it out on my own.
*  Which is part of the adventure of life, you know, like having a few bad nights.
*  It probably would have been better off to have had a little warning about.
*  For sure.
*  If someone just sat you down and said, Tom, Tom, Tom, look at me.
*  One drink, good.
*  But here's the problem with two drinks and three drinks and four drinks if you have them too quickly.
*  All of a sudden, you don't know what's good and what's bad.
*  All of a sudden, you don't know what's drunk and what's sober.
*  You don't know what's the right move anymore because you're fucked up.
*  And when you're fucked up, you don't know what to do.
*  So you got to avoid getting fucked up.
*  You got to get to the point where you're having a good time, a little chatty,
*  having fun, social lubricant.
*  Right.
*  And don't because if you're if you're, you know,
*  I mean, most people just get lucky and nothing that bad happens.
*  But, you know, you lose control when you're so.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  You could certainly think about it that way.
*  Yeah.
*  But also you can think about it.
*  It's just like something bad could happen to anybody, though.
*  For sure.
*  You need to be aware.
*  Like, hey, you gotta be careful.
*  You can't be going to run around just like.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't know what you're doing whiskey on and talking shit on a podcast.
*  Something bad is going to happen.
*  Well, you don't know what's going on anymore.
*  All of a sudden, you're a fucking whiskey robot.
*  You know, just when you're a 15 year old kid, the first time you get drunk,
*  you have no experience to draw from.
*  Like, you don't you don't have like a lot of these under your belt.
*  Like, I've been there before.
*  Like the first time you ever get drunk.
*  I don't I wish I could really clearly remember.
*  I can.
*  I can.
*  I can remember mine.
*  Yeah.
*  Tell me.
*  So I can remember.
*  So when I was in Ottawa, Canada, what's up, Ottawa?
*  You know, I you know, I would I would go.
*  We would go in high school to these things called pubs and they'd have.
*  I say things called pubs like you speak in some strange language.
*  It wasn't the bar.
*  It wasn't a bar.
*  It wasn't an actual pub.
*  What was it?
*  It was like somebody would rent out a community center and they'd be selling.
*  Like you could go buy beer, but you're 15, you're underage.
*  And they called them pubs and all the kids went there and we all go where we were.
*  It was a loophole or was it illegal?
*  It was illegal.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it was illegal.
*  It was pubs.
*  That was Ottawa, Canada.
*  We go down to Vanier.
*  What's up, Vanier?
*  Vanier is part of town Ottawa.
*  We go down there and there'd be and we'd all the kids from all the high schools would go
*  down there and you could buy a beer for a dollar or something.
*  When you're saying this, you know what I see in my head?
*  Snow.
*  Oh, it was so cold.
*  I see cold weather and slush and wet boots.
*  We would take the OC Transpo Ottawa-Carlton Transpo bus down through the snow and to get
*  to this part of town, Vanier to go.
*  First of all, I want to say, Joe, first of all, I love you, man.
*  I love you too.
*  I love you, man.
*  I love you too.
*  Thank you for having me over here.
*  And I want to and I don't want to shout out Vanier because like,
*  Shout out to Vanier.
*  Yeah, it's like, it's so cool.
*  Like, like everybody in Ottawa knows like Vanier is like this great place.
*  I grew up basically very close to there and, you know, we would, you know, it's, it's,
*  it's, it's, it's cool.
*  Ottawa.
*  Yeah, no, but, no, it's,
*  it's cold as hell up there, man.
*  It's really.
*  Yeah, I envisioned slushy boots.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You're telling that story.
*  I was thinking, okay, okay, okay.
*  Okay, Google, Google, Google this.
*  Fingers are numb.
*  Wait, Google this.
*  Check this out.
*  Google this.
*  Jamie, can I ask you to show a photo of something with, is that cool?
*  Cougar boots.
*  Cougar boots.
*  Cougar boots.
*  You don't mean Cougar like the 40 year old mom trying to get some young dick.
*  Not talking about that one.
*  No, I'm talking about Cougar boots.
*  They're made out of Cougars?
*  No.
*  So this is my experience as a, as a, as a, as a kid growing up in Canada and the freeze in Canada.
*  This is what was on my feet.
*  That one on the brown one, the light brown one, that one.
*  Oh, it's comfy.
*  Yeah, they were comfy and they're, they're like, it's, it's not leather.
*  They're like vinyl boots.
*  And that was, so when I was in the.
*  Is this an ad?
*  Are you doing a Cougar boots ad?
*  What does not exist anymore.
*  No, no, that's like, that's like, that's like Atari 2600 style.
*  That's like 1992 or something.
*  That seems like you could come back.
*  We can get retro right now with like Olivia Newton, John, let's get physical type ankle puffy things.
*  I've never seen all the white ones before.
*  There's some things you could bring back today.
*  I think people are ripe.
*  They're ready for headbands.
*  They're ready.
*  Joe, you can bring.
*  People are ready for some weird shit.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Headband on.
*  I bet you do.
*  I need to get that sweat out.
*  I bet you do.
*  I bet you do.
*  Okay.
*  Can I show you something cool about, about Canadian weird Canadian stuff that I think
*  you'll appreciate?
*  You don't have to ask.
*  Just tell me.
*  Okay.
*  Check out the Naboo network.
*  And ABU.
*  And ABU.
*  Yeah.
*  Check that out.
*  What is it?
*  So when in the eighties, we had the internet in Ottawa before anybody.
*  Yeah.
*  The 80 what you had the internet in the eighties.
*  Yeah.
*  But it wasn't the internet was called the Naboo network.
*  What is it?
*  And they, oh yeah.
*  There's Doug Henning, the magician Doug Henning did a commercial for it.
*  Well, what is it?
*  So it was a network that was run through the cable television system, but it was the
*  internet basically.
*  And everybody could talk to each other.
*  Yeah.
*  Switch on to smart TV.
*  It was like way earlier than it was anything else.
*  You talk to people like in a text message to a keyboard.
*  They had video games on there too.
*  You had arcade quality, you dig dug.
*  You had like all these like dig dugs, the one that comes to mind, but you had a track
*  and field, you know, the one where you got to shake the fucking.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  All that.
*  And so Naboo, there it is.
*  See, there's a logo there, the blue logo right down there.
*  That's it.
*  That's it.
*  That's it.
*  That was like Ottawa rewind.
*  Check it out.
*  Oh, coke fueled.
*  The untold story of Ottawa's coke fueled 1980s.
*  I didn't know Ottawa was so edgy with the coke fueled 1980s video game industry.
*  That's what I'm saying though.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  I was, I didn't partake in that part of it, but I mean, if you and I,
*  sounds like it was pretty fun, but.
*  If somebody writes a story about this podcast, they're going to say marijuana and alcohol
*  fueled blank.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what they do.
*  And I hope they do.
*  This is rude.
*  These people, they worked hard to make these video games.
*  Don't blame it on coke, coke fueled.
*  No, exactly.
*  You can't stay on coke, you assholes.
*  You can't say it's all coke fueled.
*  You know what it's like if you're on coke all day long?
*  I don't, but.
*  Neither.
*  I'm asking you.
*  I was hoping you had an answer.
*  I don't actually don't.
*  I'm not, it's funny because I'm not a drug.
*  I don't do a lot of drugs.
*  That guy looks like he's on coke.
*  Look at that picture.
*  I mean, I would try drugs if it was allowed to do drugs, but I'm.
*  No, but.
*  That guy shakes your hand.
*  You want to go to the gym.
*  Wait, who is that?
*  No, but here's the thing.
*  Here's the thing.
*  Here's the thing, Joe.
*  Like it was pretty cool.
*  Like it was like interesting.
*  It was, it was like you had a box that you would plug into the, into the cable.
*  It sounds cool.
*  The cable TV.
*  Am I, so my dad, my dad, uh, Richard Green, Dick Green.
*  Okay.
*  What's Mary Jane Green and Dick Green hanging out.
*  Yeah.
*  Dick and Mary Jane.
*  Do you know how crazy that is?
*  You're not even a real person.
*  Are you?
*  You're like a CIA plant.
*  Dick.
*  No one has the parents, Dick and Mary Jane Green.
*  That's right.
*  What games did you play?
*  Did you play Pong?
*  The first might be the best.
*  I remember playing Pong for the first time to this day.
*  Pong hangs in there.
*  By the way, can I say something about my dad?
*  Can I say something?
*  Can I say something about my dad for a second?
*  You certainly can.
*  My dad, Dick Green was a tank commander.
*  Okay.
*  Captain, Canadian army.
*  All right.
*  And won the NATO like artillery, like, uh, armored core, like, uh, best shot, you know,
*  like, like, like competition in Germany against everybody, Americans, Germans, everybody.
*  Firing a tank like this, like when you're a kid growing up here, it's like, oh yeah.
*  What did you do?
*  When you, oh, I was a tank captain, right?
*  Right.
*  And they won.
*  He won.
*  My dad actually did this.
*  Richard Green won this tank, um, shooting competition for NATO for Canada, right?
*  Beat all the other.
*  Yeah.
*  Pretty sure.
*  Pretty sure.
*  I mean, you go, I want to give you the exact.
*  Again, I see snow, I see wet boots.
*  We all have coffee in our hands.
*  It's true.
*  I want you to Google it.
*  I believe you, Tom.
*  I believe you.
*  Sometimes people shoot better than other people do.
*  I lived in a Petawawa CFB, Petawawa Canadian forces based Petawawa was where I grew up.
*  This thing that your dad won.
*  Can you explain like how it worked?
*  Do you, what was the,
*  they would go out and with the tanks and they would shoot at targets that were at
*  different ranges and they would, they would.
*  And your dad was just a wizard.
*  He won.
*  He's the plaque at the house.
*  Won the NATO.
*  It was like 1971 or something or no, before 68 or something.
*  My father went to Vietnam.
*  My father was in Vietnam with the Canadian army as peacekeepers.
*  Does he have, is your dad still alive?
*  Yes, he is.
*  Yes.
*  Does he have problems hearing?
*  A little bit.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  A little bit, but he's.
*  Should fire off those guns, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Boom.
*  He does.
*  Boom.
*  Yeah.
*  Boom.
*  Yeah.
*  You know.
*  My dad has a hearing aids actually.
*  Yeah.
*  It took a while before people realized the negative impact of firearms.
*  Yeah.
*  My father has hearing aids for sure.
*  Yeah.
*  All my friends though that grew up with guns.
*  Yeah.
*  Like that are my age that they didn't understand hearing protection right then.
*  Absolutely.
*  Or nor did rock and roll stars.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, how many rock stars have like serious ear problems?
*  Absolutely.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  Like the thing you love is destroying your ears.
*  We just didn't know.
*  You got another thing coming.
*  We just didn't know.
*  I have, okay, so I love this.
*  I have earplugs in my life.
*  Okay.
*  In my life, earplugs are part of my life.
*  Okay.
*  What percentage of your life a worn earplugs on?
*  Jamie.
*  Yeah.
*  Earplugs.
*  Earplugs are part of my life, man.
*  Well now, because you're aware.
*  I have over the ear headphones.
*  For sure.
*  And I have internal ear, orange.
*  But I'm getting that it's like people like your dad and people that grew up
*  before they really understood.
*  I've never even thought about that actually until now.
*  Yeah.
*  That you mentioned that.
*  It's a big problem.
*  Big problem with rock stars.
*  Lead singer of ACDC recently had a step down, right?
*  Isn't that still correct?
*  Is he?
*  I think that's correct.
*  Let's see if we can.
*  I guess they had flaws.
*  It's a real problem for rock stars, man.
*  Yeah.
*  When rock stars get old, they develop like real problems with their ears.
*  I mean, you got to think about being like fucking Gene Simmons.
*  And how thousands and thousands and thousands of concerts.
*  Yeah.
*  You know?
*  He's actually back.
*  But he has hearing aids now.
*  Oh, wow.
*  They fixed his ears.
*  Who?
*  Put up the story?
*  Who did?
*  Brian Johnson.
*  He's lead singer of ACDC, son.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah.
*  Oh, they put a new album out, right?
*  Overcame hearing issues and returned to ACDC.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Wow.
*  So they gave him some earpieces.
*  Well, that's good news.
*  Because that's a bummer, man.
*  Imagine like you're a fucking rock star and the one thing you can't do is go out there
*  and not only that, you're the lead singer of ACDC.
*  You know?
*  I heard that.
*  That's a wild ass band.
*  Yeah.
*  You got to be.
*  Well, probably one of the greatest rock and roll bands ever, right?
*  I mean, when you think about like if you're like right on like a piece of paper,
*  rock and roll, and then you put under it, you put the ACDC logo.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  That's right.
*  Rolling Stones.
*  Back in Black.
*  God damn, that's a good song.
*  The problem is you've heard it so many times.
*  You don't ever get to hear it with fresh ears.
*  But if you can go and listen to Back in Black the first time.
*  I remember the first time I heard it.
*  I guess I was in high school somewhere around then.
*  I mean, when did Back in Black come out?
*  What year?
*  Take a guess.
*  It was like it was always...
*  83?
*  No, it must have been...
*  Oh, was it not 79 or 80 or...
*  Fucking wildly guessing.
*  I don't know.
*  Probably early 80s, late 70s.
*  I didn't discover it until I was in high school.
*  Early 80s or late 70s?
*  80.
*  Okay.
*  80.
*  So let's put the difference.
*  We're both kind of in the middle.
*  It's that music for the time when I first heard it, I was like, holy shit.
*  You were like, holy shit.
*  Right.
*  It had so much impact.
*  When you listen to songs, like even from...
*  I couldn't imagine what it would have been like to hear Hendrix the first time.
*  Right.
*  That's a very famous interaction.
*  Because you're talking about...
*  At that point, you're talking about like...
*  Pure genius.
*  Well, they hadn't even thought about the idea of being aggressive yet with music.
*  Right.
*  Well, he was pure genius.
*  Yeah.
*  Pure.
*  Like this weird guitarist.
*  Before it was ours, let's be nice with the music.
*  All of a sudden, it's like aggressive.
*  I'm angry.
*  Well, it was also...
*  Was there anger in...
*  Well, no, the whole Beethoven was angry.
*  All the old...
*  Angry.
*  It's just energetic.
*  I don't know if you need to say angry.
*  I think what Hendrix did was...
*  You could kind of call some of it aggressive, but more I would say energetic.
*  It's like his energy was just different.
*  He would play the sounds...
*  People have a way of making the guitar sound.
*  It's so interesting.
*  It's almost like they're using their voice or something.
*  They're using like there's a sound that you can make with a guitar that other folks can't make.
*  So, yeah.
*  Well, I mean...
*  Yeah.
*  So in my opinion, some people are like...
*  Are we sharing again?
*  Yeah.
*  Cheers.
*  In my opinion, some people are like kind of like in the moment more and they're not thinking...
*  It's like what we've talked about tonight with your show and your incredible success in the show.
*  Jimi Hendrix had that same kind of energy where he didn't want to play it the way everybody was
*  supposed to be playing the guitar.
*  He just wanted to fucking put his energy into it.
*  Yeah.
*  And he played the way he wanted to.
*  I don't know how to play guitar at all.
*  But someone told me, Jimi, did he play guitar backwards or something?
*  Like he had the other hand?
*  Left-handed, yeah.
*  But he played it with his right hand?
*  Yeah, I think...
*  I'm not sure how...
*  One of the others?
*  I think they made a special guitar so he played it opposite.
*  But...
*  He played it weird.
*  He's just a genius.
*  He just figured it out in a way.
*  But there's certain people that come along where you listen to their shit.
*  You listen to Voodoo Child and you're like, oh my God.
*  You listen to him play that song and you go, oh my God, this guy's in some place that no guitarist has ever been.
*  And he's inventing rock and roll in a lot of ways.
*  Those guitar solos that we hear in every song as we were growing up was all people being inspired by that.
*  You know?
*  Fuck yeah.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  There's always going to be a guy that's at the head of the pack and he's that guy.
*  He's still to this day is that guy.
*  That's the craziest thing about Hendrix.
*  If you stop and think about Hendrix today,
*  there's some brilliant guitarists.
*  There's no doubt.
*  But when people today think about amazing rock and roll guitar, you think Jimi Hendrix.
*  In 2020, you just do.
*  It doesn't discredit all the great guitarists that are alive today.
*  When you think about the guitar, you think about Jimi Hendrix.
*  Yeah.
*  Voodoo Child, when it first came out, must have blown people's minds.
*  Was it like 69?
*  When did Voodoo Child's slight return come out?
*  He did two versions.
*  He did a Voodoo Child that was like a bluesy, slow version.
*  It's really cool and spooky.
*  It came out in 68.
*  68.
*  Have you ever heard the statement that like it's I've heard it multiple times,
*  but more specifically with Jimi Hendrix that like he existed in a world where he never could
*  hear Jimi Hendrix play guitar.
*  Oh my God.
*  He was Jimi Hendrix.
*  You know?
*  Whoa, that's so deep.
*  Of course.
*  Wait, wait, wait.
*  Did someone say that or did?
*  I've heard it said.
*  Yeah.
*  I've heard it I think a couple other times about other people, but it sticks out with him.
*  He got to well, I bet he did get to see Jimi Hendrix play guitar.
*  That's the thing.
*  That guy was on so much shit.
*  That's probably how he got to see Jimi Hendrix play guitar.
*  Probably got to see him from some LSD dimension.
*  Many feet away from his carbon based body.
*  But let's not forget, of course,
*  I mean for me, because I'm you know like 49 am I?
*  You tell me.
*  How old are you now?
*  53.
*  Are you really?
*  Yes.
*  On my way to death.
*  Halfway there if I'm lucky.
*  They're coming out with new weird shit that they're doing to people's bodies that
*  I have a feeling they're going to be able to extend life far beyond
*  what we think of as like the threshold.
*  We just have to survive past the threshold.
*  There was something someone sent me today.
*  A study that showed that
*  hyperbaric chambers with oxygen therapy.
*  Did you see that?
*  I saw that last night.
*  You saw it.
*  I figured you'd see it.
*  Yeah.
*  Hyperbaric chambers.
*  I think it's hyperbaric, right?
*  With oxygen.
*  With oxygen lowered people's biological age by 20 years.
*  I don't know.
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
*  Yes.
*  90 days, five days a week.
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
*  90 minutes of treatment.
*  Wait, wait, wait.
*  He's talking.
*  Hold on.
*  Let him talk.
*  I'm trying to...
*  Say what you said, Jamie.
*  That's the man.
*  It's like for 90 days they did five days a week, 90 minutes of treatment.
*  And within that time period I think a lot of these people were 65 and older had
*  however they measure it with telomeres and all that 20% or 25 years.
*  Someone then they're younger.
*  I think it was 20 years younger.
*  It's 20%.
*  20%.
*  And 25 years earlier.
*  It's somewhere so it's the end.
*  20% and 25 years.
*  So these people, you know what telomeres are?
*  It's an indication of your biological age or at least one of the markers.
*  And the idea is that as the telomeres shrink and shorten as you get older they shorten.
*  And if you can figure out a way to lengthen your telomeres and actually lengthen your life.
*  I am way too stupid to know if that's exactly true.
*  But I do know that it's something that people like Dr. David Sinclair and there's a lot of
*  people that really concentrate on science and its effect on telomeres and measuring telomeres.
*  They think it's a critical part of aging and anti-aging.
*  So if something can come along like this where you can get into a hyperbaric chamber and for 90 days
*  drop your biological age 20 years.
*  We got ourselves a short tank business bitch.
*  Let's show up.
*  All of us dressed in fur coats.
*  Who wants to live forever?
*  Come on boys.
*  Is it possible or?
*  I don't know.
*  I'm a moron.
*  I would imagine those smart people.
*  I know you say that on the show and I don't like when you say that.
*  You should like it.
*  I'm being honest.
*  I mean I'm a moron.
*  No you're not.
*  In comparison to the people that lengthen telomeres I'm a moron.
*  There's levels to this game.
*  There's levels to this.
*  That's just true.
*  Listen to me.
*  I'm an honest person.
*  I'm an honest person.
*  I am definitely a moron.
*  You gotta trust me.
*  I'm just not dumber than everybody.
*  I appreciate that you're being humble but you are not a moron.
*  I'm telling you I'm a moron.
*  I've met people that are really really fucking smart.
*  It's like you know how people like you know there's something that you know how to do.
*  It's something that you've met people that are really smart.
*  Yeah I know people.
*  No I know people that are actually smart.
*  You're smarter than them.
*  No I'm not.
*  Yeah you're smarter than most people.
*  Dude you're so wrong.
*  It's been frustrating for you probably.
*  You gotta trust me.
*  No because you're smarter than most people.
*  You're smart you're very very very very very hyper.
*  No I'm crazy.
*  I'm trying to tell you there's smart people and there's crazy people.
*  Crazy people don't have as many fears and they get more shit done because they're not
*  worried about the consequences.
*  Smart people figure out how to fix things.
*  Those are the smart people.
*  Isn't there's like something you do that someone doesn't really do and they think they're good
*  at it and you get a little annoyed.
*  Like say maybe there's a sport that you've done for a long time and someone just picks
*  it up and they think they can kick ass at it.
*  Or maybe like a yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  Not really.
*  I'm not that good at anything.
*  So you should think about that with intelligence too.
*  Because there's people that barely people like myself.
*  I like skateboarding.
*  I barely work at being smarter.
*  Barely work at being smarter.
*  Barely.
*  And to compare them to people whose entire lives are based on intellectual discipline.
*  Right right.
*  Is rude.
*  And there's a difference.
*  Because you're talking to all these incredible people that literally are really thinking
*  about really complex ideas at a level that is kind of not really easy to explain to the
*  average person.
*  So you can't put that in a box and send it out there.
*  Well that's where Neil deGrasse Tyson is so important.
*  Right.
*  Because he's a guy who's really good at taking those insanely complex ideas about the cosmos
*  and explaining them in a way that you can grasp if you have regular you know just regular
*  person.
*  High school education.
*  You can grasp what he's saying.
*  You're like oh.
*  So he'll resonate with people 15 to 50 to 50.
*  Five thousand years old.
*  How right.
*  He's a he bridges that.
*  I follow him on Twitter.
*  I love him.
*  I've never I've never met him.
*  I don't.
*  What do you think is the oldest that people will ever figure out how to make you.
*  I was joking about fifty five thousand.
*  But do you think there's ever going to be a time where people can live a thousand years.
*  Oh yeah for sure.
*  Within our lifetime you think.
*  No.
*  Would you want to.
*  Uh.
*  Man you're bored you'd be eight hundred years and dealing with 20 year olds.
*  I'm bored.
*  Imagine if you had a 20 year old son you're eight hundred.
*  You know what you're right.
*  You know he's fucking crazy.
*  I was going to say I'm bored now but I'm not bored now because I'm sitting here on this
*  with you.
*  Cheers.
*  I'm not bored now so I'm not bored either.
*  I think you could tell me that like a thousand years.
*  Yeah I mean eventually we may might run out of stuff to talk about you know.
*  This is my my thought my thought I mean I don't know if I want to live to.
*  A thousand years it's like OK we've talked about the absurdity of this or that enough
*  times you know.
*  Maybe people figure it out after a thousand years.
*  Michelle Wolf was telling me yesterday that I didn't know is it FDR.
*  Serve three terms.
*  Wait was it.
*  Michelle Wolf yesterday.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh.
*  Is it three terms is it FDR.
*  So hilarious.
*  Love her.
*  I love her.
*  That's so cool.
*  She's awesome.
*  So she was in Austin yesterday.
*  Yeah she was in Austin with Chappelle.
*  Oh wow.
*  That's so cool.
*  She said so I think she said it was FDR serve three terms.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah I was like I did not know that.
*  So she was saying that's one of the reasons why he got he was able to get so much shit done.
*  Like that makes sense.
*  That's interesting.
*  That was he served three terms.
*  Four elections though.
*  He won four elections.
*  At the very top of his Wikipedia says a member of the Democratic Party he won a record four
*  presidential elections.
*  Well what does that mean.
*  So you can do one and then come back a couple years later and do another one.
*  How many years were they back then because three doesn't make sense if it's 10 years
*  because I think he she was saying he served for 10 years.
*  So I believe what happened I'm trying to remember this.
*  This is part of the history thing.
*  I think he was the vice president for one president and so he stepped in and finished out one then
*  won the next election and then won another one.
*  There's so few people so few people that can hold that office and not make you worry.
*  That they got it.
*  I go oh he's got it.
*  That guy's got it.
*  There's a few guys in their office like say whatever you want about Bill Clinton.
*  When Bill Clinton was the goddamn president of the United States of America he might have
*  thought he's doing creepy shit and running around getting his dick sucked in madness
*  and maybe even a few people got offed.
*  I didn't think about any of that back then.
*  That's all come up in recent years.
*  Back then we weren't even thinking about that shit.
*  I felt like he had it.
*  You know like he's so smart.
*  Bill Clinton.
*  Absolutely.
*  He's so clever with words.
*  It's nice when you feel like okay somebody's looking after everything.
*  So we can go like you know tell jokes and do podcasts.
*  It's nice when you feel like someone smarter than you has the wheel.
*  That's the problem.
*  The people that have the wheel are not smarter than you you're like fuck.
*  Well you know sometimes they are smarter than you and sometimes they're not.
*  It goes back and forth.
*  It just got accepted.
*  It's pretty bizarre when you get to our age and you realize oh my gosh like they're just like
*  those you know like when you talked about like you go to the show and there's people with the
*  clipboards around and everybody's around.
*  There's a lot of that.
*  That's how the world runs.
*  There's a lot of people that want to be leaders that maybe probably shouldn't be but in their
*  head they want to be.
*  It's just the world's run the same way.
*  So it's a bunch of people sitting around trying to like you know I don't know.
*  What are you going to do?
*  You know I'm trying to ignore it Joe.
*  I honestly am.
*  I'm trying to ignore it and I want to and I'll say this.
*  Yeah no let me say this for real.
*  Like I like how you just re-braced yourself.
*  Change your posture for real because what I'm doing right now is like shirt over and everything.
*  No yeah for sure for sure.
*  Okay.
*  I mean like you know we just have to you know I'm traveling around in my van with my dog.
*  Chopper.
*  Chopper who's gone to sleep.
*  What a great dog right?
*  She's awesome.
*  She's gone to sleep and we're having a great time and yeah you just have to you know I just really
*  I'm trying to be positive you know I'm trying to be positive.
*  There's been so much negativity in our world in the last few years and everybody's sort of been
*  told oh I got to think this way or I got to think this way and there's this
*  anger towards each other and I just think.
*  I think you know this this election more people voted than ever voted you know that?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah it's crazy right?
*  Yeah.
*  I'm hoping that also sets a trend in motion where more people are running for office
*  that maybe could have a better idea of what people want than what they're experiencing
*  right now.
*  I think you are a big part of this Joe.
*  That's not helpful.
*  I really do though.
*  I really do.
*  I think you are a big part of this and I.
*  Only for people who listen and that's not a big part of the world.
*  No I think it is a big part and I think it's an important part because I think that
*  you know listen like let's just be good to each other.
*  Let's all be positive and be good to each other.
*  I know it sounds so cliche right but it really is the way to do it.
*  You don't have to be embarrassed about being good to your fellow.
*  But we're all worried that other people aren't going to be good to us back
*  and so we're like ready to be shitty.
*  Yeah don't worry about that.
*  That's where MDMA comes in so what I want to do is a long-term trial of MDMA across
*  the United States of America where everybody just gets a little taste.
*  So that.
*  Imagine if you ran on that platform.
*  I've never done.
*  MDMA for everybody.
*  I've never done.
*  Oh.
*  MDMA.
*  Is that what it's it's it's it's that.
*  It's ecstasy.
*  Ecstasy yeah I've never done ecstasy.
*  It's pretty potent stuff but it's yeah it's also not great for your brain.
*  Like after I did it and then the next day I was like oh my god I'm so dumb like my brain
*  was dried out.
*  Really felt like a sponge as someone just rang dry.
*  But then after a couple days it goes away.
*  Yeah.
*  Like oh let's try that.
*  Why they know you really take five HTP there's a thing you could take a nutrient.
*  Five HTP and actually it's it boosts your body's ability to.
*  I've never done ecstasy by the way.
*  Ever.
*  I'm telling you right now on the record I've never done it.
*  What if you did it alone in the woods.
*  I am telling you right now I would.
*  In your van.
*  I would do it.
*  But I'm not saying I wouldn't do it.
*  I don't I'm not judge passing judgment but I've never done it.
*  Actually that's true that's a fact I've never done I've never done ecstasy and I would do
*  ecstasy but I've never done it.
*  Sounds like you're asking for ecstasy if I was a cop I'd want to arrest you right now
*  like this motherfucker is asking for people to give him ecstasy.
*  I am not.
*  Say do you got any.
*  I know people who have it.
*  Yeah no I'm not asking for it.
*  No I'm not.
*  It's a tricky drug.
*  You don't want to be happy for no reason.
*  But but it is true that I've never done it by the way.
*  That's true.
*  I think I heard that.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what I heard.
*  You got any.
*  I heard you never did it.
*  No no but I.
*  I can't imagine it would be probably a lot of fun though I could imagine it would be.
*  It's supposed to be very therapeutic for soldiers.
*  Soldiers returning with PTSD apparently MDMA is very very good for them and overcoming
*  some of the situations they experienced.
*  Can I say something about the Canadian military.
*  Okay you can put your hat on.
*  You have to move the hat.
*  Getting excited.
*  You don't have to put it on.
*  So check this out Joe.
*  These boots.
*  I made for walking.
*  Can I show you this.
*  Yes.
*  Is that okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Check this out.
*  See these boots.
*  I don't think Jamie can see them though.
*  Can you see them.
*  Okay yeah.
*  Where's your.
*  Yeah check that out.
*  Yeah it's a boot.
*  Seriously can you kind of show that.
*  This is going to be cool.
*  Check this out.
*  Check this out.
*  These are Canadian army boots.
*  Okay.
*  I wore these.
*  You know I got them when I went to Afghanistan and did.
*  Yeah I went and did a tour with the Canadian army.
*  Dad my dad was in Canadian army.
*  My dad Canadian.
*  And you know check it out man.
*  Like these are good boots.
*  I'll tell you right now.
*  Are you telling me about your boots.
*  Is this what we've come to.
*  Canadian army boots.
*  Maybe we should wrap this up.
*  Yeah they're boots right.
*  What do they have like rubber leather a lot of shit like that.
*  Yeah they're comfortable laces.
*  Really comfortable.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  It probably is good time to wrap.
*  Why are you showing off your boots.
*  Can I have another pump of that.
*  Yeah sure.
*  When you're showing people your army boots and say you really need to get on this.
*  These army boots are like super special.
*  They're boots they're from Canada.
*  I think when you're Canadian you're like.
*  You're a little.
*  Proud of our.
*  We have a lot of stuff in Canada that people don't talk about.
*  They don't talk about it in America because.
*  But you know like.
*  You need a song.
*  Well I'm proud to be a Canadian.
*  Right.
*  Where I'm kind of sort of free.
*  Yeah very free very free very free.
*  Sort of free.
*  Very very free.
*  You don't have First Amendment though right.
*  No.
*  Well I mean.
*  No you don't.
*  You know the story about Mike Ward comedian who.
*  Yeah yeah I do yeah I know him.
*  He got in trouble and then there was another guy who got in trouble who was.
*  Involved in a heckling situation where these women were heckling him he said horrible
*  shit to them and they sued him and then they won in court.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a different sort of a situation over there.
*  So it's like they were insulting each other back and forth and he's on stage doing stand up.
*  And he wind up losing a shitload of money.
*  Remember that Jamie that was like I believe he was Vancouver Vancouver.
*  Montreal.
*  He was Montreal.
*  That was Mike Ward.
*  This guy was a different guy the guy.
*  Oh okay.
*  This guy I believe was BC.
*  Oh okay.
*  The one who lost the lawsuit to the ladies in the audience who were heckling him.
*  So they were heckling him.
*  I have not heard about that actually.
*  I know Mike though but Mike's a good guy.
*  Yeah I met Mike.
*  He's funny as fuck by the way.
*  I heard he's a very good stand up.
*  No no like Mike is hilarious.
*  I did a podcast with Mike.
*  Hilarious.
*  And I want to shout out to Mike Ward.
*  Yeah.
*  Lesbian wins 22.
*  Why do they have to say lesbian.
*  That's not Mike by the way.
*  But this isn't fucked up.
*  But hold on a second.
*  Guy Earle is the name of the comic.
*  But look what it says lesbian wins 20 22,500 over comedians insults.
*  Lesbian.
*  How about woman.
*  That's a weird headline.
*  I mean I got to admit that's a weird headline.
*  That is an identity politics headline.
*  Lesbian wins money.
*  Oh we know which side you should be on Tom Green.
*  Not on the side of jokes.
*  I honestly have no comment on that.
*  I don't even know what's going on with that.
*  You should not be on the side of defending yourself against hecklers or trying to ruin a show.
*  No you should be on the side of the lesbians.
*  I think it was actually in all fairness because one of the things that he said about her was
*  that she was a dyke or something like that.
*  I think it was just like one of those situations that I'm sure you've experienced
*  at comedy shows where people are drunk and they yell and shit.
*  Wait.
*  Comics yell and shit.
*  Wait Joe Joe Joe.
*  Audience members.
*  Your shirt.
*  Iron Mike Tyson.
*  Roy Jones Jr.
*  Yeah next week.
*  Tell me about this because I actually don't know.
*  I actually don't know.
*  I don't know a lot about that.
*  You don't know about this fight?
*  Well I know about it.
*  I do know about it.
*  Yes I do.
*  But I don't know.
*  I'm just not as in tune with the history of fights.
*  Well they're two of the all-time greats and listen they're both in great shape.
*  Roy Jones Jr. has this crazy footage on his page.
*  Israel Adesanya added to Mike Tyson's versus War Jones.
*  What?
*  Oh no shit.
*  Alongside Sugary Leonard.
*  Oh my god and Al Bernstein.
*  That's an amazing lineup.
*  Yeah.
*  That's amazing.
*  That's a great idea.
*  They're smart.
*  They're on the ball.
*  First of all Style Bender is the biggest superstar in the UFC right now.
*  So to have him him and Khabib Nemerghamov the two biggest superstars in the UFC for sure.
*  And John Jones.
*  Well there's a lot of superstars.
*  But the point is like having him be on a Mike Tyson card automatically boosted up and Larry
*  Merchant or no Al Bernstein.
*  Al Bernstein right?
*  Not Larry Merchant.
*  Al Bernstein's awesome boxing commentator and that's a weird fight because everybody
*  wanted to see that fight.
*  There was talk of that fight back when Roy Jones won the heavyweight title.
*  He beat John Ruiz and he was like about 200 pounds and Tyson in his prime was like you
*  know 215, 225 in that range and they had talked about those two fighting and it never came
*  to play.
*  So to see it happen when one is 54 and one is 51 it's crazy.
*  But Roy Jones looks insane man.
*  I know everybody talks about how good Tyson looks and Tyson looks incredible.
*  The videos of Tyson hitting the pads and he's doing it with Rafael Cordero who's this very
*  well respected MMA striking coach.
*  Rafael Cordero is legendary in the sport of MMA.
*  He runs King's Academy.
*  King's MMA in Orange County or Huntington Beach.
*  Where's King's MMA?
*  I think their base is like Huntington.
*  Anyway, Rafael Cordero has been training Mike Tyson.
*  There's all these videos of Mike Tyson hitting the pads and it's fucking insane.
*  He's so fast.
*  He looks so good.
*  It's crazy.
*  But then you've got to watch the Roy Jones Jr. clips.
*  There's Roy Jones Jr. clips that were put up over the last couple of days that Roy ramping
*  up for the fight.
*  He's 51.
*  He's 51.
*  You can't believe how fast his hands are.
*  At 51 he's like, he's throwing all these combinations.
*  He's like, oh my God, you forget like his song.
*  You like rap music.
*  Y'all must have forgot.
*  He's got a song.
*  Really?
*  Yes.
*  Roy Jones Jr. when he was in the middle of beating the fuck out of everybody.
*  When he was the number one pound for pound fighter on the planet with no questions asked.
*  He was also making rap music.
*  Really?
*  Yes.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Y'all must have forgot.
*  Damn.
*  Oh, just about what a beast he is.
*  Well, listen, he should be.
*  It's an interesting fight, man.
*  It's interesting because some people are against it.
*  They're like, I don't want to see these guys fight.
*  I don't want to see these guys get hurt.
*  But listen, that has been their whole business.
*  Look how good Roy Jr.'s hands.
*  Look, is this one of the recent ones over the last few days?
*  Look how fucking fast his hands are, man.
*  Right, right, right.
*  Oh, this is like a CBD ad.
*  Yeah.
*  So he-
*  What kind of CBD is it?
*  Left- oh, this is his company.
*  That's what it is.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Left hook CBD.
*  No bullshit.
*  Roy Jones Jr.'s left bicep is 30% larger than his right bicep.
*  It's weird to look at, right?
*  Wasn't it weird, Jamie?
*  Why?
*  Just because-
*  Freaks you out.
*  It might be more than 30%.
*  I might be selling it short.
*  That's his punching hand or-
*  His left is his front hand and he throws a lot of hooks so his bicep is really big.
*  It's enormous.
*  He jokes around about how much bigger it is than his right one.
*  You look at the two of them and you're like, oh my god.
*  So when you got into UFC and fighting and- do you enjoy that?
*  Well, yes, I do enjoy it.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, so what do you do?
*  What do you do?
*  Like, hey, next week let's go spar in the gym?
*  No, no, no.
*  Let's go fight?
*  I still do little jujitsu rolling but I don't spar, like striking anymore.
*  So how's that?
*  Like, do you do that though?
*  Like you go fight with people?
*  No, no.
*  Striking.
*  Like in an Oregon-
*  Listen, when you have gloves on and you hit each other in the head-
*  It sounds like it would be fun as hell.
*  I've never done that in my life, by the way.
*  I'm trying to tell you it's not good for you.
*  Don't do that.
*  Okay.
*  You should do that if that's what you want to do for a career or if you're young and
*  you want to see how good you can get at it.
*  But when you get to a certain point in your life, you shouldn't be getting hit in the
*  head anymore.
*  Right.
*  Because getting hit in the head is like getting poked in the eyes.
*  Right.
*  Don't get stronger.
*  Like, you know, we're talking about eyes.
*  As you get older, your eyes, even if you work out hard with them, they actually fall apart.
*  It's not like any other system in your body where you can train it to be strong.
*  Like you train your muscular system.
*  You can train like a lot of the things you do.
*  Like you get a pathway grooved where you know exactly how.
*  Martial arts are that way where you know exactly how to do it.
*  And as you do it longer and longer in your life, you get better at doing it.
*  Not with your eyes and not with getting hit in the head.
*  Those are two things.
*  When something happens bad to your eyes or something happens bad to your head,
*  it does not get better.
*  It gets a little better.
*  It does not.
*  But if you keep getting hit in the head, it's going to get worse and worse and worse.
*  So don't spar.
*  That's what I'm telling you.
*  Yeah, that's that's I love that because it's like, you know, that's, you know,
*  people think that they that it's just sparring, but it's you're getting hit in the head.
*  You're calling it just sparring and it is just some sparring.
*  I think I've never done that.
*  And now that I think about it, I haven't thought about this before.
*  That sounds like that would be probably pretty exciting and fun thing to do.
*  But I have been punched in the head a few times, Joe.
*  I'm sure you have.
*  I believe that.
*  Maybe once or twice.
*  I think most men by the time you get to be a certain age, maybe once or twice.
*  Something's hit you in the head.
*  Not more than 10 times.
*  But but all my point is, this is not to diminish anybody who loves sparring.
*  If you love sparring, just like if you love riding a dirt bike, go ahead and do it.
*  I'm not I want you to do whatever the fuck you want.
*  For some people, the value of sparring and getting that aggression out
*  is worth whatever brain damage they might get.
*  Or it's like skateboarding, too.
*  It's about risk.
*  It's about risk.
*  We have loved we need to take a risk because it makes us feel like, you know, like we're alive.
*  Yeah.
*  Taking a risk, you know, so so that's what it is.
*  I think it's a freedom issue, too.
*  Like you should be free to get punched in the head.
*  Right.
*  If you want to do it, if you and your buddy want to get together and punch each other in the head.
*  I don't think anybody should be able to stop you.
*  Absolutely.
*  But as your friend, I want to tell you that you have to think about getting hit in the head
*  than is the standard narrative amongst men that don't think about it.
*  Yeah.
*  The thing is like, don't be a pussy.
*  Put your gloves on.
*  Listen, if you get hit in the head too much, your brain doesn't work well anymore.
*  It just stops.
*  It stops functioning at a high level.
*  I start developing all sorts of problems.
*  I I don't.
*  Yeah.
*  So oh, my gosh.
*  You want some coffee?
*  No, I'm good, dude.
*  Yeah, I.
*  Don't spar, Tom Green.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  And don't listen to me.
*  If you want to spar, go ahead and spar.
*  For some people, it's better for them because they don't feel depressed.
*  Like they can get their their exertion out and sparring and they're fine with it for now.
*  And they're just going to deal with that.
*  I get it.
*  But it's just it's there's a reality of getting hit in the head too many times.
*  Yeah.
*  Only so many you have in you.
*  Yeah, it's better a thing to avoid.
*  For the wheels fall off.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't avoid it if you can.
*  Yeah, I yeah.
*  And yeah, well, it's I mean, it's it's I probably have been in a few of those, but Joe, this is good.
*  Can I bring Charlie back into the equation for a second?
*  You must.
*  Charlie, what do you want to bring her back in the equation for?
*  By the way, her new name is Chopper.
*  I thought we were just talking.
*  Chopper.
*  I don't have to, but I don't know why I thought your dog was Chopper.
*  Yeah.
*  Where did I come?
*  Where did I get that one from?
*  Did someone say it?
*  I feel like someone said it.
*  Yeah, I might have.
*  I might have said it.
*  Don't be nice to me.
*  If I made it up, let me know I made it up.
*  I'm not worried.
*  This this dog is so cool.
*  I agree.
*  Yeah, I feel really.
*  You're a salesman for a product I've already bought.
*  Yes.
*  This dog.
*  Well, you know, I'm just happy about how much how nice this doggy is.
*  I was just a good.
*  She's a good girl.
*  She's a young puppy that got really lucky.
*  She's a good girl.
*  She's a good girl.
*  I can tell by the way you guys cuddle.
*  You guys cuddle a lot.
*  She's a nice.
*  She's a nice doggy.
*  Do you have any plans to do another comedy special?
*  I can't wait to do one.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  When do you think you'll be comfortable enough to get in front of crowds?
*  Like tonight?
*  Yeah, sure.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  What would we have to do to get you on stage tonight?
*  Well, it's asked me to come.
*  But you wouldn't be worried to get into a big covid soup?
*  I would be.
*  But but it's Joe Rogan asking me to go to a show in Austin.
*  So we don't have a show tonight.
*  If I had a show tonight, I would do it.
*  I just I did a show last night for the first time in a week.
*  And the show before that I did the first time.
*  But if you were serious tonight right now, I would.
*  My point is like you're comfortable doing a show.
*  If you did a show tonight.
*  No, not at all.
*  You're not.
*  No, not at all.
*  But you take a risk.
*  Some small amount of risk.
*  Yeah.
*  If like right now there was a show, I'd go do a show.
*  Yeah, because it'd be hilarious.
*  We let's go.
*  We'd go have a good time.
*  It'd be great.
*  But I would not plan on going out.
*  I'm not trying to go do stand up right now.
*  I'm going to wait for the vaccine.
*  Yes.
*  That's what I hope it works.
*  That's what I'm doing.
*  We talked to Nicholas Christakis a couple of days ago.
*  And he was telling us about the vaccine and how it would work.
*  And I'm like, if it was proven to be effective and safe, I'd take it.
*  Yeah.
*  But I would want to know, man.
*  I want to talk to those doctors.
*  Want to know.
*  Tell me what you did.
*  You get the flu shot?
*  No.
*  I get the flu shot every year.
*  Congratulations, Tom Green.
*  Yeah.
*  I love immune system.
*  I like the flu shot.
*  What was the last time you got the flu?
*  I haven't had it since I started getting the flu shot.
*  Wow.
*  I used to get it all the time.
*  Coincidence?
*  No, no.
*  It was instantly.
*  As soon as I started getting the flu shot, I never got the flu again.
*  It was weird.
*  Jamie, when was the last time you got the flu?
*  It did exactly what it said it was supposed to do.
*  I don't know if I want to say I've ever even had it now that I've heard how bad it is.
*  Oh, I get it every year.
*  I go down the CVS, boom, boom, 26.
*  And you never get the flu because you get the flu shot.
*  So yeah.
*  Makes sense.
*  So well, this is what happened.
*  OK.
*  You'll appreciate this.
*  OK.
*  This is...
*  OK.
*  So I guess it was like, when I started doing stand up again, I was going out in the road
*  every weekend.
*  I would get the flu every year.
*  And then I decided to start taking the flu shot and I never got the flu again.
*  But yeah, so yeah, I think it works.
*  Well, that's anecdotal evidence, Tom Green.
*  And I'm going to take it into account.
*  We're going to go over this and apply it to all the other data and we'll get back to you.
*  If we believe your flu shot theory, it might be a crack of shit.
*  No, I think flu shots are probably great.
*  But I also think that keeping your immune system strong is great.
*  I think you've got to be on the ball.
*  And I think people don't want to hear that shit.
*  I need to know...
*  They want to be able to just go to the doctor and get it fixed.
*  I need...
*  Exactly.
*  I need to know...
*  I do need to be more aware of how to look after myself physically.
*  What am I supposed to be doing?
*  There's a simple body weight exercise program that you could do while you're out in these
*  remote locations.
*  You don't need anything.
*  I have weights with me.
*  Oh, do you?
*  Yeah.
*  You know what sometimes is even better than weights?
*  I got two 25 pound dumbbells.
*  Oh, that's good.
*  And I just do that.
*  Sometimes what's even better than weights is bands.
*  But I do it once every seven days, I'll do it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I'm not being very attentive to my health, to be honest with you.
*  How come?
*  Come on in and talk on that microphone, Tom Green.
*  Well, I mean...
*  All right.
*  Well, listen.
*  Listen, I'm...
*  I don't know.
*  It's weird.
*  You think about everything that's going on in the world all the time.
*  It rattles around in your head and you start to think...
*  Are you an empathic person?
*  Are you an empath?
*  Well, you know, I mean, in what sense?
*  I don't know if I'm using that word correctly.
*  Isn't that when you say an empathic person,
*  someone who's like deeply in tuned other people's suffering.
*  I think that's how I'm trying to use this.
*  Is that a correct definition?
*  I think I am.
*  Yes.
*  I think I am.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  That's what I'm trying to use a positive word for a sensitive person.
*  Showing an ability to understand and share feelings of another.
*  Okay.
*  I think that is what I am.
*  You seem like that kind of a guy.
*  So like when shit is awful.
*  When you say, can we all just get along?
*  Some people say it and there's not a...
*  You have a real sincerity to what you're saying.
*  It's like you really do want everybody to...
*  Like your happiness would be enhanced if people were getting along better.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  For sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, everybody should...
*  We should all just be having a good time.
*  I think we need to embrace those ideas.
*  I think that if there's anything that we can do as individuals,
*  like as...
*  Because society is so wack right now.
*  It's just so out of tune.
*  But the only thing that we can do to each other is like,
*  create the minimal amount of damage.
*  Like be as nice to each other as we can.
*  I'm not saying stop joking around.
*  I'm not saying just keep your mouth shut and don't talk about things you know that are wrong.
*  I'm not saying that.
*  I'm just saying there's ways in most of what we interact...
*  Most of the ways we interact with each other where we could be nice to each other.
*  We have to just think of ourselves as being in this together.
*  You're not a Republican.
*  You're not a Democrat.
*  You're a fucking human being.
*  And this idea that you have to be on that side or this side,
*  you have to support him or him or her or what the fuck ever, you don't.
*  Most of these people that are talking about politicians and these ideas that they're
*  fighting over as like a cornerstone of their life,
*  they don't even really deeply understand the people they're talking about,
*  the people they support.
*  There's a lot of things they're missing.
*  It's just the person syncs up with a good enough idea.
*  That's my team.
*  I'm a fucking Raiders fan.
*  Dolphins can suck my ass.
*  And next thing you know, you're looking at it the same way a sports fan does.
*  And that's what most people do.
*  And I think it's fucking nonsense.
*  You just have to have shit in your own...
*  We all have these weird competitive drives and instincts.
*  That's why people love to get dedicated to teams.
*  You want the fucking Buccaneers to go out there and kick some ass.
*  They get really dedicated to it.
*  It means a lot to them.
*  It feels good to them.
*  But it's a trap.
*  It's a trap.
*  And it's the same trap that leads you to Republican versus Democrat.
*  That same goddamn trap.
*  It's not good for any of us.
*  And most of the argument is started out with you're on that side,
*  this person's on the other side.
*  And then you're like, well, they can't be right because they're not over here.
*  And then you become married to you being right.
*  They become married to them being right.
*  And you're just duking it out.
*  And people will lie and fucking manipulate to try to win the argument.
*  And that's more common than not.
*  That's the weirdest thing about us.
*  And this is the basest, most primate level of like,
*  screaming at each other.
*  That is all happening right now, just filtered through really sophisticated law
*  and language and behavior in Congress and the Senate.
*  And it's all the same thing.
*  It's just like this.
*  And they're duking it out.
*  They're all duking it out.
*  The left and the right, the news anchors, the fucking,
*  the people on MSNBC and Fox News and everything is like,
*  all super ineffective ways of communicating.
*  Everybody's screaming into the night.
*  Doesn't it seem like that kind of?
*  That's what it is.
*  Seems like that's what it is.
*  Kind of, right?
*  It's not a good way to handle this.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  It's not a good way to handle this.
*  The best way to handle this is for everybody to just agree to be nice.
*  Start from that.
*  Let's go over the differences.
*  Let's go over the issues that we, how much money do you think should go to education?
*  And why?
*  Why is education so cheap to you?
*  How much do you think it costs to pay a teacher?
*  How much should it cost?
*  Is it a matter of how much you don't want to give up in taxes
*  or is it a matter of how much a teacher is actually worth?
*  We got a lot of things that we would all agree on.
*  If we could put it into a perspective of this is how much is actually going to
*  impact you in terms of how much you have to pay.
*  This is how it can actually impact you into how much your,
*  the actually quality of life, the quality of life in your community is.
*  How much it gets improved.
*  I think most people would be willing if they were absolutely certain
*  to know that the quality of their life would improve and where they live,
*  if they could just add more to the tax pool, they would probably do it happily.
*  Most people, if they really thought that it would enhance everybody,
*  that we're all on the same side.
*  I agree with that.
*  People think they're getting fucked.
*  That's part of the problem.
*  They think they're getting fucked and they think they're getting manipulated.
*  Why do they think that?
*  Because, well, let's go with California.
*  I don't think that.
*  California, when you're paying 13% in taxes, you're like, where's my money going?
*  How come you can go to Nevada and you pay zero?
*  How come I drive an hour that way and I pay zero?
*  What am I doing here?
*  Why am I paying so much money?
*  Right.
*  A lot of people think like that.
*  Sure. Sure. Yeah, that makes sense.
*  Yeah. Yeah, I guess, you know, I don't know.
*  I personally just kind of, you know, I was driving here today, right?
*  Austin, Texas.
*  I believe you.
*  And this guy at the freeway and people asking for money on the side of the freeway.
*  You know, you're like, tell me to get a job.
*  No, I did not.
*  I did not.
*  I feel I feel bad that we have to have that going on in our world.
*  Yes, it's very unfortunate whenever you see it because what it represents to me is a baby
*  that grew up and became a person that finds themselves on the side of the road asking for
*  money. And I don't know what's nature and I don't know what's nurture.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know what is drug addiction.
*  I don't know what's abuse.
*  I don't know what gets a person to that point.
*  I don't know their life.
*  But when I see them, that's what makes me sad.
*  Yeah, it makes me sad is that a person would get to this position and not have anybody to turn to,
*  not have anybody that they can rely on, not have anybody they love that loves them back.
*  Yeah, that's what that is.
*  If you see a person on the street, you're dealing with either drug addiction or a person
*  who doesn't have anybody who really loves them and they never grew up with someone who loves them.
*  So they don't understand love.
*  They're bad at relationships, they're bad at communication,
*  and they find themselves under a fucking overpass somewhere.
*  I think that should be something that we're all more aware of and we have empathy towards people.
*  When you look at a city.
*  That are in that situation.
*  When you look at a city like Los Angeles, for example, that's filled with tents,
*  you're like you're you're failing these people.
*  Whatever you're doing to take care of if you really want to be empathetic towards people that are
*  homeless or the people that are down on their luck, people that are downtrodden, you got to fix that.
*  I don't know how to do it.
*  I'm a comedian.
*  You fix it.
*  You have to come up with ideas to fix it.
*  You can't let it get worse every year because it just keeps getting worse.
*  LA is bananas right now.
*  Since you've left, how many tents do you think they popped up?
*  One million, one million new tents.
*  Okay.
*  I just made that number up.
*  Yeah, really?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I will say like it is sad when you drive around in the city and you're in this beautiful
*  city, Los Angeles, with all its history and everything and it's a beautiful place and
*  there's people sleeping under this.
*  Yeah, it's a bar.
*  Under the bridge and a tent here like man, come on, you know, like.
*  You know what happens though, man?
*  Together people, we should be able to help these people.
*  Right, but you know what happens?
*  These people develop communities and then they're all hanging out together on this like
*  tent strip and they know each other.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it's not ideal.
*  But then they started thinking about these people that are in apartments,
*  working shitty jobs, hating their lives.
*  And like, I don't know if this is any better or worse.
*  A lot of people have that perspective.
*  You could live on the beach in Santa Monica.
*  Yeah.
*  Set up a tent.
*  Like, you don't need much if you're one of those dudes.
*  There's a lot of dudes out there like, I don't need much.
*  I don't even have shoes.
*  Yeah, I feel like that.
*  I'm living in a van down by the river now.
*  So that's why I brought it up.
*  You're closing in on that.
*  I don't need much sort of thing.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  I mean, and it's funny how Charlie has been so quiet.
*  Has she been like the best dog?
*  She's an awesome dog.
*  I know a dude who started out doing what you're doing and then eventually just decided to
*  travel. He's a fitness guy, Steve Maxwell.
*  Eventually just traveled all over the world, got rid of his van,
*  stopped living in his van and started living in hotels and living wherever he gets hired to do
*  gigs. Just travel all over the world doing that.
*  Teaching fitness.
*  Wow.
*  Gave up on all his worldly possessions.
*  Fuck it. He lives out of a bag on his back.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Is he, yeah, I mean, listen, it's fun to be able to explore the planet.
*  Do you like going to other places?
*  Do you like going to new countries?
*  Yeah, I do.
*  What's your favorite country that you've been to?
*  Hmm.
*  Maybe Italy.
*  Okay, yeah.
*  Because I got a chance to go to the Vatican and you see the art collection.
*  Oh, that's cool.
*  And you wander around that place and just think of what kind of insane history it was.
*  Wow.
*  In that time of the world where Rome was conquering everything and you get to,
*  I went to Rome and saw the Colosseum and you're standing in this place where,
*  for who knows how many hundreds of years, gladiators fought to the death.
*  And just thinking about how bananas this whole situation must have been when this place was
*  filled and they would lift up the fucking bottom of the floor and there'd be a tiger
*  and a dude with a sword would fight off a tiger.
*  What the fuck, man?
*  This really happened?
*  And then you also see the beauty in their artwork.
*  There's something about Italy also because I'm Italian so it makes me think of my ancestors.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Someone wandering around this weird place.
*  I'm like, you guys were freaks.
*  I was like, no wonder I'm fucked up.
*  You guys were freaks.
*  You guys were freaks.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's incredible.
*  The Colosseum is bananas.
*  Yeah.
*  You just sit there and you think like, how many years did people entertain themselves
*  with other people getting slaughtered?
*  I read some insane statistic about how many people died in the Colosseum over the many
*  hundreds of years that it was around.
*  Wait, how many was it?
*  I forget.
*  It was hundreds of thousands.
*  It's too many.
*  It was an estimation.
*  I don't know if the estimation was even correct.
*  No amount would be too many but I mean it was too many regardless.
*  Let's guess.
*  I want to say it's close to 200,000 plus people died.
*  How many people died?
*  More?
*  What?
*  400,000?
*  400,000.
*  That's what it was.
*  So I knew it was in the hundreds of thousands.
*  So 400,000 people died in the Colosseum.
*  And a million...
*  400,000?
*  And a million animals.
*  Okay.
*  A million.
*  Wow.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  400,000 people and a million animals.
*  Over a period of how long, Jamie?
*  Fuck.
*  So think about America.
*  I want you to think of 1620.
*  Imagine a Colosseum built in 1620 is still rocking today.
*  There's a dude about to fight to the death with a fucking elephant.
*  He's got a spear and a shield.
*  He's going to fight to the death with an elephant.
*  He's probably going to get his legs snapped in half.
*  As the elephant stomps him as he shoves his fucking spear into its heart.
*  He's going to drag himself over to the elephant and finish it off.
*  That sounds so stressful.
*  Super stressful.
*  Oh my god.
*  They used to fill the bottom of the Colosseum up with water.
*  That is so stressful.
*  Super stressful.
*  Did they not want to just chill out and look at stuff?
*  That's the thing, man.
*  Italians are bananas.
*  Why not just like, hey, let's just look at everything and not do anything?
*  When I was there, I don't know if they do this for a show, for American tourists.
*  But when I was there, I had one of my daughters in the car with me.
*  This fucking Italian dude in Rome stops the car almost in the middle of an intersection
*  to compliment some woman on her figure.
*  He's like, oh, Maro, look at this one over here.
*  Literally a caricature and drives off.
*  I'm like, oh, Rome.
*  This is what happens to all the savages from Rome.
*  My people, they've turned into this now.
*  Now they're just nutty male taxi drivers.
*  When you see what they did in the Colosseum, what they decided to do was build up an arena
*  where people would fight to the death.
*  It became one of the most famous arenas in the history of the world.
*  If you stop and think of the history of the world, what is more famous in terms of like
*  an arena where you know that people did crazy shit and fought to the death?
*  There's no other place.
*  There's the Colosseum and that's it.
*  There's no other place where you think of that immediately makes you think of people
*  in sword fights and bows and arrows and lions.
*  It's only the Colosseum.
*  You know how crazy human beings are?
*  In the thousands and thousands of years we've been around, there's only one famous place
*  like that.
*  The garden is the closest I can think of.
*  Yeah, the garden.
*  But no one's dying in the garden.
*  That's why I drove and I'm going to honestly starting tomorrow and
*  going to all these little amazing places.
*  You know there's like 15 of those in New Mexico.
*  There's about 15 archaeological sites.
*  Of early architecture, native architecture.
*  Like the one you showed us, the cliff stuff.
*  So there's 14 of those?
*  There's many more actually.
*  Are they different?
*  Are they all in the cliffs or are they all different?
*  They are different and there are different places and there was this whole civilization
*  that was built up out there and we can just drive out there and go look at it.
*  You can go stand there in those spots.
*  So I was driving through Flagstaff, right before Flagstaff, Wuppatake.
*  I think it's Wuppatake.
*  But I just saw the sign.
*  National Monument.
*  I turned off and I went down and here you are all of a sudden you're standing in a place.
*  It's like it was built in, you know, stone walls around you.
*  They were built in this right here.
*  Oh my god.
*  Yeah.
*  Would you say, Jamie?
*  It's called Bandelier.
*  Like the thing your bullet's going?
*  I might be saying it wrong.
*  That's okay.
*  So it's like that.
*  So go to Wuppatake.
*  How do they get into those little holes?
*  They have ladders here.
*  I don't know how.
*  I don't think I've been there yet actually.
*  That's not, that's really different.
*  That's insane.
*  But there's stuff like that all over.
*  That's the move though.
*  Then you pull the ladder up at night and like get the fuck out of here.
*  Right.
*  Right?
*  Right.
*  You don't want that ladder down there during the day.
*  But it's like the Ewoks, you know?
*  It's all like the Ewoks.
*  That's heavy, man.
*  There's all these Ewok kind of...
*  It's just so weird to think that people lived like that just not that long ago.
*  And it's right there.
*  Yeah.
*  And you can go visit it.
*  You can just drive out there and go to it.
*  It just makes you think if you weren't born in this era, if you were born thousands of
*  years ago and you were born in this spot, this would be your village.
*  This would be where you live.
*  People like you and me, regular people, lived in that spot.
*  Yeah.
*  And you just think about what it must have been like to be alive.
*  Like the other one that you showed me, you said 1200 BC, right?
*  1200.
*  The Clift Wellings, Clift Wellings in...
*  Dude.
*  Gila, Gila National Forest.
*  800 years ago.
*  800 years ago.
*  You're sitting around 800 years ago and you're looking up at the sky and it's not,
*  there's nothing to separate you from the stars.
*  You've seen incredible stars and you're just trying to keep people from eating your family.
*  You're trying to keep other animals from eating you.
*  You're trying to eat animals.
*  You're trying to figure out how to keep the fire on.
*  You're trying to figure out how to make flint arrowheads.
*  They had, they had a macaw feather in, so this is a thing I think I announced.
*  In, this is interesting, in the, okay, I'm just going to clarify.
*  I'm not totally wasted.
*  This is kind of interesting.
*  They had a...
*  This is the cutest route to get this macaw feather story.
*  They found a macaw feather in there and then that means that they were trading with the
*  Yucatan Peninsula because...
*  Oh, because the macaw is from Yucatan?
*  They also found a bison bone in those, so that means there was not bison native to that area.
*  So that means they were trading with other...
*  Interesting.
*  There was not bison native to that area in the 1200s?
*  They could figure that out?
*  I guess, apparently.
*  You ever see all the shit that they do when they go back and look at...
*  Is it Plycene era?
*  What is the era where they had a North American lion?
*  There was a North American lion that was larger than the African lion that lived right here.
*  Okay.
*  I don't know.
*  Yeah, there was not a certain amount of time ago.
*  I think it was more than 15,000 years ago.
*  This place, North America, was filled with some really crazy shit, man.
*  Yeah, I bet.
*  Sabretooth tigers and all sorts of...
*  We were at...
*  When you think about Africa, you think about Leopards Asia.
*  Leopards are in Africa too, right?
*  Leopards, Jaguar is South America.
*  Jaguar is South America, right.
*  Leopards, lions, crocodiles, you think of the fucking predators.
*  Tigers are not in Africa.
*  They're Asia, right?
*  Yeah.
*  People always would think, oh, Africa, tigers, there's no tigers in Africa.
*  No.
*  You're right.
*  But there's plenty of shit that'll kill you.
*  Hyenas.
*  So you think all these wild beasts and then what...
*  When we think of like safari in Africa, the dangers of safari,
*  those are the animals you would think of.
*  North America apparently was filled with those things.
*  You know Antelope today?
*  You know what a North American Antelope is?
*  A pronghorn Antelope.
*  You ever seen one of those?
*  Did you see them on your trip?
*  They're really cool.
*  Oh, you saw one yesterday.
*  I did.
*  They're really cool, right?
*  It's actually on my Instagram.
*  Dude, those are prehistoric.
*  So if you go to my Instagram right now, okay?
*  Okay.
*  Let me...
*  Tom Green Live, what is it?
*  At Tom Green.
*  At Tom Green.
*  My Instagram.
*  I went, but seriously,
*  the only reason I'm really pushing it hard here, Joe,
*  is because I was driving down the highway yesterday
*  and we saw these Antelope and they were like really beautiful.
*  Yeah, they're beautiful.
*  And I said, whoa, and I went on Instagram story or whatever
*  and I said, hey, yo, check this out.
*  There's this Antelope and we turned around, we drove back,
*  we looked at them and they were beautiful.
*  They're a really weird animal.
*  They're an animal that predates all these,
*  the mass extinction of the North American large mammals.
*  So the North American large mammals like the African lion,
*  which was previous, but Sabertooth tiger, American cheetah,
*  there was a cheetah that lived in America that was really fast.
*  And those cheetahs are the reason why these pronghorns are so fast.
*  They're so fast because they evolved to get away
*  from an animal that doesn't exist anymore, but they still exist.
*  So they can run, North American Antelope can run much faster
*  than any other animal around.
*  So like everything else can eat shit.
*  They take off and those pronghorns take off.
*  They're fucking gone, man.
*  They're so fast.
*  Have you ever seen them in full clip?
*  No, no, they were just standing there, but it was beautiful.
*  Like it felt like you were kind of like, wait, this doesn't feel,
*  felt sort of like you were in a different sort of place.
*  They don't belong.
*  They don't belong.
*  Yeah, they do.
*  Obviously they belong, but they don't belong
*  in the sense that they're from a different time.
*  Their eyes are set on the sides of their head this really weird way,
*  but they can literally see almost behind them.
*  So like if you're, if you're, if this is like an Antelope,
*  it's looking here and you're over here, they see you crystal clear.
*  Okay.
*  Crystal clear.
*  They just don't see you back here.
*  Right, right, right.
*  Right here, they see you a hundred percent.
*  They see you a hundred percent here.
*  They see in a full range that we can't even comprehend
*  because their eyeballs are out here.
*  They don't even look like they belong here.
*  They look like an avatar.
*  Why are, why are?
*  Pull up a picture of a pronghorn Antelope's face.
*  Antelope.
*  Look at his face.
*  This really, there's some, there's some cool close-up ones
*  that show how bizarre their eyes are.
*  Like that one up, the one in the upper left-hand corner.
*  Click on that.
*  Get close to them.
*  Home on the range.
*  Look at his eyes.
*  See how wide his eyes are behind his head?
*  Where the deer and the Antelope play.
*  Fascinating animal.
*  And that animal exists because.
*  Oh, give me a home.
*  There was a thing called the North American cheetah.
*  Where the buffalo roam.
*  And the skies are not cloudy all day.
*  Yeah.
*  Antelope.
*  Oh, that's beautiful.
*  You know, it's.
*  Here's a good question for you, Tom Green.
*  Okay, yes, sir.
*  We don't want animals to go extinct, right?
*  Yeah, right.
*  We don't.
*  No one does.
*  But they do.
*  And most of them have gone extinct.
*  All right, we don't want anything to be extinct for sure
*  because of humans.
*  But animals have been going extinct since 90 percent of all animals that have ever existed
*  aren't here anymore because there's some weird sort of a contest going on with all of the
*  animals on the planet, us included.
*  Yeah.
*  Would we be comfortable accepting the fact that we are like a dodo bird?
*  We're some sort of a dying species.
*  I would be comfortable with that.
*  Would you be comfortable with that out there in the middle of nowhere in your van
*  hanging out with Chopper?
*  I assume that's the case, to be honest with you.
*  I think so, too.
*  I don't think that's bad for people.
*  I feel the same way I feel about someone saying, do you want to live to be a thousand?
*  I don't want to live to be a thousand.
*  That's a long time.
*  But I don't want to not live to be a thousand.
*  I like life.
*  I like it right now.
*  I'm enjoying it.
*  It's getting a bit repetitive.
*  Well, you're out there in a fucking van, Tom Green,
*  hanging out with your dog every day like Groundhog Day.
*  But yeah.
*  No, but I agree.
*  It's getting a bit repetitive.
*  But yeah, no, absolutely.
*  I'd like to live to be a thousand.
*  A thousand's a long time.
*  A thousand?
*  You might be able to figure some shit out.
*  A thousand's a long time.
*  Imagine though if you're a thousand and you were dating 18-year-olds, what a creep you would be.
*  Would they make a new rule?
*  If you were a thousand-year-old guy and you had an 18-year-old girlfriend,
*  enough, you piece of shit.
*  Doesn't matter what you look like.
*  I don't think it would be that.
*  What do you think?
*  I think.
*  Wow.
*  Chopper's asleep?
*  First of all, I'm looking at Chopper here.
*  I like how you changed her name.
*  You renamed her.
*  You like my Swiss Army knife?
*  I do.
*  You're out there out in the wilderness.
*  My dad gave me that.
*  You could do a lot of shit with this thing.
*  Open cans.
*  When I was a kid, my dad gave me that.
*  Do you use it as a can opener?
*  I do.
*  I have a few times.
*  I bet you do.
*  I remember the first time I ever-
*  Well, bottle opener.
*  Opened a can with a Swiss Army knife, the can opener one.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Oh, you know, I actually opened a can of tuna with it the other day.
*  It was oddly satisfying.
*  Because there's been a couple of nights in the last few weeks where I've been
*  saying, you know what, I want to have dinner.
*  No one don't want to have for dinner tonight.
*  What?
*  I just want to have a can of tuna and I don't want to go to bed.
*  That's it?
*  Do you worry about getting enough food or having food or making sure you're at a place
*  where you can store food?
*  No, no.
*  Is this something you just have a schedule?
*  We buy food on Monday.
*  No, no.
*  It's like I've been just driving around and I've-
*  Shooting squirrels?
*  No, no.
*  But I-
*  Eating rabbits?
*  No, I have not eaten a rabbit, actually.
*  You've never eaten a rabbit?
*  No, I've never.
*  Have you ever had frog legs?
*  Yes, I have.
*  That's pretty goddamn good.
*  Oh yeah.
*  But you haven't done any fishing where you caught a fish in this whole trip and ate it?
*  So-
*  You should do that.
*  You should make that a priority.
*  Yeah.
*  Find a good spot.
*  Because there's something about catching a fish and then eating it right away.
*  Man, it's amazing.
*  I did it in Utah.
*  My friend Brent, we went ice fishing.
*  Caught a rainbow trout.
*  Yeah.
*  Cooked it like a couple hours later.
*  It's magical.
*  Yeah.
*  Make you feel like you're self-sustaining out there, Tom Green.
*  I got a-
*  Okay, I got a story about that.
*  Please.
*  But like-
*  So I did catch a fish on this trip.
*  Oh.
*  All of a sudden you caught a fish.
*  Yeah, but it was the first fish I caught and it wasn't, you know, it was a sunfish.
*  And it wasn't like I didn't catch it too good.
*  It was kind of a tough situation.
*  I felt bad, you know, and I just haven't fished again since then.
*  Oh, okay.
*  You know, sunfish are good to eat, right?
*  I grew up when I was a kid, those, you know, would catch those in the perch and all that.
*  But it's like, yeah, yeah.
*  How come you decided not to cook it and keep it?
*  Well, no, it was this last time.
*  The only time I know of.
*  I wasn't really fishing for a sunfish, you know.
*  I was trying to catch a bass or a trout or something.
*  Something larger.
*  Yeah.
*  I got a little sunfish and it was-
*  You decided not to keep it?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's the problem with not keeping it.
*  Like-
*  There was nothing you could do.
*  I hear you.
*  Yeah.
*  Why not just keep it?
*  Cook it.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I wasn't, I guess, I guess I could have probably still probably-
*  Was it of legal size or was it tiny?
*  No, it was just, it was just, it was just, you know, you kind of figured, oh, okay.
*  Well, it'll probably like, I thought it figured it probably would have lived, you know, so I let it go.
*  I let it, I released it.
*  A lot of catch and release fish don't live.
*  Yeah.
*  I was hoping it would though.
*  Fishing is a weird thing, man, right?
*  I don't like it.
*  You're standing on the edge of a world and you're throwing in a trick.
*  So that's what I'm saying.
*  So listen, here's the thing.
*  Okay.
*  So-
*  Okay.
*  Now we're talking about this.
*  What are we talking about?
*  I did that like I was a kid, like as a kid in Canada, I would go with onto an,
*  onto a wharf in the middle of a lake, lower Beverly Lake.
*  This is where I grew up when I was a kid.
*  Okay.
*  Check this out.
*  This is a obscure geological place, lower Beverly Lake, Canada.
*  And I grew up there and we would go out there and I would meet my friends.
*  We would catch a Northern pike.
*  I love Northern pike.
*  Off the dock.
*  We'd catch like five a day.
*  Boom.
*  These-
*  Awesome fish.
*  Fish this big.
*  And then, you know, you would eat them.
*  It tastes good.
*  Their bones are the shape.
*  They're like, shaped like Y's.
*  They're a little Y's.
*  And these, and, and, and, and, and-
*  They're a little bony.
*  Like when you're-
*  Very, yes.
*  Yeah.
*  When you're eating them.
*  You gotta pick out some bones.
*  Largemouth bass is like a sea bass.
*  It's the Canadian sea bass.
*  You know?
*  And that was a delicious thing.
*  You know what they say that largemouth bass in particular, they taste better in cold water?
*  Like cold water bass, like what you would catch where you live versus what someone
*  would catch in Florida.
*  Yours would taste better.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's interesting.
*  I don't know if that's true.
*  Did they say that?
*  Yeah.
*  I've heard that.
*  I don't know if it's true.
*  Smallmouth bass are supposed to taste better than largemouth bass.
*  And so the smallmouth bass put up a better fight than the largemouth bass.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what everybody says.
*  They're more aggressive.
*  So you could get like a two pound smallmouth is gonna like-
*  And people prefer them to eat too.
*  The people that eat bass, yeah, they prefer smallmouth over largemouth.
*  I don't know enough, but yeah, that's the word.
*  Smallmouth bass are supposed to taste better than largemouth bass.
*  So it's pretty crazy.
*  And then so like, you know, but like catfish, I've got a few of them in my day as well.
*  Catfish are awesome.
*  You ever see those people that go noodling?
*  Would you do that?
*  I would do that, yeah.
*  Would you?
*  You don't give a fuck about your fingers, huh?
*  I don't give a fuck.
*  What about snapping turtles, son?
*  You ever think of that?
*  That moment Tom Green realizes his fucking hand is in the grip of a shell dinosaur.
*  I can tell you, I have snapping turtle stories.
*  I mean, you know, like I've been in front of snapping turtles as a kid and you realize,
*  it's like, oh, this thing's head's the size of a coconut.
*  And it's gonna bite your dick.
*  Yeah, I'm staying away from that.
*  So it's kind of pretty interesting when you're, when you're-
*  I saw a snapping turtle when I was a kid.
*  I was like, I was living in Florida, so I had to be between 11 and 13.
*  And we saw the snapping turtle in the middle of the forest.
*  We were poking at it.
*  It was snapping at us.
*  I was like, oh my God.
*  It was so big, it almost seemed like somebody's pet.
*  They just like, fuck this thing.
*  And they just let it go, which people do in Florida.
*  That's why they have all those pythons everywhere.
*  You know, they have pythons everywhere in Florida.
*  And they like, they caught an 18 foot long the other one the other day.
*  Yeah.
*  They have alligators everywhere.
*  And when I was a kid, I saw a fucking snapping turtle and I remember thinking like, what?
*  Yeah.
*  What is this thing doing?
*  Just wandering around where people live.
*  But the snapping turtle is the only like, kind of like weird sort of like, you know,
*  like, like when you talk about crocodiles and, and-
*  Have you ever seen a crocodile snapping turtle?
*  Jamie.
*  Crocodile snapping turtle son.
*  Get ready for the next level of horror.
*  Right?
*  Snapping turtle has an ugly cousin and the ugly, meaner, more demonic cousin
*  is the alligator snapping turtle.
*  Look at that fucking thing.
*  Wow.
*  Was I joking?
*  Imagine that big thing is trying to bite your foot.
*  Okay.
*  So that actually, that actually looks like a snapping turtle.
*  So that's what I'm talking about.
*  Dude.
*  Yeah.
*  So I grew up with-
*  The one on the right is a snapping turtle.
*  I saw those when I was a kid.
*  The one on the left is an alligator snapping turtle.
*  I remember my, my dad and I, we went, we, we, we were like camping on this and this thing
*  came up and I was like, wow, that's like a, like an alligator.
*  And you're a kid and you're in like Canada and there's things-
*  You saw one of those?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Where do those things live, Jamie?
*  What's their range?
*  They're all over.
*  I've never seen one of those in a while, but I would-
*  It's a snapping turtle.
*  Shit my pants if I saw that fucking monster.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And they swim up and you're sitting there going like, well, that thing's the head's
*  the side of a, you know, like that could, that could, that could probably potentially hurt.
*  I saw a regular snapping turtle.
*  The one I saw when I was a kid, it was a regular one.
*  Yeah.
*  It wasn't that big.
*  Nothing like that thing.
*  But the mouth on that thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh.
*  Primarily southeastern U.S.
*  Florida Panhandle to East Texas.
*  Wow.
*  Okay.
*  Well, what's the snapping turtle that's in Ontario?
*  You know what, man?
*  I mean, especially how old were you when you saw this?
*  I don't know.
*  It's like, I don't know.
*  Six.
*  Yeah.
*  Imagine how little you are and how big that is and your little six-year-old memory trying to-
*  It's probably a regular snapping turtle, but it just seemed like the size of a fucking building.
*  So I can describe the exact scenario.
*  Okay.
*  Check it out.
*  This is what happened.
*  Okay.
*  I think about this a lot.
*  Snapping turtle story?
*  No, I think about this in my life.
*  It's one of those beautiful memories that you think about in your life and go, wow, that's cool.
*  That's when you realize how the fucking world worked.
*  Okay.
*  Me and my dad, we jumped in a canoe at my, we had a little, they had a-
*  Did you really jump in or did you step in carefully?
*  My dad and I had gotten in a canoe and we went out, we went fishing.
*  We went fishing.
*  We went over to the other side and we set up a tent.
*  We camped out, we went fishing, we caught two largemouth bass and it was an amazing night.
*  It was beautiful, beautiful, beautiful time.
*  That's it?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, no, no.
*  So, also no, no, sorry.
*  I forgot what it was going to say actually.
*  Something about snapping turtles, right?
*  You're right.
*  Yeah, you just said that's it and you forgot the snapping turtle part.
*  No, no, no.
*  Listen.
*  So listen, this is what happened.
*  We went out to this island.
*  We went out to this island.
*  Okay.
*  And I remember, okay, so.
*  We were shaking hands?
*  Yeah.
*  How drunk are you, bro?
*  Very drunk.
*  All right.
*  Yeah, no, I'm great.
*  I'm good.
*  I'm good.
*  Cheers.
*  I'm great.
*  I'm good.
*  I'm not, I'm not, I'm in control.
*  I understand.
*  Cheers again.
*  Good.
*  I'm not very drunk.
*  I'm great drunk.
*  I'm great drunk.
*  You're a good man.
*  This is like one of the all-time good times ever.
*  I listen, you know I love you.
*  Like when you put it down like in a book, you go like,
*  what was the best time ever?
*  This was the best time.
*  Let's give it like top 20.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  We don't have to make it the best.
*  Put so much pressure on ourselves.
*  Good time.
*  Good time.
*  Yeah.
*  So what's the goal for the end of this walkabout,
*  this motor vehicle powered walkabout?
*  When are you going to bring this dock, this boat into the dock?
*  Well, I'm going to, I'm going to just, I don't know.
*  I actually, I'm not sure actually to be honest with you.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I definitely, I'm going to go see my fam up in Canada at some point.
*  But are you allowed to drive to Canada right now?
*  Yes.
*  How's that work?
*  Because you have a double ID?
*  Because you're a fucking spy?
*  You're so like on, you're like, you're like very like in tune with everything, aren't you?
*  What do you mean?
*  Like it's like, it's like, like, yeah, of course.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  But you're, you're, you're so like, Joe, like, I mean, yeah, absolutely.
*  Yeah.
*  How, how are you so connected with everything?
*  What am I getting to with?
*  I'm just asking if you have a dual citizenship passport thing where you can get into Canada.
*  Listen to things like, you know, cause here's the thing when you, when you stand up, you know,
*  when you stand up, you're traveling around the country and you go to all these shows
*  and everyone's interviewing and everyone, but like you like really are,
*  you listen and connect with people.
*  How did you feel?
*  How did you realize that you knew how to connect with people?
*  I'd learned that I'd do it.
*  I wasn't very good at it at first.
*  Honestly, I'd, I'd fuck conversations up because I would talk when I didn't want,
*  I shouldn't have talked.
*  Like you don't realize it while you're doing it.
*  You're not trying to be an asshole.
*  You're trying to just get, you have an idea in your head.
*  You just don't know how to, you don't know how to seamlessly integrate your ideas into
*  a conversation with someone else's ideas.
*  Is there's a dance going on and the dance is not just what you want to say.
*  And some comedians, they do it very poorly because all they think about is what they
*  want to say.
*  They don't think about what you're saying.
*  And if they don't think about what you're saying, then they're not,
*  they're not really dance partners.
*  They just expect you to move with them.
*  And I've been that person before we've all been that person.
*  It's not the right way to communicate with people.
*  So you learn over time that part of the dance is you, you have to like the person.
*  You have to listen to what they say.
*  You have to give them some love.
*  You have to be interested in what they're saying genuinely.
*  You have to be in tune on the same idea.
*  So if you're, if you're telling me about an idea, I'm listening to this.
*  I got to be in tune with you the way you're thinking.
*  I can't just be waiting to say what I want to say.
*  A lot of comedians are just waiting to say what they want to say.
*  They're not, they're not trying to help you get the most out of what you're saying.
*  Yeah.
*  As Jack Benny is like, was Johnny Carson's idol and hero.
*  And Jack Benny, you know, would often have on all these great comedians of the day.
*  And people would say, you know, why, how do you feel they're getting all the laughs?
*  You know, you said, yeah, but it's my show, right?
*  It's my show.
*  So it was like, yeah.
*  So, so well, here's the problem, man.
*  Yeah.
*  That's, there's, there's, you could look at it that way.
*  But that doesn't help you as much or it doesn't, I should say it doesn't, didn't help me as much
*  as looking at it.
*  Like I don't, I don't have any control currently over what's more funny in the moment,
*  nor should I want it to be me.
*  What I should want to do in the moment is laugh at things that are funny
*  and not think while I'm laughing at something that's hilarious.
*  Why am I not the funniest one in the room?
*  You can't think like that.
*  It doesn't do you or the moment any good.
*  It certainly doesn't do the person who's got a really funny thing to say.
*  Like when you, when you grow up and stand up, because a lot of like my growth and standup
*  is hanging out with Joey Diaz.
*  When you're hanging out with Joey Diaz, you're always the second funniest person,
*  no matter who you are.
*  She's just the funniest guy that's ever lived.
*  So like that helped too, is being around Joey, you're never thinking,
*  I have to be the funniest.
*  Yeah.
*  All you thinking of is like let Joey be as funny as he can.
*  And then just do yourself, but your job when you're around someone like Joey is just let
*  him be as funny as he can.
*  Just give him as much encouragement as you can give him.
*  Let him be as funny as he can.
*  Because he's, when he's fun, when you're encouraging him, he's free.
*  He's supported, he's loved and he's free.
*  And then he becomes the funniest guy that ever lived.
*  You've got a lot of freedom though, because then you could like fuck around
*  in the, in the, in, in, you know, like, and just be hilarious in that
*  area where he's, he was carrying a lot of that energy, right?
*  Well, you could also just enjoy-
*  He kind of gave you a sort of a support system.
*  Like he created a nice support energy.
*  Like that was, this was the area that you grew up in.
*  Well, you all feed off each other for sure.
*  Everyone feeds off everyone's particular thing that they're really,
*  really good at or success that they're having.
*  Everyone feeds off of it.
*  It's all, we all, everyone works it in together.
*  But there was a thing about Joey where he was so funny and so ridiculous
*  that he made other things more ridiculous.
*  He made other people's bits more ridiculous.
*  He was so far, he was so far into I don't give a fuck land.
*  He was so down the road that you were yelling at him, where are you going?
*  And he was like, come on, cocksucker, follow me.
*  He was so far ahead.
*  He was so deep into I don't give a fuck land.
*  Right, right.
*  It like my point is with all things, whether it's with podcasting or with standup comedy
*  or with martial arts or with basically anything you do, we're all a mix of all the people that
*  we've met and their influence as well as who we are and what our own expression is.
*  But we're a mix of all these other people and all these other, there's so many fucking people
*  that influence you.
*  We're not, we're not autonomous.
*  We're not alone.
*  We're never.
*  And that's good and bad.
*  The bad part is people know that they can influence you because they know that you're
*  not alone.
*  That's where bad comments come into play.
*  The only reason why it's like a negative thing is because it makes you feel bad.
*  And the only reason why it makes you feel bad is because that's the intention of the
*  person who's doing it.
*  Like it's a thing that people do because we aren't all alone.
*  We do, we can reach out blindly and infect each other and hurt each other and smash it.
*  We can do it.
*  We can reach out blindly because we're weirdly connected in some way that we want to
*  ignore.
*  That's why it hurts when you read shitty comments.
*  Because we're weirdly connected in some previously not completely understood way.
*  And you can just decide to not look at them?
*  Yes.
*  Just like you can decide to work out.
*  Just like you can decide to drink only water for a month.
*  Just like you can decide to eat only ribeye steaks for a month.
*  Just like you can decide to run a mile a day for a month.
*  Just like you can do a thousand push-ups a month.
*  You can do whatever the fuck you want, Tom Green.
*  You just have to decide that's what you're doing.
*  I can do a thousand push-ups a month.
*  I bet you could.
*  I can.
*  That's the key.
*  The key is for sure you could.
*  That's not that much.
*  I mean I'm not sure if I could this month but maybe next month.
*  Well a thousand, that's a hundred a day for ten days.
*  That's not that bad.
*  Okay, maybe next month.
*  You can do a thousand pretty easy.
*  You know?
*  I could probably do ten push-ups.
*  Well you've got to do what?
*  Thirty-three a day?
*  Thirty-three a day is a thousand in a month?
*  Thirty-three.
*  Thirty-three push-ups a day.
*  Can I do push-ups right now?
*  Sure you could but why would we do that?
*  I mean how drunk are you that we're really going to bring ourselves to that?
*  Pretty drunk.
*  Plus this podcast is like eight hours old, right?
*  How many hours is it, Jamie?
*  Four fifteen.
*  Be funny.
*  It'd be funny to do something.
*  It's gone a long way.
*  Be funny to do push-ups.
*  It'd be funny at this point.
*  I don't think it would.
*  Okay, all right.
*  I understand.
*  All right.
*  I understand what you're coming from.
*  Cheers.
*  So that's what, how do we get to that about push-ups and?
*  I'm just.
*  Get up in the morning.
*  Where did that come from?
*  Okay, check it out.
*  I'm going to do something, okay?
*  No.
*  Watch.
*  Let's end this.
*  Close it.
*  Close it down, Jamie.
*  He's going to do something.
*  He's going to regret.
*  No, you can't if you want.
*  I'm just joking.
*  You want me to do push-ups?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Let me do something.
*  Okay.
*  Come on.
*  What are you going to do?
*  There won't be a camera on you though.
*  Charlie's chilling.
*  How many push-ups are you going to try to do?
*  Don't hurt yourself.
*  Let's see if I can do ten.
*  Okay.
*  That's reasonable.
*  I like what he said.
*  He said, let's see if I can do ten.
*  That's a very reasonable thing to say.
*  Yes.
*  Okay, go ahead.
*  All right.
*  Okay.
*  All right, let's see.
*  Ready?
*  One.
*  Tom Green, ladies and gentlemen, he will be appearing at a truck stop near you.
*  If you are in upper northern Utah near the trailhead, holla at him.
*  He has a podcast.
*  It's.
*  Oh my God.
*  What were those noises?
*  Oh, that was her.
*  Oh my God.
*  Your dog was shaking her ears.
*  I thought it was your back cracking.
*  Ten push-ups.
*  Congratulations.
*  I literally thought that was your back cracking.
*  No, no.
*  I was like, he's going to die.
*  And it's going to be my fault that I didn't stop him.
*  Oh, Charlie.
*  Charlie.
*  Chopper, bro.
*  Her name is Chopper.
*  Chopper.
*  Yeah.
*  No, Joe.
*  Thanks, man.
*  Thank you, Tom Green.
*  Listen, thank you originally for inspiring me because you really did.
*  The day that Red Band and I went to your studio and I saw your house and how you had it set up.
*  That was one of the first seeds that were and I was on Fear Factor back then.
*  But I remember wandering around your place, how you had it set up and you were very gracious and
*  very hospitable and took us around.
*  You were an awesome host and you were so happy that you did this.
*  You wanted to show everybody.
*  It was a cool thing.
*  We left there going, God, first of all, God damn, how nice is Tom Green?
*  We both said that.
*  And they were like, how cool is what he's doing?
*  Like it made me think that that could be done.
*  So Red Band and I, we were in, so Red Band, you know.
*  He's moving here.
*  I know.
*  I knew that.
*  Yeah.
*  You're like, you guys are like taking over Austin, right?
*  No, we don't want to take over anything.
*  We just happen to be moving here.
*  Yes.
*  Love this place.
*  No, I remember saying in a positive way, you love it.
*  You love Austin.
*  Yeah, we do love it.
*  When we saw your place, dude, with the servers and the fucking, he had these,
*  you got to think what year was it that you were doing this?
*  So Red Band and I were in San Diego.
*  In your house.
*  What year were you doing it?
*  Oh, 2004?
*  2005.
*  Maybe.
*  So you have to think, folks, it's not possible to do this show with YouTube.
*  It's not possible to do this show with, you know, there's no social media to speak of.
*  You can't really stream anywhere.
*  So Tom Green decides to do a website where you can stream it from a website.
*  Like you were miles ahead.
*  So it's like when I was saying about my dad earlier, right?
*  My dad was a tank commander, right?
*  And so in the Canadian military, when he was finished doing the tank, he was working,
*  tank commanding, he was working with the Department of National Defense and computers,
*  right?
*  Cobalt computers.
*  So yeah, so like, yeah, it's just kind of like,
*  I was always just computers have always been around up in Canada.
*  So but you, it wasn't just computers, dude.
*  It was the idea to do a show on the internet.
*  I even met with the people that you were working with back then.
*  Remember you were working with like a group of people that hosted the website and did all the
*  logistics and everything.
*  Yeah.
*  I met with them in Denver.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  But I remember thinking, I don't have the time for this.
*  This is too much.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't want, you know, I was thinking about this.
*  No, this is not for whatever reason.
*  I wasn't ready for doing.
*  And then we started doing some stuff on Justin TV.
*  And then we eventually went to Ustream and then it went to iTunes and YouTube.
*  Because it was a very obscure space back then.
*  There was like, well, there wasn't many people even thinking about it, but it was still kind of.
*  But it was 100% inspired by you.
*  100%.
*  It was inspired by you and inspired by Opie and Anthony.
*  You because you did it on your own and Opie and Anthony because they created the hang.
*  And then Anthony Kumia did a show in his house called Live from the Compound.
*  Where he would like play karaoke holding a machine gun.
*  He had a green screen behind him.
*  It was madness.
*  Okay.
*  Madness.
*  He was doing it by himself.
*  He was just having fun, being silly.
*  Right.
*  And he did it.
*  I believe he was on Ustream.
*  I believe Live from the Compound was on Ustream.
*  And he had beer taps in his house.
*  So he'd be drinking Guinness on tap, singing, having a fucking party.
*  And he was doing that all on the side.
*  And then SiriusXM decided they didn't like it because he was on the Opie and Anthony show.
*  And they were like, listen, you can't do that too.
*  And he was like, but it's just an advertisement for my show.
*  It's not hurting anybody.
*  They didn't want him to do it.
*  And then it became like a big sticking point.
*  And then eventually he wound up doing Compound Media.
*  But Live from the Compound was the original show.
*  So those are the in order, the things that influenced me to do the podcast.
*  Number one, your show.
*  Number two, Opie and Anthony, they're both interchangeable because they're both around
*  the same time.
*  And then after that, Live from the Compound.
*  Because I remember seeing that going, oh, OK.
*  Because this can be done way cheaper than what Tom Green is doing.
*  I'm like, what Tom Green is doing requires businesses to get involved.
*  But what Live from the Compound was doing on Ustream, he just spent a lot of money and
*  developed his own studio.
*  He put his own green screen.
*  He had his own professional microphones like this kind of set up.
*  But he did it all.
*  He was the pioneer.
*  Anthony Cumio was doing it in his house, in his basement.
*  Way before everybody else.
*  Why do you think it is?
*  We were we just happened to be on the edge of the time when it became like, oh, there
*  was an opportunity to actually speak out and have your own opinion, right?
*  Before that.
*  Well, also, we got super lucky with platforms like you didn't get super lucky, but I got
*  super lucky that I met you.
*  And I'm not bullshitting because you decided to do it yourself.
*  And I remember thinking like, oh, this can be done.
*  You have to sometimes see someone do it.
*  See someone's house where you had your living room with fucking all these cables run from
*  these servers all the way to your machine.
*  I remember that.
*  I was like, oh, my God, this is like my van right now.
*  By the way, it was like a TV studio.
*  You got to come check out my van.
*  If you go to film like cables in the van, I believe you.
*  I'm proud of the way the cables are running the van.
*  If you were going to the camel show and you were watching how they film it, there's cables
*  on the ground, there's cameras, they're on dollies and people are moving shit around.
*  Like your fucking house looked like a set.
*  And I was like, oh, he can do it himself.
*  Then I'm like, I remember thinking this is not ready yet, but there's going to be something
*  that happens out of this.
*  And I remember thinking, look, I remember we talked about it.
*  There's a video of you and I talk about it saying, you're right.
*  Like you got it nailed.
*  Me, I'm sitting on your couch and I'm like, Tom Green, you're doing this right.
*  Fuck all these executives and all these people telling you what to do and what to say.
*  They get in the way.
*  The people that are important, the folks at home, what they want to listen to is what's coming out
*  of your mouth, whether you're right or wrong, whether it's good or bad, they want it to be you.
*  And as soon as you have a bunch of people chiming in and a bunch of fucking people that aren't,
*  you're not even talking about writers or creative folks, right?
*  You're talking about business people that are doing it just based simply on whether or not
*  they want to keep doing this successful.
*  If you want to keep doing this, you want to keep being, you know,
*  you were the first guy to figure out how to do it without those people.
*  And I remember sitting in your, in your living room right by your desk.
*  Oh, whoa.
*  All right.
*  I remember thinking, look at this, Tom Green figured it out.
*  I remember thinking this is going to be a path, but it wasn't ready yet.
*  I was like, this just not enough people, the bandwidth to watch it.
*  Not enough people understand what it is.
*  It was a small window, but it was, it made me very,
*  very interested.
*  I like just, I'm pausing for a moment and I'm bringing myself back to that time.
*  And I, I remember that day.
*  Like, it's so cool, man.
*  How long ago was that?
*  It's a long time, my friend.
*  How long ago was that?
*  17 years.
*  Yeah, that's cool.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember being in there.
*  And it was cool.
*  He's got it.
*  He's got it.
*  He's figured it out.
*  You came up and like, there was like, there was like, you know, you talk to
*  entertainment tonight or something was there.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  They were there and I was saying it was the future video on entertainment tonight from like 19.
*  What year was that 19?
*  Well, it had to be 2003.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  There's a video video from that.
*  That's it.
*  That's my house.
*  That's my living room right there.
*  Let's hear this.
*  That's what I'm talking about.
*  This is my living room.
*  I was talking the same stupid shit even back then.
*  My living room.
*  And I still, that's still my house today.
*  Look at your house, dude.
*  Yeah.
*  I made them eat my own poo.
*  I don't have the TV studio.
*  Maybe I have black down.
*  I actually, um, tried watching an episode of Fear of the Dead.
*  I threw up watching it once at home.
*  Eventually it was the same episode.
*  Probably not.
*  Was it when they put the frozen rats in the water?
*  This is basically a podcast.
*  We were doing a podcast back in 2003.
*  This is really early.
*  What year?
*  This was, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So.
*  Dude, this is you and me 17 years ago.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  Wow.
*  Holy shit.
*  That was you.
*  I didn't even recognize you.
*  Look at this beautiful dark beard.
*  Look how dark.
*  I look so silky smooth.
*  Yeah.
*  There you go.
*  And you said all this cool stuff and you were like, you know, you're, you know,
*  you know, you, you were, you were, uh, you were, you were hosting Fear Factor then.
*  I think.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  I just started doing Fear Factor.
*  Yeah.
*  But I remember thinking when I was there, like you got it nailed.
*  But I still, that's still my house.
*  You can't play it because if you play it, like that'll get pulled even though it's me talking.
*  No, no, no, it's probably Access Hollywood.
*  It's probably their video.
*  That photo, that old, that older gentleman in the background, I took that photo when I was in college.
*  Who is he?
*  So he was, so when I was in college, uh, we had to do an assignment and go take some photos.
*  So I went out in the streets of Toronto and you just met that gentleman.
*  Yeah.
*  It was in the city of Toronto.
*  I asked him.
*  Do you remember his name?
*  I do not know.
*  I know.
*  I was one of, one of, uh.
*  Want to call him something?
*  Want to call him Harry?
*  Let's call him Harry.
*  Harry.
*  Thank you, Harry.
*  No, but I just, a guy took, oh, look at there you are, Joe.
*  Look at you, fellow.
*  Look at your place.
*  That's cool.
*  Look at you, TomGreen.com.
*  Look at back when TVs had those big ass.
*  That's still my house, by the way.
*  So isn't that funny?
*  That's still where I.
*  Let that, let the haters and fucking stalkers know they can still find you.
*  But it's kind of funny that.
*  It's kind of funny that it was 17 years ago, my friend.
*  Yeah.
*  And here we are.
*  We're still basically doing the same kind of thing.
*  Yeah.
*  It's cool, man.
*  It's like, it's so cool, man.
*  I like, I, I, I appreciate it.
*  I really do.
*  I appreciate it too.
*  I love what you guys are doing.
*  And Jamie, I'm so glad you're doing good and you're not, you're feeling better.
*  Yeah.
*  He felt bad for about 14 hours.
*  Yeah.
*  And even then it wasn't that bad.
*  I'm glad you're not feeling too bad.
*  Despite what Donnell Rawlings thinks, he's very strong, very fit.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you?
*  And, and.
*  Inside joke, TomGreen.
*  Slipped right by ya.
*  No, but he, but I'm glad, I'm glad he's doing good.
*  Yeah.
*  He was only sick for a little bit.
*  We didn't even think he really had it.
*  We thought he had some sort of allergies.
*  Yeah.
*  Got lucky.
*  My gosh.
*  Well, listen, this is amazing.
*  Tom Green, stay gold, pony boy.
*  Joe.
*  It's always good hanging out with you, my friend.
*  And again, thank you for everything.
*  Thank you for being one of the most important initial inspiration.
*  I love you, Joe.
*  I love you too, Tom.
*  I love you.
*  I love you too.
*  Okay.
*  I love you.
*  I appreciate it.
*  You're always been a good guy.
*  Always.
*  Yeah.
*  I've known you for two decades now.
*  You've always been super cool.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  My pleasure.
*  Thank you.
*  Appreciate it.
*  And we've known each other a long time, man.
*  That's kind of crazy when you stop and think about it.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a long time, Tom Green.
*  But I appreciate you very much.
*  And everything I'm saying is sincere.
*  You were one of the most absolutely important inspirations for me.
*  Well, you know.
*  You did it, dude.
*  Class act, Joe Rogan.
*  You did it, dude, before anybody.
*  And I'm glad you're still doing it.
*  So tell everybody about your podcast you're doing right now.
*  Yeah, I can go to the Tom Green interview.
*  Google that in quotes.
*  The Tom Green interview.
*  That's going to bring you directly to the current show that I'm doing.
*  And it's...
*  First of all, I love what you do, Joe.
*  I love what you do.
*  I love interviewing people.
*  I do really love sitting down with somebody.
*  It's fun, right?
*  Talking to them and getting into their mind and asking them what they're up to.
*  And how they think and really getting into it.
*  So I love it.
*  And so I just had Kenny Hotz on my show this week.
*  Kenny Hotz from Kenny vs. Spenny.
*  One of the Canadian legendary...
*  This is all on tomgreen.com?
*  Yeah, it's on...
*  And so this is on tomgreen.com.
*  Is there any of the links to the videos that you do?
*  The van life videos on tomgreen.com?
*  If you go to my YouTube channel, just go to youtube.com slash tomgreen.
*  Just go there.
*  That's where I'm putting all the great videos.
*  This was a nice long one.
*  We did about four and a half hours, I think, right?
*  Yeah.
*  How about that?
*  Four and a half hours.
*  No peeing.
*  How long was it?
*  You know mine.
*  Four and a half hours, dude.
*  What?
*  Yeah, you got brain damage?
*  He got hit.
*  In the middle of the podcast, one of those whiskey shots just fucking clip.
*  He woke up in the middle of the fight like, what round is it?
*  Four and a half hours, Tom Green.
*  All right.
*  Well, listen.
*  I take a lot of supplements.
*  I can burn through alcohol pretty fucking quick, son.
*  Glutathione.
*  Liposomal glutathione.
*  What's that?
*  What is that?
*  It's a very powerful antioxidant that allows your body to process alcohol more quickly.
*  Okay.
*  Lute...
*  Glutathione.
*  You want liposomal glutathione so that your liver is like...
*  There is actually...
*  No, no.
*  All bullshit aside.
*  There's actually a doctor that I'm very good friends with, Dr. Mark Gordon,
*  who brought it up on a podcast.
*  And some guy tried to dispute it.
*  We wound up Googling it.
*  It turns out liposomal glutathione.
*  Glutathione in particular.
*  Liposomal is just a different...
*  Liposomal is controversial in that there's some people that don't believe it's a more effective way
*  of getting glutathione into your system.
*  But some people think it does.
*  I'm not qualified to have that argument.
*  I know that glutathione has been shown to help your body process alcohol more quickly.
*  How much more quickly?
*  That's up to debate.
*  And I don't think there's ever been any real long-term peer review studies on drunks.
*  Where you give them glutathione, you give their twin glutathione,
*  and you find out who recovers quicker with the same amount of food in their body,
*  same amount of rest, same amount of stress in their life.
*  Yeah.
*  But allegedly, glutathione, all those caveats and disclaimers aside,
*  glutathione helps your body process alcohol more quickly.
*  That's true, right?
*  Glutathione.
*  Yeah.
*  Glutathione.
*  Glutathione.
*  Glutathione.
*  I think it...
*  Glutathione.
*  I want to say it's an amino acid.
*  Glutathione?
*  What the fuck?
*  Glutathione.
*  What is that?
*  What is glutathione?
*  It is an antioxidant.
*  Okay.
*  That's what it is.
*  All right.
*  What is it, Jamie?
*  I went too far. My recording stopped.
*  Oh, the recording stopped.
*  We went too far.
*  That's right.
*  We broke the show, Tom Green.
*  How about that?
*  Is anything recording right now?
*  That's right.
*  Okay. It's back?
*  It just hits a limit once we go to work.
*  We broke the show.
*  The show has gone so long.
*  Tom Green and I broke the show.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Glutathione is an antioxidant in plants, animals, fungi, and some bacteria.
*  I don't know what that word is.
*  Archaea?
*  Anyway, glutathione is capable of preventing damage to important cellular components caused
*  by reactive oxygen species such as free radicals, peroxides, lipid peroxides, and heavy metals.
*  Glutathione.
*  And can you Google glutathione and alcohol?
*  Glutathione.
*  And hangovers.
*  That's the thing.
*  I think glutathione is supposed to be a really good thing to take when
*  you're in the middle of recovering from a hangover.
*  That is wild stuff.
*  Wild stuff.
*  Alpha-lipoic acid.
*  Alpha-lipoic acid is a potent antioxidant.
*  On its own, it helps your body produce glutathione.
*  Take about 400 milligrams before you start drinking.
*  And acetylcysteine NAC is a precursor to glutathione and a great nutrient for liver support.
*  Take 600 milligrams of NAC before you start drinking.
*  Those are like dedicated drunks.
*  Before I start drinking, I'm going to carb load.
*  I'm going to fill up with liquid.
*  A buddy of mine drank with John Claude Van Dam once.
*  Wow.
*  And he said John Claude Van Dam would drink but he would bring a gallon of water.
*  So he had a gallon of water with him.
*  Like a giant jug of water.
*  Oh nice.
*  So he would drink and he would take a jug.
*  So he knew how to like...
*  Yeah.
*  He said he was super impressed.
*  He was like, whoa.
*  This guy is a professional partier.
*  He would be drinking but he would also downing this gigantic bottle of water.
*  He kept pissing.
*  That's all you got to do is hydrate.
*  He kept hydrated the entire time.
*  He said he was so blown away by it.
*  He's like, I can't believe this guy.
*  Why did nobody ever tell me that?
*  You didn't hang out with John Claude Van Dam.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  You got to party with JCVD.
*  The amount of nights you could have probably survived if you just drank a little more water.
*  Here's something embarrassing.
*  You know the Volvo commercial where John Claude Van Dam does the splits between two trucks?
*  I don't know if that's real.
*  And I've questioned whether or not it's real.
*  But I know it's not real.
*  Okay.
*  I know they would never spend...
*  Do you know how much money you would have to...
*  But the concept is real.
*  I'm sure he's really capable of doing the splits.
*  No, but it's the idea of it's probably almost better than the ability to do it.
*  No.
*  Thinking of it is cool.
*  No, it's crazy.
*  You're trusting your life to these two trucks and then they got to push together.
*  Get the fuck out of here.
*  You don't think that he did that?
*  I don't think he did that.
*  Oh really?
*  No.
*  I think if he fell he would be a dead man.
*  Are we breaking news right here?
*  I think if he fell he would be a dead man.
*  And I don't think they would ever do that without a harness.
*  I just don't believe it.
*  I think it's CGI.
*  But he's most certainly capable of doing that if the trucks could be so specific in
*  their movements that they never separated and then he had time to strengthen his legs
*  at like 50 plus years of age.
*  There was...
*  I don't have the video of it but it says...
*  That's cool man.
*  There's a Wikipedia, three days of rehearsals was made in one single take.
*  He was protected by a hidden safety harness.
*  I believe it happened.
*  Oh okay.
*  Hidden safety harness.
*  Okay.
*  Well that makes sense.
*  I thought it happened but...
*  That makes sense.
*  The hidden safety harness now I believe it.
*  He's definitely capable of doing it.
*  Have you ever seen it?
*  Yeah I watched it.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's watch one more time.
*  I thought it happened.
*  Let's end on this.
*  But did...
*  Well now we know it did happen.
*  They just hit a safety...
*  They probably CGI'd the safety harness or something.
*  But he's most certainly capable of doing those kind of splits.
*  Yeah absolutely.
*  Look at it.
*  They're going backwards.
*  Oh they're going backwards.
*  Where's the safety harness I wonder?
*  You definitely can't see it.
*  I know but...
*  There's a little platform you can't see I think where his feet are on to help that.
*  Oh okay.
*  That don't exist.
*  Oh okay.
*  I like the...
*  What's Globetrotter?
*  What is that?
*  That's the...
*  Oh that's cool.
*  So they're very very slowly moving backwards.
*  25 miles an hour.
*  This is a cool shot actually.
*  But look at this.
*  Look at this.
*  Very cool.
*  Very very very very cool.
*  Check this out.
*  Look how they spread.
*  That's right where my balls break off and fly away.
*  That line.
*  See how they're marking it?
*  That one stays around the line.
*  Look at that.
*  Can you believe that?
*  I know but the fact they're doing it going backwards, that's bananas.
*  Yeah.
*  So he's not...
*  His weight is not being supported by his ankles there.
*  That's the only thing that's preposterous.
*  Because it seems he has no strain at all.
*  It's not preposterous that he could get into that position.
*  But there's a difference between getting into that position and doing it in between two chairs.
*  Like people do it in between two chairs.
*  So you don't think that's real?
*  No you can do it.
*  You can do it in between dude chairs.
*  Okay.
*  People can do it.
*  They've definitely done it.
*  Do you think that's real?
*  I think he definitely did it.
*  He's definitely capable of doing that.
*  I think he was supported by some sort of a safety harness.
*  The question is whether or not this...
*  But still, the image you're looking at is him supported by a safety harness.
*  Yes 100%.
*  And then CGI'd out.
*  Or whatever like chroma keyed out or whatever the hell they call it.
*  The safety harness is just so he didn't fall they're saying.
*  Jamie's saying.
*  I believe that too.
*  I would imagine it would take a little bit of weight off.
*  And I think that would help his ankles.
*  The PR guy said the stunt is real.
*  The PR guy can eat a whole bag-o.
*  He can eat a whole bag-o because you know PR guys are always honest.
*  The point is it's way more difficult to support yourself in that position if you're being held
*  on each ankle of all your weight is being pressed.
*  He's probably 170 pounds or something like that.
*  All his weight is on both of those ankles out extended like that.
*  That's very difficult to do.
*  It's not easy.
*  So for him to just be sitting there all calm and stretched out like that and do it over long.
*  I've seen people do it in between chairs but they don't do it for very long.
*  It's not something you want to do while two trucks are driving.
*  This is just what they're saying and everything I can find that his feet were not connected.
*  His feet were able to be moved and that harness was only in case he fell.
*  And they only did it that one time.
*  Well I mean if he has enough support again if they only did it for a couple of seconds
*  he has enough support where his ankles.
*  I mean he 100% can do that and has done that his whole life.
*  Where he suspends himself in a split over two chairs.
*  A lot of guys do it.
*  My only question would be like how long can you hold that spot?
*  I'm good dude.
*  How long can you hold that spot?
*  Have you ever seen a guy do that?
*  A little more. One more tap.
*  No you drink a whole bottle of whiskey.
*  Just have a little sip.
*  Just settle down.
*  No? Okay.
*  Have you ever seen those videos where people do that?
*  Yeah. I was going to say that maybe if they would have said it was a camera trick
*  and it was like high speed and they just slowed it down.
*  No.
*  You got a little. Oh you got it.
*  Four seconds.
*  You have some more.
*  Yeah that was a good footage.
*  One more tap. One more tap. That's all I'm saying.
*  Time footage. Seems like it was real.
*  No I'm sure he can do that.
*  If they really did do that with those two trucks that's even more impressive.
*  I assume that they CGI'd it.
*  Still Austin.
*  That is so good.
*  But I assume that he did do this.
*  I finally found the making of them.
*  Let's see if I can find.
*  Oh my gosh.
