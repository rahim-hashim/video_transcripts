# Joe Rogan Experience #2033 - Matt Rife
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6.0s)]
*  Alright, where are we recording this? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=12.0s)]
*  Let's go Matt Rice. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=14.0s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=15.0s)]
*  Let's start off the show. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=16.0s)]
*  Are you still in LA right now? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=18.0s)]
*  Technically, yeah. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=20.0s)]
*  I mean I'm home three days a week, three days a month maybe. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=21.0s)]
*  You're just constantly touring. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=24.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a dream come true man. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=26.0s)]
*  Careful what you wish for. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=28.0s)]
*  But long time coming, you know. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=30.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=32.0s)]
*  It's not careful what you wish for. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=34.0s)]
*  It's just, you just have to learn how to manage this new thing now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=36.0s)]
*  It's great though. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=40.0s)]
*  It's not careful. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=41.0s)]
*  It's fucking awesome. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=42.0s)]
*  It's so much better than it not working out for you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=43.0s)]
*  Oh absolutely. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=46.0s)]
*  No, if I could sleep like a normal human being, I think I'd be just fine. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=47.0s)]
*  Yeah, you were just talking about that idea of serious insomnia. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=50.0s)]
*  Have you done anything to try to mitigate that? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=54.0s)]
*  Have you taken melatonin? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=56.0s)]
*  Have you tried any herbal? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=58.0s)]
*  Have you done all that stuff? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=60.0s)]
*  I've OD'd on melatonin, dude. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=61.0s)]
*  I've taken 30 milligrams in a night. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=63.0s)]
*  You build up a tolerance to melatonin. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=65.0s)]
*  You have to stop using it for a little while. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=67.0s)]
*  I do have to smoke every single night to even have a chance of falling asleep. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=69.0s)]
*  Wow, so you just get some of that Be Real Indica, some of that Cypress Hills shit. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=73.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, dude, until I just am deformed in bed. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=78.0s)]
*  And that puts you out? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=82.0s)]
*  Not really. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=84.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=86.0s)]
*  I can stay awake on Xanax and everything. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=87.0s)]
*  It's almost like... [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=89.0s)]
*  It's so interesting. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=90.0s)]
*  If you picture a light switch to turn your brain off, I just can't. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=91.0s)]
*  Your switch doesn't work. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=96.0s)]
*  No, and I think it's like after thinking about it for years, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=97.0s)]
*  I think it's the same mechanism in my brain that allows me to think quickly on stage, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=101.0s)]
*  that keeps my brain up at night. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=106.0s)]
*  I just think about anything. It's not even anxiety. It's just anything. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=108.0s)]
*  It's just frantic thoughts just bouncing around in your head. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=112.0s)]
*  Yeah, anything from middle school memories to like, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=115.0s)]
*  man, it's crazy how leaves are green and then brown sometimes. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=117.0s)]
*  It's just fucking anything. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=120.0s)]
*  My dick is like, please don't beat me again. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=122.0s)]
*  I've tried everything. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=124.0s)]
*  You've tried everything. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=126.0s)]
*  I promise. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=127.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=128.0s)]
*  I know, I know. It sucks. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=129.0s)]
*  Because obviously, I mean, for as much as I work out, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=131.0s)]
*  your muscles don't get that time to recover because they can't build. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=133.0s)]
*  Well, and your brain doesn't get that time to recover. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=137.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=139.0s)]
*  Your system suffers. Everything suffers when you don't sleep. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=140.0s)]
*  I've made a really conscious effort over the last year to get a lot of sleep, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=143.0s)]
*  and I've fucked it up quite a few times with the club [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=147.0s)]
*  because there's been times with the club where at least three nights a week when I'm performing, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=150.0s)]
*  I'm out until two o'clock in the morning, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=154.0s)]
*  and generally, I wake up around eight to start working out. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=156.0s)]
*  At eight, it's like six hours. It's not quite enough. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=159.0s)]
*  It's not even six hours. It's like five and a half. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=163.0s)]
*  And I feel tired. I look tired. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=166.0s)]
*  And I just don't have as much juice. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=168.0s)]
*  And then when I adjust and then get proper sleep again, it's all sudden. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=171.0s)]
*  It's like whoop. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=175.0s)]
*  I feel like everything turns up to 10 again. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=177.0s)]
*  It's fascinating. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=181.0s)]
*  I feel a big difference, physically feel a big difference. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=182.0s)]
*  If sleep was a supplement, if I could take a sleep supplement [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=186.0s)]
*  and it gives you that feeling you get when you're fully rested, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=190.0s)]
*  oh my God, you're just better. You're better. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=194.0s)]
*  Everything works better. Your brain works better. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=197.0s)]
*  You can physically do more. Everything works better. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=199.0s)]
*  I've heard. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=204.0s)]
*  Yeah, you've got to try it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=205.0s)]
*  I don't think I've even been in a REM sleep in five years, dude. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=206.0s)]
*  Oh, that doesn't make sense. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=210.0s)]
*  It's so not good. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=211.0s)]
*  You'd be dead. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=212.0s)]
*  I feel dead, dude. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=213.0s)]
*  But you're not. You feel alive. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=214.0s)]
*  I've stayed awake for nine straight days before. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=216.0s)]
*  What? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=218.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=219.0s)]
*  I don't even think that's possible. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=220.0s)]
*  I think the world record is like 11 or 13 [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=221.0s)]
*  because I looked into it because I genuinely started to get fearful for my own health. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=223.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=227.0s)]
*  Do you agree with having needing eight hours? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=228.0s)]
*  Because I've heard so many different theories. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=231.0s)]
*  No, I don't think everybody needs eight hours. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=233.0s)]
*  I just know I do. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=235.0s)]
*  There's no way I could know what's going on in other people's bodies. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=236.0s)]
*  You mean it's case by case? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=239.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think it's like everything with biology. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=240.0s)]
*  Biology varies so much by genetics and life experiences. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=243.0s)]
*  What have you done leading up? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=247.0s)]
*  Have you just been sedentary your whole life or you've been very active? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=249.0s)]
*  Is your body very fit or is your body like riddled with problems? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=252.0s)]
*  Like there's so many and it's just genetics, man. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=256.0s)]
*  They vary so much. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=259.0s)]
*  Some people are, you know, they have no problem with five hour sleep. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=260.0s)]
*  And it changes over time as well, doesn't it? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=264.0s)]
*  Like didn't people evolve from sleeping in like four hour increments or something like that? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=266.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure they did. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=270.0s)]
*  I'm sure they didn't get a chance to just fucking chill. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=271.0s)]
*  You know, they were getting eaten by cats. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=274.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=276.0s)]
*  That's the, you know, the rub on people. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=277.0s)]
*  It's like we still have these genetics that are from 10,000, 15,000 years ago when life was very different. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=280.0s)]
*  And those are still the same genetics. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=286.0s)]
*  And that's why we're still looking for like tribal leaders and shit. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=288.0s)]
*  We're looking for like a president, a prime minister. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=291.0s)]
*  We're looking for like one person. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=294.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Leaders used to fight in wars. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=296.0s)]
*  Yes. And that was how we sort of figured out what to do. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=298.0s)]
*  We went to the person who had experienced the most, not the person who's been paid off the most. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=302.0s)]
*  Not the person who's got the fucking shadiest insider dealings with the party that has the most influence. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=307.0s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=313.0s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=314.0s)]
*  I'm so happy I take zero part in any politics whatsoever. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=315.0s)]
*  I'm the least politically informed person you'll probably ever meet. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=318.0s)]
*  And I know I'm taking pride in naivety, but. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=321.0s)]
*  Well, for your own self-preservation, that's probably a good idea. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=324.0s)]
*  I've always said that like voting and like politics in this country is a lot like rooting on pro wrestling. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=327.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=334.0s)]
*  It might make you feel better, but I'm not sure how much it affects the outcome. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=335.0s)]
*  That's a very good point. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=339.0s)]
*  It seems like at the very end of the day, the same people are getting all the money. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=340.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=346.0s)]
*  And don't think about it in terms of whether or not you can vote in your party. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=347.0s)]
*  You most certainly can. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=350.0s)]
*  And don't think about it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=352.0s)]
*  They most certainly can enact social change and they can do some good things, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=353.0s)]
*  and especially in relationship with the Supreme Court and a lot of other things. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=357.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, the real people that are running the show are the people that are getting these massive defense contracts and massive pharmaceutical contracts. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=360.0s)]
*  Like the billions and trillions of dollars that's being generated by various industries. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=373.0s)]
*  That's what's running the show. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=378.0s)]
*  That's what's running the show. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=380.0s)]
*  You're speaking Mandarin Chinese right now. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=381.0s)]
*  That's not the fucking old dude that keeps getting tripped by ghosts. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=383.0s)]
*  He's not your leader. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=388.0s)]
*  Are you a big ghost guy? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=390.0s)]
*  I believe it's possible. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=391.0s)]
*  I'm obsessed. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=393.0s)]
*  Are you? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=394.0s)]
*  So really weird side hobby of mine, I go ghost hunting. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=395.0s)]
*  I've been like around the world. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=399.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's incredible. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=401.0s)]
*  What have you experienced? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=402.0s)]
*  Have you ever had like an absolute moment where you're like, oh my God, I'm in the presence of a poltergeist? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=403.0s)]
*  Not, still not a thousand percent. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=409.0s)]
*  I've definitely witnessed things that I cannot for the life of me explain that have creeped me out. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=415.0s)]
*  The timing has been impeccable. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=421.0s)]
*  I've seen things move that there's just no fucking way that they've moved. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=422.0s)]
*  I've gotten answers back on EVPs. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=426.0s)]
*  But for me, it is one of the things I do need to see it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=428.0s)]
*  Isn't the EVP like a radio though? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=431.0s)]
*  No, EVP is just a recorder. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=433.0s)]
*  It's a recorder. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=434.0s)]
*  What is that radio thing? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=435.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=436.0s)]
*  What is the one where they like listen? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=437.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of different names. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=439.0s)]
*  My daughter's heavily into this shit. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=440.0s)]
*  What does she watch? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=442.0s)]
*  Like Sam and Colby. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=443.0s)]
*  You had them on, right? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=444.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=445.0s)]
*  Great guys. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=446.0s)]
*  So I met these other guys. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=447.0s)]
*  There's another channel called the Overnight Channel who are equally as popular as Sam and Colby. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=449.0s)]
*  And they actually used to work together. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=453.0s)]
*  I believe they split off into each do their own thing. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=454.0s)]
*  But that's who I started going with. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=457.0s)]
*  So I'm very familiar with those guys. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=458.0s)]
*  So these kids, the Sam and Colby guys just went into the Conjuring house. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=460.0s)]
*  I was just there maybe a month and a half ago. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=465.0s)]
*  You went into the Conjuring house too? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=467.0s)]
*  By myself, Joe. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=468.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=469.0s)]
*  Do you believe that there's something going on in that house? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=470.0s)]
*  The Conjuring movies are fucking great. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=472.0s)]
*  It's my favorite franchise. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=474.0s)]
*  They're fun. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=475.0s)]
*  And there's so many of them. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=476.0s)]
*  They really did it right. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=477.0s)]
*  Like if you want to be smart, they branched off with the nun. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=479.0s)]
*  They branched off with Annabelle. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=482.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=483.0s)]
*  And I love the way they tie in the story for each one to make it all one chronological story. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=484.0s)]
*  It's genius. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=488.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=489.0s)]
*  I will say I wasn't as scared as I've been in a lot of places we've been. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=490.0s)]
*  There is some kind of solace to the house. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=497.0s)]
*  But you get to know the history of it and it does make sense that there would be something here. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=501.0s)]
*  I mean it's on some lay lines of water underground. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=506.0s)]
*  There was war spot there. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=508.0s)]
*  There's apparently bodies buried on the property in the walls of the property structures and stuff. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=510.0s)]
*  There's a lot of history that goes into it that just makes for kind of the perfect storm for some creepy shit. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=516.0s)]
*  But I didn't witness anything that was that insane. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=521.0s)]
*  Some items moved. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=524.0s)]
*  Some cars rolled off of the children's dressers a couple of times on cue. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=525.0s)]
*  And that's the one thing I do pride ourselves in these videos is so often we get absolutely nothing because we don't fake anything. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=530.0s)]
*  So you only get to see the highlights. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=537.0s)]
*  Like there's so many times we'll go to a place that is so notoriously haunted and we'll be there for 10 hours and get absolutely nothing. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=539.0s)]
*  And it sucks. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=546.0s)]
*  But that makes when something does happen that much more valuable. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=547.0s)]
*  It's so much more impressive. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=550.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=551.0s)]
*  Do you think a ghost is like the soul of a person that's left behind? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=553.0s)]
*  Or do you think the ghost is almost like space and time because of a horrible incident contain a memory? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=558.0s)]
*  And like that memory is almost like it like shows up in current time sometimes. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=568.0s)]
*  There's a guy named Rupert Sheldrake. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=575.0s)]
*  I forget what his field of study is, but he had this theory about things and he believes that objects contain memories. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=578.0s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=589.0s)]
*  It's not he's not the only one in animate objects. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=590.0s)]
*  Yeah, that things contain memories. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=592.0s)]
*  And this is one of the reasons why like people kind of universally support this idea that if someone was murdered in a house, you must tell the people inform the people that are about to buy it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=595.0s)]
*  You have to tell them, hey, somebody got murdered in this house. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=606.0s)]
*  Like maybe you don't maybe you don't want to buy this house. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=609.0s)]
*  Now, does that maybe you should think about it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=612.0s)]
*  Does the potential owner have to ask that information? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=614.0s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=616.0s)]
*  I'd want to know. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=618.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a good question. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=619.0s)]
*  I think they should have to inform you because there's something about someone being murdered in a spot that freaks us out. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=621.0s)]
*  And this is my question. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=628.0s)]
*  How you knew the conjured house was haunted. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=631.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=634.0s)]
*  How do you go there with this feeling and this expectation. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=635.0s)]
*  That's what I always wonder about these things like how much of how much of it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=639.0s)]
*  This isn't just imagining things. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=644.0s)]
*  This is like the mind itself seems to have some unmeasured effect on the world. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=646.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=656.0s)]
*  I think the way you think has an unmeasured effect in terms of like this. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=657.0s)]
*  There's energy that you put out. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=664.0s)]
*  There's connections you make with people. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=666.0s)]
*  They're very, very unmeasured. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=668.0s)]
*  You don't manifest your own perception of things for sure. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=670.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=672.0s)]
*  So what my concern is, is like if you go into a place with a preexisting knowledge of ghosts like you think ghosts are here, you think ghosts are real. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=673.0s)]
*  You have this thought in your mind that you you maybe experience a ghost in this place that's haunted. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=685.0s)]
*  You're at this elevated level of anticipation. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=690.0s)]
*  You're probably really nervous and kind of freaked out and your imagination starts firing up. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=694.0s)]
*  And I'm not even saying that these people are lying or that they're seeing things that aren't there. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=699.0s)]
*  I'm saying maybe you make things show up. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=705.0s)]
*  Maybe you see memories. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=708.0s)]
*  Maybe you experience some horrible energy that existed in this spot 50 years ago, 100 years ago, that there's like ways you can tune into that. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=710.0s)]
*  I could see that being possible. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=720.0s)]
*  But to me, that's what's so exciting about it is like you go hoping for those solidified answers. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=722.0s)]
*  You're going hoping to witness something that you couldn't have possibly made up. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=727.0s)]
*  But you know why I think that too is like you never see them in the daytime. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=731.0s)]
*  Ghosts don't exist on the street. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=735.0s)]
*  Sometimes. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=737.0s)]
*  Yeah, but not outside. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=738.0s)]
*  Never outside. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=739.0s)]
*  That's a very good point. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=740.0s)]
*  That's my point is like you're always trapped. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=741.0s)]
*  So you're always in this like weird space like if you had a wolf in your house, you'd be freaked out. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=743.0s)]
*  You want to get outside. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=747.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=748.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=749.0s)]
*  You don't wolf in the fire. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=750.0s)]
*  It's a wolf in the house. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=751.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=752.0s)]
*  Anytime you're in a contained area, your brain has this heightened sense of like being trapped in awareness. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=753.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=759.0s)]
*  And how do you escape? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=760.0s)]
*  I mean, every horror movie is the same. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=761.0s)]
*  We got to get to the door. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=762.0s)]
*  Get to the door. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=763.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=764.0s)]
*  Everybody's trying to fumble with the keys. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=765.0s)]
*  The monsters chasing them. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=766.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=767.0s)]
*  Get it just in time. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=768.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=769.0s)]
*  That is a reoccurring theme in the human mind. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=770.0s)]
*  If you're trapped in a fucking house with a killer or a ghost or a wolf, you know, you know where that makes the most sense. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=773.0s)]
*  We did the USS Hornet up in the Bay Area. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=781.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=783.0s)]
*  And we had the whole ship to ourselves, which I was so excited about because I love military stuff. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=784.0s)]
*  I love history. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=788.0s)]
*  I was so excited to go there and just witness it. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=789.0s)]
*  And they sent me by myself on a bit, basically a game of hide and seek where they had to go find them in the ship somewhere after I had to like count to 100 by myself. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=791.0s)]
*  It was the most terrifying place I've ever been because if you've never been in like the bowel of a ship, it's so unfamiliar. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=799.0s)]
*  Like doorways don't look the same. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=806.0s)]
*  You know, you have to step over them and everything. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=808.0s)]
*  There's so many pipes and everything sticking out. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=810.0s)]
*  It's such an unfamiliar environment, especially in the dark. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=812.0s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=814.0s)]
*  You think I can't possibly run away from something in here. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=815.0s)]
*  It's too there's too many obstacles. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=818.0s)]
*  You don't know if that's a wall or a pipe or something peeping around to like look at you. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=820.0s)]
*  It's fucking terrifying because of exactly that you feel so trapped. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=824.0s)]
*  That totally makes sense. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=827.0s)]
*  And I would imagine also the feeling of being underwater is an extra freak out. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=828.0s)]
*  I didn't think about that, but now I have anxiety. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=832.0s)]
*  I mean, you literally if you're deep enough in the ship, you're under the water. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=834.0s)]
*  That's a very good point. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=838.0s)]
*  And somehow metal floats. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=840.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=842.0s)]
*  I don't understand it whatsoever. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=843.0s)]
*  I just don't get it because of the shape. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=844.0s)]
*  What? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=847.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=848.0s)]
*  Oh, that to me has always been like, what? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=849.0s)]
*  Yeah, like a rock that size would sink. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=851.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=853.0s)]
*  I don't know what's going on. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=854.0s)]
*  I'm too stupid to figure out. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=855.0s)]
*  So confusing. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=857.0s)]
*  I get a fiberglass boat. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=858.0s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=859.0s)]
*  But they didn't have fiberglass. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=860.0s)]
*  I get a wood boat. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=862.0s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=863.0s)]
*  But of fucking ships, one of those battleships. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=864.0s)]
*  Imagine if they had to make battleships out of wood. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=867.0s)]
*  Do that was like we have battleships, but they have to be out of wood. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=869.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=873.0s)]
*  Let's go back to having to fight with swords while we're at it as well. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=874.0s)]
*  Do you ever do Pirates of the Caribbean at Disneyland? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=877.0s)]
*  I've been one time and it's fucking terrifying. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=879.0s)]
*  No. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=881.0s)]
*  Are you scared of everything? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=882.0s)]
*  I'm scared. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=883.0s)]
*  I'm afraid of no living things apparently. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=885.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=888.0s)]
*  Apparently not. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=889.0s)]
*  The ride scares me. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=890.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=891.0s)]
*  Because I can only imagine if I was the only person in there and you see those fucking animated figures in there by themselves, that to me is like a perfect scare movie. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=892.0s)]
*  It's so creepy. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=899.0s)]
*  Right, like one of them would come alive. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=900.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=901.0s)]
*  But what I was getting to is there's a scene when you're going down the river in the raft where these two ships are shooting at each other with cannonballs. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=903.0s)]
*  And it makes you think about what the fuck that would have been like living back then. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=911.0s)]
*  Oh, you had to be a man. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=917.0s)]
*  You're on a wooden thing floating around the ocean and you're both shooting things that make holes in the woods to sink them. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=919.0s)]
*  Yup. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=926.0s)]
*  You're out in the middle of the ocean. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=927.0s)]
*  Which would you rather had to have done in that situation? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=929.0s)]
*  Would you rather rely on the cannons or would you hope they get close enough that you had to battle it out hand to hand? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=931.0s)]
*  I like my odds hand to hand. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=935.0s)]
*  I don't trust the ship. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=937.0s)]
*  Both suck. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=938.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're not ideal. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=940.0s)]
*  Because it depends on numbers. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=941.0s)]
*  It depends on experience. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=942.0s)]
*  Have you had food lately? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=944.0s)]
*  You know, have you been starving for the last week and a half and then all of a sudden you get hit by pirates? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=946.0s)]
*  There's a lot of those guys like barely made it. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=951.0s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=954.0s)]
*  They got across to land wherever they were going in those ships back then and they barely made it. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=955.0s)]
*  People died on those things all the time. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=960.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=962.0s)]
*  It's impressive. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=963.0s)]
*  And also the ocean's fucking terrifying. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=964.0s)]
*  You ever see the videos of these giant ships in the middle of the ocean just getting vertical on these waves? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=966.0s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=971.0s)]
*  And their food was nothing. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=972.0s)]
*  It was garbage. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=975.0s)]
*  They got scurvy. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=976.0s)]
*  They got all kinds of diseases. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=977.0s)]
*  There was rats on board. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=979.0s)]
*  The rats were carrying fleas that carried diseases. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=980.0s)]
*  Like, ugh. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=983.0s)]
*  No, I don't think I could have made it. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=984.0s)]
*  I would have stayed in England for sure. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=986.0s)]
*  And by the time you get there, you're so worn out. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=988.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know how long it takes by sailboat to get from England to America. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=991.0s)]
*  Like, how much, how long does that take? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=996.0s)]
*  Was it just sails back then too? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=998.0s)]
*  Or you're from Spain? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=999.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah, there's no propeller. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1000.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1001.0s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1002.0s)]
*  I never even registered that. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1003.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1004.0s)]
*  Those people were so gangster. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1005.0s)]
*  Those people were so gangster. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1006.0s)]
*  They didn't even know what was over there. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1007.0s)]
*  They thought they were in India. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1009.0s)]
*  That's so fucking funny. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1011.0s)]
*  Bro, they thought that they were in India. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1013.0s)]
*  It's so wrong. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1016.0s)]
*  And then kept calling people the wrong thing. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1017.0s)]
*  To this day we call them the wrong thing. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1020.0s)]
*  Sailing from New York City to London takes about six nights and seven days, depending on your speed. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1022.0s)]
*  That's because of the famous Royal Places, Big Ben, and Double Decker buses of London. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1027.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't think that's today. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1032.0s)]
*  I don't buy that. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1033.0s)]
*  I thought it took like weeks. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1034.0s)]
*  I think that's today. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1035.0s)]
*  The addition mentions, typical passage from New York to the English Channel for a well-found sailing vessel of about 2,000 tons [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1036.0s)]
*  was around 25 to 30 days with ships logging 100 to 150 miles per day on average. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1045.0s)]
*  That's not that bad. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1051.0s)]
*  No, I believe that number. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1052.0s)]
*  Yeah, 30 days is pretty good. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1054.0s)]
*  I mean, that's still so uncomfortable. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1056.0s)]
*  That's if everything goes well. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1057.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1059.0s)]
*  Do you ever see that video going around recently of those potential mermaids on the side of that ship in the middle of the ocean? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1060.0s)]
*  No. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1066.0s)]
*  What? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1067.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1068.0s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1069.0s)]
*  Potential mermaids? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1070.0s)]
*  Jamie, you know what I'm talking about? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1071.0s)]
*  Is this some CGI nonsense? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1072.0s)]
*  There is like a sailor, a guy sail on the back of the ship and you can hear moans, right? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1073.0s)]
*  Sort of. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1080.0s)]
*  So there's like, it's just a dude on a blurry cell phone video. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1081.0s)]
*  It looks like a good cell phone video. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1084.0s)]
*  And there's these things that are like racing on the side of the boat that are going the same speed as the boat. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1086.0s)]
*  And it's like there's like a tail or something trailing behind them. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1092.0s)]
*  And this keeps up for hours. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1095.0s)]
*  And then you start to hear whistling. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1097.0s)]
*  Let me see your tunes. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1099.0s)]
*  You hear what sounds like one of them say jump for me? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1101.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1104.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1105.0s)]
*  How do you think this is real? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1106.0s)]
*  There's no way this is real. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1107.0s)]
*  Imagine if I'm being, this is like the beginning of a movie, right? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1108.0s)]
*  You and I are having this podcast. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1111.0s)]
*  We're being super skeptical. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1112.0s)]
*  And then in the movie, you find out there has been a very small group of mermaids that have existed in the ocean, hiding from humanity because we have only discovered 10 percent of the ocean. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1113.0s)]
*  This is a fun world to live in. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1124.0s)]
*  Is it this one? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1126.0s)]
*  Yeah, this guy. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1127.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1128.0s)]
*  So this video is a couple of years old. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1129.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1130.0s)]
*  No fucking way. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1131.0s)]
*  Wait, I just threw this overboard. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1133.0s)]
*  Y'all saw me throw overboard. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1135.0s)]
*  Are you fucking kidding me? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1137.0s)]
*  That did not just. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1139.0s)]
*  So what is this guy saying? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1141.0s)]
*  He's got a couple of videos. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1143.0s)]
*  He's like he's spent a lot of time out in the water. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1144.0s)]
*  That looks like. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1147.0s)]
*  So where are the mermaids? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1148.0s)]
*  And this is a much longer video than I've ever seen. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1150.0s)]
*  Well, that was one of the sounds. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1153.0s)]
*  You hear the jump for me? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1155.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1168.0s)]
*  I didn't hear jump for me. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1173.0s)]
*  Did you hear a jump for me, Jimmy? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1177.0s)]
*  It's one of those things that somebody somebody somebody did the subtitles for at one time. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1179.0s)]
*  That always makes your brain register a little bit easier. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1185.0s)]
*  It has a few videos like this. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1188.0s)]
*  Where's the video of the mermaid? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1190.0s)]
*  It was a part of the same one we were just watching where you heard like the squeal. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1192.0s)]
*  So in there, there's a mermaid. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1196.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's before this. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1198.0s)]
*  I cut it off because this is what I have found is a smash cut of a few videos this guy made. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1201.0s)]
*  That's like a this is like a compilation. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1208.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1210.0s)]
*  It could have been a whale. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1211.0s)]
*  It could have been easily easily changed my mind. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1213.0s)]
*  It was definitely mermaids, bro. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1216.0s)]
*  You know what whales do make that sound as a matter of they do they make fat mermaid. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1218.0s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1223.0s)]
*  I just don't whenever one dude in multiple videos is encountering mermaids. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1224.0s)]
*  I get suspicious. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1230.0s)]
*  But here's this. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1232.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1233.0s)]
*  Your reaction right now is why I love to believe in ghosts, aliens, cryptids, Bigfoot, mermaids, all that kind of shit. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1234.0s)]
*  Because imagine this shit is real. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1241.0s)]
*  Imagine this dude had a real experience. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1243.0s)]
*  I love the idea of all of those things you just mentioned. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1245.0s)]
*  I really do. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1247.0s)]
*  I love the idea. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1248.0s)]
*  I love you love that stuff. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1249.0s)]
*  I fucking love nonsense. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1250.0s)]
*  I got so high once I watched the Patterson Bigfoot footage. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1252.0s)]
*  I was like, oh my God, what if it's real? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1255.0s)]
*  What if I've been an asshole making fun of this thing forever when it's actually really a Bigfoot? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1257.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1262.0s)]
*  And I imagine you've had an encounter and the rest of the world thinks you're a fucking psychopath. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1263.0s)]
*  That would feel so lonely. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1266.0s)]
*  But that that moment only lasted like 15 minutes. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1268.0s)]
*  The weed wore off a little bit. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1270.0s)]
*  I was like, that shit is so fake. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1272.0s)]
*  This was a similar one. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1273.0s)]
*  I don't know if you know anything about this, Matt. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1274.0s)]
*  I haven't seen this. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1275.0s)]
*  So this guy, people, I've seen this video multiple times. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1276.0s)]
*  Supposedly this guy saw a giant on the side of a hill. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1279.0s)]
*  A giant? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1281.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1282.0s)]
*  I'm trying to find the part where he is. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1283.0s)]
*  So like it's something like this. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1284.0s)]
*  So high. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1285.0s)]
*  He thought he saw it. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1286.0s)]
*  So he goes back and like he's looking for it. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1287.0s)]
*  It looks like it's someone walking on the side of a hill. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1289.0s)]
*  The perspective is very strange. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1291.0s)]
*  Let me change the angle. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1293.0s)]
*  That's a giant one is a fascinating one. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1294.0s)]
*  But then the guy disappears. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1297.0s)]
*  So he's making a bunch of videos on TikTok and then he just disappeared and everyone's like, what the fuck? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1298.0s)]
*  I didn't I don't know if I saw anything in the video. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1302.0s)]
*  Where's the video? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1304.0s)]
*  Where's the giant? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1305.0s)]
*  This is also a guy's making an edit about this whole story. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1306.0s)]
*  This one. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1310.0s)]
*  We're trying to find this very specific video where he's trying to find the. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1311.0s)]
*  So he's driving in his truck and he sees a giant. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1313.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's driving on the truck and he sees something on the side of this hill. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1315.0s)]
*  And I don't know if on this specific one you can see it. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1318.0s)]
*  Like how big of a giant? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1320.0s)]
*  That's what it's hard to tell because it's this. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1322.0s)]
*  I mean, it looks far as shit, but I also don't see anything. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1323.0s)]
*  The one you can find. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1326.0s)]
*  I'll try to find out what you use. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1327.0s)]
*  What are you looking at? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1328.0s)]
*  Do you see something? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1329.0s)]
*  I don't see anything. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1330.0s)]
*  I don't. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1331.0s)]
*  There's someone move in there. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1332.0s)]
*  I'm trying to find the very specific thing, but there is a very it looks just like this and you can see a person like you can see the silhouette of a person on the side of that hill. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1333.0s)]
*  It's weird from this far away. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1341.0s)]
*  You could see that. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1342.0s)]
*  I'm going to be completely honest. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1343.0s)]
*  I don't know what I'm looking at in that video. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1344.0s)]
*  Yeah, I saw the zoom in, but the zoom was in the sky. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1345.0s)]
*  It doesn't make sense to me either. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1349.0s)]
*  I'm looking at him like I don't see shit. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1350.0s)]
*  Like where is this person? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1352.0s)]
*  These people's this likes blob squashes. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1354.0s)]
*  That's one of the things that Bigfoot hunters. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1357.0s)]
*  They just start seeing shadows that look like Sasquatch and they're convinced. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1359.0s)]
*  They convince themselves. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1363.0s)]
*  The fact that that show has been on for so fucking long. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1364.0s)]
*  They're still finding Bigfoot. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1367.0s)]
*  They're working really hard. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1368.0s)]
*  How do you get renewed with no results? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1370.0s)]
*  Here's a picture of what the video is. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1372.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1374.0s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1375.0s)]
*  That the persp... [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1378.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1379.0s)]
*  It's a perspective thing. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1380.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how far away that zoom is. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1381.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that could be a six foot tall dude up there. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1383.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean also humans are six foot seven, seven foot sometimes. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1386.0s)]
*  That's not that big. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1391.0s)]
*  So they're claiming this guy died actually apparently. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1392.0s)]
*  Oh, the mountain guy up there. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1394.0s)]
*  Apparently he's now he says, all right, I didn't this is an update. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1396.0s)]
*  This video was only posted recently. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1399.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1400.0s)]
*  Admission that was a hoax and then he died. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1401.0s)]
*  Oh, you. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1403.0s)]
*  Oh, he made an admission. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1404.0s)]
*  The video was a hoax and then he died. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1406.0s)]
*  I didn't know about that. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1408.0s)]
*  Oh, well, it's probably unrelated. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1409.0s)]
*  The type of person who's out there hoaxing giant videos, probably doing a lot of wild shit. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1411.0s)]
*  I would imagine so. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1415.0s)]
*  I think a lot of people are doing that. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1417.0s)]
*  Making these hoax things like mermaids. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1419.0s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1420.0s)]
*  That's a product of DMT for sure. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1421.0s)]
*  That's how it goes viral. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1423.0s)]
*  You got to fake things. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1424.0s)]
*  There's a lot of people faking things for sure. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1426.0s)]
*  But there was the Bigfoot ones were some of the Bigfoot fakes were so bad. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1428.0s)]
*  There was one on the less drought show where the guy was like so obviously wearing a mask. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1434.0s)]
*  It's like a close up on a guy wearing a mask. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1438.0s)]
*  It's so embarrassing. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1441.0s)]
*  So bad. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1443.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1444.0s)]
*  Like make some kind of compelling case. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1445.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1447.0s)]
*  Less drought is the shit. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1448.0s)]
*  You know, Survivor Man. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1449.0s)]
*  That guy's awesome. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1451.0s)]
*  That guy did legit things. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1452.0s)]
*  He's the guy that you never see that show Survivor Man. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1453.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1455.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1456.0s)]
*  The show is amazing. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1457.0s)]
*  When was this on? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1458.0s)]
*  He used to go. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1459.0s)]
*  It was a while back. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1460.0s)]
*  And he used to go legitimately by himself with a very limited amount of tools. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1461.0s)]
*  And he would live in wild places. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1466.0s)]
*  I love that. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1468.0s)]
*  Really dangerous places and figure his way out and survive. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1469.0s)]
*  And you know, a lot of times like you could see on the show he was losing like 15 pounds. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1471.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1477.0s)]
*  Like got really sick. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1478.0s)]
*  Got injured. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1479.0s)]
*  Watch that show alone on Netflix? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1480.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's similar. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1481.0s)]
*  But this was like one guy with his own cameras doing this everywhere. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1482.0s)]
*  So cool. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1486.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1487.0s)]
*  That's why I like other shows like remember when Bear Grylls had a show? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1488.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1491.0s)]
*  There's like multiple camera people and they're filming them doing wild things. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1492.0s)]
*  It's like that's what they wanted to do with him. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1495.0s)]
*  And Les is like, uh-uh. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1497.0s)]
*  No, I do the real thing. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1498.0s)]
*  This is the real thing. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1499.0s)]
*  So Les is obsessed with Bigfoot too. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1500.0s)]
*  So he went looking for Bigfoot. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1503.0s)]
*  But there was, you know, on one of the episodes they're looking at this footage. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1504.0s)]
*  And I'm looking at footage that looks to me like a guy in a monkey suit. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1508.0s)]
*  See if you can find it. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1513.0s)]
*  Which one? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1515.0s)]
*  It's Les Troud, Bigfoot. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1516.0s)]
*  It's very controversial because the guy who claimed to have captured the video is very controversial. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1518.0s)]
*  Imagine if it's real. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1524.0s)]
*  I mean, and everybody's like disparaging you and you literally saw a Bigfoot. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1526.0s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1529.0s)]
*  That would drive you nuts. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1530.0s)]
*  You'd shit your pants, man. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1531.0s)]
*  Yeah, but watch this. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1533.0s)]
*  Put it up. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1534.0s)]
*  As I'm looking for it, he's looking for him again recently. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1535.0s)]
*  No. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1537.0s)]
*  Les is looking for him again recently? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1538.0s)]
*  Yeah, like he got a video from a month ago in North Texas. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1539.0s)]
*  But then you have to have the conversation of is it one? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1540.0s)]
*  If it's real. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1543.0s)]
*  If it's real and he's right, then we look stupid. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1544.0s)]
*  But, um... [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1547.0s)]
*  Is there one or is this a species? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1549.0s)]
*  Bro, there's so many people out there in the wild. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1551.0s)]
*  You know who doesn't see Bigfoot? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1553.0s)]
*  Who? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1554.0s)]
*  Hunters. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1555.0s)]
*  The people that are really out there in the wild, they're not having these experiences. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1557.0s)]
*  The people that are having these experiences... [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1561.0s)]
*  That's a damn good point. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1563.0s)]
*  You know, it's just... [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1564.0s)]
*  And there's also a thing about bears. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1566.0s)]
*  Bears walk on two legs all the time. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1568.0s)]
*  Do they really? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1570.0s)]
*  All the time. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1571.0s)]
*  Like grizzly bears? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1572.0s)]
*  Especially black bears. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1573.0s)]
*  Especially black bears. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1574.0s)]
*  There's hours of footage of black bears walking on two legs. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1576.0s)]
*  That's fucking terrifying. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1580.0s)]
*  Just walking through the woods on two legs. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1581.0s)]
*  I've seen it. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1583.0s)]
*  There's hunter videos of that. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1584.0s)]
*  I've seen it in person with my own eyes. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1585.0s)]
*  I've watched a black bear stand on his two legs and walk. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1587.0s)]
*  How tall can a black bear get? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1591.0s)]
*  Seven, eight feet. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1593.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1594.0s)]
*  They're big animals, man. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1595.0s)]
*  I think a grizzly bear is the number one thing I'm afraid of in the world. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1596.0s)]
*  That should be a good point. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1600.0s)]
*  That should be right up there. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1602.0s)]
*  Massive. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1604.0s)]
*  They're a massive killing machine. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1605.0s)]
*  I remember being a kid and seeing them at the Columbus Zoo. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1606.0s)]
*  They have an exhibit there where you can go inside their cave. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1610.0s)]
*  Because that's where they spend most of their time there. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1612.0s)]
*  And you can see them up against the glass. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1614.0s)]
*  And laying down, it's like four and a half feet, five feet tall. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1616.0s)]
*  What is this one? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1620.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1621.0s)]
*  Bigfoot from 2013. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1622.0s)]
*  Is this the one? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1624.0s)]
*  So there's one where... [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1625.0s)]
*  No. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1626.0s)]
*  There's one where there's like a close-up on Bigfoot's face. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1627.0s)]
*  Oh, so that... [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1629.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I can't find the one where he's walking. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1630.0s)]
*  Or I can't even find video. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1631.0s)]
*  That's it right down there. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1632.0s)]
*  But it's just a picture. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1633.0s)]
*  Okay, well look at that picture. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1634.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1636.0s)]
*  No. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1637.0s)]
*  No. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1638.0s)]
*  It looks like Teen Wolf. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1639.0s)]
*  But when you see it in the show, it's like the guy zooms in on it. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1640.0s)]
*  He gets a close-up. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1646.0s)]
*  It's like Bigfoot's just staring back up. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1647.0s)]
*  It's too posed. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1649.0s)]
*  Like all these years, Bigfoot's been shy. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1650.0s)]
*  But Bigfoot's like, you know what? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1652.0s)]
*  It's time to let these motherfuckers know. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1653.0s)]
*  Yeah, you get the shot. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1654.0s)]
*  Time to let these motherfuckers know. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1655.0s)]
*  I was trying to find it. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1657.0s)]
*  I thought that's what you wanted, but I couldn't find it. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1658.0s)]
*  That is the video. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1659.0s)]
*  It's so... [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1660.0s)]
*  Which one of these was Joey's? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1661.0s)]
*  Was it this one? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1662.0s)]
*  This one right here. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1663.0s)]
*  This one? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1664.0s)]
*  I'm gonna spark that back up. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1665.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1666.0s)]
*  It's just, if it... [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1667.0s)]
*  I mean, imagine if it is real. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1668.0s)]
*  Imagine if that video's real, right? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1669.0s)]
*  But it doesn't look real. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1670.0s)]
*  And in my limited experience, most things that look fake are fake. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1671.0s)]
*  That looks fake as fuck. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1672.0s)]
*  Oh, damn it. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1673.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1674.0s)]
*  I'm gonna go back to the video. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1675.0s)]
*  I'm gonna go back to the video. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1676.0s)]
*  I'm gonna go back to the video. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1677.0s)]
*  I'm gonna go back to the video. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1678.0s)]
*  I'm gonna go back to the video. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1679.0s)]
*  I'm gonna go back to the video. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1680.0s)]
*  That looks fake as fuck. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1682.0s)]
*  Oh, damn it. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1685.0s)]
*  That looks fake as fuck. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1688.0s)]
*  Look, his hair looks perfect. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1690.0s)]
*  It's nice and slick back. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1691.0s)]
*  It's so perfect. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1693.0s)]
*  Recently applied hair. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1695.0s)]
*  That literally looks like Michael J. Fox in Teen Wolf. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1696.0s)]
*  He looks clean. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1698.0s)]
*  Looks way too clean. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1699.0s)]
*  That's exact... [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1700.0s)]
*  If that was a homeless dude, I wouldn't give him money. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1701.0s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1703.0s)]
*  Or it was a bear. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1704.0s)]
*  Like, bear hair looks different than that. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1705.0s)]
*  Everything looks different. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1706.0s)]
*  I don't want to meet a bear up close. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1707.0s)]
*  That's fucking terrifying. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1708.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're a terrifying animal. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1709.0s)]
*  But the thing is, like, when people... [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1710.0s)]
*  Find video of bears walking on two legs, Jamie. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1712.0s)]
*  I just want you to imagine it's dusk, okay? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1715.0s)]
*  And you're in the Pacific Northwest. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1719.0s)]
*  So you're in this... [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1721.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1722.0s)]
*  You're in this... [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1723.0s)]
*  It's not great. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1724.0s)]
*  Thickly wooded area where it's like, literally like a box of Q-tips. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1725.0s)]
*  That's what the trees are like. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1730.0s)]
*  They're stacked in there. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1732.0s)]
*  Have you ever been in the Pacific Northwest? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1733.0s)]
*  Yeah, I love it up there. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1734.0s)]
*  The mountains up there. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1735.0s)]
*  Beautiful, right? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1736.0s)]
*  The rainforest. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1737.0s)]
*  Now, that's where a lot of sightings are. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1738.0s)]
*  It's also where a lot of bears are. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1740.0s)]
*  Now, look at this. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1741.0s)]
*  Look at this motherfucker. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1742.0s)]
*  That literally looks like a guy in a costume. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1745.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1747.0s)]
*  I mean, what... [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1750.0s)]
*  There's also that China sun bear that went viral. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1751.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1753.0s)]
*  I will say, no swinging arms, though. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1754.0s)]
*  That would be the only sign that would make me think a bear or not bear. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1755.0s)]
*  That bear had a wound, though. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1761.0s)]
*  That bear was a bear that was missing one of its paws. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1763.0s)]
*  One of the... [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1765.0s)]
*  Oh, a paw? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1766.0s)]
*  One of the other bears probably bit his paw off. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1767.0s)]
*  I saw a monkey in Costa Rica that had his hand bitten off. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1772.0s)]
*  And I was like, wow, what do you think happened to his hand? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1775.0s)]
*  And the guy we were with was like, oh, another monkey bit it off. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1778.0s)]
*  I was like, really? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1782.0s)]
*  Yeah, probably when he was a baby. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1783.0s)]
*  I'm like, really? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1784.0s)]
*  Didn't somebody have their hands pulled off by a chimpanzee? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1786.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1790.0s)]
*  That's fucking terrifying. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1791.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1793.0s)]
*  They're so strong, dude. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1794.0s)]
*  They're so strong. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1795.0s)]
*  We can't even imagine. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1796.0s)]
*  They're so strong and they're so aware of the things you want, like your fingers. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1797.0s)]
*  They bite your fingers off. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1800.0s)]
*  It's one of the first things they do. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1801.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1802.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1803.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1804.0s)]
*  When chimpanzees attack you, they bite your fingers off. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1805.0s)]
*  Because they know without your fingers, you can't protect yourself. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1807.0s)]
*  And that's part of what makes you a person. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1809.0s)]
*  They also grab your dick. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1811.0s)]
*  They rip your dick off. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1812.0s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1813.0s)]
*  Yes, they do. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1814.0s)]
*  They bite your face off. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1815.0s)]
*  They tear your eyes out. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1816.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1817.0s)]
*  They're not trying to kill you. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1818.0s)]
*  Diabolical. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1819.0s)]
*  They're trying to rip you apart. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1820.0s)]
*  They're not even trying to kill you. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1821.0s)]
*  They're trying to torture you. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1822.0s)]
*  That is the most caveman shit I've ever heard of. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1823.0s)]
*  It's far beyond. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1827.0s)]
*  They're so different than us, but yet so similar. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1828.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen Chimp Nation on Netflix? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1830.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1832.0s)]
*  You've got to watch it. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1833.0s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1834.0s)]
*  The lady. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1835.0s)]
*  Because, what's up? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1836.0s)]
*  The picture of the lady after the attack. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1837.0s)]
*  Oh, don't show me it. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1838.0s)]
*  Don't show me it. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1839.0s)]
*  Can I see it? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1840.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1841.0s)]
*  Oh, fuck, I'm sorry. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1842.0s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1843.0s)]
*  Just put it on the screen. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1844.0s)]
*  He can look at it. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1845.0s)]
*  I don't want to see this lady's face. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1846.0s)]
*  This is a lady that her friend had a chimpanzee that was a pet. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1848.0s)]
*  That's what she did look like? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1853.0s)]
*  She went to visit the lady and the chimp tore her face apart. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1855.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1860.0s)]
*  She looks like a belly button. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1861.0s)]
*  Yeah, he tore her face apart. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1863.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1865.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1866.0s)]
*  And he was just upset at her because she was cock blocking him. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1867.0s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1871.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1872.0s)]
*  No. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1873.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1874.0s)]
*  She used to sleep with the chimpanzee. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1875.0s)]
*  She used to sleep with the chimpanzee Xanax and wine. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1876.0s)]
*  This lady was nuts. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1877.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1878.0s)]
*  Was this Michael Jackson's monkey? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1879.0s)]
*  This is living the best life ever. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1880.0s)]
*  It was way worse than that because it was a full grown male and it was really big. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1881.0s)]
*  It was like 200 pounds because it was like eating well. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1886.0s)]
*  How big was the chimpanzee when they shot it? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1889.0s)]
*  It says tiny chimp had been left alone with his mother. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1892.0s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1896.0s)]
*  No, that's not the same one. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1897.0s)]
*  The one that tore that lady apart was big. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1898.0s)]
*  Yeah, this one actually said it was the friend. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1901.0s)]
*  It had a diaper on. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1902.0s)]
*  It wasn't the people who owned it. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1903.0s)]
*  It was the couple's friend. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1904.0s)]
*  It wasn't the people who owned it what? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1905.0s)]
*  This says, the one I'm looking at right now, it says he snapped and attacked the couple's [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1906.0s)]
*  friend. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1915.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1916.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1917.0s)]
*  So he didn't even attack someone who had seen the chimp before? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1918.0s)]
*  He was a new person? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1920.0s)]
*  I don't know if it was the first time meeting. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1921.0s)]
*  I was trying to catch up to that, like what happened and make sure this was the same one [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1922.0s)]
*  we're talking about. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1926.0s)]
*  I mean, it didn't happen. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1927.0s)]
*  There's been quite a few chimpanzee attacks. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1928.0s)]
*  One of them is really horrible. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1931.0s)]
*  This guy was a guy who had the chimp as a pet and raised it, but it got too big and [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1933.0s)]
*  they couldn't take it anymore, so they brought it to a chimpanzee shelter. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1938.0s)]
*  It was his birthday, so they brought a cake for the chimp for his birthday. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1942.0s)]
*  The other chimps were so jealous that he got a cake and they didn't that they got out of [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1946.0s)]
*  the cage and tore the guy apart. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1952.0s)]
*  Yeah, because chimps get very, very jealous. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1955.0s)]
*  The fact that they can't even like... [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1957.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1960.0s)]
*  Process that emotion of jealousy. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1961.0s)]
*  They also knew how to get out of the cage somehow or another. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1963.0s)]
*  So they probably knew the whole time. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1967.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1969.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if somebody fucked up and left something open and they noticed it [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1970.0s)]
*  and then tore the guy apart. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1973.0s)]
*  Could have been in the process of when they were getting the other chimp out, so they [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1975.0s)]
*  give him the cake that they saw this. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1979.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1981.0s)]
*  She knew the chimp. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1982.0s)]
*  She knew the chimp, yeah. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1984.0s)]
*  She came out with a tickle in the elbow and the chimp lunged at her. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1985.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1989.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1990.0s)]
*  Fucking hates the Sesame Street. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1991.0s)]
*  Hit him with the spades. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1994.0s)]
*  Oh, it was the chimp's favorite toy. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1995.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1998.0s)]
*  She tried to steal his favorite toy. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=1999.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2001.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2002.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2004.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2005.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2007.0s)]
*  He's eating her. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2008.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2009.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2010.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2011.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2012.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2013.0s)]
*  That is fucking brutal. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2014.0s)]
*  How big was the chimp? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2017.0s)]
*  Because there's photos of him. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2020.0s)]
*  See if you can see the photo. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2022.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2023.0s)]
*  It's right here. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2024.0s)]
*  I mean, this doesn't show the exact same. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2025.0s)]
*  No, that's him when he's a tiny baby. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2026.0s)]
*  But is there any photos of him as a full grown male? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2029.0s)]
*  Because I know there is of him with a diaper on. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2033.0s)]
*  Let me Google then. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2036.0s)]
*  Like he would wear a diaper because otherwise he would just shit everywhere. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2037.0s)]
*  Almost domesticated. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2041.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2042.0s)]
*  Well, I think he's like, I run this house. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2043.0s)]
*  I'll tell you what I want. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2045.0s)]
*  I'll tell you what I want. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2046.0s)]
*  Shit right here. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2047.0s)]
*  This is the living room. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2048.0s)]
*  There's plenty of room in here. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2049.0s)]
*  Is there any kind of? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2050.0s)]
*  Is that him? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2051.0s)]
*  It says it's Travis the Chimp. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2052.0s)]
*  God damn. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2053.0s)]
*  He was massive, dude. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2054.0s)]
*  Massive. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2057.0s)]
*  There's a photo of the lady walking with him. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2058.0s)]
*  That's one of the fattest chimps I've ever seen. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2061.0s)]
*  There was a photo of her when you get to see the perspective of the full grown chimp next [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2063.0s)]
*  to a human. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2069.0s)]
*  Like, God. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2070.0s)]
*  It's just a sack of muscle. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2071.0s)]
*  Is that him up there with it circled? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2073.0s)]
*  I couldn't tell. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2075.0s)]
*  It doesn't. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2076.0s)]
*  It just looks like a. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2077.0s)]
*  No, it just looks like a, like when it was drive through. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2078.0s)]
*  He's like trying to get in the car or something. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2081.0s)]
*  Yeah, it does look like one of those. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2083.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2084.0s)]
*  But it says it's a 911 call from the chimp attack and that was describing the same thing. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2085.0s)]
*  Oh, that might be him out there. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2089.0s)]
*  Oh, look at the cop cars. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2091.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2092.0s)]
*  Can you imagine being the cop showing up? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2093.0s)]
*  You don't know how to handle this fucking thing. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2095.0s)]
*  Not only that, he might rip the door right off the fucking car. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2096.0s)]
*  You think he could? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2100.0s)]
*  Like it's made out of cardboard. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2101.0s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2102.0s)]
*  He definitely could put his hand right through that window. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2103.0s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2106.0s)]
*  A guy can put his hand through a window. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2107.0s)]
*  Do you think you even try to tase that? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2109.0s)]
*  You think it does anything? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2111.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2113.0s)]
*  Tasing would work. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2114.0s)]
*  You think so? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2115.0s)]
*  Because I've seen humans take a. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2116.0s)]
*  Bullets is what you do. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2117.0s)]
*  You use bullets. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2118.0s)]
*  Yeah, you'd have to. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2119.0s)]
*  If the fucking chimp is eating people's faces and you see him on the street, you got to [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2120.0s)]
*  put that motherfucker down. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2125.0s)]
*  If you miss. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2126.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2127.0s)]
*  It was over. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2128.0s)]
*  She was taking his toy. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2129.0s)]
*  How the fuck did she not know that that was his? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2131.0s)]
*  I don't think she just registered how. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2133.0s)]
*  You know how dogs get with their toys? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2135.0s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2138.0s)]
*  Dogs are trained. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2139.0s)]
*  You're not training a chimp. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2140.0s)]
*  She could have been picking it up to give it to him. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2141.0s)]
*  I think he said she was leaving with it. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2143.0s)]
*  Oh, but also why the fuck are you taking the toy in the first place? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2145.0s)]
*  Maybe she was trying to fuck with him. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2148.0s)]
*  Maybe we're not, you know, maybe there was like some thing going on or she didn't like. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2150.0s)]
*  Has anyone taken this stance from the monkey side? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2154.0s)]
*  No. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2156.0s)]
*  Well, the monkey, the chimp plays for keeps. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2157.0s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2159.0s)]
*  Technically, Elmo doll means you don't have a face anymore. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2160.0s)]
*  Just whoa. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2163.0s)]
*  Is there is there an exotic animal that if you had the means to do it properly, you would [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2164.0s)]
*  want as a pet? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2170.0s)]
*  No, I like pets as pets. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2171.0s)]
*  I appreciate wild animals for what they are and I think there's something real weird about [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2173.0s)]
*  owning them. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2178.0s)]
*  And if you want to, I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to, but there's something fucking very [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2179.0s)]
*  strange. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2185.0s)]
*  I want a pet otter. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2186.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's very strange. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2187.0s)]
*  They're fucking adorable. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2188.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2189.0s)]
*  But wouldn't it be cooler if you saw an otter in a river? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2190.0s)]
*  He's out there chilling, doing otter things. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2193.0s)]
*  Yeah, I suppose. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2196.0s)]
*  Catching his own fish and eating them. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2197.0s)]
*  Cracking the fucking clams on their chest and shit. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2199.0s)]
*  The cutest. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2202.0s)]
*  Cutest. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2203.0s)]
*  Holding that fish and fucking eating his head. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2204.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2206.0s)]
*  I don't want a pet one so bad. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2207.0s)]
*  You see that lady's face who got fucked up by an otter? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2208.0s)]
*  Somebody was telling me about this. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2210.0s)]
*  Is there a photo? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2212.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2213.0s)]
*  Jamie, I'm sorry to make you keep bringing up gruesome shit, but I got to see this because [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2214.0s)]
*  it's an unhealthy obsession I have with otters. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2218.0s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2220.0s)]
*  It's not as bad. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2221.0s)]
*  Well, it's not as bad as the chimp, but she got fucked up by an otter, dude. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2222.0s)]
*  I've seen cats do worse. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2228.0s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2230.0s)]
*  Yeah, but that's a fucking wild animal in your face. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2231.0s)]
*  Dude, if a squirrel was trying to fuck you up, you'd be scared. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2233.0s)]
*  But look how cute he is. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2235.0s)]
*  Look, they're very adorable. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2237.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2238.0s)]
*  They're absolutely adorable. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2239.0s)]
*  Little sea weasels. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2240.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're cute. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2242.0s)]
*  If they were really domesticated, I don't know if you can domesticate them. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2244.0s)]
*  I really know nothing about domesticating otters. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2248.0s)]
*  But if that's possible, I think they'd be the cutest pets ever. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2250.0s)]
*  I'll find out. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2253.0s)]
*  They're adorable. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2254.0s)]
*  Have you seen the videos of them showing humans how to pet them? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2255.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2258.0s)]
*  That's the cutest shit ever. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2259.0s)]
*  That's pretty fucking cute. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2260.0s)]
*  That's pretty fucking cute. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2261.0s)]
*  I'm going to find out. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2262.0s)]
*  I'm going to do my research. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2263.0s)]
*  If that's really what they're like, if you domesticate them, that's pretty cool. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2264.0s)]
*  I bet you can't have an aquarium. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2268.0s)]
*  Or you can and treat this motherfucker otter to a buffet. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2272.0s)]
*  Whenever you want, man. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2277.0s)]
*  All you get is a salad bar. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2278.0s)]
*  That's what it would be. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2279.0s)]
*  That would be my ideal house. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2280.0s)]
*  What's that? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2282.0s)]
*  Biting and ripping. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2283.0s)]
*  Oh, but like puppies do that. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2284.0s)]
*  Yeah, puppies do that. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2286.0s)]
*  How are you going to teach an otter? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2287.0s)]
*  Maybe they're smarter than we think. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2289.0s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2291.0s)]
*  Maybe it's just a thing they do when they're scared. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2292.0s)]
*  Maybe that person was treating them wrong. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2294.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen people miss it. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2296.0s)]
*  You ever see somebody who thinks they're really gentle with animals, but they're so not? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2297.0s)]
*  They're rough. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2301.0s)]
*  They pet dogs like ... [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2302.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2303.0s)]
*  Some people slap dogs. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2304.0s)]
*  Like, hey, buddy. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2305.0s)]
*  Or one hand, pick them up in an awkward way. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2306.0s)]
*  I know you don't mean well, but you're doing this terribly. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2309.0s)]
*  Imagine being a chihuahua. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2312.0s)]
*  Everybody's going to carry you. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2313.0s)]
*  Oh, I would hate to be a small dog. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2314.0s)]
*  What a fucking torturous life. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2316.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2318.0s)]
*  Everyone has to carry you everywhere. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2319.0s)]
*  You have a dog, right? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2320.0s)]
*  You have a golden retriever? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2321.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2322.0s)]
*  Beautiful dog. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2323.0s)]
*  He's great. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2324.0s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2325.0s)]
*  He's one of the best dogs of all time. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2326.0s)]
*  He's just a sweetheart to everybody. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2327.0s)]
*  He's just a big old love sponge. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2328.0s)]
*  He's just super sweet, friendly. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2331.0s)]
*  I want a golden retriever, German Shepherd I would love to have. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2333.0s)]
*  So beautiful. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2336.0s)]
*  So smart. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2337.0s)]
*  Those are great dogs, too. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2338.0s)]
*  Those are dogs, though, that need ... They need activity. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2339.0s)]
*  Yeah, they need stimulation. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2341.0s)]
*  Yeah, they need activity. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2342.0s)]
*  You can't just have a German Shepherd and keep him in a little yard, like going out of [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2343.0s)]
*  his fucking mind like he's in prison. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2346.0s)]
*  No. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2348.0s)]
*  Also, what a waste of talent. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2349.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2350.0s)]
*  They're so smart. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2351.0s)]
*  So impressive. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2352.0s)]
*  They're very smart dogs. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2353.0s)]
*  Very smart dogs. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2354.0s)]
*  They're a different kind of dog. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2355.0s)]
*  That's a working dog. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2357.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2358.0s)]
*  But I guess it's just ... People want different things in a dog. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2359.0s)]
*  I just got my mom for Mother's Day last year, this tiny little thing that's literally the [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2362.0s)]
*  size of this coffee mug. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2365.0s)]
*  You could accidentally squish it so easy. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2367.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2369.0s)]
*  So people like those kind of dogs. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2370.0s)]
*  But also, what does that come from? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2371.0s)]
*  That's not a descendant of a wolf. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2373.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2374.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2375.0s)]
*  How does that happen? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2376.0s)]
*  Well, selective breeding. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2378.0s)]
*  And also, there's a thing that happens with animals. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2380.0s)]
*  We don't totally understand it, but they've done this study with foxes where they took [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2382.0s)]
*  foxes and over a period of not that many generations, what they did was any time a fox displayed [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2388.0s)]
*  any aggression towards people, they killed it. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2398.0s)]
*  And over a certain period of time, all the foxes that were left, their jaws had shrank, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2402.0s)]
*  their ears were more floppy. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2410.0s)]
*  They started giving into the idea of domestication, and they literally started softening their [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2413.0s)]
*  appearance. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2420.0s)]
*  They weren't alert like a fox would be if it was a little killer. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2421.0s)]
*  Silver Fox Domestication Experiment. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2427.0s)]
*  So for the last 59 years, a team of Russian geneticists led by Ludmila Trutte have been [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2429.0s)]
*  running one of the most important biology experiments of the 20th and now 21st century. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2440.0s)]
*  The experiment was the brainchild of Trutte's mentor, Dmitry Belyev, who in 1959 began an [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2444.0s)]
*  experiment to study the process of domestication in real time. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2452.0s)]
*  He was especially keen on understanding the domestication of wolves to dogs, but rather [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2455.0s)]
*  than use wolves, he used silver foxes as his subjects. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2460.0s)]
*  Here I provide a brief overview of how the Silver Fox Domestication Study began and what [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2463.0s)]
*  results to date have taught us. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2468.0s)]
*  Experiments continue to this day. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2470.0s)]
*  Then I explain just how close this study came to being shut down for political reasons during [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2472.0s)]
*  its very first year. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2476.0s)]
*  So that's the abstract. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2478.0s)]
*  So this is probably butchering the story, but over time, these things started to change, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2481.0s)]
*  and they softened their appearance and they dropped their ears. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2489.0s)]
*  And so there's also there's a thing that happens with pigs where the opposite happens. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2492.0s)]
*  When you take a domesticated pig and you release it in the wild, they morph within six. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2498.0s)]
*  I think it's a very short amount of time. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2505.0s)]
*  I want to say it's less than two months of living in the wild. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2507.0s)]
*  They start to display different characteristics with males. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2511.0s)]
*  Their snout extends, I think with females too, but males grow these big ass tusks and their hair gets thicker. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2516.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2523.0s)]
*  Their hair gets thicker all over the body. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2524.0s)]
*  Just instinctually for being out there. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2525.0s)]
*  Now they know they're on their own and their body morphs. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2527.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2530.0s)]
*  So their appearance morphs. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2531.0s)]
*  That's an incredible genetic. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2533.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2534.0s)]
*  So there's different kinds of pigs, but they're all the same animal. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2535.0s)]
*  It's all I think that genus is called seus scroffa and that when you see a wild boar, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2540.0s)]
*  a lot of them could have descended from domesticated pigs because people have pig farms and pigs get out fences break. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2546.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2554.0s)]
*  And the pigs get loose and some of those pigs, they just keep having piglets, but they're wild pigs. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2555.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2560.0s)]
*  But they look like wild boars, like from what you would expect from like some movie. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2561.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2565.0s)]
*  That's that's what happened. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2566.0s)]
*  Very quick evolution. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2567.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2568.0s)]
*  See if you can find like how much time it takes for a domesticated pig to start displaying wild looks. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2569.0s)]
*  That's a bad way to Google it. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2579.0s)]
*  This is what I love about you and your show. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2581.0s)]
*  Like you're very insightful on a lot of things I find very, very fascinating. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2583.0s)]
*  You're like a science guy offered people DMT. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2587.0s)]
*  I got plenty of stupid information. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2589.0s)]
*  I love it. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2591.0s)]
*  It's all things that fascinate me. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2592.0s)]
*  But if you look at it that way, right, if a pig becomes harder in the wild and a wolf becomes softer with domestication, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2593.0s)]
*  if you just kept doing that and like softening it like when you associate those little tiny fluffy dogs, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2602.0s)]
*  what are you associating with? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2608.0s)]
*  Like some some lady who's got a nice house and a nice car, she's got a nice little little fluffy dog that sits next to her. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2610.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2618.0s)]
*  They've taken that wolf and knocked it down to that. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2619.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2622.0s)]
*  Thousands of years. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2623.0s)]
*  It's funny that like the same thing happens to humans. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2624.0s)]
*  I mean, we got trapped inside for two years. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2627.0s)]
*  So often they'll fuck up. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2629.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's all in also society. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2631.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2633.0s)]
*  The needs of like society, especially society like ours, it's not engaged in war on our shores where there's not like a physical threat of actual violence from the enemy. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2634.0s)]
*  We you know, you tend to soften things up and the same sort of experiment is going on with male human beings. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2644.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2651.0s)]
*  It's going on with dogs and I've heard I've heard that quote on this show so many times. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2652.0s)]
*  Hard times bring hard, hard people. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2656.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2658.0s)]
*  Easy times, easy times, easy people or whatever it is. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2659.0s)]
*  I'm paraphrasing. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2661.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2663.0s)]
*  Hard hard times create hard men. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2664.0s)]
*  Hard men create easy times. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2666.0s)]
*  Easy times create soft men. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2668.0s)]
*  Soft men create hard times. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2670.0s)]
*  Vicious cycle. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2672.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's normal. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2673.0s)]
*  It's just we they've known this forever. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2675.0s)]
*  This is how humans work. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2677.0s)]
*  From hog to wild hog, how a stealth gene transforms pigs into wild boars. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2679.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2684.0s)]
*  A barnyard escapee can quickly resemble a feral hog growing bigger and hairier in a matter of months. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2685.0s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2691.0s)]
*  So that pig right there could have started out as a domesticated pig and got out and it will turn into that wild looking thing. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2692.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2701.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2702.0s)]
*  Experts say the crisis is largely driven by people who trap and transport the animals so they can be hunted. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2703.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2708.0s)]
*  Maybe the year the rabbit, the pig, the feral pigs. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2709.0s)]
*  Like how long does it? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2713.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's Suskrafa. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2714.0s)]
*  So that is millennia of chasing wild boars around the woods of spears. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2715.0s)]
*  Homo sapiens finally got wise. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2719.0s)]
*  Roughly 9000 years ago, which is now in what is now eastern Turkey, our ancestors began domesticating the Eurasian boar Suskrafa by the time. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2721.0s)]
*  So they were wild first, then they domesticated them. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2730.0s)]
*  And they're like gremlins. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2734.0s)]
*  You feed them at night. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2736.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2737.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2738.0s)]
*  By the time Christopher Columbus picked up a few to take along on his second voyage to America in 1493, the 400 pound tusk beast had been transformed into a pink floppy eared familiar. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2739.0s)]
*  In that time, pig husbandry had produced a docile and resilient animal, one bred to survive a range of climatic conditions and to reproduce a lot. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2751.0s)]
*  Well, that's the thing about pigs. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2763.0s)]
*  Like they have three litters a year. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2765.0s)]
*  Do they really? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2767.0s)]
*  Yeah, they bang out babies like let's go and they start doing it when they're like six months old. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2768.0s)]
*  So it's six months old. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2773.0s)]
*  They're already spitting out kids. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2775.0s)]
*  That's and how many piglets do they usually have? [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2776.0s)]
*  Like eight? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2778.0s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2779.0s)]
*  I think it's about six. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2780.0s)]
*  If I had to guess, there might be more. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2781.0s)]
*  What is the average litter of a pig? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2783.0s)]
*  Is that what they call it? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2788.0s)]
*  Litters? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2789.0s)]
*  I think. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2790.0s)]
*  I'm just guessing. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2791.0s)]
*  They're so smart too. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2792.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2794.0s)]
*  Average pig litter. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2795.0s)]
*  The amount of tabs you have open at this browser is so funny. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2798.0s)]
*  7.5. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2802.0s)]
*  The average litter size is 7.5. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2804.0s)]
*  It's not uncommon for a sow to have 12 to 14 pigs per litter. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2807.0s)]
*  How do you have a half? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2812.0s)]
*  Just one little midglet? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2813.0s)]
*  This is an average. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2814.0s)]
*  You know, some 15, some 13, some total. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2816.0s)]
*  Thank you, Jamie. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2819.0s)]
*  That's pretty nuts, man. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2820.0s)]
*  That's pretty nuts. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2821.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2822.0s)]
*  So they're just constantly pumping out kids. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2823.0s)]
*  And when you let them grow out in the wild, they turn back to what they originally were. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2826.0s)]
*  So that makes sense that if you took dogs and you like slowly gave them food all the time [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2831.0s)]
*  and all the wolves that were like bitch ass wolves who couldn't hunt anymore, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2835.0s)]
*  like come on, bitch ass wolf. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2839.0s)]
*  I got some food for you. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2840.0s)]
*  Just growl when the bears come. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2841.0s)]
*  And then they, okay, I'll do that for you. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2843.0s)]
*  Just like people kind of get. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2846.0s)]
*  People that have like overpowering bosses. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2848.0s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2851.0s)]
*  We learned the other week or the other day. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2852.0s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2854.0s)]
*  Oh, the thing about wolves. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2855.0s)]
*  Shockingly enough, a creature almost synonymous with the sea didn't actually begin that way. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2857.0s)]
*  And boy, is it a whale of a tale. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2862.0s)]
*  A mind blowing video recently posted by PBS eons reveals that whales were actually predatory land animals, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2864.0s)]
*  the same ones that would later become wolves specifically. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2871.0s)]
*  So the animal branched off in the water and became whales and on the ground became wolves. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2875.0s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2883.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2884.0s)]
*  What? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2885.0s)]
*  How wild is that? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2886.0s)]
*  That is fucking wild. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2887.0s)]
*  And hippos, I guess, came from the same thing. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2890.0s)]
*  And hippos came from the same thing. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2891.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2893.0s)]
*  What Bible chapters? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2894.0s)]
*  They missed that part. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2897.0s)]
*  Hippos. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2899.0s)]
*  Hippos scare the fucking shit out of me. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2900.0s)]
*  Oh, I mean, that's a dinosaur. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2902.0s)]
*  That is they are so insane. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2904.0s)]
*  So unbelievable. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2906.0s)]
*  And aren't they relatively aggressive? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2907.0s)]
*  Oh, super aggressive. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2909.0s)]
*  And they go after boats. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2910.0s)]
*  They take people out. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2912.0s)]
*  You know, the thing about hippos is it's one of those other animals that for whatever reason, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2913.0s)]
*  when we anthropomorphize, when we give them like human characteristics, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2918.0s)]
*  we make them sweet. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2922.0s)]
*  Hungry, hungry hippo. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2923.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2925.0s)]
*  You know, like polar bears. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2926.0s)]
*  Like it's Coca-Cola. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2927.0s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2928.0s)]
*  Klondike bars. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2929.0s)]
*  So aggressive. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2930.0s)]
*  They're terrifying. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2931.0s)]
*  No, fuck all that. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2932.0s)]
*  We do that with so many terrifying animals. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2933.0s)]
*  Fucking yogi bear. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2935.0s)]
*  We turned one of the scariest animals in the forest. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2939.0s)]
*  Roasted flakes. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2942.0s)]
*  Hey, boo boo. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2943.0s)]
*  Let's get us a picnic basket. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2944.0s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2946.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2947.0s)]
*  Dude, yogi bear was like this sweetheart. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2948.0s)]
*  And how many people grew up thinking bears were their friends because of that stupid shit? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2951.0s)]
*  And then these dummies, you go out in the woods, you're like, oh no. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2955.0s)]
*  Mold to death. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2958.0s)]
*  People used to look at bears for what they are. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2959.0s)]
*  And then teddy bears came around. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2961.0s)]
*  And then when they started giving people teddy bears, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2963.0s)]
*  then they started like thinking that like bears are your little friends. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2966.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2970.0s)]
*  And then build a bear is responsible for a lot of deaths. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2971.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2972.0s)]
*  People don't talk about that enough. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2973.0s)]
*  I don't think build a bear is responsible, but the teddy bear is. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2974.0s)]
*  By the time build a bear came, it was already Disney movies. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2978.0s)]
*  It was already too late. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2981.0s)]

*  Bears are your friends. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2984.0s)]
*  Animals are your friends. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2985.0s)]

*  They save you. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2987.0s)]
*  They tell the people about the wicked witch. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=2988.0s)]

*  I don't even think that's like, I think it is a person. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3004.0s)]
*  Some people say it's a bird. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3006.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3007.0s)]
*  Some people say it's a bird in the background. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3008.0s)]

*  They said it was one of the little people. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3012.0s)]
*  Enough. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3014.0s)]

*  Oh, no. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3018.0s)]
*  Unpacking the myth of the hanging munchkin. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3019.0s)]
*  So, might be a myth. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3023.0s)]

*  No. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3031.0s)]
*  It's fun to be naive. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3032.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3036.0s)]
*  That's why I like to read about shit like Hollow Earth. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3037.0s)]
*  It's that. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3039.0s)]
*  That thing. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3040.0s)]

*  What the fuck is Hollow Earth? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3042.0s)]
*  Please unpack after this. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3043.0s)]
*  That's it? [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3044.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3045.0s)]
*  Okay, that could be anything. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3046.0s)]
*  And when they're walking, it does start moving side to side. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3047.0s)]
*  It starts walking? [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3049.0s)]
*  No, when they're walking. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3050.0s)]
*  People say it's a swing, right? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3051.0s)]
*  I'm saying, yeah, when they're walking down the yellow bridge road. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3052.0s)]
*  Do you think they would see that? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3053.0s)]
*  Stop filming. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3054.0s)]
*  Stop filming. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3055.0s)]

*  Keep rolling. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3058.0s)]
*  You know how much money this film costs? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3059.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3064.0s)]
*  It's just one of the executive producers. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3065.0s)]
*  You know how much money this studio's investing in this film? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3067.0s)]
*  I'll pull the plug on it right now. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3071.0s)]
*  Keep walking. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3074.0s)]
*  Hanging little person be damned. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3077.0s)]
*  Please unpack Hollow Earth from me because you said it and now I want to know everything [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3079.0s)]
*  about it. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3082.0s)]
*  Well, Hollow Earth, it pales in comparison to Space is Fake. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3083.0s)]
*  Space is Fake is the greatest conspiracy thing to dive into online. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3090.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3094.0s)]
*  It's so fun. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3096.0s)]
*  How do you think they're lights in the sky? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3098.0s)]
*  Like these kind of lights? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3101.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3103.0s)]
*  There's a firmament. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3105.0s)]
*  There's like a glass ceiling above it all. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3106.0s)]
*  Nothing can go out there because there's nothing there. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3109.0s)]
*  The Earth is flat. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3112.0s)]
*  Didn't somebody land on the dark side of the moon the other day? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3113.0s)]
*  China. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3116.0s)]
*  China did? [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3117.0s)]
*  I think it was India. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3118.0s)]
*  Yeah, correct. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3119.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3120.0s)]
*  I don't think Earth can. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3121.0s)]
*  Space can't be fake. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3124.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3126.0s)]
*  It's amazing how many people are into it. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3127.0s)]
*  If you just Google hashtag Space is Fake, you'll be taken to these random Instagram accounts. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3129.0s)]
*  And here's the thing about it. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3134.0s)]
*  I don't know if they're real people. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3136.0s)]
*  But I don't know if it matters because it starts off, it could start off as like some Russian troll. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3139.0s)]
*  Like there's these things called like the Internet Research Agency is one of them, these troll farms. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3147.0s)]
*  You know about these? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3152.0s)]
*  No, but it makes sense. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3153.0s)]
*  Renee DeResta reported on it and some people, a lot of people have reported on it. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3155.0s)]
*  But what it is is they have these places where there's thousands and thousands of accounts. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3161.0s)]
*  And they set up like there's images of it where you see like rows of cell phones that are connected to this network. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3171.0s)]
*  And they have these people that have these access to these accounts and they're posting things that are really stupid. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3180.0s)]
*  They're posting things that are ridiculous conspiracy theories. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3189.0s)]
*  They're posting things blaming Democrats for certain things and blaming Republicans for certain things. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3194.0s)]
*  At one point in time, Facebook, 19 of their top 20 Christian sites were run by Russian troll farms. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3200.0s)]
*  It's genius like social sabotage at a very high level. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3209.0s)]
*  And so they're interacting with people constantly online. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3215.0s)]
*  So if you see people fighting on Twitter, if you say like a controversial post goes up about anything with foreign policy, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3220.0s)]
*  trans rights, abortion, Second Amendment, anything, if you go into one of those popular posts, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3228.0s)]
*  you'll see all these like crazed right wing and crazed left wing opinions. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3235.0s)]
*  Occasionally you click on them. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3242.0s)]
*  And if you go to, I should say occasionally, oftentimes you'll click on them and you go to a page that seems oddly unhuman. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3244.0s)]
*  It seems fake. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3253.0s)]
*  It's fake. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3254.0s)]
*  There's like a real personality behind it. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3255.0s)]
*  And you go into it and you see that they're always engaging on these very specific issues. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3258.0s)]
*  And they're always being like very confrontational. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3262.0s)]
*  And it kind of discourages people that disagree with them from interacting with them. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3266.0s)]
*  And it kind of encourages people that love to fight with people to fight back. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3272.0s)]
*  So you get all this interaction and these people do it to steer conversations and get people to lose faith in democracy, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3276.0s)]
*  lose faith in the police's ability to protect you, lose faith in whether or not we can unite racially or sexually, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3285.0s)]
*  whether we can be a harmonious country. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3293.0s)]
*  It's like designed to keep conflict going. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3297.0s)]
*  It literally can accelerate conflict like gasoline on a fire. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3300.0s)]
*  And that you can engineer to a certain extent. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3304.0s)]
*  I don't know what percentage, but imagine it's five percent. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3307.0s)]
*  You can five percent through these trolls engineer conversations in the public. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3310.0s)]
*  And you can get people to do a lot of really dumb shit. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3316.0s)]
*  Like if you wanted to get people to believe that the earth is flat, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3319.0s)]
*  or if you wanted to get people to believe that the earth is hollow and there's dinosaurs inside of it and aliens live in there, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3324.0s)]
*  you could get people to believe that. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3330.0s)]
*  And then they would start fighting about it online. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3332.0s)]
*  And then you could get people to believe that, you know, there's been a bunch of them. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3334.0s)]
*  There's been a bunch of them that were that are like mainstream propaganda things like the Russia collusion hoax with Trump. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3339.0s)]
*  It took us like three years to figure that out. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3345.0s)]
*  But now everybody knows that didn't really happen the way they were saying it was happening every day on the news. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3348.0s)]
*  If that can take place with like mainstream media, how much of like what people are fighting about is like engineered? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3353.0s)]
*  Oh, man. How much of it? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3361.0s)]
*  That might be the most evil thing I've ever heard in my entire life to just control and design chaos. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3362.0s)]
*  You definitely are encouraging chaos. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3369.0s)]

*  When Shultz and Morel started putting out their clips, that's when I was like, I have [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3811.96s)]
*  to do it. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3815.0s)]
*  Shultz converted it into a Netflix show. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3816.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3818.34s)]
*  Genius. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3819.34s)]
*  Well, at first, it was when he was releasing a new bit [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3820.34s)]
*  every single week. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3825.38s)]
*  And he was like, well, if I can write one minute a week [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3826.58s)]
*  for a year, that's a brand new hour, boom, 52 minutes. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3829.26s)]
*  And I just thought that was so inspiring. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3832.34s)]
*  And I was like, I need to be doing [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3833.6600000000003s)]
*  something relative to that. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3835.38s)]
*  Well, it's also, you know, the pandemic kind of opened up [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3836.6600000000003s)]
*  doors and also closed a shitload of them, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3840.1000000000004s)]
*  but it did open up doors with time. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3842.7000000000003s)]
*  And when you're just sitting there and you can't do [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3845.46s)]
*  the normal thing that you do, you start thinking, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3848.48s)]
*  okay, okay, okay, I feel sorry for myself. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3850.92s)]
*  That's all over, let's get over that. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3853.0s)]
*  And now let's figure out what can we do? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3854.76s)]
*  And if you're a hustler, if you're a guy who's like, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3857.48s)]
*  you know, like a guy like Andrew, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3859.96s)]
*  who's always trying to figure things out [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3861.88s)]
*  and get ahead and do better. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3864.12s)]
*  Yeah, so he created like a no, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3866.2000000000003s)]
*  and by the way, it's a totally different style of comedy [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3869.0s)]
*  than his standup, which is interesting [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3872.2000000000003s)]
*  because it's these rapid fire punchlines [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3874.2400000000002s)]
*  where his standup is much more engaging [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3877.16s)]
*  and he pauses more, he laughs a lot. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3879.7599999999998s)]
*  More personable. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3882.96s)]
*  Yes, yeah, so this is like a different kind of comedy, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3883.7999999999997s)]
*  but it was like really the best kind of comedy [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3887.96s)]
*  for the pandemic. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3890.08s)]
*  Like short attention span, rapid fire jokes, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3891.3599999999997s)]
*  very silly, and turn your phone sideways. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3895.08s)]
*  It changed everything. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3899.2s)]
*  That's scary to think about. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3901.8799999999997s)]
*  You had to do it. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3904.7599999999998s)]
*  You had to do something. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3907.88s)]
*  It was almost like a late night show, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3908.72s)]
*  the way he wrote that material. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3911.0s)]
*  Yes, yeah. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3912.72s)]
*  And the attention span during that time period was so fast. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3914.04s)]
*  Remember we thought Quibi was gonna be a good thing? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3917.2s)]
*  I never thought it was gonna be a good thing. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3919.24s)]
*  Nobody in their right fucking mind did, [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3921.12s)]
*  but Hollywood went, well, everyone's watching [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3922.72s)]
*  short things now, and everyone, are you sure? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3924.84s)]
*  Well, everyone's on their phone, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3927.52s)]
*  those are always short videos. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3928.48s)]
*  What they don't understand is that you can't just set out [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3929.48s)]
*  to create a successful show like that, [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3934.28s)]
*  or a successful thing like that, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3938.2400000000002s)]
*  and throw a bunch of money at it, [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3940.5600000000004s)]
*  and know that it's gonna be successful. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3942.2000000000003s)]
*  You have to let them become successful, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3944.6400000000003s)]
*  then you acquire them. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3947.2400000000002s)]
*  That's the only way. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3949.2400000000002s)]
*  Cause they'll give up, just like they give up [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3952.2000000000003s)]
*  with a TV show. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3954.0s)]
*  If you have a TV show on ABC, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3954.84s)]
*  and then the first few episodes come out, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3956.76s)]
*  and it doesn't do well, and then it drops off [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3958.76s)]
*  with the fourth, you're done, son, over. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3960.7200000000003s)]
*  But if you have something that you've developed [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3963.84s)]
*  on your own, and these videos go viral naturally, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3966.2000000000003s)]
*  then it makes sense that you have a channel [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3971.76s)]
*  where there's 10 seconds of these videos [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3974.6800000000003s)]
*  that have already gone viral, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3976.32s)]
*  and people know to look for them. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3977.6800000000003s)]
*  But if you're trying to get people to sign up [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3978.6800000000003s)]
*  for some new fucking thing, while YouTube already exists, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3981.38s)]
*  and you're gonna dump all the, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3986.96s)]
*  unless you're completely uncensored, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3988.2400000000002s)]
*  like Rumble or something like that, [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3990.6000000000004s)]
*  that kinda makes sense, that makes sense. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3992.4s)]
*  But you're not gonna be able to compete with them [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3994.28s)]
*  in terms of just entertainment. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3997.08s)]
*  There's everything on there. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=3998.92s)]
*  I will respect them taking a risk [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4000.7200000000003s)]
*  that Hollywood just doesn't do anymore. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4003.2400000000002s)]
*  Every meeting I go into now is like, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4005.6800000000003s)]
*  so what reboots do we wanna do? [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4008.1600000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4010.04s)]
*  Like that's a real conversation [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4010.88s)]
*  every single meeting I have, and it's so sad. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4012.12s)]
*  Well there's probably less projects than ever before. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4014.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4016.88s)]
*  And there's probably less money than ever before, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4017.7200000000003s)]
*  and less certainty. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4020.2000000000003s)]
*  Nobody wants to sit through 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4022.1200000000003s)]
*  and watch three different commercial breaks. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4026.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4029.1200000000003s)]
*  We don't wanna do that anymore. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4029.96s)]
*  People are done with that. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4031.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4032.08s)]
*  That shit's stupid. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4032.92s)]
*  And then unless you're a sitcom, [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4033.76s)]
*  that's the only thing that really lives. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4034.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4036.52s)]
*  That's middle of America. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4037.36s)]
*  Yeah, and then you're watching arthritis commercials. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4038.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4041.1600000000003s)]

*  Yeah, they're wrapping my tour bus coming up. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4057.12s)]
*  I'm so excited. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4059.56s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4060.4s)]
*  So funny to get a sponsorship from them. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4061.24s)]
*  Have you ever seen the amount of money [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4062.3599999999997s)]
*  that is spent on content creators on OnlyFans [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4063.92s)]
*  and most of it, naked girls? [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4067.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen the amount of money? [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4069.16s)]
*  Let's guess. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4070.7599999999998s)]
*  Like how much they spend a year. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4071.6s)]
*  Like OnlyFans? [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4073.92s)]
*  Subscribing, yeah. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4074.7599999999998s)]
*  All the money that comes in. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4075.72s)]
*  How much do you think they spend a year? [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4076.8799999999997s)]
*  From all the influencers, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4078.0s)]
*  we wanna call them that. All of them. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4080.48s)]
*  Yeah, influencers. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4082.56s)]

*  I'm gonna say, [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4084.24s)]
*  a year? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4087.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4088.4s)]
*  700 million. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4090.96s)]
*  It's way more than that I think. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4093.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think it's probably somewhere around [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4096.04s)]
*  the GDP of a small country. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4098.68s)]
*  What? [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4101.64s)]
*  What is it? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4103.0s)]
*  What's the amount that OnlyFans brings in every year? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4103.84s)]
*  It's definitely increased last year, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4107.72s)]
*  which is gonna be way more this year. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4109.8s)]
*  2022's revenue was $2.5 billion. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4110.96s)]
*  But that's just OnlyFans. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4115.599999999999s)]
*  There's a couple other sites too [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4116.84s)]
*  that have to be included in this. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4117.68s)]
*  Bro, if you get enough pictures of tits and feet, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4118.5199999999995s)]

*  Get me down to about 2.5 billion. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4164.44s)]

*  They'd buy a fucking island. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4176.32s)]
*  They could. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4178.24s)]
*  They might be able to start their own country. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4179.08s)]
*  One of those content houses. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4180.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they could do their own country. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4182.24s)]
*  Where there'd be like 10 models living in there. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4183.08s)]
*  They could have their own rules. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4184.36s)]
*  Their own country. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4185.599999999999s)]
*  It wouldn't surprise me at all. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4187.0s)]
*  They have so much. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4188.24s)]
*  That's only in a year, bro. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4189.08s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4190.5s)]
*  2.5 billion. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4191.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's in a year. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4192.24s)]

*  I think 10%. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4195.96s)]
*  That's the cut. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4196.799999999999s)]
*  I think so. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4197.639999999999s)]
*  Think of that. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4198.48s)]
*  But I'm wondering what inevitably set them aside [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4199.32s)]
*  from like Patreon's been around forever. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4201.599999999999s)]
*  Girls were doing Patreon before OnlyFans. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4204.04s)]
*  I wonder if the revenue split is better. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4206.44s)]
*  Maybe the, is it easier to navigate? [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4208.36s)]
*  Well I think, wasn't it, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4212.24s)]

*  They're real close to being able to do that [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4272.88s)]
*  with like very realistic, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4275.56s)]

*  and make words come out of your mouth that you didn't say. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4280.3s)]

*  and then they have the baseline. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4285.34s)]
*  There's a ton of commercials out there of me [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4287.06s)]

*  They used AI, they used my voice. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4293.900000000001s)]
*  They can do wild shit now, man. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4296.54s)]
*  And you gotta imagine that, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4298.1s)]
*  like if you're like a young female celebrity, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4300.02s)]

*  Yet there's no good footage of Bigfoot. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4307.18s)]
*  Not one AI interpretation of Bigfoot. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4310.74s)]
*  Exactly. Come on, man. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4312.179999999999s)]
*  Well, I think Bigfoot was a real animal [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4314.219999999999s)]
*  at one point in time. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4317.379999999999s)]
*  It just makes sense. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4319.0199999999995s)]
*  First of all, historically it was a real animal. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4320.54s)]
*  There's a thing called gigantopithecus. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4323.0199999999995s)]
*  They found its bones in an apothecary shop. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4326.179999999999s)]
*  There was a large primate molar [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4329.78s)]
*  that an anthropologist found in an apothecary shop [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4332.099999999999s)]
*  that it was in China [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4335.92s)]
*  and it didn't match any known primate. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4337.22s)]
*  And he knew it was too large. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4339.9800000000005s)]
*  And there was bones that seemed to indicate, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4341.740000000001s)]
*  it was jaw bones that seemed to indicate it was bipedal. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4344.9800000000005s)]
*  They can apparently tell by the shape of the jaw. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4348.18s)]
*  Like how tall? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4349.900000000001s)]
*  Eight feet tall. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4351.22s)]
*  It was an enormous thing. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4352.54s)]
*  That's what it looked like. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4353.860000000001s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4354.900000000001s)]
*  It's very orangutan like. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4355.820000000001s)]
*  But that looks like Bigfoot. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4357.54s)]
*  It is Bigfoot. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4359.9400000000005s)]
*  I think that is Bigfoot. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4361.02s)]
*  I mean, it's easier to believe one of these [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4362.740000000001s)]
*  just happened to still be around. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4365.1s)]
*  Than a totally new creature, I think. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4366.94s)]
*  Yes, but no. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4368.46s)]
*  It's not easy to believe they're still around. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4370.54s)]
*  When did they go extinct? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4372.099999999999s)]
*  They went extinct somewhere around 100,000 years ago. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4373.3s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4376.34s)]
*  They find animals sometimes that they thought were extinct. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4377.18s)]
*  Like when did they, 9.8 feet, wow. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4379.22s)]
*  God damn. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4382.3s)]
*  Okay, 11,700 years ago in southern China. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4383.18s)]
*  This is what they know, right? [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4386.099999999999s)]
*  So they don't necessarily know [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4387.86s)]
*  that it was 11,700 years ago [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4390.5s)]
*  or really might've been like 6,000 years ago. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4392.66s)]
*  They just don't have those bones yet. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4394.7s)]
*  It's all like when they're finding bones of things, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4396.7s)]
*  you know, like if they do, [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4403.26s)]
*  they feel the last bone we found was this amount old. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4406.0199999999995s)]
*  If they find a new one six months from now, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4411.0199999999995s)]
*  they do that all the time with like, [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4413.46s)]
*  they're finding all these new versions of human beings. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4415.0599999999995s)]
*  Like they found Denisovans. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4418.179999999999s)]
*  That's a new kind of human that they found. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4419.86s)]
*  I think they found that in Russia. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4422.74s)]
*  I want to say that was like 2013 or 2014, [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4425.099999999999s)]
*  but I think they just found another one in China [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4428.0199999999995s)]
*  that seems to be different [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4430.7s)]
*  than any other human being they found before too. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4431.98s)]
*  So there was multiple versions of human beings, right? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4434.219999999999s)]
*  There was Neanderthals, there's Homo sapiens. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4437.34s)]
*  There's a bunch of different versions of us [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4440.54s)]
*  that didn't quite make it. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4443.179999999999s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4444.62s)]
*  And one of them they found was the Hobbit person. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4445.46s)]
*  They found it in the island of Flores. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4448.139999999999s)]
*  And there was always talk in like legend [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4450.82s)]
*  of these little furry men, these little tiny men. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4455.54s)]
*  Like how tall? [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4458.259999999999s)]
*  Three feet tall, man. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4459.099999999999s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4460.42s)]
*  But they found bones. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4461.58s)]
*  And then when they found bones, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4463.54s)]
*  they realized that this thing lived around the same time [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4464.86s)]
*  as human beings somewhere as recently as, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4469.46s)]
*  I think they think it was like 10,000 years ago, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4471.9s)]
*  but that's what they looked like. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4474.9s)]
*  So they looked like people. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4476.3s)]
*  They used tools. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4478.58s)]
*  They probably hunted. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4480.54s)]
*  They had small brains and they were tiny [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4481.860000000001s)]
*  and probably covered with fur. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4484.66s)]
*  And they found multiple bones of these. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4486.820000000001s)]
*  At first they thought like maybe that's a deformed human [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4490.62s)]
*  or what is this? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4493.46s)]
*  But now they're reasonably certain [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4495.62s)]
*  that that's a new type of human being. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4497.62s)]
*  It just didn't make it. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4500.34s)]
*  Or new type of higher primate. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4501.18s)]
*  I don't know if you would even say human being, [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4503.06s)]
*  but a little tiny little weird one. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4504.9400000000005s)]
*  And they think there might still be [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4507.46s)]
*  some of those left in the wild. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4509.66s)]
*  Has they given any, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4511.7s)]
*  I know this is a cross-pollination of subjects right now, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4513.1s)]
*  but has there been any thought as to these smaller bones [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4515.82s)]
*  being related to like aliens per se? [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4518.78s)]
*  Because sometimes they say they're tiny people. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4521.38s)]
*  I think, well, if you want to subscribe to the idea [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4524.14s)]
*  that human beings have been genetically engineered. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4527.46s)]
*  Oh, well that's a much deeper conversation. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4529.82s)]
*  Yeah, if you want to subscribe to the idea [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4532.18s)]
*  that human beings have been genetically engineered, [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4533.9800000000005s)]
*  that's one of the parts of UFO folklore. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4535.82s)]
*  I love that. The real nutty ones. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4538.9s)]
*  They want to say that we were seeded with alien DNA. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4540.66s)]
*  And so they took these savage lower primates, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4545.26s)]
*  like the chimpanzees still exist, right? [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4548.66s)]
*  They took these savage lower primates [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4550.34s)]
*  and with a specific group of them, [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4552.46s)]
*  they manipulated their DNA to give them creativity, [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4554.42s)]
*  intelligence, the ability to communicate, [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4557.94s)]
*  doubling of the human brain size [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4561.26s)]
*  over a period of two million years, [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4563.26s)]
*  This is a fun thing to believe, why not? [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4565.7s)]
*  It's the best thing to believe. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4567.42s)]

*  That's the most fun. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4571.339999999999s)]
*  That's way more fun than like Amish. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4572.299999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4574.299999999999s)]
*  As far as like believing in something. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4575.139999999999s)]
*  Well, the Amish, they, you know. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4576.94s)]
*  They can't be the right ones. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4580.0199999999995s)]
*  They seem happy, which is odd. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4581.339999999999s)]
*  There is something to be said about that. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4584.78s)]
*  I think there's like very low instances [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4586.179999999999s)]
*  of autism amongst the Amish, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4588.78s)]
*  very low instances of mental health disorders. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4591.7s)]
*  I think like it sucks to say, [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4596.3s)]
*  but I think working hard all the time [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4598.86s)]
*  is really good for people. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4601.3s)]
*  And I think physically working hard all the time [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4603.0199999999995s)]
*  is good for people. It keeps you focused [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4605.42s)]
*  on something positive and productive. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4606.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4607.98s)]
*  People get too much time on their hands [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4608.82s)]
*  to think and do absolutely nothing else. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4610.22s)]
*  I mean, you see what happens. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4611.74s)]

*  Out there making butter and shit. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4618.9s)]
*  I've never seen Netflix. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4620.42s)]
*  They look healthy. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4621.7s)]
*  None of them are fat. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4622.66s)]
*  They read. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4624.18s)]
*  I mean, you probably should use electricity. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4627.1s)]
*  It's pretty fucking cool. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4630.18s)]

*  was when you pass by where the cattle are. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4727.580000000001s)]
*  Because the stench in the air. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4731.26s)]

*  This might be the only group we can kind of shit on. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4774.86s)]
*  I think I might have seen it once. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4776.7s)]
*  I think I might have seen it once. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4778.46s)]
*  I'm like, oh yeah. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4779.78s)]
*  But I didn't get stuck behind them. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4781.66s)]
*  I would just hate to get to heaven [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4783.14s)]
*  and God was like, I'm glad you're here, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4785.26s)]
*  but you missed out on so much good shit down there. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4786.9s)]
*  You heard of OnlyFans? [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4790.06s)]
*  Well, they are allowed to go nutty [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4791.9800000000005s)]
*  before they rejoin. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4793.98s)]
*  That's gotta be a tough decision. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4795.98s)]
*  There's a great documentary on it [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4797.339999999999s)]
*  where they follow these Amish kids [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4798.94s)]
*  and they go party in and have a good time. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4800.94s)]
*  But the thing is, when you're used to that life, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4804.379999999999s)]
*  that life of toil and work and manners, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4809.74s)]
*  and it's probably attractive to cut loose, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4813.62s)]
*  but then you probably feel lost. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4818.299999999999s)]
*  And they probably know that. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4820.54s)]
*  That's why they let them go. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4821.86s)]
*  We already got them programmed. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4824.14s)]
*  Let them go. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4825.7s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4826.54s)]
*  I wonder what the percent is that don't go back. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4827.38s)]
*  Let's find that out. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4829.54s)]
*  Because if marriage fails at 50%, [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4830.82s)]
*  that's obviously a huge decision. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4832.78s)]
*  It's a lifestyle choice. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4834.82s)]
*  Do you know anybody that was ever in a cult? [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4836.1s)]
*  Not that I know. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4841.14s)]
*  No, I don't believe so. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4841.9800000000005s)]
*  I know quite a few people. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4842.82s)]
*  Really? [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4844.26s)]
*  Yeah, I know quite a few people [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4845.1s)]
*  that were in cults when they were kids. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4846.56s)]
*  How dangerous of cults. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4848.46s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of different levels of cults. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4849.94s)]
*  What is Jehovah's Witness a cult? [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4854.38s)]
*  Is Scientology a cult? [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4855.22s)]
*  There's cults that are just getting started. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4858.3s)]
*  Doomsday style. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4861.18s)]
*  Well, one of them was. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4862.86s)]
*  She was told that she was an elder [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4864.06s)]
*  and that she was a prophet. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4867.22s)]
*  And then when the family left when she was 13, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4868.9800000000005s)]
*  she was like, oh my God, thank God. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4871.58s)]
*  It was like so much stress thinking I was a prophet. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4873.34s)]
*  Now she works at Rite Aid or some shit. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4876.1s)]
*  I realize now she's really just a 13 year old kid. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4881.42s)]
*  You know, but there's a, [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4884.02s)]
*  man, I was talking to Mark Andreessen [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4886.02s)]
*  and he was telling me that there's successful cults [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4888.46s)]
*  that are still operating in California, a lot of them. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4890.3s)]
*  And I'm like, what? [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4892.700000000001s)]
*  So he started labeling all these different cults [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4893.9800000000005s)]
*  that operate still in California. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4896.34s)]
*  They just managed to keep it together. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4898.22s)]
*  With what end goal? [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4899.740000000001s)]
*  What's the goal of a cult? [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4901.46s)]
*  Just control? [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4902.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a natural inclination [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4903.740000000001s)]
*  specifically among males to dominate a group of people [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4907.7s)]
*  and have them treat you as if you are this wise sage [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4912.3s)]
*  that's completely in tune with the right way to live life. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4919.26s)]
*  And you're here to teach. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4922.58s)]
*  And that what you do is you bestow this wisdom upon them. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4924.42s)]
*  And usually it involves you banging everybody's wife. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4927.82s)]
*  Usually they all give you all their worldly possessions. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4930.9s)]
*  They treat you to the finest meals. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4935.14s)]
*  You eat first, then they eat. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4937.18s)]
*  You know, you bless them. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4939.18s)]
*  When you talk, everybody listens. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4940.14s)]
*  And they really do believe that you're divine. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4941.820000000001s)]
*  And it happens in like Waco with the Branch Davidians. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4944.740000000001s)]
*  I was watching that documentary the other day. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4948.06s)]
*  Ooh, that guy. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4949.660000000001s)]
*  I almost bought his car. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4951.06s)]
*  No way. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4952.18s)]
*  What kind of car is it? [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4953.02s)]
*  Yeah, a 68 Camaro. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4953.860000000001s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4954.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I found out it was for sale [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4955.54s)]
*  and I almost pulled the trigger, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4956.740000000001s)]
*  but I was like, what am I doing? [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4957.9400000000005s)]
*  What was it going for? [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4959.34s)]
*  What if ghosts are real? [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4960.18s)]
*  And what if- And you're in the car? [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4961.46s)]

*  but like the energy of a person's real. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4964.26s)]
*  That guy was a psycho. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4966.94s)]
*  Yeah, cause you know what's even crazier? [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4968.419999999999s)]
*  You have the power to start a cult. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4969.74s)]
*  It would be so fucking easy. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4971.86s)]
*  It would be so easy. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4973.86s)]
*  I just want to say to the CIA, I have no desire. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=4975.5s)]

*  And then when I get done with the shows, [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5022.9s)]
*  I go back to my room and edit for like two hours. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5023.9s)]
*  Do you find that that sometimes gets in the way of writing [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5025.86s)]
*  because you're not experiencing enough life? [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5029.58s)]
*  One of the things, remember in the 80s, [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5032.339999999999s)]
*  it was like stock material that everybody would talk about. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5035.0199999999995s)]
*  Airline seats not moving back and do not disturb. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5037.86s)]

*  You were always just traveling. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5046.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5047.74s)]
*  At least it's very unrelatable. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5048.58s)]
*  Yeah, because I also, and nobody really knows this [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5049.9s)]
*  because all my clips are about crowd work. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5052.0199999999995s)]
*  Most of my jokes are stories. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5054.38s)]
*  I don't know if I have a joke less shorter [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5056.38s)]
*  than like three minutes. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5058.1s)]
*  So with me not really being out there [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5059.9s)]
*  and experiencing a lot of things, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5061.34s)]
*  I am curious, because I'm about to shoot my next special [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5062.9s)]
*  in September. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5064.74s)]
*  And when I start all over to build this brand new hour, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5065.7s)]
*  I'm like, what is gonna be the theme of it? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5067.94s)]
*  Is it gonna be about my current state of life? [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5069.78s)]
*  I'm not 100% sure yet. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5072.3s)]
*  But that's the most fun thing about standup [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5074.14s)]
*  is having to start all over [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5075.74s)]
*  and figure out what this new hour is. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5076.86s)]
*  It's very fun. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5079.58s)]
*  Yeah. It's scary. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5080.74s)]
*  It's very scary. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5082.42s)]
*  It's just exciting. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5084.1s)]
*  It's a creative thing, coming up with a new thing. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5084.9400000000005s)]
*  And also you're doing it live in front of people. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5087.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5090.06s)]
*  There's a lot of bits where I've done them [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5090.900000000001s)]
*  and they were kind of successful. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5092.38s)]
*  I'm like, I gotta put that one on the shelf for a bit. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5093.42s)]
*  I gotta think about that one. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5095.26s)]
*  Because I think I'm saying some things [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5096.34s)]
*  that I'm not really believing. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5097.5s)]
*  I'm kind of pushing it too much. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5098.780000000001s)]
*  I'm trying to make it work instead of reassessing. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5100.26s)]
*  So let me reassess. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5103.26s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5104.46s)]
*  So it's kind of a fun process [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5105.3s)]
*  because you put it together over time. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5107.780000000001s)]
*  And at the end, you're like, I got it. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5110.860000000001s)]
*  This is it. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5114.06s)]
*  This is the right way to say this thing. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5114.900000000001s)]
*  And you have to test it in so many different settings [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5115.740000000001s)]
*  as well. Yes. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5118.02s)]
*  Like last night, we've been doing this tour [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5119.26s)]
*  for the better part of this year. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5121.860000000001s)]
*  And we're in these amazing theaters [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5123.62s)]
*  from like 1500 to like 6000, which is incredible. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5125.34s)]
*  But sometimes you have to remember [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5128.820000000001s)]
*  that's not always real standup. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5130.02s)]
*  Like I had for some new shit that I'm working on [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5131.34s)]
*  for the upcoming special, [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5133.46s)]
*  I popped it into a couple of local spots here last night [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5135.18s)]
*  where it was like 25 people the first one [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5137.3s)]
*  and like 30 the next one. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5139.02s)]
*  Perfect. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5140.1s)]
*  I missed this. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5140.9400000000005s)]
*  This is where you see if jokes work. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5142.1s)]
*  Yeah. Little crowds, [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5143.900000000001s)]
*  like the belly room at the comedy store is the best. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5145.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5147.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like a little truth serum. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5148.780000000001s)]
*  You know, you just, you feel the grossness of a fake, [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5150.02s)]
*  like the way you're phrasing something. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5153.9800000000005s)]
*  You feel like you're not connected to it or whatever. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5155.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you're like, this isn't how a comedian would say this. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5157.660000000001s)]
*  Not even like, a comedian would say this. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5159.06s)]
*  You're not attached to it. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5160.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I know what you mean. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5162.26s)]
*  You can't just present in front of 25 people. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5163.54s)]
*  You gotta be there with them. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5166.5s)]
*  You gotta really be locked in. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5167.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And they know it. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5169.14s)]
*  Oh, that gives a fuck. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5170.46s)]
*  I noticed the other day, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5171.9400000000005s)]
*  you could do that in a large crowd of 3000 people [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5173.9400000000005s)]
*  because there's this like sort of weird disconnect. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5177.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's more performance based. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5179.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's a different feel. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5181.14s)]
*  That's why I wanted to do all these theaters [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5183.26s)]
*  right after like leaving the comedy clubs. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5186.38s)]
*  Like, cause you know, obviously agents go, [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5188.18s)]
*  the numbers are doing, we could, [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5190.1s)]
*  what stadiums do you wanna do? [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5191.58s)]
*  I was like, dude, can I get used to a theater first? [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5192.74s)]
*  Cause it's a totally different performance. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5194.9800000000005s)]
*  It's a different timing for sure. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5197.26s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta hold laughs longer [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5199.18s)]
*  and also I realized once I went to watch Lewis Black [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5201.9400000000005s)]
*  and we were doing the same place the next night [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5205.26s)]
*  and we got there early and Joey and I went across the street [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5208.820000000001s)]
*  and it was like right there. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5211.26s)]
*  And so we were sitting in the audience [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5213.18s)]
*  and when he was killing, when he got with big laughs, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5215.18s)]
*  he would occasionally have a tag that he would hit [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5218.660000000001s)]
*  that I didn't hear because so many people were laughing. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5221.42s)]
*  And I was like, oh wow, [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5224.9400000000005s)]
*  that's something to take into consideration [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5226.26s)]
*  cause I didn't think about that. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5227.860000000001s)]
*  Cause we were like in like probably the 30th row back [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5228.9s)]
*  and it was a pretty big theater. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5232.74s)]
*  And so the roars were really loud. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5234.58s)]
*  Like when he was killing, it was really loud. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5236.66s)]
*  So as the laughter was, and then he was like, [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5238.78s)]
*  ba ba ba ba ba ba. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5240.879999999999s)]
*  And I didn't know what he said. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5242.0199999999995s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, you can't hear because people are, [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5243.139999999999s)]
*  you gotta wait. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5245.339999999999s)]
*  Like for certain tags, [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5246.46s)]
*  you can't hit them like a comedy club. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5247.66s)]
*  No. Like bang, bang, bang. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5249.139999999999s)]
*  The laughter, the loudness of the laughter [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5250.099999999999s)]
*  when you're in the midst of it, it's too loud. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5252.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Oh dude, I got so lucky. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5254.74s)]
*  I was able to be on the show with one of Chappelle's [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5257.38s)]
*  birthday shows at MSG this last week. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5259.9s)]
*  And I had never been to a stadium before. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5262.34s)]
*  I had never even been to Madison Square Garden. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5264.5s)]
*  So I don't know that I've really been to a stadium. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5267.3s)]
*  No, I've been to a Clippers game in my life. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5270.7s)]
*  That's it. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5273.0599999999995s)]
*  But I've never performed anything that big. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5273.9s)]
*  And like my first couple of jokes up there, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5275.2s)]
*  I realized I stepped on the laughs, [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5276.719999999999s)]
*  like probably five times. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5278.9s)]
*  Cause it takes, you literally have to go, [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5280.34s)]
*  nah, nah, nah, nah. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5281.94s)]
*  Like the laughs take so much longer to get to you. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5284.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. 15,000 people is another level up above theater. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5287.26s)]
*  Yeah. But the positive energy, when the joke does hit. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5289.78s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5293.54s)]
*  The biggest place I ever did with Dave and I did [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5294.94s)]
*  25,000 people in Tacoma, Washington. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5297.62s)]
*  That was bananas. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5300.46s)]
*  25,000? [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5301.78s)]
*  It was bananas. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5304.3s)]
*  Yeah. It was so fun. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5305.46s)]
*  Goggins was there for that one. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5306.86s)]
*  No way. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5308.02s)]
*  Yeah. It was the Tacoma Dome. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5308.86s)]
*  Tacoma Dome. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5311.38s)]
*  That's a sick name. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5312.42s)]
*  It was dope. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5313.4s)]
*  And we did it in the round too. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5314.3s)]
*  It was bonkers. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5315.5s)]
*  The laughs are just like, what is this? [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5316.860000000001s)]
*  When you hit a big punch line [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5319.7s)]
*  and the whole place just falls out, you're like, [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5321.42s)]
*  holy shit. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5323.1s)]
*  I haven't done in the round yet. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5324.38s)]
*  I don't know if I'd like it. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5325.78s)]
*  It's great. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5326.62s)]
*  Is it? [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5327.46s)]
*  It's intimate. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5328.3s)]
*  It's weirdly intimate. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5329.12s)]
*  Oh, I would like that then. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5330.26s)]
*  The thing is you're really in there with the people [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5331.320000000001s)]
*  as opposed to a theater. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5334.62s)]
*  See the thing about, or if you're doing an arena [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5336.46s)]
*  and it doesn't have a round, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5339.820000000001s)]
*  the thing is like you have this big ass stage [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5341.14s)]
*  and you're above everybody and there's like a gap. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5343.26s)]
*  And then, so there's the stage, which is you, [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5347.02s)]
*  and then there's them. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5349.54s)]
*  But when you're in the round, [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5350.66s)]
*  then it's everyone in a circle. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5352.5s)]
*  So people are looking at people. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5355.9800000000005s)]
*  Everyone's in there together. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5358.38s)]
*  I didn't think about that. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5359.58s)]
*  They are looking across at each other. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5360.42s)]
*  And we're all feeding off each other [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5362.22s)]
*  and everybody's having a good time. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5364.5s)]
*  So everyone's laughing and it's fun [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5366.9400000000005s)]
*  and you're wandered around. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5369.58s)]
*  So it's playful. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5371.26s)]
*  You're wandered around this big circle. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5372.62s)]
*  It's great. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5374.66s)]
*  Fuck, I might have to try that. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5375.5s)]
*  I love it. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5376.34s)]
*  I'm gonna have to try it. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5377.18s)]
*  It's my favorite way to do big places. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5378.0s)]
*  By far. That's incredible. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5380.14s)]
*  I don't like doing them the other way. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5381.14s)]
*  The other way it just feels like [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5382.54s)]
*  I wanna be out there with you guys. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5383.44s)]
*  I don't wanna be like up here. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5384.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5386.3s)]
*  It feels weird. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5387.14s)]
*  I also feel bad for somebody sitting [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5387.98s)]
*  so fucking far away in an arena. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5389.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, usually they have big screens too. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5392.3s)]
*  But that's not what you're there for. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5394.14s)]
*  Yeah, but you're there also just like [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5395.62s)]
*  the experience of experiencing it [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5397.94s)]
*  with a lot of people there. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5399.58s)]
*  You know? Yeah. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5401.42s)]
*  There's a thing about experiencing things [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5402.42s)]
*  with a lot of people. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5404.14s)]
*  Like I saw Guns N' Roses in Greece. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5404.9800000000005s)]
*  No way. I saw Guns N' Roses in Athens. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5408.1s)]
*  I saw that photo. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5409.5s)]
*  It was so dope. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5410.46s)]
*  But it was just the feel of all those people [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5411.9400000000005s)]
*  having a good time. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5416.06s)]
*  It's like just this wave of fun [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5417.42s)]
*  and positive feeling that's in the air [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5420.9800000000005s)]
*  that I think people, [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5423.58s)]
*  it's like that thing that I was saying. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5425.02s)]
*  There's things in the world that you can't measure. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5428.34s)]
*  But they're real. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5431.62s)]
*  And we seek them out. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5432.9s)]
*  We seek out these weird moments [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5435.3s)]
*  where people collectively can experience something [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5438.22s)]
*  at the same time. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5440.46s)]
*  I love that psychological sync up. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5441.46s)]
*  There's just something contagious [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5444.3s)]
*  of being in the middle of a crowd [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5445.5s)]
*  of people enjoying themselves [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5447.54s)]
*  that just takes, [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5449.26s)]
*  so you wanna enjoy yourself as well. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5450.1s)]
*  Yeah. It's contagious. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5451.66s)]
*  It's contagious. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5453.06s)]
*  Laughter for sure is. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5453.9s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5454.9s)]
*  But fun is too. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5455.74s)]
*  Good times are contagious. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5457.1s)]
*  And so are bad times. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5460.18s)]
*  That's a good book. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5461.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Good times are contagious. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5462.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. They are though. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5464.26s)]
*  Sounds like it's a book on STDs though. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5465.1s)]
*  Nevermind. Nevermind. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5466.14s)]
*  We'll take it back. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5467.14s)]
*  Nevermind. Fuck. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5468.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5472.18s)]
*  It's a weird aspect of being a person. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5475.66s)]
*  We have this stupid myth of the loner. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5478.860000000001s)]
*  I like to be by myself. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5484.06s)]
*  That's not good. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5485.700000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5486.740000000001s)]
*  That's not normal. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5487.58s)]
*  That's made, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5488.42s)]
*  somebody's made to be that way I think. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5489.26s)]
*  Every now and again, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5491.54s)]
*  it's good to be by yourself. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5492.379999999999s)]
*  But when I think about loners, [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5493.219999999999s)]
*  I think of like Ted Kaczynski. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5494.0599999999995s)]
*  I think of like the Unabomber [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5495.66s)]
*  or some fucking psycho out there [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5496.98s)]
*  laying bear traps [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5498.9s)]
*  in the middle of Montana. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5500.339999999999s)]
*  You have to laugh or you will go fucking insane. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5501.66s)]
*  I think people need people too. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5504.219999999999s)]
*  I just don't, [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5506.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't think it's a good thing [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5506.9s)]
*  to be by yourself too much. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5507.98s)]
*  I think that's one of the things [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5509.179999999999s)]
*  that really freaked everybody out about the pandemic. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5510.299999999999s)]
*  When everything got locked down [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5513.379999999999s)]
*  and people were terrified [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5515.54s)]
*  and they were in their homes [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5516.78s)]
*  for months and months at a time [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5518.0199999999995s)]
*  without any interaction with other people. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5519.58s)]
*  When they finally did see people, [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5522.22s)]
*  they didn't know how to behave. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5523.94s)]
*  They were weirded out. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5525.3s)]
*  Everybody was scared. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5526.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5527.54s)]
*  It was so uncomfortable. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5528.46s)]
*  It was so weird. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5529.54s)]
*  It was so weird. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5531.0199999999995s)]
*  It was such a mind fuck. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5532.0599999999995s)]
*  When you tour, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5533.34s)]
*  do you travel [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5534.42s)]
*  with a lot of people? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5536.54s)]
*  No. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5537.78s)]
*  No? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5538.62s)]
*  No. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5539.46s)]
*  Because that's like the most specific thing [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5540.3s)]
*  I've been trying to build [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5542.34s)]
*  with the tour I'm on right now [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5543.62s)]
*  is I wanted to make sure [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5544.9s)]
*  I surrounded myself with people [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5545.74s)]
*  who are gonna make all of this journey [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5547.54s)]
*  positive and fun for me. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5550.14s)]
*  If you have a lot of people. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5551.98s)]
*  Because you meet people. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5553.1s)]
*  Not a lot of people. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5554.3s)]
*  But the right people. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5555.58s)]
*  Well yeah, look, good people. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5556.46s)]
*  I travel with good people that I know. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5558.14s)]
*  Like comics that I know. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5560.78s)]
*  People that I know. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5562.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5563.14s)]

*  Is that a myth? [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5642.780000000001s)]
*  Is that a myth? [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5643.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's alcohol. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5644.7s)]
*  It's alcohol. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5645.54s)]
*  It's alcohol. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5646.38s)]
*  But isn't there some sort of an effect that's different [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5647.22s)]
*  because is tequila? [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5649.66s)]
*  It seems different. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5651.26s)]
*  It's clear. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5652.3s)]
*  That's the difference. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5653.14s)]
*  That's the one difference that we didn't dig into. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5654.14s)]
*  Like it's clear. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5655.62s)]
*  It doesn't have additives. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5656.46s)]
*  It's probably the most pure. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5657.3s)]
*  And any of those impurities are things [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5658.780000000001s)]
*  that can cause hangovers. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5660.14s)]
*  I mean, I'm not a fan of any of it. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5660.9800000000005s)]

*  Like I limit myself to one or two. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5728.78s)]

*  Supposedly those American spirits are better [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5737.66s)]
*  because it's just tobacco. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5739.52s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5743.7s)]

*  And especially if you're rolling blunts. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5760.66s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5771.14s)]

*  Well, it's definitely chemicals, right? [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5780.06s)]
*  It depends on how they manufacture them, [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5782.860000000001s)]
*  but it's different kinds of oils. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5784.740000000001s)]
*  I know some of them do it with like MCT oil, [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5786.26s)]

*  But I don't know if there's like strict standards [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5790.860000000001s)]
*  on that stuff. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5793.42s)]

*  They probably can't make the, [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5805.64s)]
*  they probably can't import the actual cannabis. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5807.18s)]
*  So I bet they actually do make it here. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5810.42s)]
*  Now that I think about it. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5812.46s)]
*  That makes sense that they probably do make it here. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5813.9800000000005s)]
*  They probably would have to make it here. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5816.58s)]
*  But do they make the pens here, [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5818.18s)]

*  I thought that was a myth. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5823.42s)]
*  I thought that happened one time. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5824.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5825.34s)]

*  Like a rocket. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5836.26s)]

*  I can't, yeah. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5840.06s)]

*  The most gaslighting shit I've ever read. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5911.9400000000005s)]
*  The guy who was part of the one who caused the accident. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5915.780000000001s)]

*  He made it explode. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5918.58s)]
*  We had Peter Berg on the other day, [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5919.86s)]
*  and he was talking about the opioid crisis, [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5921.58s)]
*  because he created that series, Pain Killer on Netflix. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5924.179999999999s)]
*  If you haven't seen it, it's fucking incredible. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5927.62s)]
*  But it's about the Sackler family, [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5929.46s)]
*  and how they created this. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5930.9s)]
*  And one of the things that they did was, [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5931.86s)]
*  when people got hooked on OxyContin, [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5933.66s)]
*  they had like a policy of hammering the abuser. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5936.099999999999s)]
*  Go after them. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5939.82s)]
*  They were drug addicts. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5940.7s)]
*  Like shame them. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5941.86s)]
*  So that's what they would do. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5943.299999999999s)]
*  They're like, oh, he was a drug addict. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5944.38s)]
*  This person was a drug addict. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5946.66s)]
*  And it's nothing to do with whether or not [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5947.78s)]
*  our drug is addictive. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5949.34s)]
*  Our addictive drug. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5950.82s)]
*  He's a drug addict. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5951.66s)]
*  And so that's what they did. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5953.0199999999995s)]
*  That was their gaslighting. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5953.9s)]
*  But you can't be a drug addict without the drugs. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5955.139999999999s)]
*  I know, but they just made. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5957.82s)]
*  Drugs are the problem. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5958.66s)]
*  If you can make someone think [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5959.5s)]
*  that someone else is a drug addict, [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5961.26s)]
*  that's a shameful thing. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5963.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, he's a drug addict. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5964.46s)]
*  It's shameful. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5967.0199999999995s)]
*  And so they shamed the abusers. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5968.5s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5971.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's typical corporate gaslighting. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5973.0599999999995s)]
*  They like to do stuff like that. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5974.94s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5976.26s)]
*  Change the narrative. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5978.34s)]
*  Get that Russian troll farm involved. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=5979.18s)]

*  I hope you know. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6002.34s)]
*  I can see this written on Twitter already. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6004.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6005.7s)]
*  I have another social media theory [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6007.299999999999s)]
*  to go along with these troll farms. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6008.46s)]
*  So you know how there's a new TikTok dance every week? [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6010.7s)]
*  I've heard about these things. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6013.78s)]
*  Same. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6016.139999999999s)]
*  As much as I post on TikTok, [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6016.98s)]
*  I don't fucking watch anything. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6018.259999999999s)]
*  It's something I'm most proud of. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6019.259999999999s)]
*  Good for you. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6020.78s)]
*  But anyways, there's always something trending. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6021.599999999999s)]
*  Every single week, there's some new dance [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6023.74s)]
*  that every girl from 11 years old [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6025.46s)]
*  to 40 year old is doing. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6028.62s)]
*  But to my recollection, at least up until 2015, [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6031.099999999999s)]
*  if somebody came up with a dance, [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6035.0599999999995s)]
*  the Dougie, the Cat Daddy, [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6037.66s)]
*  that person was famous for making that dance a thing. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6039.0199999999995s)]
*  Everybody knew who that was. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6042.78s)]
*  There's never an originator of these dances. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6044.78s)]
*  And I have a theory that TikTok does AI dances [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6047.3s)]
*  of trends that they push out to people's streams [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6051.0599999999995s)]
*  and go, and then everybody goes, [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6054.099999999999s)]
*  oh, this is the trend. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6055.62s)]
*  I have to do that now. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6056.46s)]
*  Because there's never a person taking credit [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6057.62s)]
*  for I was the first person to fucking do [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6059.82s)]
*  whatever this shit is. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6061.94s)]
*  That never happens. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6063.78s)]
*  I think it's AI infiltrated trends. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6065.5s)]
*  I don't believe they're really created by people. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6068.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, TikTok is a genius company. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6069.62s)]
*  If you wanna look at it from a perspective [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6072.0599999999995s)]
*  of how effective it is. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6073.9s)]
*  And it's interesting because I had Adam Curry on. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6076.0199999999995s)]
*  Do you know what Adam Curry is? [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6079.86s)]
*  He's the original podcaster. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6081.0599999999995s)]
*  Podcaster number one. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6083.46s)]
*  And he has a different theory than a lot of us. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6084.86s)]
*  Most people that I talk to say TikTok is dangerous. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6087.179999999999s)]
*  It's like tracking all your information [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6089.799999999999s)]
*  and everything you do online. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6091.66s)]
*  But his theory is they're all doing that. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6094.3s)]
*  And what they don't like is that this Chinese company [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6096.780000000001s)]
*  is eating their lunch. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6099.18s)]
*  This Chinese company has figured out a way [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6100.06s)]
*  to have the most addictive [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6101.740000000001s)]
*  out of all of these social media sites. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6103.9800000000005s)]
*  TikTok's the most addictive. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6105.860000000001s)]
*  And he's saying, look, if you don't think [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6107.780000000001s)]
*  that they're all tracking your shit on a regular basis, [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6110.06s)]
*  they're definitely doing that. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6113.62s)]
*  And they're probably using your microphone. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6115.42s)]
*  There's a weird coincidence that pops up all the time [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6117.58s)]
*  where you're talking about something [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6120.58s)]
*  and then you see ads for it. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6121.780000000001s)]
*  Did you watch Social Dilemma? [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6124.74s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6125.94s)]
*  I had the guy who did it, Tristan Harris, [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6127.0199999999995s)]
*  come in and talk about it. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6131.5s)]
*  It's a fucking... [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6133.339999999999s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6134.58s)]
*  It's a terrifying thing. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6135.42s)]
*  And we're interacting with something [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6136.24s)]
*  that we're not designed for. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6139.54s)]
*  We evolved to experience natural things, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6141.62s)]
*  animals, wildlife, beautiful scenery. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6144.179999999999s)]
*  That's why we react to those things. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6146.54s)]
*  That's part of what we are. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6147.9s)]
*  And now all of a sudden we're locked into this thing [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6149.259999999999s)]
*  that we don't have any reference of history for. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6152.8s)]
*  There's no like, well, back in the 1800s, [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6157.56s)]
*  when high speed internet first was available, [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6160.04s)]
*  there was a lot of confusion. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6162.24s)]
*  A lot of propaganda got pushed by various nations [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6164.06s)]
*  until mind reading became available. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6167.0s)]
*  And then it made lying impossible. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6169.4800000000005s)]
*  That's literally what we probably need [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6171.64s)]
*  to get out of this mess. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6173.2s)]
*  We need mind reading. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6174.320000000001s)]
*  We need mind reading. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6176.1s)]
*  We need to make lying impossible. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6177.2s)]
*  And we gotta get to it before they have complete [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6180.16s)]
*  total control of your money. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6185.24s)]
*  We gotta do it before people agree [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6187.4s)]
*  to a centralized digital currency [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6189.639999999999s)]
*  that's attached to a social credit score system. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6191.639999999999s)]
*  If we can get to mind reading before that, [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6194.04s)]
*  then people will uprise and they'll realize like, [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6198.36s)]
*  oh, okay, this is outrageous. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6200.84s)]
*  This is not how the world's supposed to be run. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6203.04s)]
*  And if it's ubiquitous, [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6205.24s)]
*  like if the whole world has mind reading software, [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6206.5599999999995s)]
*  it makes all of the stuff very difficult. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6209.36s)]
*  I mean, you could somehow or another force compliance, [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6212.5599999999995s)]
*  but it's gonna be very difficult to do that [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6215.96s)]
*  with all the soldiers in sync now. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6217.44s)]
*  It's gonna be very difficult to like lead armies [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6219.88s)]
*  where people are gonna know [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6222.62s)]
*  what your actual intentions are. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6224.0s)]
*  And they're gonna know that this is motivated by money [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6225.5199999999995s)]
*  and that this report that you've brought [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6227.96s)]
*  in front of Congress about the movement of these terrorists [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6230.2s)]

*  So it's gonna end wars. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6239.599999999999s)]

*  and then the internet came around [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6308.66s)]

*  What is Quake? [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6361.76s)]
*  Quake is an amazing 3D online death match game [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6362.6s)]
*  where you're running around with rocket launchers [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6369.76s)]
*  and rail guns and you're running through these mazes [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6372.4800000000005s)]
*  and you're fighting other people that are on your screen [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6376.160000000001s)]
*  in real time. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6380.08s)]
*  You've never heard of Quake? [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6381.84s)]
*  It's a 3D shooter. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6382.84s)]
*  Show them some Quake 3 arena. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6384.88s)]
*  You're the scariest nerd I've ever met. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6386.96s)]
*  I've been meaning to not tell you, [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6389.64s)]
*  they just remastered Quake 2. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6390.96s)]
*  So it just came out like a week ago. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6393.2s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6395.2s)]
*  And they do like HD 4K. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6396.04s)]
*  I've never seen this. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6397.96s)]
*  Look how good it looks. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6398.8s)]
*  Oh my God, it looks so good. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6401.400000000001s)]
*  So this was the game I really started with, was Quake 2. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6404.6s)]
*  There's new levels too, they made new stuff for it. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6407.759999999999s)]
*  But the thing about this game is not really the levels. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6410.759999999999s)]
*  The thing about this game is death match. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6415.759999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6417.759999999999s)]
*  What was death match? [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6418.599999999999s)]
*  Death match is one on one or team versus team. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6419.44s)]
*  Like you're on a team with four, [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6423.24s)]
*  like what you could do is you could jump on a server online [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6424.599999999999s)]
*  and you would look to join a team. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6430.32s)]
*  Like say if you're playing Rocket Arena, [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6431.92s)]
*  you can find a server and you could just join a team [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6433.5599999999995s)]
*  and then once the teams were filled, [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6435.88s)]
*  the game would start, game begins in three, two, one. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6437.76s)]
*  And then you got like your side is like one color [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6440.360000000001s)]
*  and the other side is green [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6443.56s)]
*  and you're running through this fucking maze [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6445.12s)]
*  looking for the enemy and trying to acquire like weapons [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6448.200000000001s)]
*  and all these different things. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6453.200000000001s)]
*  But this is the game, this is Quake 3 Arena. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6454.04s)]
*  And so it's these wild graphics. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6456.84s)]
*  This looks fun. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6459.0s)]
*  It's fun as fuck dude. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6459.84s)]
*  It's very early 2000s, I love the graphics. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6460.68s)]
*  Give me some vibes. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6462.52s)]
*  It's very early 2000s, I love the graphics. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6463.4s)]
*  Give me some volume so you can hear it. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6465.24s)]
*  So you hear things too. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6467.599999999999s)]
*  You hear your footsteps. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6468.839999999999s)]
*  The water. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6470.04s)]
*  You're running through here [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6470.88s)]
*  and then you find the people and you're duking it out. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6471.719999999999s)]
*  And when you hit them it makes up the loop. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6475.32s)]

*  He's really good. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6649.28s)]
*  It's so fast paced. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6650.24s)]
*  Is this video sped up or is this how quickly he plays the game? [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6651.16s)]
*  No, this is how quick the game is. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6653.96s)]
*  That's very impressive. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6655.08s)]
*  It's one of the things that's exciting about it [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6655.92s)]
*  because it requires you to really think quickly [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6657.16s)]
*  and move quickly and you're changing weapons. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6659.28s)]
*  And the guy he's playing can't kill him either. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6662.12s)]
*  He's up eight to oh right now. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6663.48s)]
*  Yeah, he's fucking bad. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6664.679999999999s)]
*  And that's frustrating for the other guy. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6665.5199999999995s)]
*  And the guy, every time he spawns, [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6668.0s)]
*  he's got no energy or rather no weapons. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6670.0s)]
*  He's just got a bullshit standard gun [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6673.72s)]
*  that you're not gonna kill this guy with. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6675.8s)]
*  So the longer you live, you get more powerful. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6677.12s)]
*  Well, the longer you traverse the map [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6679.52s)]
*  and accumulate all the different armor and shit. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6682.04s)]
*  So this guy, every time he fucks that dude up, [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6687.32s)]
*  he gets some of his armor. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6689.68s)]
*  He's getting the super health. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6691.32s)]
*  So all these things, look at that. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6693.84s)]
*  Oh, he's fucking that dude up. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6695.2s)]
*  Oh, he got killed. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6696.56s)]
*  Huh. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6698.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6699.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6700.08s)]
*  That guy's really good. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6700.92s)]
*  He's really good. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6701.759999999999s)]
*  But that's what it is. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6702.599999999999s)]
*  It's like you get so, and it's so exciting. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6703.44s)]
*  It's so much more exciting [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6705.599999999999s)]
*  than literally anything else that's a game. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6706.5599999999995s)]
*  More than Halo? [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6709.799999999999s)]
*  People love Halo. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6710.799999999999s)]
*  I've never played Halo. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6711.639999999999s)]
*  I've never played Halo either. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6712.48s)]
*  But it's kind of the same sort of thing. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6713.32s)]
*  It's a first person shooter, right? [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6714.44s)]
*  And you're running around. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6716.24s)]
*  Isn't Halo first person or is it third person? [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6717.08s)]
*  Yeah, first person. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6718.799999999999s)]
*  So those things are just super, super addictive. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6719.879999999999s)]
*  I think the chat rooms would be addictive. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6722.679999999999s)]
*  People say the meanest, craziest shit. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6725.36s)]
*  Oh, they go crazy. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6727.28s)]
*  Dude, it's insane. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6728.12s)]
*  They go crazy on those online games. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6729.799999999999s)]
*  They actually just made an announcement about that [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6731.04s)]
*  that's gonna change. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6732.599999999999s)]
*  You get something like eight strikes, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6733.44s)]
*  which I don't know exactly how they're gonna count those, [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6735.36s)]
*  but they have AI listening now. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6737.36s)]
*  So all those game chats are being recorded. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6738.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6740.799999999999s)]
*  And as you start talking shit, [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6742.84s)]
*  they're gonna start striking you down [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6743.679999999999s)]
*  and you're gonna have to take a break [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6744.679999999999s)]
*  for a year or something. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6745.88s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6747.28s)]
*  Good. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6748.28s)]

*  through a fucking VPN. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6750.24s)]
*  Your new email address, whatever it is. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6751.5199999999995s)]
*  Wear a fake nose. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6754.76s)]
*  Fuck out of here. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6756.8s)]
*  Change the pronouns. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6757.72s)]
*  You're not gonna stop these junkies. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6759.08s)]
*  These people are straight up junkies. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6760.44s)]
*  It has never changed yet. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6762.32s)]
*  As racist as it can be. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6764.32s)]
*  This is so funny. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6767.36s)]
*  People aren't good. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6768.5199999999995s)]
*  It's so funny. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6769.599999999999s)]
*  Well, they definitely like to be naughty. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6772.0s)]
*  Oh, the things people will say [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6774.36s)]
*  when people can't see who's saying it. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6776.12s)]
*  Yeah, people like to be naughty. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6778.0s)]
*  It's impressive, dude. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6779.28s)]
*  Well, it's also, it's like, [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6780.96s)]
*  you feel like you're protected. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6782.96s)]

*  You're on the internet. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6789.24s)]
*  It's a fake name. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6790.56s)]
*  You're Supa Killer, 69, whatever. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6792.76s)]
*  And you're out there fucking people up. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6796.28s)]
*  I wanted to do a modern troll version [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6798.28s)]
*  of Bully B down, remember that show? [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6800.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6802.4400000000005s)]
*  Where you use the same technology [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6803.28s)]
*  and sources they use for catfish. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6805.0s)]
*  They do all this research to really find the person. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6807.64s)]
*  So say you're talking shit to fucking Sugar Sean, right? [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6809.76s)]
*  Like you're like this constant troll. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6813.84s)]
*  You're always talking about what a trash fighter he is. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6814.96s)]
*  We team up with Sean. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6816.92s)]
*  We do the research. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6818.24s)]
*  We find out what this dude really is. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6819.08s)]
*  And we go, you said you could beat him up [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6820.400000000001s)]
*  or a 15 year old girl could beat him up. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6822.4800000000005s)]
*  Looks like a dozen times. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6824.280000000001s)]
*  So we're gonna offer you an amount of money [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6825.68s)]
*  to put your money where your mouth is. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6826.92s)]
*  But he also gets a chance to whoop your ass. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6828.04s)]
*  Yeah, the guy's gonna go, I didn't really mean that. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6830.320000000001s)]
*  Of course, but then he looks like, [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6833.4400000000005s)]
*  I was just talking shit. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6834.280000000001s)]
*  But then at least it looks like a bitch [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6835.12s)]
*  in front of everybody. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6835.9400000000005s)]

*  That's where it's, you gotta, [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6838.360000000001s)]
*  the money has to be worth it. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6840.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but the thing is, they're not gonna fucking win. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6841.88s)]
*  You know, I always wondered that about cops. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6844.64s)]
*  Like how, do they have to sign waivers, right? [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6847.160000000001s)]
*  On the show Cops? [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6851.18s)]
*  Yeah, remember, so Cops does, [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6852.160000000001s)]
*  but I told you that show that's been going on, [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6853.580000000001s)]
*  it was called Life P, it's called something else now. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6855.76s)]
*  They have a weird workaround [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6858.0s)]
*  because it's live on TV streaming for three hours a night. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6859.120000000001s)]

*  Don't worry about them. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6865.120000000001s)]
*  The cops are doing a documentary about us. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6865.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6867.88s)]
*  And I guess that's the loophole. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6869.92s)]
*  Just sort of like the prank calls in Vegas kind of thing. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=6870.76s)]

*  I believe. They never found him? [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7411.44s)]
*  I believe they never caught the Zodiac Killer. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7412.599999999999s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7414.76s)]
*  I'm fascinated by John Wayne Gacy's stuff. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7416.5599999999995s)]
*  It's fascinating. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7419.36s)]
*  Okay. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7420.2s)]
*  Because it's such an insane level of psychosis. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7421.04s)]
*  Dressing up like a clown. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7424.64s)]
*  It's so terrifying. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7426.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7429.12s)]
*  And just burying him under the house. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7429.96s)]
*  Never caught. Fuck. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7431.4s)]
*  Never caught the Zodiac Killer. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7432.24s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7433.36s)]
*  That's part of life though. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7434.36s)]
*  The official investigation remains open. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7435.64s)]
*  Public interest has remained high. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7437.68s)]
*  Countless theories have gained traction over the years, [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7439.2s)]
*  pointing a finger at various men who share physical markers [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7441.48s)]
*  or specific interests with the famed killer. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7444.08s)]
*  They did crack the code though, but I did. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7446.56s)]
*  They did? [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7448.72s)]
*  I don't think they know who he is. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7449.56s)]
*  AI was like, I could get that quick. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7450.72s)]
*  That's what I thought it was. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7453.04s)]
*  Why would you take so much time for you dummies? [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7453.88s)]
*  Yeah, they caught. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7456.68s)]
*  Oh, what does it say? [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7458.76s)]
*  It's been reportedly revealed. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7459.6s)]
*  Oh. No. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7462.16s)]
*  Let's see what it says here. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7463.24s)]
*  DNA points to an Air Force veteran [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7465.0s)]
*  according to independent investigation agency. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7467.2s)]
*  Their information is solid. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7469.400000000001s)]
*  DNA evidence. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7470.68s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7471.92s)]
*  Is the guy still alive or is he dead? [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7473.04s)]
*  Huh. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7475.68s)]
*  Inaccurate, says that tweet. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7476.52s)]
*  Inaccurate. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7478.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7480.04s)]
*  So what is the community notes on the tweet? [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7481.6s)]
*  It says inaccurate. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7484.04s)]
*  Did you click on those? [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7484.92s)]
*  What does it say? [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7485.72s)]
*  Also, code break. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7487.56s)]
*  Okay, it says misleading tweet title, [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7488.56s)]
*  inaccurate, attached article states the FBI [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7490.32s)]
*  denies cases closed. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7492.72s)]
*  Article states author has cited a whistleblower, [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7494.4400000000005s)]
*  not FBI identification. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7496.88s)]
*  Read tweets linked article, also case breakers group [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7499.16s)]
*  making claims, not FBI. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7502.56s)]
*  Okay, so it's not that the FBI said [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7505.12s)]
*  that this case is closed. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7506.88s)]
*  So it's a theory. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7508.96s)]
*  Didn't they catch Richard Ramirez from his shoes? [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7510.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think they found his shoe print. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7514.92s)]
*  You know what's most fucked up about guys like that? [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7516.839999999999s)]
*  They go to jail and the women wanna marry him. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7518.92s)]
*  Why is that? [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7521.599999999999s)]
*  I think it's some ancient primal instinct [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7523.36s)]
*  that some women have to be connected to killers. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7528.639999999999s)]
*  What? [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7532.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7533.28s)]
*  Like, do they see it as a power? [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7534.12s)]
*  I mean, there's probably like legitimate psychologists [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7536.2s)]
*  like Jordan Peterson can answer this much more accurately. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7538.879999999999s)]
*  But I would imagine there's something, [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7542.56s)]
*  because it's such a forbidden thing to do to kill people. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7544.360000000001s)]
*  Someone just kills people all the time. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7546.68s)]
*  There's probably some bizarre attraction [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7548.88s)]
*  that some mentally ill people have to someone like that. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7552.080000000001s)]
*  That's probably based on, it's probably based on DNA, [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7555.56s)]
*  because if you wanted your children to survive, [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7559.4800000000005s)]
*  you would be better off back in the barbarian days [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7561.76s)]
*  with a slaughterer, not a slaughtery. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7566.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7570.72s)]
*  That's the guy you want. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7571.56s)]
*  There's a level of unhealthy alpha. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7572.6s)]
*  As long as he doesn't kill you. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7575.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7576.160000000001s)]
*  You fuck him and he kills everybody else. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7577.0s)]
*  And they might even see romance in that. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7578.4800000000005s)]
*  He chooses to kill everybody else, not me. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7581.280000000001s)]
*  Vampires, that's the thing about vampires. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7583.96s)]
*  Women, like the whole Twilight thing. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7585.96s)]
*  As long as he doesn't kill me. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7588.92s)]
*  And these other eatin', suckin' deers dry [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7592.400000000001s)]
*  because he doesn't wanna kill people anymore. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7594.92s)]
*  Do you believe in vampires? [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7596.88s)]
*  Well, I think scientifically they believe [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7598.72s)]
*  that if vampires existed, there would be no more humans. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7602.400000000001s)]
*  Because it would just be a matter of time. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7606.320000000001s)]
*  Of feeding? [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7608.280000000001s)]
*  They would just get us all, [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7609.12s)]
*  and then turn us all into vampires. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7609.9400000000005s)]
*  And then just the amount of people [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7611.320000000001s)]
*  that would get turned into vampires, [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7612.4400000000005s)]
*  it would be an epidemic. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7613.72s)]
*  You wouldn't be able to stop it. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7615.0s)]
*  If they were superhuman in their powers [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7616.16s)]
*  and all that stuff, they would just overrun us. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7618.16s)]
*  I guess that's that. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7619.88s)]
*  They would just overrun us. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7620.72s)]
*  Unless they also recognize [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7622.0s)]
*  that they would run out of a food supply. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7624.0s)]
*  Well then, what are they gonna do? [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7625.84s)]
*  To survive. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7627.72s)]
*  Just to survive, they have to keep eatin' people. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7628.6s)]
*  And they keep, either they kill the people [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7631.08s)]
*  or they turn the people into vampires. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7633.6s)]
*  So it's like, depending on which lore. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7635.62s)]
*  You know, which lore are you going by? [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7638.0s)]
*  You going by the one where they kill all the people, [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7640.12s)]
*  or you going by the one where they drain the blood [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7642.12s)]
*  of the ones they love, [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7644.88s)]
*  and then they let them turn into vampires [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7646.400000000001s)]
*  because it's romantic? [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7648.4800000000005s)]
*  People definitely do drink blood. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7650.400000000001s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7651.92s)]
*  Those are real rituals that happen in Europe all the time. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7652.92s)]
*  It's real satanic blood ritual shit. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7656.12s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7658.12s)]
*  That's real. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7659.16s)]
*  But then there's like, you know, [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7660.0s)]
*  how much of it is just what people are scared of? [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7661.9s)]
*  They're scared of a thing like that. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7664.92s)]
*  Maybe it represents psychopaths to them. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7668.24s)]
*  Because the original Dracula was based on- [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7670.68s)]
*  Vlad the Impaler, right? [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7673.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7674.32s)]
*  Vlad, I think it was Vlad Tepes was his name. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7675.16s)]
*  And this was a guy who literally impaled people on stakes [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7678.28s)]
*  and sat down and ate his lunch in front of him. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7682.36s)]
*  Insanity. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7684.56s)]
*  And there was a woman who did bathe [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7685.96s)]
*  in the blood of children. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7687.72s)]
*  That's a tricky one too. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7689.280000000001s)]
*  That's Elizabeth Bathory. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7690.38s)]
*  Yeah, clinical vampirism. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7691.96s)]
*  But I don't think that was to do with vampirism. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7694.080000000001s)]
*  I think it was more, [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7696.4400000000005s)]
*  she just believed the blood kept her youthful, I suppose. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7697.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, we'll get into that in a second. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7701.76s)]
*  But look at this, clinical vampirism, [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7703.240000000001s)]
*  more commonly known as Renfield syndrome, [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7704.68s)]
*  is an obsession with drinking blood. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7707.76s)]
*  The earliest presentation of clinical vampirism [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7710.38s)]
*  in psychiatric literature was a psycho-analytic [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7713.12s)]
*  interpretation of two cases contributed by Richard L. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7717.5199999999995s)]
*  Vandenberg and John F. Kelly. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7722.36s)]
*  The authors point out over 50,000 people addicted [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7724.72s)]
*  to drinking blood have appeared in the psychiatric literature [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7727.68s)]
*  from 1892 to 2010. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7730.92s)]
*  50,000 people. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7734.36s)]
*  This was documented in the work of Austrian [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7736.08s)]
*  forensic psychiatrist Richard von Kraft-Ebing. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7739.72s)]
*  Nailed it. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7745.8s)]
*  Many medical publications concerning clinical vampirism [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7747.320000000001s)]
*  can be found in the literature of forensic psychiatry [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7750.200000000001s)]
*  with the behavior being reported as an aspect [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7753.22s)]
*  of extraordinary violent crimes. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7755.84s)]
*  Jesus. Jesus, yeah. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7758.92s)]
*  So it's a real psychological disorder. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7761.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7764.38s)]
*  At least 50,000 people in the past 150 years. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7765.22s)]
*  So the Elizabeth Bathory thing is an interesting one [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7767.92s)]
*  because the story is that Elizabeth Bathory was this woman [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7770.8s)]
*  and she was beautiful when she was younger, [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7775.12s)]
*  but as she started growing older, [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7776.96s)]
*  she started murdering young maidens [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7778.32s)]
*  and bathing in their blood. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7780.54s)]
*  She was this evil, psychotic serial killer. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7782.4800000000005s)]
*  And... [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7786.7s)]
*  That'd be a good movie. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7788.16s)]
*  That's a good story, but there's also a counter-story to that [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7789.1s)]
*  that what they were trying to do was accuse her of this [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7793.62s)]
*  so they could take her land [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7795.6s)]
*  because she was in control of this very coveted kingdom [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7797.28s)]
*  and they essentially put her in house arrest [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7803.599999999999s)]
*  because she was a royal, [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7806.679999999999s)]
*  even though she was a serial killer, supposedly. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7807.5199999999995s)]
*  But there seems to be some possibility [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7809.759999999999s)]
*  that there might be fuckery. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7813.36s)]
*  See if you can find that. Damn. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7815.08s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7816.16s)]
*  I just read that recently [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7817.7s)]
*  because we talked about that on the podcast [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7818.92s)]
*  and then somebody, I forget who it was, [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7820.5199999999995s)]
*  brought it up to me like that might not, [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7822.5599999999995s)]
*  that might not have been what actually happened. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7824.599999999999s)]
*  Her brutality has been questioned by historians. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7827.32s)]
*  Here it is. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7829.36s)]
*  Several historians have argued [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7830.32s)]
*  that far from being a cruel and barbaric killer, [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7832.04s)]
*  Bathory was in fact merely a victim of a conspiracy. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7835.04s)]
*  The Hungarian professor, try that one. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7838.32s)]
*  Laszlo Nagy claimed the accusations and proceedings [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7841.639999999999s)]
*  against Bathory were politically motivated [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7847.36s)]
*  due to her extensive wealth [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7849.4s)]
*  and ownership of large lands in Hungary. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7851.0599999999995s)]
*  It is possible that Bathory's wealth and power [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7854.34s)]
*  made her a perceived threat to the leaders of Hungary [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7856.62s)]
*  whose political landscape was overrun [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7859.78s)]
*  with major rivalries at the time. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7861.900000000001s)]
*  Bathory appeared to have suborted her nephew, [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7864.02s)]
*  Gabor Bathory, ruler of Transylvania, and rival to Hungary. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7867.3s)]
*  It was not uncommon to accuse a wealthy widow [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7872.34s)]
*  or murder, or murder witchcraft, [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7874.78s)]
*  I think they meant to say of murder, witchcraft, [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7877.46s)]
*  or sexual misconduct to seize their lands. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7879.72s)]
*  That makes sense. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7882.98s)]
*  That is crazy. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7884.62s)]
*  So the official story was that she was a serial killer [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7885.459999999999s)]
*  and that she was doing that to try to stay young. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7888.94s)]
*  But if you wanted to lock somebody up, [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7892.66s)]
*  that would be the way to do it. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7894.339999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7895.419999999999s)]
*  So she's a fucking serial killer. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7896.259999999999s)]
*  Highest number of victims was 650. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7897.419999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7899.98s)]
*  According to the Guinness World Records, [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7901.259999999999s)]
*  Bathory is the most prolific female murderer [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7903.0599999999995s)]
*  and the most prolific murderer of the Western world. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7906.0599999999995s)]
*  This is despite the precise number of victims [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7909.179999999999s)]
*  remaining unknown and debated. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7912.22s)]
*  Upon collecting testimony from 300 witnesses, [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7914.5s)]
*  Thurzo determined that Bathory had tortured [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7917.38s)]
*  and killed more than 600 victims. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7919.66s)]
*  The highest number cited was 650. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7922.26s)]
*  However, this number came from a claim by a servant girl [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7924.7s)]
*  that Bathory's court official had seen the figure [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7927.88s)]
*  in one of her private books. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7931.3s)]
*  The book never came to light. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7933.66s)]
*  Bathory's victims were said to have been hidden [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7935.780000000001s)]
*  a variety of places, but the most common method [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7938.14s)]
*  was to have the body secretly buried [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7940.9s)]
*  in the church graveyards at night. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7942.82s)]
*  So this was a servant girl that claimed [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7947.219999999999s)]
*  that she saw a book that said [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7949.379999999999s)]
*  that she had killed 600 people. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7951.48s)]
*  That's a good one. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7954.66s)]
*  She should have wrote that down, I guess. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7955.5s)]
*  Yeah, she's like writing down in their blood. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7956.32s)]
*  411. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7959.5s)]
*  Imagine being such a psycho that you've documented [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7961.54s)]
*  all the people that you killed and bathed in their blood. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7964.16s)]
*  Dexter. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7967.92s)]
*  Imagine how many people have done it. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7969.24s)]
*  He didn't bathe in the blood, [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7970.08s)]
*  but he kept a little sample of all of them. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7971.8s)]
*  Imagine how many people have done it we don't know about. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7974.16s)]
*  I think they all keep little trinkets. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7975.88s)]
*  Oh, definitely, definitely. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7978.04s)]
*  Has there been a serial killer for a while? [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7980.9s)]
*  There's a lot of them active right now in the country. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7983.28s)]
*  Really? [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7985.2s)]
*  Yeah, there's always active serial killers. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7986.04s)]
*  How do you just never hear about it? [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7988.6s)]
*  Some of them try it for a little while and then stop. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7990.5s)]
*  Try it for a little while. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7992.8s)]
*  Yeah, for real. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7994.24s)]
*  Like it's tobacco. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7995.08s)]
*  But they could just try it for a while [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7995.96s)]
*  if they get away with it. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7998.72s)]
*  It's not anal, dog. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=7999.6s)]
*  Like you can't dabble in murder. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8000.68s)]
*  There's a lot of broken people out there [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8002.82s)]
*  that I think right now probably dabble in murder. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8004.44s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8007.44s)]
*  Yeah, it is terrifying. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8008.44s)]
*  And it's probably in other parts of the world [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8009.28s)]
*  even more common. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8010.68s)]
*  But you know what, that's actually, [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8012.04s)]
*  it's a weird association I have with scary movies. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8013.4s)]
*  Murder or scary movies never scare me [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8016.38s)]
*  because I know what happens in the world every day. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8019.1s)]
*  Ghosts, demon, monster stuff, that's what scares me. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8021.76s)]
*  Ghosts? [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8025.759999999999s)]
*  Because it's up to your imagination. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8026.599999999999s)]
*  Demons, monsters. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8027.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8028.44s)]
*  Yeah, those are the scariest I guess. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8030.04s)]
*  Well the scariest are aliens. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8031.679999999999s)]
*  Because it's, yeah, Fear of the Unknown. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8032.839999999999s)]
*  Like Alien 1 movie? [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8034.12s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8035.32s)]
*  Alien 1 was like, that to me [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8036.16s)]
*  is the scariest scary movie ever. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8037.5199999999995s)]
*  That movie was terrifying. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8039.44s)]
*  Is it Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8041.08s)]
*  that takes place in Alaska? [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8042.799999999999s)]
*  Where they combine the actual footage [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8044.299999999999s)]
*  of the woman's real therapy sessions and stuff. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8046.16s)]
*  I don't know, I don't think I saw that one. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8049.32s)]
*  Jamie, you know what I'm talking about? [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8050.16s)]
*  Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind? [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8052.0s)]
*  It's Third or Fourth Kind. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8053.719999999999s)]
*  Which one's the original movie? [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8055.4800000000005s)]
*  Third Kind. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8056.32s)]
*  So this one's Fourth Kind. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8057.14s)]
*  I almost heard, probably wrong. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8057.9800000000005s)]
*  I've never heard of it. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8060.28s)]
*  It's a really good movie. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8061.24s)]
*  There's a woman up in, I wanna say Juneau? [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8062.36s)]
*  Or no, no, no, what's the, Gnome, Gnome, Alaska. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8065.4800000000005s)]
*  And back in the day, she became famous [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8069.28s)]
*  because she claimed aliens were basically [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8072.64s)]
*  showing up and abducting her and stuff, right? [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8074.88s)]
*  That eventually her kid got abducted by aliens. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8076.28s)]
*  Or so that's the case. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8080.96s)]
*  And they accused her of killing the kid or whatever. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8082.12s)]
*  Obviously nobody believes that this woman's son [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8086.08s)]
*  was abducted, or daughter was abducted by aliens. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8088.72s)]
*  So it's not currently available in our country? [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8091.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's in Canada. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8093.2s)]
*  I think it's showing up weird. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8094.8s)]
*  You can only get it in Canada? [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8096.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8098.04s)]
*  Go down to the, what? [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8098.88s)]
*  That's strange. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8100.88s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8102.3s)]
*  But they have, it's a movie about this case, [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8103.14s)]
*  but they splice in real footage of her therapy session [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8105.76s)]
*  that she had to go to, that she was going to [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8109.64s)]
*  while she was being abducted each night. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8111.14s)]
*  And they do this, I don't really know how to describe it, [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8113.700000000001s)]
*  this deep meditative state that makes you recall your dreams. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8117.3s)]
*  And she's describing all the things [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8120.9800000000005s)]
*  that were happening to her, these aliens. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8122.820000000001s)]
*  And she starts screaming, she starts levitating up [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8125.06s)]
*  from the couch a little bit. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8128.02s)]
*  It's creepy as shit. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8129.62s)]
*  It's a really good movie. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8131.62s)]
*  It's my favorite abduction movie I've ever seen. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8133.58s)]
*  And obviously nobody believes her. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8135.58s)]
*  She runs into the one person. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8136.780000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, that old footage is the real footage. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8138.9800000000005s)]
*  Wow. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8143.38s)]
*  So here's my issue with the alien abduction thing. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8144.9800000000005s)]
*  Other than there's not any real solid evidence [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8150.42s)]
*  that you could point to that's very convincing, [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8152.74s)]
*  it always happens at night. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8155.46s)]
*  And it always happens during periods where people sleep. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8157.14s)]
*  And when you're sleeping, I'm not saying always, [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8159.860000000001s)]
*  okay I'm sure there's some stories out there, I'm sorry. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8162.5s)]
*  But most of the stories I've ever heard [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8165.3s)]
*  are people in their bed, they can't move, [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8167.42s)]
*  aliens abduct them, or they're in a car, [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8169.7s)]
*  the car stops, they wake up, aliens abducted them. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8172.58s)]
*  When you go to sleep and you dream, [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8177.22s)]
*  there are psychedelic chemicals that your brain makes. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8179.46s)]
*  And we don't know how much they're making. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8183.58s)]
*  We don't know what effect that's having on your dreams. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8187.22s)]
*  We don't know what is going on. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8190.900000000001s)]
*  What is going on with dreams? [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8192.42s)]
*  What is going on with vivid dreams? [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8194.1s)]
*  What is going on with dreams that are, [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8196.38s)]
*  they're indiscernible for real life, [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8198.939999999999s)]
*  and sometimes, in a strange way. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8201.14s)]
*  Like what is that? [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8204.22s)]
*  Is that a psychedelic state your brain goes into every night? [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8205.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8207.859999999999s)]
*  And if chemicals vary in human beings, [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8208.699999999999s)]
*  serotonin varies, dopamine varies, everything varies, [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8212.46s)]
*  testosterone varies, estrogen varies, it varies. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8215.939999999999s)]
*  Wouldn't you just assume those psychedelic chemicals [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8219.779999999999s)]
*  would vary? [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8221.58s)]
*  And wouldn't you just assume that sometimes, [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8222.42s)]
*  maybe even people are in very agitated, [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8224.38s)]
*  anxiety-ridden states, high cortisol levels, [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8229.98s)]
*  perhaps maybe those chemicals are coming out [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8233.859999999999s)]
*  in an abundance too. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8238.099999999999s)]
*  Now, if you're lying in bed, [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8239.539999999999s)]
*  and you're having an insanely vivid [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8242.339999999998s)]
*  and terrifying interaction with aliens every night, [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8246.3s)]
*  because your brain is just dumping psychedelics into you, [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8251.699999999999s)]
*  and this is your big fear, [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8255.539999999999s)]
*  so you're gonna get abducted by aliens again, [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8256.74s)]
*  and then there they are again, [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8258.619999999999s)]
*  leaning over your bed and reaching for you. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8260.259999999998s)]
*  Constant paranoia. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8262.38s)]
*  And then here's the mindfuck of all mindfucks. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8264.5s)]
*  Maybe psychedelics are a gateway to some other reality, [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8268.14s)]
*  some other dimension that's accessible by these creatures. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8275.22s)]
*  I like this. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8279.019999999999s)]
*  And that when you are getting abducted, [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8279.94s)]
*  you really are getting abducted. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8282.94s)]
*  Like whatever your being is, or your spirit, [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8284.980000000001s)]
*  or whatever is you, is getting, [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8287.9s)]
*  you're interacting with these things. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8290.5s)]
*  And it feels real because it is real. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8294.34s)]
*  And because we're thinking about the ability [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8297.460000000001s)]
*  to come in contact with other life forms [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8300.18s)]
*  as being a physical thing. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8302.02s)]
*  It might be that there's a chemical gateway in your mind [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8303.94s)]
*  that when breached, you enter into a dimension [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8308.26s)]
*  where physical bodies don't exist anymore, [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8312.34s)]
*  and everything moves in this constant soup [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8315.460000000001s)]
*  of geometric patterns. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8319.54s)]
*  And that whatever your consciousness is, [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8321.42s)]
*  whatever your soul is, is decoupled from the body [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8324.82s)]
*  and thrown into this realm. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8328.66s)]
*  I imagine that's probably what happens at death. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8330.94s)]
*  It probably is what happens at death. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8333.300000000001s)]
*  It's probably what it's all, [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8334.9s)]
*  I mean, that's probably why people think about it that way, [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8336.34s)]
*  that you're gonna transcend into heaven. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8338.82s)]
*  You're gonna go into this new place. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8341.22s)]
*  It might be true. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8342.82s)]
*  It might be, like a lot of the old depictions [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8344.259999999998s)]
*  of like what happens when you enter into a psychedelic state. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8349.58s)]
*  I've heard this multiple times, [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8355.179999999998s)]
*  that it's like a well of souls. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8356.74s)]
*  That you're interacting with souls [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8359.259999999998s)]
*  that are like completely unattached to a physical presence. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8362.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8367.38s)]
*  And maybe that is, maybe you're getting layers and layers [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8368.859999999999s)]
*  of that depending upon how fucked up you are [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8372.98s)]
*  while you're sleeping. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8375.58s)]
*  And maybe some of those layers are boom, [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8376.539999999999s)]
*  aliens are in the room with you. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8379.06s)]
*  Peeled back. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8380.22s)]
*  Just aliens in the room with you. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8381.34s)]
*  And maybe they can do that. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8382.66s)]
*  Maybe they can visit you while you're in those states. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8383.9s)]
*  Maybe that's what's happening too. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8387.619999999999s)]
*  I mean, we're just assuming. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8390.14s)]
*  Before anybody invented a cell phone camera, [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8392.619999999999s)]
*  like if you tried to show that to someone from 1700, [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8395.539999999999s)]
*  they'd be like, what the fuck are you doing? [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8398.619999999999s)]
*  Like what is this? [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8401.22s)]
*  The idea of transforming or rather traveling [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8402.779999999999s)]
*  through another dimension, even in a non-physical sense, [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8410.14s)]
*  even in like a hologram sense, [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8414.82s)]
*  and existing in a space that's completely different [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8416.779999999999s)]
*  from the dimension that you exist in. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8420.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8422.54s)]
*  Like that might be a thousand years from now, [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8423.38s)]
*  normal shit like a cell phone picture. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8425.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8427.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's just without, [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8428.5s)]
*  it's just above our understanding for now. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8429.3s)]
*  It could be. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8431.46s)]
*  So it could be. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8432.74s)]
*  That makes total sense to me. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8433.66s)]
*  Cause it's like, what the fuck, [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8434.66s)]
*  what the fuck is wifi? [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8435.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8436.74s)]
*  You can't see it. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8437.58s)]
*  It's not a physical thing you can see. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8438.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8439.24s)]
*  What the fuck is wifi? [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8440.08s)]
*  Yeah, how? [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8441.5s)]
*  What's happening with that? [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8442.34s)]
*  What do you mean a text goes from my phone to your phone? [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8443.18s)]
*  What the fuck does that mean? [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8444.98s)]
*  There's no wires. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8445.94s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8447.02s)]
*  Yeah, so that makes total sense. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8447.94s)]
*  Not just a text, but a video. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8449.18s)]
*  You could send a video to your friend that lives in China. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8451.02s)]
*  And it's the exact same quality [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8453.94s)]
*  you saw with your own eyes. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8455.300000000001s)]
*  They might not be able to get it. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8456.14s)]
*  Yeah, maybe not China. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8456.98s)]
*  Okay, Japan. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8457.800000000001s)]
*  If you made a TikTok. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8459.300000000001s)]
*  Okay, yeah, you could send it to Japan. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8460.26s)]
*  You could send it to Germany. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8462.300000000001s)]
*  You could send, if you have a friend in Germany, [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8464.02s)]
*  you could send that person a video and they will get it. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8465.78s)]
*  You send them an iMessage and they will get it, [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8469.18s)]
*  and they'll open up that video and they'll watch it. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8471.06s)]
*  How? [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8472.58s)]
*  Like through space. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8473.42s)]
*  A non-physical transfer. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8474.26s)]
*  It's wild. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8476.94s)]
*  You watch sporting events on your phone. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8477.94s)]
*  Yeah, in real time. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8480.82s)]
*  Live sporting events in real time. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8481.66s)]
*  We live in the future. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8484.18s)]
*  We just don't live in the future [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8485.86s)]
*  where you can travel from one dimension to another [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8487.1s)]
*  and exist in this other dimension [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8491.62s)]
*  as long as this person is in a certain psychedelic state. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8493.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's totally believable. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8496.300000000001s)]
*  And honestly, I hope there's some truth to that. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8498.62s)]
*  It's scary to think about, [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8501.220000000001s)]
*  but that gives a little bit of comfort [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8502.62s)]
*  to have just some kind of answer. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8504.54s)]
*  I think the worst thing that would happen if you died [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8508.94s)]
*  is if you stay totally conscious. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8511.58s)]
*  Imagine your body, you leave your body. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8514.380000000001s)]
*  You have no more control. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8517.34s)]
*  You just exist in the woods. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8518.18s)]
*  Yeah, you still have a consciousness, [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8519.140000000001s)]
*  but when people close your eyes, [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8521.26s)]
*  you're just in darkness for the rest of eternity. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8522.460000000001s)]
*  But, okay, hear me out. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8526.220000000001s)]
*  Super high conversation. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8527.94s)]
*  Now, you're conscious in all black, right? [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8531.58s)]
*  But because you have power over your consciousness, [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8534.54s)]
*  you can create. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8537.140000000001s)]
*  So what do you do? [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8538.26s)]
*  You create some kind of reality. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8539.1s)]
*  Now, you're God of your own consciousness [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8542.86s)]
*  and you create beings within that. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8545.060000000001s)]
*  You get so kooky that you make your own reality. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8546.34s)]
*  Yeah, because what else is there to do [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8548.34s)]
*  besides create something in your consciousness? [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8549.66s)]
*  You can't move, you have no life anymore. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8551.7s)]
*  It's just torture. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8553.5s)]
*  Yeah, that would be the most terrifying thing. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8554.62s)]
*  You exist, but you can't interact. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8556.42s)]
*  Yeah, imagine what if God's there? [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8557.78s)]
*  Nobody knows you're there. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8559.62s)]
*  What if God is exactly that? [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8560.460000000001s)]
*  I think God is the whole universe. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8563.66s)]
*  Has to be. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8565.58s)]
*  That's what I think. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8567.300000000001s)]
*  I think this idea that God made the universe, [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8568.140000000001s)]
*  I think God is the universe. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8569.18s)]
*  I think that makes more sense. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8571.34s)]
*  That this whole thing is just, whoa. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8572.62s)]
*  The whole thing is just this infinite creation machine [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8576.18s)]
*  that creates galaxies, solar systems, stars. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8581.58s)]
*  To everything, to microorganisms. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8586.78s)]
*  Yeah, that it's all by this strange mathematical process [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8588.58s)]
*  that exists where everything gets more and more complex. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8593.74s)]
*  Everything from the beginning to now, [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8597.62s)]
*  and then the humans and whatever's past humans, [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8601.1s)]
*  they're just constantly making things more complicated [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8604.22s)]
*  and more advanced. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8606.78s)]
*  Even the way planets form, then life grows on them, [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8608.42s)]
*  and then that life figures out gunpowder. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8612.7s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8614.539999999999s)]
*  All that stuff is wild. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8615.46s)]
*  It's wild, because it seems to be like it all is moving [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8617.9s)]
*  in this very specific way. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8622.26s)]
*  Even in evolution, animals don't make it. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8625.66s)]
*  This is like, your design sucks. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8627.86s)]
*  We got a new design now. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8629.34s)]
*  This one's better. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8630.34s)]
*  You guys, ground nest? [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8631.7s)]
*  There's cats around here. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8633.380000000001s)]
*  This isn't gonna work out. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8634.42s)]
*  Up in the trees? [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8635.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8636.58s)]
*  It's kind of weird to think that, [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8640.5s)]
*  here's one of the weird ones. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8643.78s)]
*  People don't ever want to believe in anything [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8645.54s)]
*  other than scientific facts. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8648.7s)]
*  When you're examining the universe, [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8651.18s)]
*  we base it on the information that we can currently get [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8653.300000000001s)]
*  from the Webb Telescope and from space exploration [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8657.02s)]
*  and all the stuff that we've done. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8661.94s)]
*  So we have this understanding of the universe, [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8663.300000000001s)]
*  but it all relies on a miracle. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8666.62s)]
*  It really does. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8670.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8671.18s)]
*  Because it relies on this fucking one moment [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8672.02s)]
*  where for some reason, [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8674.62s)]
*  something smaller than the head of a pin [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8676.18s)]
*  became everything you see in the sky. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8678.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8681.5s)]
*  But it's all based on odds. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8683.86s)]
*  But it's almost like to throw in your face. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8685.5s)]

*  the more you figure out everything [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8692.380000000001s)]
*  about the vastness of the universe, [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8694.060000000001s)]
*  black holes and what is inside of them. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8696.5s)]
*  Is there something in there? [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8699.54s)]
*  Is that a portal to another universe? [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8700.5s)]
*  It has to be. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8702.140000000001s)]
*  It might be. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8703.140000000001s)]
*  I think that's the only thing it can be to me. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8703.980000000001s)]
*  But the more you think about the complexity of all it [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8705.74s)]
*  and that it all emerged from this teeny tiny little, [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8709.06s)]
*  and what was before that teeny tiny little thing? [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8714.54s)]
*  What was the teeny tiny thing? [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8717.26s)]
*  What was that form of this universe? [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8719.06s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8721.54s)]
*  And where was it? [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8722.38s)]
*  It's almost like. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8723.3s)]
*  If it wasn't in space, if it itself is space, [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8724.14s)]
*  where the fuck was it? [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8726.7s)]
*  It's almost like as intelligent as people get, [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8727.66s)]
*  as they get more and more advanced, [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8731.18s)]
*  more and more knowledge, [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8732.74s)]
*  they have to kind of always admit they don't know shit. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8733.98s)]
*  Because there's no way you know what happened. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8737.42s)]
*  You can't know. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8740.34s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8741.54s)]
*  No one has ever come up with any fucking reasoning [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8742.82s)]
*  that makes any sense why this one thing [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8746.54s)]
*  would be smaller than the head of a pin [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8749.9s)]
*  and then become this infinite expansion [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8751.42s)]
*  that we see in front of us. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8754.62s)]
*  Yeah, what? [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8755.66s)]
*  What happened? [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8756.5s)]
*  There's theories. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8757.54s)]
*  There's some brilliant theories. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8758.82s)]
*  There's theories that it's a never-ending process [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8760.5s)]
*  of constant expansion and compression, [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8762.42s)]
*  which is really terrifying. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8764.78s)]
*  It continues to expand. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8767.06s)]
*  What's really terrifying is that the whole universe [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8768.54s)]
*  is eventually gonna go back to that fucking pin. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8770.26s)]
*  No, it's not. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8772.140000000001s)]
*  Why would that happen? [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8773.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8774.18s)]
*  No. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8775.26s)]
*  What made it in the first place? [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8776.1s)]
*  We're too stupid to be talking about the universe. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8777.9s)]
*  I know. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8779.7s)]
*  But, is it? [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8780.54s)]
*  I mean, I know that that is a theory. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8781.62s)]
*  There's also a theory that different universes [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8784.380000000001s)]
*  collide with each other, [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8786.42s)]
*  and that they're like membranes, [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8788.380000000001s)]
*  and they collide with each other, [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8789.94s)]
*  and that could be what's creating big bangs. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8791.220000000001s)]
*  That would make the most amount of sense [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8793.94s)]
*  for a reaction of that size. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8795.46s)]
*  Dude, it's all scary. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8797.419999999998s)]
*  It's so big. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8798.699999999999s)]
*  We just look at it at numbers. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8799.859999999999s)]
*  Oh, 13 trillion, and we had Brian Keating on. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8801.58s)]
*  He was explaining that these people that are saying [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8805.099999999999s)]
*  that the universe is not 13.7 billion, [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8807.099999999999s)]
*  that it might be 26 billion, [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8809.619999999999s)]
*  he said that's really based on the development [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8811.179999999998s)]
*  of these galaxies that exist, [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8814.179999999998s)]
*  and it's not definitive proof that the universe is that old. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8816.099999999999s)]
*  But even 13 billion, what are you saying? [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8819.099999999999s)]
*  I know there's science behind it, [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8821.66s)]
*  but yeah, what else? [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8823.179999999998s)]
*  How do you fucking know, man? [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8825.1s)]
*  How do you calculate that? [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8827.18s)]
*  How do you know? [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8828.74s)]
*  How can you know? [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8829.7s)]
*  Geniuses. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8831.1s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8832.1s)]
*  It's amazing just to think of how much we do know, [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8833.1s)]
*  and then how much we don't. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8835.980000000001s)]
*  It's scary. It's so bananas. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8837.42s)]
*  Is it wildly unprofessional [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8840.34s)]
*  if I have to pee so bad right now? [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2TjpguCYzU&t=8841.980000000001s)]
