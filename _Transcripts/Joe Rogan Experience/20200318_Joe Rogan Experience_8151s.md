# Joe Rogan Experience #1443 - Jonathan Ward
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 18, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd1IF8_FKBo)
*  One Jonathan you're the first man ever not only the first man I've ever met who made his own leather jacket
*  Absolutely the first man who made his own leather jacket has ever been on the podcast wearing that jacket
*  Well, I thank you so much a fucking sweet jacket man
*  I'd show you my g-string, but it's probably a little munch for this time of day
*  Well, how are you functioning is that like on the side? How you tying that one?
*  Well, I like I prefer a center rear yank
*  So does my wife because it's she can just put the leash right on it and you know
*  For one keeps her when did you get into making leather stuff? Is that a recent thing about three years ago?
*  But I mean Joe my whole life
*  I've just been a rampant fan of craftsmanship and I've done various deep dives throughout my life into like all sorts of different
*  Art forms. In fact the reason
*  automotive design became my thing and turned into a business was because my hobbies of
*  painting and sculpting and
*  Finish carpentry woodwork and all these different things if you think about it transportation is like this incredibly communicable
*  extroverted combination of so many different art forms. Yeah, so
*  I've been also as in my travels in the last ten years or so or maybe five. I've really been focusing on
*  Always have been focusing on like getting immersed in that local culture
*  But now I've stepped that up a notch and I'm doing like these deep dive travels into
*  Different art forms of different cultures. So
*  leather craft have been visiting tanneries and studying from Masters in the US and in
*  Morocco and Mexico. I just got back locks last week from Mexico doing it really
*  Yeah
*  It's super fun and it's then because for me now at this point the scale of the shop is such
*  That I'm actually doing a disservice if I'm out there actually building your car, right?
*  And because that's what I used to do. I've welded and shaped it and I was on the floor
*  But at our size, I'm not and our fill rates as you recall suck
*  It takes forever for us to finish anything and there's something about
*  just
*  literally putting on your podcast
*  Going in my spare bedroom at home because my son's off at college
*  The second his ass was out of there is like leather studio
*  And it's totally built that sucker out with really good audio and lighting and stuff
*  So being able to come from sketch to have finished good within a matter of weeks a hundred percent myself
*  Independent of everything I needed that I really kind of felt I was losing that tactile craft connection at work
*  Well what you do is so unusual and I'm there's other people that build cars. There's other people that do
*  do innovative things with automobiles, but what you're doing is at a level and
*  With with an obsessiveness that is to me
*  Deserves to be rewarded. I love it. I love the fact that you make these fucking
*  I love the fact you do those derelicts where you leave the patina on the cars
*  Well, you take these beautiful old cars that have like they're they're gorgeous because of the life that they've lived
*  Totally I love them. We do the inside so you can drive them really well
*  Yeah, you know you smell bad you see it and you're down with the romantic sort of yeah
*  You know rosy eyes of memory and then you actually drive a vintage vehicle for most people in the modern world after a couple miles
*  You're like, well that sucks. I have a very peculiar
*  Obsession with cars, but it's not it's not wide. I go from like
*  1965 to
*  1972 like with Broncos maybe 72 and then that's it and then there's modern
*  Like 90s cars, I'm cool with I like 2000 cars, but all those 70s and 80s cars can all they shit suck Joe
*  I'm right there with you and like people bring me all sorts of requests to do later model cars
*  And then I used to like trying to get my head around it. In fact, we did a Caprice classic
*  I saw that thing what a shit show man, but what a ridiculously overbuilt car that thing was
*  I was super gnarly but in the reality was at the end of the day
*  I was rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic because it was still a 90s piece of shit built poorly by people
*  who didn't give a damn and
*  That version of it. Well, we had fun fucking sporty
*  Yeah
*  You know that video got like a half a million views in like half a day and the client just freaked out
*  He's like dude. The whole point of this car is to be under the radar. Could you please remove the video?
*  Oh, yes, we had to take everything down. But for those that didn't see it
*  It was an ex-Miami Dade narc undercover car and the the client came to me with it
*  Like a pretty direct and simple mandate he goes basically like I I trust what you do in your instincts and design
*  The whole purpose of the car. I wanted to say get the fuck out of my lane
*  That was it. That was my mandate for the bill. So Mike I can do that. You know, that's fun
*  That's a fun challenge. You guys had that thing for a long time
*  Yeah, it was it was a long and arduous build for sure
*  but you know, they the guy's brother passed away in a plane crash and
*  Ever since his passing his brothers refused to get on an airplane
*  But he has a ranch in one state and businesses in other states and he does a lot of interstate high-speed travel
*  So we set it up as a full-on mobile office plus a bunch of James Bond hidden oddities and shit ton of performance and
*  Well, I think people get out of his lane. What kind of engine do the thing if I recall?
*  I think that one had an LS 9 so dry something or cold very similar to your LSA motors
*  Yeah, but same here like the the continuity in the design and the consideration
*  but you know by the time you get into the 70s even
*  I'd argue late 60s 70s like the aesthetic is super sexy
*  But then you get inside and the execution the material choice and everything is just sucks
*  Yeah, that's why I like resto mods like I don't know if you've seen it by
*  1965 Corvette that I have out there. Yeah, I was just walking for I came in. That's that's what I like
*  I like cars that look like an old car on the outside, but that have disc brakes and modern suspension
*  And you know and it's a slippery slope, right?
*  It's like where do you stop but for me one thing that I'm keen to do with everything that we build
*  You know be at the derelicts or the reformer one-offs or the production models
*  More and more I'm pulling back on my redesign on the cosmetics to make sure I'm not creating something
*  Temporary or trendy in that I want to honor the original design language of the era in which a vehicle was built
*  Now I may want to elevate that and geek out on it and do unnecessarily cool shit that the production
*  You know car company wouldn't have done
*  But I'm trying to be super careful not to do something that like in ten years is like, you know some
*  fuchsia graphics 80s hot rod all smoothied out that just represents them like a brief moment in time
*  Gimbala Porsche, yeah, did you see the new one?
*  Yeah, it looks like an RC car and I don't haven't decided in a fucked up bad wear and a fucked up really good one
*  I'm not sure. Yeah, it's one of those things where just some people have too much money, you know
*  You're making a four-wheel drive off-road Porsche, although
*  Matt Farah from the smoke, you know, man, he has an off-road
*  1980s Porsche. Yeah. Yes. It's one of those you know, the really nasty upholstery in that
*  Can blame me for that really? Yeah. Oh my god. He loves it. He's like, where can I get some really weird stuff?
*  I know I love all the weird sourcing you do it. I'm like, well, how weird do you want?
*  Disgusting it is I don't know why he's into it, but it's almost like a Atlanta, you know Marta bus
*  Yeah, like an 80s public transit, right? Yeah, it's foul, but it's a it's a rally car
*  You know, I mean he has the rally car lights in the front
*  I mean it looks like a rally car, but it won't perform like a rally won't know
*  No, I don't think so. I mean, it's like an amphibious car at the end of the day
*  You have a shitty car in a crappy boat. You got a picture poison like I thought even I thought he actually was like a car
*  That you could rally
*  No, I mean, you know, it's got coilovers and a couple things here and there but you know at the end of the day
*  It is what it is and it wasn't built to do that. Mmm. I thought he had built it that way
*  He did see there's many mods as could be done within those confines. They do drive those fucking things on dirt roads
*  It's really weird those rallies when you watch them online
*  It's like Jesus Christ
*  First of all, who are these assholes standing next to the road while these people going sideways around corners? Where are the lawyers? Yeah
*  Why are you trusting these people? Have you ever seen anything of the old Paris to P King race?
*  No, I'm so fascinated by that. So I can't remember his name right now Luigi
*  Was the first name so it started in the turn of the early?
*  1900s I believe it was one of the first large international rallies and there's a wonderful
*  biography written by the son of count Luigi whatever who started it and it all started as a drunken dinnertime bet and
*  The idea was you know, I bet it can't be done. He's like, of course it can be done
*  So the the thing was all right, whoever's gonna go for it. Let's go for it
*  Whoever wins gets a magnum of champagne and it like, you know, the race took months and months and months but phenomenal
*  Like it's on my bucket list that would be such a phenomenal experience to do and can you imagine doing it in like 1917?
*  Jesus Christ
*  they were going through villages that had never seen a round eye not to mention a motor vehicle and
*  all the photography and all the old
*  Data put into the all the original diaries of the driver and the co-drivers
*  It's just such an amazing explain to you don't know what we're talking about what this race is
*  So it's a race by land from Paris to P King and it goes through
*  Mongolian all sorts of middle-of-nowhere situations. In fact, I believe it got a bit up here canceled and rerouted several times
*  different geopoliticals
*  Dramas, I didn't even know that Paris and P King were connected like that, right?
*  Who would have thunk it? I never really thought about it and I think of course it's like a three-month race
*  So it's a serious commitment. But wouldn't that just be the adventure of a lifetime?
*  You know Andrew Picard right no ACP great race car driver dear friend of mine, you don't know him
*  I would know he'd been on the show. No, no, no, yes
*  So I've already been talking to him and a dear friend of mine within him
*  You know my buddy with a DC3 that you see me flying around and sometimes
*  the no 3 DC 3 airplane 1944 now, so
*  Stupid stupid absurd hidden car collection in Central, California
*  So I've been slowly lobbying him and you know invited Andrew ACP to a dinner to start sort of planning that seed
*  And they don't realize I don't think either of them realize it yet. They're gonna realize now they're part of the team
*  What are you doing? I want to do damn Paris P King. No, you don't hell. Yes, I months. Yep
*  Oh my god party on well, I just have gone and doing yet, but I want to do it really
*  Trying to put together. Yeah as a travel geek and as a car geek and as a culture geek like hello
*  Why why on earth what I'm not you use a modern car to do? No, you can't it's
*  Yeah, no very stringent very vintage. Oh
*  Yeah, like all these photos just nuts and that's an incredibly contemporary car for it
*  Usually you're talking about like three five sixes like those. Oh, no like rolls open touring cars
*  Those fucking Alves is in like super weird early shit open wheel cars. That's what those people do. Yeah
*  So there's these are hundred year old cars
*  Yeah, and that that car in fact in that image is a replica of the actual original
*  Car that started the entire race. Oh my god, just super super cool experience
*  Especially after reading that book that's how you would want to do it
*  Well, I don't know if I'd want to go brass-era bat shit about it. Well, what where would you stop?
*  You wouldn't go
*  1979 Datsun, you know, I think a Volvo Suga. What's that a sugar? It basically looks like if a
*  48 humpback Ford and a power wagon had a love child. It would be a Volvo
*  Shugga, I need to see this thing. It's super trippy. I think one of those all rallied out vintage would be super super cool su
*  That's actually a cool looking car. They're super
*  Beautiful right in like the ugliest way what is that? But is that an aftermarket set?
*  No, that's the wheels and everything dead factory other than those are more contemporary tires
*  Go go with that that last image that you had Jamie with the crazy tires. That thing is fucking cool
*  Oh, yeah, there's another last image
*  Yeah, but I want the other image that one right there like look at the wheels on that thing. Yeah
*  Usually that's usually they were command cars
*  Commanding officer cars so the back area on the interior was generally kitted out quarter sawn
*  Dovetailed fumed white oak with like a teletype machine and all their early correspondence gear
*  And there's such a freak of a car that is beautiful. Yeah, that's such a cool in car
*  I'd love to see that with like modern headlines. I'd like to see that with yeah like on
*  40s
*  Solid axles Fox Racing coilover
*  Has anyone done that? Oh, no, there was one that made the rounds. I think it was last year
*  I saw it at SEMA that did more of a sort of conventional contemporary hot rod street rod build but they kind of
*  Not the way you and I are thinking that is so cool looking. I've never seen that car before there's super freak
*  No one really knows about him. They're one of those odd moments in automotive history
*  What size are they like what did so there's no nothing to come?
*  To there. I mean, it's like a 48 humpback Tudor four-door
*  Anything to you. It's it's sort of
*  Not into post-world war two so it's like a
*  Mid 40s standard four-door sedan scale other than its height. I'm pretty reasonable
*  They're probably really hard to find though, right stupid are defined. I believe there's eight of them known in North America
*  But then you know, whatever you bring one over from Europe there is a shame to chew it up. Yeah, I'm over that
*  Guilty anymore. I'll tell you what at the end of the day
*  What's actually getting used and enjoyed and creating more memories?
*  That's one of my vehicles that are hacked and ruined as people like to say occasionally or something sitting in some static collection gathering
*  They say that about the derelicts when you redo the interiors. Oh sure everyone's that's everyone likes to talk shit
*  But I kind of enjoy it what I was gonna say about cars. I have this very narrow window
*  So if I see like a really cool 55 Chevy, it's great. I never want to own one really
*  I don't know what about don't do it. How far back can I take you like 65 like 63 Corvettes?
*  It's those that year like like a bubble top 63 Pontiac or Chevy or too early
*  No, it's like the the second generation Corvette is as early as I go and then really I look to 67 Mustang
*  What year were you born 66 67? Okay, so that's the problem, but it's not it's my high school years during my high school years in the 80s
*  That was those were the cool cars the cool cars with the system. I mean, that's what I mean. We've identified the problem
*  It's not even a problem. It's just like to me like like the quintessential shape is like a 69 Camaro
*  There's something about a 69 Camaro like goddamn did they nail it? They just it's a timeless classic. It'll always
*  Be they've been crawling under my skin lately I've been thinking I come here
*  Yeah, like I think it'd be interesting to do one because if you look back on the design history
*  They were the design team and executives at GM designed that car basically in reaction to trends in European
*  touring cars and sports cars
*  So there's a lot of Ferrari direct Ferrari inspiration like 275s and stuff
*  so I always thought it'd be interesting to do a
*  Elevated more European perspective version of that gen Camaro like devoid of badges
*  Not like all smoothied out like everyone does but just like elevate the trim
*  but like that kick-ass egg-crate grill and all those details like do it more the way a
*  Small coach builder would have done it than production. Mmm. There's something to him for sure
*  Yeah, when Matt was here last he was showing me there's a company that takes an older Ferrari
*  What was it? Which which model was it? Do you remember Jamie?
*  They took an older Ferrari and puts a much more modern Ferrari engine and completely redoes everything
*  But makes it so that was it's an ETO
*  Was it the Norwood P4 or was it GTO engineering in LA and the UK?
*  They do a lot of GTO builds, but they stay pretty true to the original form
*  But Phil Norwood who used to actually race for Ferrari
*  He's I don't think he's doing them anymore, but he for a while in Texas
*  I believe was doing what they called the P4 Norwood and those are so bad. So like
*  Monaco superleggera lightweight and they were using modern
*  I think at that time they were what are they taking like rec test erosus or something some modern Ferrari powertrain
*  But keeping like the original race aesthetic
*  I'm not sure what company's doing it
*  But what they were doing essentially was making everything that you could remove and put it back to the original stock form
*  Including the engine including the suspension including the transmission including the brakes, but everything was aftermarket
*  So they weren't cutting anything they were sort of replacing stuff
*  But making this way better way more high-performance version
*  It might be GTO and also man if you look at one of their
*  Recreation cars that are scratch-built and you know the value of the original GTO is is so nuts that now like a guy goes
*  Oh, well, yeah
*  I'll leave that in the collection and they'll call GTO and say build me one that looks just like my car and I actually
*  Want to drive it and if you sit them side by side
*  The only difference is the GTO one has better fit and finish and tolerances
*  Otherwise, you cannot tell them apart hands down. So the new one has better fit and finish. Yeah. Hell yeah
*  Yeah, there's a company called Revology that does that with mustangs yeah Tom Scarpello
*  Yeah, they make some beautiful cars. They do but I wonder like smogging them in
*  California would probably a nightmare
*  Well, yes, so right now unfortunately
*  You know
*  There's that new law that Tom and myself and a lot of other builders in our space have been very active and trying to get
*  Past that was for ultra low volume vehicular manufacturers act
*  So if we made under 350 units a year, we'd be exempt from crash and many expensive regulatory
*  Limitations, but we had to be responsible for emissions
*  So it's turned into a complete shit show and it's already three years beyond posting
*  in fact
*  SEMA just filed suit against the federal government for inaction because their will outside of their legal
*  Timeframe to actually create the damn paperwork to enact the law and Tom's caught up in the middle of that
*  So right now he's been putting General Motors LS threes into the mustangs because it's the only thing that smog legal
*  Because Ford Racing hasn't bothered doesn't seem to see any importance or value
*  We're creating a mission certified
*  Power trains when these are using LS threes once the laws start again a little sketchy
*  Oh, so past a percentage and when Tom was doing the new bodies and new everything
*  He's going down that road even all the Cobra guys in emissions regulated states are putting
*  LS threes in them Wow because Ford doesn't it's like I talked to execs at form like you guys cool with that
*  Like you don't see that's not good for branding. Yeah, there's such spreadsheet junkies. I don't think that
*  They see the value the struggles real. Yeah, it seems like a
*  Bastardization. I mean there's something about combining Ford and like it's really gross when they combine
*  Chevy and Mopar there's something about yeah
*  LS engine in a like an old coup to you like what are you doing? I agree but like to a point
*  I think if we look forward that's changing because as it is today
*  You know your Bentley is your BMW is your key at like everyone sharing the same pool of suppliers
*  Anyway, and a lot of these cars are just badge cars nowadays anyway, so I think there's a
*  Wider acceptance as time passes to oddities, but I mean look at that 49 electric mercury. I did
*  we
*  Purposely like dress the quote-unquote engine bay to look like an old speed equipped v8
*  And you know vintage thin kind of Fenton header look you know the cast
*  To try and keep those old dudes engaged and not to look out and go on there's a room you ruin
*  You put a little video that it was a 49. So yeah, 49
*  mercury
*  Electric it's on the Jonathan Ward YouTube page. You know it's amazing guess where it is right now
*  In the bottom of the lake not that bad what it's stuck in Luxembourg
*  Why well it's a long story?
*  But we were honored that good year invited us to have it be the feature vehicle on their large booth at the Geneva
*  International Auto Show so we jumped through hoops. We put it on an airplane. We sent it over there
*  Show got canceled now all the commercial because we we wanted traveling by air not by boat now all the flights are canceled now
*  Other cargo is getting prioritized and now we're transporting it to Frankfurt, and it's like stuck in limbo. Oh no
*  Yeah, oh the coronavirus transport yep. Yeah
*  Shit, when you gonna get that back fuck if I know and that's a client's car. Yeah, and so he said yeah
*  Go ahead. Yeah
*  Fortunately the client is like one of the best humans we've ever worked with and he's totally cool about it
*  But we know we're all nervous. We want the darn car back. Yeah, what's a one-of-a-kind you there it is now
*  That is what one of the things that I love that you do that
*  I don't think anybody else is gonna do I don't think anybody else would take that level of engineering and to rebuild something to that
*  Spectacular level of detail, but yet keep the fucked-up paint
*  Like look at that thing and you know I never rolling down the street you wouldn't have zero idea
*  What that is especially when that thing is it is no transmission?
*  So it's dual electric motors just under 500 foot pounds of torque no shifts
*  So it's it moves like a freight train. Yeah, I think is so fast have you driven a Tesla
*  Huh, yeah the s the p100d yeah, it's a preposterous vehicle
*  Yeah
*  We put the 80 array in that with American racing motors and dual Reinhardt
*  Controllers and thermal management network that we engineered a whole bunch of stuff and when this guy charges us in
*  How many miles can he get 200 to that's not bad?
*  The Porsche Taycan essentially yeah well supposedly right but but
*  I can't afford to do fancy misleading federal testing
*  So I literally just make sure my flatbed is at hand and just drive the piss out of it until I can't go and then
*  I go okay there you go. There's the range well
*  But the EPA or whoever is doing the tests on the Taycan apparently they sold it way short and all these automotive
*  Journalists that have driven the car are saying no we've gotten you know
*  270 280 they've gotten quite a bit more than that I think
*  Whoever the government rated it 201 yeah, so it's it's quite a bit more than that
*  But but they're that whole derelict program
*  You know was like many things in my life started just from a stupid passionate idea like I didn't never
*  Never considered a business model of doing it. It was just okay. I've got two young kids. I've got two labs
*  I like to do this. I like to do that. What do I want is my next car?
*  And I'm like you know what I'm tired of over restoring shit because that's like my OCD
*  I just everything be perfect perfect and then the first time you know the kids nail it with a skateboard
*  Or I ding it with a surfboard or the dog takes a piss in it whatever like I don't want to be that guy anymore
*  So I was like you know what I think I like want to find something that's already fucked up
*  I'm just gonna leave it looking all fucked up, so I don't even I hate
*  Washing cars and I hate putting gas in them so with the derelicts all you do is clean the windows and vacuum it at best
*  And party on and then I just put a massive gas tank so my old 52 de Soto
*  Station wagon was the first derelict that I built 100% myself nights and weekends
*  Just because I had this stupid idea in my head
*  And I wanted I've realized it it wasn't until it was done
*  And it got like to cover a hot rod and won all these awards that my dumbass went. Oh wait a minute
*  Yeah, we're honest and this still is you know it fits within how we define the icon brand
*  Holistically about revisiting classic transportation design in a modern context. It's just a different way of doing it
*  So that was your first derelict. Yeah, what do you mean?
*  So derelict till I was done, and then we're like okay. Let's brand them and we started getting tons of requests
*  We've built some pretty wild array of them and have a bunch of me here your first one was for you
*  Yeah, yeah
*  I mean
*  But that speaks to how weird it is that you're doing that in the first place because most people who you know high dollar
*  Restoration and you know air quote resto mods or whatever you want to call them
*  Everyone wants them to be beautiful and pristine with you know handles that that disappear. You know I mean
*  wants to shave everything down and
*  Like
*  Moving a lot of the original character of the design that they're supposed to be celebrating in the first place so that
*  Compounded by patina which tells a more personal story of like where's this carbon? How did he get that ding?
*  There's like romance and mystery all wrapped into one as far as the history behind all those finishes
*  How much how big is the gas tank in this thing that one's got like a 42 gallon gas tank?
*  I was like spare tire gas tank spare dirt Mike screw it three cans of fix-it-flat and a big-ass gas tank
*  I hate stopping for gas well especially with something like that
*  It must get like four miles to the gallon that actually is a full emissions equipped modern
*  SRT 8 hemi 6.1 and so get six you know what it's I don't understand why but I've built several hemi based builds
*  That is the fastest and most fuel efficient of the hemi build I've ever done. I mean that thing gets probably
*  15 17 really yeah with that much metal and I drive it like an ass
*  I mean, I'm I'm flogging that thing granted. I'm on my third transmission, but oh really yeah to the first two remote part trannies
*  Which fellow builders avoid them they suck if you add even like five horsepower beyond the stock motor app
*  They completely shut themselves so the third time. I'm like that's it. I'm done pull the band-aid off
*  Throw that thing away and put a good old GM for only 5e in there
*  So this thing has how many miles on it now? I got about
*  38 39 thousand miles on it so wow I love the split windshield too. Yeah, yeah, it's such a fun fun fun ride
*  But you know we going all the way back to the beginning of icon
*  Even further back to the beginning of the first brand TLC they all started with personal cars
*  Mmm like the icon idea was just another dumb idea that was rattling in my head
*  it was literally keeping me up at night and it got to the point that
*  I need and this happens to me often like you know when I did my watch and then all the different products that I've designed
*  Generally, I'll start with something that gets to the point that I'll lose my remaining sanity if I don't actually create it
*  So I had the concept for icon. I could see it clearly in my head. I had like a full-on
*  3d detailed model in my head and like my version of jumping over sheeps at night in bed
*  Was like sitting there and zooming in on an element and changing that
*  radius and scaling this and trying that and it literally got to the point told my wife I'm like I
*  Gotta build it. I just gotta build it. Well your your company
*  It's sort of it's symbiotic with social media in a sense particularly YouTube because so many people on YouTube
*  Are interested in unique builds and interesting companies that are doing cool things like revology
*  But your company in particular
*  It's so perfect because you do all those videos and you drive around the cars with this incredible detail
*  And that's one of the first things that got me very attracted to your company was the fact like I go look at this motherfucker
*  He's so balls deep into this shit. Oh, yeah, so
*  And if I'm not I won't take the job. It's so it's easy to say now
*  You know it's so contagious though when someone's like really into something particularly design and production and I totally
*  And like if you're not totally into it, and you're not balls deep into it
*  Then pull out and zip up and go home shut up like you know
*  Yeah, do something else is if you're not passionate about it you you suck at it
*  Well particularly in this world right in the world that you're in and you know like your most classic
*  Models are like your Bronco your FJs like those those get the most amount of attention
*  I think online and those I mean there's a lot of people making Broncos
*  There's a lot of people making now there are now there are yeah, well, you know you opened up a door
*  There's a lot of people that making the exact Bronco you make it's so close. It's ridiculous. They're redoing your grill
*  Yeah, kind of urge me. I'm some people are like oh you should be flattered
*  I'm like no not really like I'm flattered when I see an industry swell around my first dumb idea
*  I want you know you see the revologies and the singers and all these companies having viable businesses
*  Revisiting classic transportation design that I absolutely love what I absolutely despise is the
*  suckerfish that just will go oh
*  Well, they have a two-year waiting list that doesn't look hard
*  Let's make a company and let's make our business model that we're just like icon
*  But we're quicker and cheaper like that just irks the piss out, but what do you know?
*  What are you gonna? Do I can't say anything?
*  I just hard because some party on don't have the money you know but they want a Bronco
*  You know I get it. I see what you're saying, but I get it from their perspective no, but from a consumer perspective
*  I understand the appeal of not having to wait and not having to pay as much
*  But at best in this industry you get what you pay for and frankly even that is a rare equation
*  What I'm more pissy about is companies that go oh well now we can charge more for it
*  And let's just deliver something that looks as close to that and copy as much of its trade dress and
*  Style
*  And kick it out at a fat margin at what's deemed to be the most acceptable price point like but with your waitlist
*  Like why do you even fuck with that like what do you why do you pay attention to those maybe maybe I'm insecure and childish
*  Or maybe I'm worried that you know past a point. It's going to erode our business one way or another
*  No, thank you. No not your I mean it's cool like Scouts for example
*  There's like three or four companies now doing Scouts their way with their vision
*  They're realizing their dream, and I like I'm here to support them help them cheer them on that's great
*  It's when people come into a market because they just merely see a capital opportunity
*  But they have no passion or expertise in it. That's where I get pissy. I understand your perspective
*  My perspective is always a bandwidth perspective you say of you your bandwidth is
*  100 for that's all of your attention that you have to even give 10 of
*  That to some knuckleheads that are just copying. It's true. It takes energy
*  It's all it all does it just takes away from what you're doing and what you're doing is amazing
*  I think the last time I thought about it prior to just now pitching to you has been a good three or four months
*  I don't give it too much thought just every now and then every now
*  And then keep moving yeah, you were
*  You were doing a bunch of I mean, I don't know how much you could talk about this
*  Can you talk about that little BMW? No that doesn't exist doesn't
*  Know I mean I guess now that we did talk about it. No I have a couple we said is little BMW
*  I have a couple R&D projects in the works that are again those odd projects that were keeping me up at night and
*  one of them includes doing kind of a very
*  Progressive take on you know even beyond what how we've been known to redesign classics
*  Taking that up ten notches. Yeah
*  With an early classic iconic BMW and meanwhile, it's killing me. It's it's I'm hemorrhaging money in it
*  I'm almost three-quarters of a mil
*  Deep into that project. Well, but the other one that was yeah for a long time like before
*  You built my Bronco which took a year to build and I've had for a year and a half
*  Yeah, hopefully my wife doesn't listen. Yeah, I think it's been about four years of work on it Wow
*  But I'm super stoked like when when it's done. It's something like nobody ever done seen before
*  Well, I love the idea behind it, you know, like I'm a fan of those cars
*  I'm a fan of the original one and I'm a fan of you know, we're doing another one too. That's you know again sort of
*  Looking at how we've done what we do and like how else could we do it or how further could we evolve it?
*  Which as you've seen and working with me like I'm doing that all the time and all the little things but like holistically
*  Conceptually, how do you do it? So we're doing early C 20
*  Chevy truck hmm and you know, we were gonna do our usual thing of you know
*  engineer chassis engineer the axles and
*  Call Brembo what design the brakes like and then you've got like umpteen purchase orders from umpteen different suppliers and a big pile of
*  Cost and at the end of the day
*  You could say I mean we don't have hundreds of millions of dollars in development
*  So we're building hopefully a well-functioning what is in essence a prototype. So this time for the Chevy truck
*  I'm like screw it. I'm going to the dealer. So I just went and bought the
*  Wt which people call the white trash edition the Wt series Chevy pickup
*  So we bought a three quarter ton four-wheel drive brand new Chevy truck off the dealer floor for like 36 grand took that apart
*  And we're rebodying it with its grandfather's body
*  So now like ABS he'll hold many of the perversions of modernity
*  Everything is integrated and literally the client could go to a Chevy dealer
*  Although they probably cringe and say no no no, it's not a 70, you know, look look
*  Here's the ID tag this then from this 2019 truck. That's what it is
*  So just service that's the service protocol and the interior dead stock C 20 Wow
*  So the gauges were working with classic instruments to design an IP an instrument panel that has the original design aesthetic
*  But then integrates the little three by three digital screen for all of the you know
*  All your prompts and digital what about airbags?
*  Can't do that because the body is not designed to absorb energy thereby. It's not compliant with airbags
*  But we're keeping the entire
*  Basically the entire truck minus the airbags and the HVAC system in tact. So how does someone register that?
*  What does that register does still is the original truck because the client brought us the C 20
*  So then the way that handles it's up to the client say, okay, here's your legal entities for both
*  Wow, you pick which way you want to title it and party on and obviously most people want to stay the traffic of
*  Least resistance. Yes stick with an exempt year. Yeah, but it meets 2019 emissions and everything and cylinder
*  Deactivation and all sorts of course. That's why I asked you about the airbags because it wouldn't meet
*  Corrects yeah, but that would be sick though. Yeah, it would be neat, you know for a while who was it?
*  Someone told me it was Midas
*  Was trying to think of ways to stay relevant and they they were like knees deep and investment in retrofit airbag systems
*  Really? Yeah, did they ever get it off? No
*  I mean, it's an absolute engineering shit show because there's so many parameters you can't control it would just never work
*  But you were talking about retrofitting things with ABS did that ever come?
*  No, and I still I'm dying to do it
*  So the only way that it's come to fruition for me is like with your fcj 80 by maintaining the original
*  ABS system or such as the case with the c20 by keeping the entire modern vehicle
*  Active and just rebodying it but I mean I'm dying for the aftermarket to come up with a standalone ABS module
*  That's tunable. I think it's such the missing link
*  There's so many missing links as I was bitching to you earlier the automotive aftermarket
*  Quite frankly my dear is an absolute whorehouse in my opinion
*  There's just so much garbage on the market and and it's like
*  Where's the quality and the markets there? Like I think consumers are ready for elevated consideration and execution
*  Well, there's surely there's some companies that are making good aftermarket stuff. So the minority it's
*  Ten percent not even really. Oh, yeah, good Lord
*  But I'm a picky bitch so you are so I wouldn't say that word I might I might
*  You see a lot of words, but you wouldn't say the B word
*  I would I say the bitch word all the time, but about you calling you a picky bitch
*  It seems like it seems like I would say picky fellow
*  All right. Yeah, I'll take either one clever bitch. You're a clever bitch. I would say that maybe but you're
*  Your whole place like every time I go there I feel like
*  Like I like I want to give myself time like if my appointment is at 12 30
*  I'll show up at 12 just start wandering around. So what do you got? What's going on here, man?
*  What are you doing? It's Willy Wonka's such odd diversity in there right now
*  Do you notice in the DNR and the derelict and reformer section?
*  The range of projects the diversity of those platforms right now. Did you see the 70 Ford yellow and cream?
*  Short bed. No, I did not. I didn't see that. It's so stupid sexy. I did see that blazer that someone's selling
*  Yeah, that's one of your older projects. Yeah, I never drove it
*  I remember you were building two of them one
*  It was more modern looking correct kind of more over engineered or not more over engineer
*  But more engineered and then this one which is more of a really looks like an older
*  Yeah, and it has the same mechanical engineering integrated in it
*  But it was a much different style more of what I call my old-school style where all my mods like even the badging on
*  It where it says icon was CNC and stainless in the original typeface that blazer was written in
*  So if you don't know you don't know and it's like super under the radar mellow colors
*  Yeah, really good letters. It's a cool blue. Yeah, I love that. Yeah, it's a 60s Fiat blue
*  So the guy just never drove it. No, it drives me crazy. I hate that. I love that. You drive my car
*  I drive the shit out of it
*  Take it back and it had like 400 more miles on it than when I deliver
*  Like dude, what yeah, what's going on? He's all it was too nice. I was afraid to drive it
*  I'm like, oh, come on. I drive that Bronco everywhere everywhere and every time I drive it people like what in the fuck is that?
*  Like yeah, that's exactly see ya. Yeah, it's uh, it's such a mechanical thing when you drive that car
*  It's what I love about it
*  Like sometimes if I don't drive it for a week or two, I kind of forget and then I get in it's like
*  Everything is like you feel everything. It's like there's a thing about modern cars. Like I really do love my Tesla
*  It's it the way I describe it. It makes other cars seem stupid like they're stupid like this is how cars should drive
*  Like you hit the gas. It's almost telepathic. It just goes somewhere. It just moves
*  It's in the gigantic navigation screen. Everything about is amazing
*  I was supposed to be in Detroit right now for the Bronco launch, which they they've
*  Laid because the Corona but the difference between that and say the Broncos you don't feel it like at the Bronco
*  It's a manual transmission and you literally feel every gear
*  It's there's all these moving parts that you kind of sync up with so there's all this
*  Sensation that's going into your brain through your hands visceral. Yeah
*  Reconnection of man and machine and I think there's a place for both
*  Yeah, right
*  But I think more and more as the world turns to autonomous vehicles ride-share
*  Infrastructure community development is even starting to go a different direction
*  I used to be concerned about that in regards to the future of our company
*  But now I realize like that's great like because the more that happens the more there's gonna be
*  plenty of people who for the weekend for the whatever like
*  Demand a manual tranny and a visceral man-machine relationship. It feels different
*  It feels different when you drive them. There's a sweet spot somewhere
*  I have a 2005 e46 m3 and I got it online off this dude
*  it was only 15,000 original miles and
*  That seems to me to be the sweet spot because it's not the fastest car in the world
*  And it's got a dining supercharger on it. It doesn't handle the best in the world. But man, is it a it's like
*  There's something about that car like when you're driving it makes you smile
*  There's something about the way it steers the way you feel the hydraulic steering not electric
*  The new m3 is almost becoming there's like too many nannies
*  It's it's too technical in a manner that makes the stats improved
*  But not the connection to the driver feel more dynamic. Yeah, it's like I've got a
*  96-993 twin turbo and that to me is one of the most perfectly
*  Engineered vehicles that was designed by a core group of people
*  Who had a singular focus on what its purpose was and what it should do what it should evoke and what it shouldn't
*  Do you have the same one that you had before? Yeah
*  Yeah, I was minor. Okay. Yeah, I love that car. It's a great car
*  I remember the cover of was Motor Trend eroded in tracks had sell your soul and buy this car when it came out
*  When it came out it was like, you know early 90s was when I first came to California
*  There was no way I was ever gonna be able to form all those
*  I remember looking I had the poster as a kid when you see that when you see a car like that you start thinking like
*  How much does that cost? How much do I make? How long do I have to save? What do I have to do?
*  What if I work twice as much?
*  How do I make this happen? Yeah, I remember I had the possible I had the vector poster
*  I had the 993 turbo. I had the Kuntas
*  Periscope and
*  Had a 550 Maranello poster and then for a little while as I approached I just turned 50 last week
*  Like my late 40s. I started like having to knock at that list like okay, what are we waiting for right bought a
*  550 it sucked the Maranello should have been left to the rosy eyes of memory
*  It's a bucket of shit. I get so annoyed at that car can't afford the vector missed my chance to afford a periscope
*  Oh, but I've been watching Farah just piss money into his constantly
*  I had that BMW M car that wedge. Yeah one the original wedge. What the fuck was that car and one I believe
*  I'm one emmering right? Yeah, yeah, I like the original BMW supercar
*  I had one of those my wall when I first came out to California in the 80s
*  I remember and I think it was a Newport or Manhattan Beach. There's like
*  ex BMW dealership looking space
*  But it was an independent BMW dealership and service center and they had one in the factory
*  Tri-color livery and they had it for sale and I remember
*  Begging my mom to pull over in our crappy Dodge Aries rental car and going in and asking and it was for sale
*  It was like 11 grand and the guy was like
*  Hoping and begging I was serious because they couldn't give them away back. Look at that thing. They're so nifty god
*  I love that thing and the wheels are so I had a red one on my wall. I
*  Remember thinking God only one day. That's it. That's the fucking car. Jamie. Is that the poster yet?
*  Probably it's hard to remember but it looks exactly like one of my photographers does a trick and now I've been using it
*  So you'll get that mirrored effect if you take an iPhone that's off and put it right under the lens and hold it up
*  And angle it just right
*  Cool interesting. Yeah, that's a beautiful car and back in the day like what was that that had to be like
*  Early 80s, right? What year was that? Oh, yeah, I was late 70s. I believe was it
*  Yeah for long that makes sense because I was in high school
*  First year high school was 81. So that that's when I had it on my wall. I can't remember his real name but on Instagram
*  Mr. Enthusiast. I don't know
*  He's a designer and a really interesting cat. He has like Lancia Delta
*  He had a Stratos for a couple years like he's in like all the weird shit
*  And I think he still owns one but he rocked one of those before anyone was talking about him and like had it forever
*  Drove the piss out of I love those cars
*  I have zero desire to own one now and I have zero desire to own anything old that hasn't been redone
*  Yeah, I don't like there is mr. Enthusiast. Oh, there you go. That's a beautiful car
*  He's so funny, too
*  Cuz like as you know, I'm a big watch geek and he's like the Antichrist and watch culture because he's all about
*  Quartz like vintage quartz. So like for a short time Patek made quartz watches
*  And like everyone shuns them but now like they're immensely collectible
*  Why why does everybody hate quartz because they just want everything to be mechanical to me
*  That's why I won't touch a quartz watch
*  But what about when they combine the two of them they use them the quartz to even a response
*  He's one of my favorite of the weirdos
*  Yeah, not my design. This is a resins or resins is the brand these are super trippy
*  But like they just came out with a smartwatch where like when you're on the plane and you're in our new time zone and you land
*  It'll reset itself. I'm like what I have a thumb and an index finger that work pretty fucking good
*  I can set my own watch. How does it do that? Oh, it's a good
*  Mechanical quartz combination. Oh wow, but these are super trippy because the entire
*  Movement rotates as it tells the time what?
*  That's crazy super trippy brand really interesting guys and they're oil-filled and all sorts of neat niftiness
*  And talk about an industry in a shit show even before this sad virus situation
*  luxury watch world
*  Yes, why is that? Why is the luxury watch world bleeding? I think
*  Smartwatch put a bigger ding on it than they thought it would and they negated it originally
*  Yeah, and exactly
*  Arrogance if we're doing just fine and then like now they say there's so many manufacturing
*  options for low volume watches that the only growth segments and I read the big LVMH like annual report and
*  the
*  Like was it 800 to 1600 dollar segment of watches pumping killing it growing like crazy
*  Otherwise, it's up. It's like 20 grand and more
*  Independent watch brands are killing it. Everyone in between is like
*  Hammering really that's interesting. There's this new company on bum
*  Because when I went to the Geneva show I was gonna go meet with him
*  But David Rutan watches that are doing watches that are CNC'd out of a solid chunk of meteorite
*  And like not like some bullshit EDM meteorite dial on your ladies Daytona
*  The entire watch case the crown and everything is meteorite. Jesus Christ. How many meteorites are there?
*  Like how there's actually a shit ton of meteorites really?
*  Yeah
*  There's different grades of them and stuff and it depends on the metallurgic content to if they can be machine and they eat machine
*  Here is left and right Wow. Look at that funky, right? How weird looking that's made out of a meteorite
*  Yeah, god damn it. You can see all the fracturing it and his price points pretty
*  he's doing like a pre-launch and
*  So he hasn't launched yet
*  They just started doing deliveries like a week ago and like I'd saved up my little side monopoly cash from selling off used parts and
*  leather stuff
*  And I was like ready to pull the trigger and I already had a meeting and lunch date set up with those cats and like
*  And what happened? Well that my trip got canceled. Oh, the Geneva show got canceled
*  but anyway, the point of the story is guys like this and a resense and
*  Lorraine fray and all these different mozer is another great brand if they have a very unique aesthetic and
*  philosophy
*  They're killing right, but it's the traditional big luxury bling bling. Yo, look at me
*  Yeah, those guys are just dying on the vine because I think more and more people aren't buying into what is
*  Considered luxury in a conventional sense. Hmm people more story. Well
*  Mean that also speaks to like what the kind of stuff that you do. I mean people like
*  Things that are crafted by artisans. Yeah, you know, I love that me too
*  We're seeing that revival right in the last years. It's just growing and growing and growing
*  It's so I feel like it's the world becomes more digital and people become more disconnected with each other
*  There's something about like when I drive your Bronco first of all, I really like you
*  So I love the fact that I'm driving your truck and then too I feel like it's a piece of art
*  Yeah, I feel like a functional how I look at a piece of art highly functioning sculpt. I smile when I'm in it
*  It makes me feel different when I'm in my Tesla. I'm like, this is a badass motherfucking piece of invention
*  But I'm just still in your own head. It's a piece of plastic. It's this you know, it's plastic and glass and metal and it's beautiful
*  It's amazing. It's spectacular innovate, but it it will never be art. Are you in it? What do you have an ass?
*  I have the yeah the p100d. Yeah, it's a sign the back seat
*  No, don't why the noise coming out of that third point shoulder seatbelt retractor is so unacceptable
*  Literally the shits coming up through the plastic wheel well and like a noise and a cold breeze is hitting your
*  Outboard ear and I'm like, okay breeze. How did this shit happen?
*  There's a damn draft that comes up through there and you're hearing road noise through it
*  It's you're hearing road noise through the seat belt through the cavity the whole which really?
*  Yeah, the retractor spool sits and air gets in there next time you're too stoned to drive
*  You sit in the back seat. Let mama drive and report back. You send me a text. It's that annoying
*  It did for for guys like us dare. I go out on a limb and say us. Yes, it'll annoy the piss out of you
*  Interesting that car thing you didn't have a call in number one. Elon was here. I would have chewed his ass about that
*  Would you that one thing?
*  Fuck is this?
*  He already knows who this asshole is years ago. I developed a concept that I called the Haley. Oh, I don't know if you ever saw that
*  So I love like design challenges. I like framing things right so I was like, alright
*  Let's do a revisionist history approach to car design
*  So what if electric cars had remained predominant in the late 1800s early 1900s?
*  What if we had taken inspiration from?
*  aircraft design a couple decades prior to when the industry actually did and then what if after he did the
*  experimental plane the h2 I think it was
*  What if Howard Hughes had sat in down and like he couldn't get that last starlet to?
*  Go out with him right before he lost his mind completely
*  What if he buck minister Fuller and Gordon Bureig sat down and did a napkin sketch after too many martinis?
*  What would that car look like? So that was my stupid pile of questions around which I framed my design
*  and I designed it to work on the at the time and p85 platform and
*  Basically
*  I received a copy of a letter that's titled like peanut butter and chocolate that was written by Elon's core engineering team
*  Begging him to allow them to support me to do the build and like since day one Mike my launch was I don't need
*  Your money I'll go to the dealership. I'll buy the damn car
*  I need y'all's back in support on the software because they're super shitty about any repurposed or I'm sure
*  Teslas and Elon never addressed it was like that gentleman right there with the glasses the larger bobblehead. That's
*  Wow, I know we just did a speaking panel together in Texas recently. That's his major beef with Tesla
*  He he's bought a couple of them and piece. Yeah, they're back together
*  They cock block them. Yeah, they cock block them left and right. They won't let them supercharge
*  But it's six about in the last two or three quarters. There's been major gains
*  Thing honestly, I think due to rich and due to the community that rose up around him that shits been hacked now
*  Really? Oh, yeah
*  Now people can open source hack the can data chain and people are repurposing Tesla components like I use Tesla batteries
*  But I haven't been using their motors or planetaries or anything else because again
*  What do I tell my client when the client needs an update or a part you go to the right?
*  They're like what's your VIN?
*  I
*  But yeah like
*  Stealthy V in fact has this new setup that they just started marketing where you literally
*  Take that IRS apart where the electric motors built in there's a little access door
*  You pull out a little circuit board you put in another one and voila
*  Is there a setup like crate engines where you know or do you envision a setup where because you know
*  The new Hummer is now going to be an electric vehicle, which is really interesting
*  Yeah
*  And there's going to be a bunch of other electric vehicles that are coming out from Volkswagen that are really cheap and a bunch different
*  Companies are jumping in do you envision there being some sort of a crate engine option for people that might I do I do and I
*  Think there should be now
*  Proof in the pudding to this point is that everyone's focusing on the do-it-yourself market
*  Therefore also on the cheapest possible equation which leaves a lot of in my opinion a lot of safety issues completely
*  Unaddressed and they can get downright nutty
*  So the other issue is they're all for ease of installation and conversion
*  everyone's thinking about doing kits that literally are a
*  spud plate and a short shaft to go where the engine used to be put an electric motor to a bell housing adapter to the stock
*  transmission which is stupid because
*  Electric cars going through manual transmissions. There's a lot of scavenging of energy
*  It's bad enough to go through a ring and pinion doing a right angle gear displacement of power
*  You lose so much efficiency and the best EVs in my opinion are transmission lists or go through planetary
*  Said, you know for gear reduction like that. The Merc is the to my knowledge the first sort of retrofit EV
*  That you know, I being the goober that I am like I was like, okay
*  We've done a couple of EV builds, but if we're gonna keep doing them like I want to do them our way
*  Like I want to I want more safety. I want more performance. I want more range
*  I want dedicated thermal management networks for the batteries the controllers the motors and all that and none of it existed
*  How long did that bill take? Oh god for
*  Yeah, just a little bit over four years
*  And at the scale of technology shits changing so quickly in the EV space
*  That as we were building it suppliers of key components came out with another generation that's
*  infinitely better than the
*  V1 or v3 already had so even before we could finish that car
*  We were backing up and updating and updating and updating which really if you put sort of a marketeer hat on
*  I'm so proud of the value retention in my vehicles and I'm proud of our foundation of
*  Taking something that in essence a lot of people would think is that the end of its already usable life cycle
*  And up cycling it and breathing new life, so it's good to go for decades again
*  but now with EV stuff is moving so quickly that
*  Am I am I like making iPhones all the sudden so in two years?
*  It's totally worthless because the tech is outdated that is the weird thing about tech right is that the exponential growth and improvement
*  It just makes yeah, like no one wants an iPhone one right they're useless
*  So look at you know internal combustion engine development cycles what I put in today is still relevant in a decade
*  But with with electric it's a whole new space to consider
*  So a em is like well known in in racing and aftermarket for engine management electronics
*  They just at pri and at SEMA made a fair bit of noise about coming out with a full array of
*  Ev retrofit conversion system so they seem to be the first ones entering the field that are gonna offer a comprehensive
*  suite of products and solutions
*  But then again being that it's part of this industry. You know I go grill the dudes at their trade show booth, and they're like
*  well, it's
*  something we're
*  Working on you know does all these press releases and all that I'm like paperware. Tell me some shit
*  I
*  Think I trust it will come out
*  But when you see Elon coming out with like that new roadster is gonna have a 600 mile range
*  That is when things get really interesting in Volkswagen claimed with that vehicle that you noted earlier that they were gonna make the platform
*  Shareable and they were gonna make it available to many different manufacturers large and small
*  But I've heard stories like that over the years from you name it from Faraday was claiming the same thing and
*  So much of its bullshit because now it's it's like I don't want to say vaporware, but it's it's so much of that like
*  VC money don't worry. We'll be profitable one day and we're worth a billion multiple of nothing today
*  So buy in and then it's like so many of these EV startups and retrofit companies come to the scene looking for that
*  Elusive FedEx fleet contract that everyone thinks is gonna be easy to get and none of them get it and then the algo belly up
*  You know, so I just think we're at that point in history
*  Where not only is the tech moving forward so quickly and not only that but the likes of
*  Predominantly only due to Tesla. It's proven the viability in the market now
*  There's purists and traditionalists and everyone's starting to poke at it and I see exponential more interest
*  So I think you know for the next five years or so, it's gonna be a bit tumultuous
*  But I definitely think it's the future of hot rodding. I
*  Imagine within five years. I imagine probably half of my client builds will be electric Wow, that's a big
*  That's a big statement. Well, I'm totally pulling it out of yeah booty
*  But that that's the vibe that I get have you seen there's a 68 Porsche
*  911 that has a Tesla engine in it. Yeah, is that the one EV West?
*  I don't know who build it
*  Scamming through scanning through in Instagram the other day and I saw it a green
*  68
*  That's that's very interesting when they do stuff like that to old cars
*  But and there's so many guys springing up out of the woodwork
*  Yeah, like nationwide to various levels of price expectation range expectation, etc
*  But I think that's a really it's a lovely community too. I've noticed it's much more open than the conventional
*  automotive
*  Community is about sharing information and suppliers and knowledge and helping one another and it's there's a really nice camaraderie
*  Within that community. There's like movement motors and Austin's doing really nice retrofits and oh, yeah, Evie West has been around forever
*  They're really the granddaddies on the scene and you know
*  Motors in Austin did they the ones that did that Mustang?
*  I think they've done a staying they just finished doing a 2002 BMW. They did a early GTV alpha
*  They've done all sorts of different like pretty cool diverse range of platforms and then of course
*  Z electric down in Orange County that started out doing just the bugs now the bugs in the buses and now 9-elevens
*  And it's like there's such a large and welcoming kind cool community of people in that space now when you charge a Tesla
*  It's easy, you know, you look for the Tesla superchargers
*  They're all over the place you press a button on your screen and it shows you where they are
*  It'll navigate you to them when you try to get one of those you can't charge a regular car at a Tesla super
*  Station, can you know and there's different so there's this standard
*  I forget the anacron we could call rich the J blah blah blah connector
*  But there's a standard municipal connector and then there's also the new fast charge network
*  But it depends on where you live. But for example around here, it's a joke. They're everywhere
*  so like I have an app when I'm driving that 49 Merc and you know, I was
*  Speaking at Barrett Jackson and had it there in town for while I was visiting and there you network the apps and you find it
*  But we made that one
*  Supercharger compatible because the clients gonna install one in his house and bunk the system
*  Otherwise you try and go to a public Tesla charger. It has to do a handshake and it says no
*  You may not charge here. So you can have it supercharger compatible for like I have one on the wall back there
*  Yeah, my car so it would work with that. Yes. That's my understanding but not a public in
*  Installation those have to go through a whole handshake protocol
*  Yeah, it's interesting that you decided to do it that way
*  Well, it's fun. We put one behind the front license plate
*  So we do one of those old-school articulating plates like remember on the gas
*  On the plate so that has the one interface connector and then the other one I machine this
*  Unnecessarily groovy sort of gas cap under the original fuel door on the Merc and then that's for the other style charger
*  So do you oh so you could charge it with different ones?
*  Supercharger is one depending on to increase the versatility of it
*  You had a supercharger fast charge compatibility and then you had the more widely distributed
*  municipal format charger and then there's just two different pigtail adapters so you can go either way with it
*  Do you anticipate upping the range on that thing? Do you think that someday you swap the batteries out?
*  Definitely. I think the reality is any EV project I build I have to not only do I anticipate but like I've lost many clients because I'll be
*  super
*  blunt about making managing their
*  Expectations that look you're gonna spend a lot of money to have me do this and trust
*  I will geek out and do the best of the state of the art that is available to us
*  But in a year that might all be garbage
*  Yeah
*  So you have to understand either you're cool with this moment in time and the range in the performance and is what it is or you're
*  A tech geek like most guys that are engaging in that and you're gonna be harming money
*  Then coming back every couple years for us to upgrade and evolve as the sciences evolve
*  But you know we build on the submodular even like your Broncos submodularly built
*  So your powertrain the electrical network for your powertrain goes to a two single Deutsch tech
*  26 pin connectors aerospace connectors
*  So one day when that powertrain is no longer relevant, but your truck still has good platform value
*  Unplug that yank it out and put in the hydrogen or the micro capacitor or whatever the hell's working at the time
*  Do you remember the bloom boxes no really what is it? That's been thinking about them lately
*  I remember seeing them on 60 minutes years ago, and I think Google headquarters was powered by one
*  What does there were these funky little black boxes that had some chemical process of creating energy?
*  And they were like early on massive news
*  Promising tech and they're super groovy little simple boxes and they originally did it for like campuses and military like large
*  Large
*  Installations for you know multiple
*  Complexes and stuff how they work, then they were also making them for automotive, and they had a prototype. I was so excited
*  I don't remember. It's been years, but it was some sort of I think it was a ionic transfer process that went through a series of
*  Elements within the shielded box to create the energy, but they were like self-sustaining and super groovy
*  It's called a bloom box
*  anything
*  What's in there, and I don't know what happened with them they went belly-up or someone
*  Yeah, so that 60 minutes so that was powering Google at one point those things and what's inside?
*  And I think Stanford was getting into it. I don't know major mental flashback for me even that I'm remembering it
*  It's just one of those things that seems so promising that then went bye-bye
*  Same with like toroidal engines there was a great engineer up in Lodi that was revisiting toroidals
*  And he had a he had a Ford Focus that would do is like his daughter's old car with a blown-up motor
*  He had his own toroidal motor that he had developed that could run from the energy in the charged particles in the air
*  What this thing did like 15 miles an hour on a flat test track?
*  running on air
*  Charged particles in the air yes
*  Ionically charged particles as the technology improved that 15 miles an hour could be a real speed yeah, wow
*  Yeah, and then that same guy I saw him once at a trade show
*  And I was exhibiting at the show as well so as they're on set up day as bored out of my gourd
*  We were I was already set up in the Ford booth, so it's walking around sort of sniffing around and see this trippy
*  Scientist guy in his lab coat and this shitty little booth
*  It was like you know six by ten foot booth
*  And you know at a show where people have like 200 by 60 foot booth
*  He's got this odd little toroidal thing and then a bigger toroidal thing and literally like a chalkboard
*  So I'm like dude. What's going on?
*  So start talking about he starts explaining the technology and what he was doing and like the smaller one at 300 foot pounds of torque
*  The larger one had 2000 and he was looking to develop it for rail cars for semis for
*  Cars like and on and on and on he's like yeah
*  The biggest problem is stopping it once it gets going because the toroidal structure meant that the compression cycle
*  From you know 12 to 2 of that first cylinder was such that
*  When the combustion occurred and it propelled the next piston into the next combustion cycle and kept going
*  So getting that power out of the central crank was a challenge and then how to stop the damn thing was like the bigger challenge
*  But they'd run on like horse piss
*  Ionic charge particles
*  Diesel gas like didn't even need spark plugs, so I'm like blown away by this I go back the next day
*  Where'd he go?
*  Booth gone empty done, and I had the guys info
*  Try to reach out to him website gone website. I'd looked at the night before gone got gobbled up
*  Five years later. I see him again at another trade show with another kick-ass design and man was he a bitter man
*  It's like yeah never again because they bought it and they shelved it. I'm never selling anything again fuck them
*  I'm licensing to specific channels of applications, and that's it his new product
*  So what do you think happen if you're a conspiracy theorist do you think someone bought him out and just oh, I'm a
*  Small independent business owner real realist in that hell yes someone didn't like that and they shelved that shit
*  So they bought it and then just shelved it yep, so his next product
*  Yeah, you don't know and he was very cagey about it
*  Then he had another product where you would replace the alternator in your car with a generator
*  And you had a small battery in the vehicle right so this is a retrofit system
*  the retail model was brilliant because you'd have like a pretty cheesy and expensive three axis mill a
*  Shit ton of CAD files and one product on the shelf so in a lightweight car
*  It was like an electric supercharger, so you'd replace your alternator, and it had a toothed cog
*  For the pulley and then your crank pulley would add a tooth cog to it and then tooth belt
*  So the idea was it would assist the internal combustion engine through its compression cycle
*  It would negate the parasitic load of all the fiat all the front engine accessory drive mounted things
*  You know your alternator small pump or whatever
*  By pushing the engine through the cycle with the captured electrical energy from the deceleration
*  Whoa and then in bigger cars it gave you like passes this and range
*  Increase and did great things for MPG and then the story I got on that one was BMW
*  Put them under a big contract for it to license it and use it and then the guy disappeared off the face planet again
*  Jesus Christ this guy
*  Shit happens. Do you remember there was a video that was?
*  Circulating many years ago about a guy who created a car to run on air
*  Hmm no excuse me water you get created a car that runs on water
*  And then this car that ran on water, I mean he apparently had a viable engine, and it was really working and
*  Then he he had a heart attack and as he was dying he was saying they killed me they killed me and
*  Then he died
*  Nobody heard from the water engine again, but
*  He's from Columbus to
*  Shit happens, and I don't even like the term conspiracy
*  because I think that's something created by the machine to negate things that are disruptive and
*  innovative so we can put them in a little box and call it a
*  Conspiracy theory or whatever and yes therefore it never happened well anyone who doesn't believe in conspiracy theories
*  I say look at Jeffrey Epstein. Yeah, it's real clear
*  Myers said that his invention could do what physicists say is impossible
*  Turn water into hydrogen fuel efficiently enough to drive his dune buggy cross-country on 20 gallons straight from the tap
*  He took a sip of cranberry juice, then he grabbed his neck bolted out the door dropped to his knees and vomited violently
*  I ran outside and asked him. What's wrong his brother Stefan Meyer?
*  Recalled he said they poisoned me that was his dying declaration
*  That's fucked up. That's fucked up. I
*  Don't know if it's true. He might have been nuts
*  And or both or both. I mean you know that's another thing like we like to just call people nuts and write them off
*  You know some of the greatest innovators
*  You know throughout the history of mankind have been a little off the rocker and Nikola Tesla was in love with
*  Yeah, he's in love with a story. Yeah his final days man in that well
*  There's a story that I read that I'm trying I've tried to substantiate that apparently he was
*  he was so frustrated by sexual desires and a
*  Love affair that he had and the distraction that it presented that he in quotes destroyed his sexuality
*  I do not know what that means
*  I gotta say man. I'm kind of tired of my penis still ruling my brain. You know at 50
*  It's like I wouldn't mind to be able to take it off and leave it at home
*  Well, no, I mean just like enough already like
*  You know I get it. Yeah, I mean I turn it on turn it off as needed and when appropriate
*  Like I don't want to be walking around like maybe have a hip switch
*  It's like something you could just oh like set it aside and become a eunuch for a little bit
*  These make it useful make it like a GoPro mount or something
*  Yeah, I see what you're saying. There's there's a lot of
*  Innovation that does sort of get swept aside that you wonder like there's a documentary who killed the electric car. Yeah
*  again, and
*  Really interesting cat the guy who?
*  Produced and developed. Yeah lovely guy. Yeah, I don't know who he is
*  But that is another example of you know that was an innovation that was a little bit ahead of its time
*  And the powers that be were like fuck you. Yeah, we're not ready for it. Yeah, and that goes way back
*  I mean you know this have you heard of the the Selden patent very interesting no of American
*  Transportation history this prick named Selden was one of the richest people in the country because he was like one of your early patent trolls
*  Who like sat back one day went?
*  You know we got these horse carriages, and then we got these new motor things and you know at some point
*  There could be a horseless carriage
*  So we like literally did like a chicken scratch bullshit drawing and filed it and got awarded the patent
*  So Henry Ford and his first two companies as well as the Dodge Brothers all the early pioneers in the transportation
*  Sector in the US had to pay this prick a massive royalty to even produce the vehicle
*  And it was Henry when he read when he after he went down and under and he goes reborn and came back out with Ford
*  Motor company the second time that he said you know what fuck him fuck that
*  I'm not paying this shit, and it was like eight years of court battles to overrule it in the National Automotive Dealers Association
*  Originally didn't want any trouble and everyone was paying and Henry was the one who had the gall and the balls to say no
*  No, we should not pay this prick, and they finally got it kicked out
*  But they say that hindered innovation and transportation for a good decade wow
*  No, I didn't know about that
*  It was only the electric starter the Magneto starter that Henry Ford integrated into his cars that really made
*  The massive shift away from
*  predominance of electric cars to internal combustion so when you flash forward and you look at
*  Mr.. Payne's film who killed the electric car, and you look at Firestone and who was it?
*  Pacific oil, but it was oil company a tire company
*  They created that bus company, and then they did all the lobbying to privatize municipal transport
*  So that then they could slowly buy them all up and you know California had an incredibly successful
*  Electric trolley system through the west side it was brilliant. It was pioneering was ahead everyone
*  They're the ones that ended up stacked in the desert some of that footage in the film
*  Yeah, because they were not going to sell tires or oil if this shit goes down, so let's tank it
*  Yeah, they do that yeah, they will buy a company that's doing amazing
*  Yeah, and then just put it on the shelf. Do you remember that early?
*  Ford cars the early Ford cars were made with hemp all of his fenders and everything were made with hemp and there's a video of him
*  taking a hammer and
*  bag a sledge and banging it off the fenders and it shows you the insane
*  Durability that hemp fibers have have you ever seen that yeah, but he never that never made it into production right?
*  I think that was a wartime shortage
*  R&D effort same thing was stainless you ever seen any of the prototype a couple of them still exist, but stainless
*  Yeah, so Ford. I think it was the 37 Tudor
*  it was a
*  61
*  Maybe T bird was the newest and there was a third one
*  That the entire body is made out of stainless
*  And there's so badass and then GM did one during World War two during the metal shortage time
*  entire plexiglass Buick sedan in it sold an auction recently and I
*  Plexiglass like I was so fucking tempted yeah, so the entire body is clear like you see through the doors
*  You see the window regulators the locks all know everything it is so badass
*  And it sold for what didn't seem like an absurd it was like 180 200 grand
*  So actually can you google that image it's a
*  plexiglass prototype
*  Buick I think it was hopefully we'll find it super super nifty
*  Wow, um I know that
*  What is the company
*  Lotus Lotus developed a
*  Hemp fiber car they did like an anniversary one of their
*  What is it a stage or whatever the fuck it is there it is there it is to the left Wow
*  One more over yeah, look at that. That's insane. Are you kidding me?
*  Fucking cool
*  Apparently it cracked and proved not to be viable so I'm never made a passion
*  But just as like a sculpture to have you in your man cave the thing is so bad
*  Yeah, really cool. I like there's all the is that safety bracing on the doors structural bracing on the doors
*  I also for a while like I wanted to do there was a
*  Dow Corning and somebody else there was a big consortium that was doing a bio derivative molded plastic concepts
*  So like for your city trash cans and stuff and the durability in the life cycles and everything were epic
*  And I was thinking for a while like how bad ass would it be invest all the money in the platform of the vehicular engineering?
*  And then make the body literally
*  By design almost disposable
*  So when it's at the end of its life cycle it literally could turn into mulch and go on the ground and be totally neutral
*  right or more interestingly more liberating for a consumer and a designer like
*  Let's say that same platform you had you could have like a dune buggy style like okay
*  I'm gonna take it out to the desert and we're gonna go elk hunting or whatever the hell you're gonna do that weekend
*  right and you want like a buggy trucky style or
*  You know, we're doing construction at the house and we're gonna use it for you know, hauling soil or whatever
*  So you could have like modular bodies and different applications used on the same platform, but all bio derivative materials
*  I think that'd be super cool
*  Well, I've always wondered why someone didn't but besides Lotus didn't make another hemp bodied car because you know Corvette still use
*  Plexiglass or fiberglass for all their cars, but hemp is far superior
*  It is and you it's another one of those things like why isn't yeah moving forward?
*  Someone make maybe you should do it. Maybe we should make like a
*  69 Corvette but make all the panels redo them in hemp fiber hate to say it
*  But you're going up against the petrochemical industry and I do not want to be that for you
*  Sure, I mean all the you just make a little interest in plastics. You know, if you're just rebuilding something
*  Do you really think that it would be that big of a deal?
*  like they would come after you if like if you took all the body panels off and by the way would probably so much stronger if
*  You watch the video of see if you can find that video of Henry Ford banging the hammer off of
*  Delight he didn't lie the video people that putting out the video lied. I guess is what this article says
*  What does it say the angry historian wrote a big blog about it dug through it?
*  That seems to be a prototype as he was saying and it was probably plastic. It might have been some hemp in there
*  But it wasn't even some binder. Maybe
*  It wasn't even 50% hemp. Well, how does he know that?
*  He did digging through all the places that this that the information came from
*  40s and all the places that they were talking about making angry historians pretty balls out serious when he was in statement
*  He does his homework interesting. I had a friend who had a stock of hemp
*  You know
*  one of those the base of a hemp tree
*  On his desk and he's like pick that up and I picked it up and I it looks like
*  Like a piece of oak like it looks like it looks like a really like and we feel it
*  It's really hard, but it's really light
*  It's the weirdest plant like if I don't have you ever held a piece of hemp like a hemp stalk
*  It's like an alien plant. It doesn't seem to make any sense
*  Yeah, and it's properties and its structure is so unique and there's so many benefits to it for sure
*  Yeah, I would think I mean see if you find that lotus the hemp lotus
*  They had it where the front stripe down the center was clear coat
*  So you could see the actual hemp fiber in the in the lotus, but no one's ever done anything
*  I mean they still make Corvettes out of plastic. I'm still making them out of fiberglass
*  I would think that that would be like a real
*  Straightforward approach especially now that hemp is legalized and you can grow it in the United States and most states
*  I think it's federally legal. Yeah, I you know I for my leather goods like this jacket is all hemp threat
*  Really super strong. Oh, yeah better than anything
*  So that stripe down the middle is all the clear coat natural hemp fiber
*  So that whole car is made out of hemp
*  What the hell's lotus doing these days like they keep coming out with all these concepts and prototypes
*  But then nothing ever seems to be actually happening or coming out. I don't know they had that little car
*  You know I guess it's that one is that the one the really little one that they had
*  And I feel the Elise I drove it one day
*  I was like what would you have a fucking parrot chipmunks running the the engine with a like a one of those hamster wheels
*  But then even like last year at the quail
*  We were up there showing a car. They debuted a concept that was lovely. It was kick-ass, but from what I heard
*  What's his name Bajar?
*  they're making such a
*  disgusting amount of money and
*  Licensing like keychains and bullshit that like the core even the engineering tier one engineering aspect of Lotus
*  And then the production they're like fuck that that's complicated wait a minute. They make their money off of keychains
*  Yeah, from what I've been told that's what's kept Lotus in business over the last 10 years Lotus keychains kid
*  Just merch just whatever watches Merc's
*  Bags
*  Whatever shit that anyone wants to put the Lotus name on where selling licenses left and right, but they're not selling cars. I
*  Don't think they have anything in production right now. That's so weird, and they've shown like more concepts than
*  multinational car companies well
*  I know Matt Farah reviewed that rear engine or the mid-engine one that they have and said it was awesome
*  It's a beautiful car, but you don't see them you never see them
*  Yeah, I think they're one of those interesting companies that like
*  Kind of like a Malcolm Bricklin situation of like just that Malcolm Bricklin
*  So one of the best car books ever that John you know Johnny Lieberman, right?
*  Johnny's dear friend Johnny had recommended. It's called the worst car ever built and it's the story of the
*  Hugo oh
*  It's a fast read it is absolutely hysterical the shenanigans and shit show around that car
*  And behind all of it was Malcolm Bricklin who's like the PT Barnum of the automotive industry the amount of
*  stories and stuff this guy has lived through and caused and gotten away with is insane but like
*  Hugo the cars were like late
*  They were gonna debut at the LA Auto Show and they realized like oh shit. We don't have booth models or anything
*  What are we gonna do so Malcolm Bricklin in the story goes that he drove around downtown LA and just where the prostitutes where the
*  whores hang out around here went over and like
*  Hired a bunch of the girls to like could you put on something a little more tame and like be here at this time
*  For these days and to like run the show and be their booth models and rep the cars
*  But like the cars as they came out of the container had disassembled themselves in transit like
*  Just on and on and on
*  Shenanigans hysterical, but that book is so fucking funny. I've never heard of that before that's interesting
*  I would think that for a guy like you who's building cars the way you're building them the real challenge would be staff
*  Yes, I think that would be the real challenge is finding people that understand what you're doing finding fellow artisans
*  That also understand how to build cars that really get what you're doing. Yep that and I
*  Love the state of California, but they do not want me here. How so they don't want me in business
*  They don't want anyone in California making anything except maybe solar assisted bicycles
*  I did the business climate in the state of California and the associated HR costs and
*  Insurance and workmen's comp and liabilities like every couple weeks
*  There's another absurd ruling that we get an update on that like wait what it's like
*  You mean to tell me if I catch a dude smoking crack while on the clock
*  Stealing my inventory. I can't fire his ass on the spot. Nope. What oh, yeah
*  Now if you do you have to give him a week's pay at the time of letting him go and you can't make him sign
*  Anything that indemnifies nor protects you you have to put them on probation and offer therapy and resources
*  No, you don't yeah
*  Stealing merchandise and smoking crack like literally the most vagrant
*  Disrespect of safety of policy of company goods like it has gotten so bad and like we just got a letter from the from the
*  Building inspector came by and he's like, yeah
*  You know those those automotive lifts in your building. I'm like, yeah, he goes. Yeah, you have 30 days to remove all those
*  What thank you. That was pretty much my response
*  Because yeah, you're not zoned for automotive I'm like you see this plaque on the wall the congressman
*  Councilman and the mayor you see this picture of me and the mayor when he did the ribbon cutting
*  Here's the email record showing the mayor's aid personally delivered me all my occupancy permits because yeah, not my problem
*  I'm like, what about the last nine years of inspectors coming in all the time saying you guys have the cleanest most professional
*  Above board shop kick-ass. Well done. Thank you so much for making my life good. He goes the other idiots
*  I'm the new inspector
*  So the new inspector says you're not licensed
*  I'm not zoned appropriately to be in business where I'm at despite having permits and everything for it
*  Did they change the zoning? I don't know what the hell happened
*  Other than this new guy seems to be a prick and wanting to show his value. What's his name? I
*  Actually don't remember
*  But I literally at every turn it's killing me and like I've piece of shit
*  I think at this point to the amount of cost related per employee
*  Should be going to my employees not to insurance companies and all this bullshit that gets tagged on top
*  It's like for every dollar you pay someone now. There's another 32 cents that should be going to them
*  That's going to suckers tell what they want you to do. How do they expect you to work in these cars? Oh
*  Is this something you can fight or you gonna actually I had to lawyer up and we're fighting it
*  but I mean literally I I honestly think they'd rather have a
*  Commercial weed facility in that building kicking out a hell of a lot more tax revenue than us really
*  Do you think that's what they're doing? Yes, so you really think they're trying to make it
*  Challenging for you to do business so that you quit. Yes, and just about any small business owner
*  I know in the state of California the challenges we're facing are getting to the point of making us
*  Wonder about our own intellect for staying in the state. I don't want to move. I don't want to go anywhere
*  I don't want to I love it here. So what would you do with this if you lose this?
*  You know if it gets to the point that we have to oh you mean this building situation
*  Yeah, I'll fight it or a move and I'll deal I've been through this shit for a while
*  You find someplace where you are zone. Yeah, just keep partying on but I know I'm zone fine where I'm at
*  I'm just gonna have to be you know instead of running a business
*  I have to now become a lobbyist and you know
*  Knock on doors and ring phones and dig through my black book to find people with the clout to get the city to go
*  So this is flexing like what is this? I think so and at first he seemed like he chilled out when we went above him and then
*  Everything was good and then a week later bubbled back up again, and we got another notice
*  So we're in the middle of it right now, but you went above his head and you got approval
*  Verbal verbal yeah, and then I said yeah, I don't know what he's talking about. You're fine. You're good to go and
*  Then you go back again. We know it's a problem. He said what in the fuck that's crazy
*  But look at the end of the day the reality is also I'm going against what trade schools are telling young kids that are
*  Going into the field. What are they telling kids?
*  They're telling kids that here if you run this scan tool
*  You'll be you'll make 150 grand a year as a lead tech at a BMW dealership
*  What they're not telling these kids while sucking all their money out of them with crazy
*  You know student loans and stuff is yeah
*  That's like the kids in the street in Brazil all wanting to grow up to be pay lay
*  There's not that many pay lays so there's plenty of dudes at that dealership that are making minimum wage or thereabouts
*  Or dealing with the politics of flag hours or whatever
*  But what what I'm having a hard time with is we charge $100 an hour for our labor. I
*  Can't just keep charging more and more and more at the level of what we do with projects that can run thousands of hours per job
*  The math is it almost doesn't make sense like I honestly have guys that I think should be I should be paying them
*  70 80 90 100 grand a year to do what they do because they're artists and they deserve it the
*  Bullshit of running a business in California all of the exponential costs that are added on top even
*  De-incentivize overtime now if I give a dude overtime
*  It ups his tax rate and they take even more out of the overtime
*  Well is whatever happened to like GDP and employment and productivity and like keeping everything rolling. They're
*  De-incentivizing us even to offer our employees more money with more hours
*  It's it's tragic and I've lost several guys now that have gone to do
*  Jobs that they hate but like I department of water and power
*  I've lost several employees at DWP because they'll they get a pension they get killer healthcare
*  They get 90 grand a year to pick their nose and watch other people work
*  Well sucks, what is this? Is this a Democrat thing? I
*  Think it might be the uber green side of
*  Democratic because I think the old whatever the old two-party systems a shit show as it is
*  Anyway, I don't think it's about which party so much is I think we've empowered attorneys to such an extent that it's it's downright
*  Sinful because it's hindering industry
*  It's hindering innovation
*  There's just so many constrictions because everyone has their hand out no one's no one's
*  Self-accountable, but everyone's liable. So then you you know, then you need a policy for that
*  And so that I mean we had a we had an employee once Sue as he jumped in a dumpster
*  To stomp on everything to compress it in the dumpster. It started moving across the
*  Ramped parking lot and he jumped out of it clipped his leg on the way down and shattered his arm in four spots
*  Well, he sued me and it's like well, it's not in your job description
*  Did someone tell you to jump in the dumpster and stomp on it?
*  No, and then we discover the guy had embrittled bones due to chemical agent exposure in the military, but it's my problem
*  like what
*  People whatever happened to like be proud of what you do be respected be well paid
*  Everyone's content everyone's like inspired and engaged and I just feel like more and more there's just so much noise and
*  Lawyers and policies all this crap. It's like we're just here to like do something
*  We love and get rewarded and pay people. I mean, I'm stoked that you know, we support directly
*  58 families plus all our sublets and everything else
*  But it's it's hard to retain people when when we we know we can't pay them what they're worth
*  In this business environment. I have a really hard time with the whole crack thing
*  Catching someone stealing smoking crack and you can't fire them
*  That seems so strange. You have to give them a week's worth of money
*  Yeah on the spot on the spot. So you have to cut him a check. This is getting so stupid
*  That seems that seems and you ought to offer them therapy. I
*  Mean to be clear I didn't do that. Yeah
*  But I tell you man more and more surf shack with like my own little garden out back and my little leather studio and
*  Sell shit on Instagram simplify life
*  Me my wife and my dogs. I know what you're saying my own one-bay garage, but you know Jamie's Montana
*  We've been dealing with cancer, you know, my wife got diagnosed with cancer last year and we've been in the throes of
*  Chemo and dealing with that whole shit show you want to talk about something that puts everything in a perspective
*  Yeah, you know, we really made a stop and sit back and go okay
*  All right
*  That doesn't fucking matter like a lot of the bullshit a lot of the noise in our modern world does not
*  Matter doesn't mean a fucking thing. So that kind of
*  reinvigorated but also refresh my perspective to remind myself is someone's panties are in there not because
*  Their icons been in storage for six months
*  They didn't plug it into the tender and the batteries dead and they want to call and yell at me about it
*  They think yeah, like like give me your bank info. I'll send your money back. Oh
*  Well, no, that does not what okay then why are we interfacing like this? You have a dead battery
*  They haven't been there for six months, dude. That's what happens pick your bow
*  Well, that's why the icon has real easy way to remove the battery post right and an integrated tender
*  If you click that box on the fucking configurator, yeah
*  Well, there's a lot of silly people out there for sure, but it's just weird when they're empowered by the government
*  well, you know when you don't have a
*  Common sense approach to knuckleheads, you know
*  If you got a guy smoking crack and stealing things
*  You're not supposed to reward that kind of behavior with a week's paycheck
*  Yeah, it's like the you know, the homeless challenge that we're facing
*  And you know when we try and address that in my opinion when that's addressed on a state level
*  It's gonna fucking fail because then you're gonna overburden that state
*  Even if they're innovative and brilliant in their solution then the whole country tilts to that state and they all come a sliding over
*  Yeah
*  And then the one in Venice that is like super nasty low occupancy level because the homeless are like wait a minute
*  There's a curfew and there's drug tests. Screw you. I want to do whatever I want
*  I want to smoke what I want to smoke and do it's like no
*  So Joe, I'm running for office. Oh, this is my platform. I'm announcing right here
*  Catalina
*  Catalina kind of sucks. Have you been there? It's not the best place. Okay, so how about this move to the homeless people to Catalina?
*  Yes, I want to live there though
*  No, you go there no, I'm not asking oh we were Republican
*  I'm nothing but you go there
*  You contribute to that social system
*  Will give you you know seed money and development free internet for all free and you actually start
*  Producing something of value to society and get your shit together and come back home
*  Then we'll send the ferry over and we'll bring you back to the prison for homeless people. Yeah, what do you think?
*  How they gonna get food?
*  Air drop grow your shit. There's enough bison to feed them for a couple
*  It's not gonna work
*  That's that idea. So I'd also my other platform would be you cannot
*  Evoke the law in your defense in the process of breaking the law like when your stories like a friend of mine
*  NFL player called a dude breaking into his car like
*  He's in the gym and looking out the window and sees like legs hanging out the passenger window of his BMW
*  He's like motherfucker. He runs down there
*  He literally grabs a dude by the ankles and yanks him out of their car
*  Blows the guy's jaw out knocks his teeth out on and on and on my friend ended up getting sued for that and ended up
*  Liable and owing this prick a bunch of money like really but he was in the middle of breaking the law and stealing the guy's property
*  You should not have a California thing
*  Texas they don't give a fuck that was California. You should go to Texas
*  Yeah, Austin's looking better and better Austin looks pretty good
*  I some buddies with some shops in Austin and barbecue from my friends that the barbecue have a kick-ass barbecue
*  Yeah, it's a great place in front of me. If someone's breaking your car. You can just shoot them sweet. Sign me up
*  I mean, I don't think you should shoot them, but you could
*  You know, I'm not advocating shooting people for breaking in the foot and then run over and would you feel better with that?
*  Well, I feel like if you break into a former NFL players
*  BMW and he catches you you should get your fucking ass kicked. Yeah, totally big giant man
*  Yeah, I mean that's that's how you learn how to come in to not break into someone's car
*  That's going back to this lack of accountability. Yes, like well, that's the problem with Democrats
*  That's the problem with this country
*  And then there's a problem with particularly the state the state is so
*  Progressive minded and I'm a progressive. I'm a very open-minded person, but you can't remove
*  Responsibility, you can't remove the consequences for actions. You can't do those things
*  You can't give people participation trophies and that's what you're doing
*  Yeah
*  And I agree with this that attitude that people have by thinking they're being open-minded and kind and nice
*  You are just enabling people to keep fucking up their life by not get an award by showing up
*  They have no consequences and you know, you can't litter right?
*  So how come you can put a fucking tent filled with shit and just park it under the overpass?
*  But if I throw a can of diet coke out my window into that same spot
*  I will I will get a fine and I'll get arrested rightly so but why why can this asshole?
*  Park is fucking tent filled crack there
*  How come you can have cardboard boxes just scattered out all over the place that you sleep on?
*  I don't know what to tell that guy and how to change his life once he's got a tent once you camped out under
*  The overpass that you feel there's a lot of things that have gone wrong get you to that position
*  But what I do know is you shouldn't be allowed to have a fucking tent
*  You shouldn't be allowed of these tent villages under downtown man. He's too much lately in downtown. Yes
*  I went to dinner with the other night in Venice one of the last times I go to dinner for the next couple months
*  I think in a restaurant, but when we went down there, there's a nice house like a beautiful house in Venice across the street
*  There was 50 tents just filled with shit broken bike parts and garbage and just things piled up
*  And you're like this is the problem with being open-minded
*  This is the problem and this is why people like when Rudy Giuliani cleaned up New York City with this totalitarian
*  Approach like the people that live in New York City that that weren't homeless were like fuck. Yeah
*  Finally take these homeless people off the street do this fix that because it make it harder to be a criminal make it more difficult
*  You know in the in the the downside of it a lot of people got arrested
*  That probably shouldn't have a lot of people got frisked that probably shouldn't have a lot of people got harassed
*  They're probably shouldn't have but on the plus side you got to crack a few eggs if you want to make an omelet and they
*  Cleaned up New York City and they cleaned up the homeless problem that they have there
*  I think that's like probably our most vexing modern social challenge. Yes, it's really
*  A mental health care challenge the bottom line is how did you get to that position?
*  Like there's there's many things in the federal negligence. There's that there's you know, the original problem when they changed
*  What what it constitutes to be mentally and captain?
*  Carter administration
*  Yeah, I mean they gave him a bus ticket and send him to LA. Well, that's what they're doing
*  I think they send people all over the country. Everybody likes to do that. They send them the palms frames. Get out
*  Get out what the desert? What am I doing? I'm with you though, man
*  like the restoration of personal accountability like to me my word is everything to me and I'll lose my ass to honor my word if
*  I told you I'm gonna do something to whatever extent I have to go
*  I'm gonna do it cuz it my generation whatever my dad I was raised where that meant everything above
*  Yeah, but more and more like corporations have no conscience and we've that's been encouraged more and more and more, right?
*  So people there's a lack of accountability there all the way through it
*  If your kid even shows up to school, he gets a fucking award
*  Like no, we need to celebrate the leaders the people that really are pushing and going and let them reap the benefits
*  And gains of that and our government should be protecting their energy their efforts their investments
*  intellectual property, but I just feel like it's almost like everyone should
*  Everyone should get something and it's like no, that's not how it really works like never how it works
*  Yeah, it's never been how it works and it can't be how it works
*  It's the whole reason why it's difficult to get out of bed because there's a reward for accomplishing that it's difficult to show up at work
*  But there's a reward for accomplishing that do you think we'd ever exercise do you think we could segment aspects of?
*  Our culture our society meaning do you think it would ever be viable and I'm so politically ignorant
*  So maybe you're just gonna laugh me out of the room
*  Could you socialize?
*  legal defense
*  Education and health care like do you think that would be viable as a hybrid where it's a democracy?
*  It's it's a capitalist driven system
*  But you take the the money therefore the corruption that takes us like the business of medicine versus the art of medicine or completely
*  different things
*  You know now give you a pill so you can live and then we'll give you another pill to deal with the
*  ramifications of the side effects of the pill we gave you versus the cure got fucking shelved
*  You know because there wasn't a rev model behind it. Yeah, do you think we could ever?
*  Would that ever work? I think education and health care for sure can be socialized the questions
*  Would you get the same education the same health care if it wasn't socialized?
*  I think as long as you had private options you would and then the problem is well how much?
*  Funds go towards these public education solutions versus the private options that have the access
*  Yeah, that's that's always gonna be the issue and that's because when people want look
*  If someone is excelling at something whatever that is whether it's teaching or there. It's you know being an orthopedic surgeon
*  They want to be rewarded for their efforts plus. They've probably cured
*  acquired a massive amount of debt right if you're
*  Orthopedic surgeon you've gone through medical school. There's a strong chance that you're deeply in debt by the time you start cutting people and
*  That's a real problem
*  That's a real problem because that also incentivizes them to perform surgeries that are not unnecessary
*  That are unnecessary rather and you find you hear about that all the time
*  I mean there's a lot of doctors that just want to start cutting people you know and they don't have proactive solutions like listen
*  Let's this this might take a long time, but let's let's try to rehabilitate this first. Let's particularly with like back issues
*  It's all gone. Yeah, I remember when I first started having my health issues
*  You know I'm epileptic and when I first started looking into that and they were throwing darts at the wall for a decade
*  I don't know could be this could be that endocrinologist
*  Cardiologists all these different specialists and literally the cardiologist sits me down and it's like okay
*  So here's what here's what life with a pacemaker is like we're gonna do this. I'm like we'll back the fuck up like
*  Show me the math like I'm far from a doctor, but I'm kind of an engineering guy
*  So like show me the math like this is a result of that which causes that as indicated by this therefore
*  We're gonna do this couldn't it's like well
*  We just figure you know it's probably a safe measure
*  I'm like so you haven't even seen anything that clearly defines that that's even the issue and you're fuck you
*  I'm out of here like well. He's dealing with 15 people a day. Yeah, he's probably exhausted
*  Well, he's got a big note. Yeah big loan and mm-hmm and also a little desensitized
*  They get desensitized to people struggle, and you know did you you and I talked about this, but did you look into?
*  Ketogenic diets did you ever look into the idea of ketogenic diets and how it benefits?
*  Epilepsy I did just to the extent of doing some Google research promptly after our discussion
*  And I also was looking into
*  Medical marijuana approaches to it, but again the beautiful state of California is such that I lose my license
*  If I don't take the chemicals that big pharma promote because they do biannual blood tests
*  So even if test you for those chemicals. Oh, they do blood tests to make sure you're on the shit, but that's well
*  Is that just assuming there's no way to cure epilepsy correct that seems insane
*  Yes, especially with all the proof in the CDB
*  CBD solutions right and it's been medically verified, but the state won't acknowledge it
*  So if you choose to go that route not only obviously your insurance company won't pay for it
*  But you lose your license and everything else related to its regulation
*  But what if you go through all that and you have no issues like what if you can prove that your?
*  Epilepsy is in remission then that can work, but it takes a year or longer
*  To be able to prove that Jesus Christ
*  So you have to take medication
*  Unfortunately, I haven't I haven't had a seizure in years so
*  Yeah, I have a friend he taken in his son has issues is epilepsy
*  And he got him on CBD and it stopped Dennis tracks young boy to is like three years old. Yeah, stop Dennis tracks
*  Yeah, it's um CBD is an issue or a solution for some people with some people with epilepsy
*  ketogenic diets are another one they they actually
*  Started using those on certain team members that were using rebreather's so certain
*  Seals and
*  Team members that were using these rebreather's some of them would have seizures for some reason you know rebreather's or it's not
*  scuba gear it's a different sort of setup and
*  One of the ways they found to mitigate that was to put them putting them on ketogenic diets
*  There's something about your body burning fat as opposed to carbohydrates that lends itself to
*  Stopping these sort of seizures and they don't completely understand why or whether or not it works on everybody
*  So a lot of research too in the cancer field in regards to diet impacts. It's pretty phenomenal data out there
*  Yeah, it is. Yeah. Yeah, um
*  One of the things that I'm hoping out of this coronavirus scare is that people start taking their health more seriously
*  you know and your immune system and just if something hits you and you're in a compromised state you're
*  So much worse off than if you're in a healthy state
*  I mean it literally is like having insurance on your body being able to defend itself from an outside attack
*  Yeah, cuz that's what a virus is stop. Yeah, listen to it honor it
*  Chill stop your role get better keep your defense up keep your strength up
*  I mean that that is literally the benefit of a healthy diet and exercise is your body
*  Functions better and it can ward off attacks and that's what people have to think about when you the flu comes around or anything comes
*  That's an attack
*  It's an attack by a viral entity and if you have weak defense if you have a poor immune system if your body is already
*  compromised because of tobacco use and
*  drugs and all these various things that can wreck your system and you don't exercise and you're gonna get around to it but you
*  Never do and you eat like shit. Well, guess what man? You have no fucking tools
*  You have no no weapons to defend yourself against this entity. I'm worried about Jamie right now
*  Like I'm not letting her fill her car up a gas
*  Go to the bank. Yeah anywhere like me and my younger son Quinn who's still at home like let us handle everything
*  Yes, your immune system is severely challenged right now. Just finish chemo like
*  Lockdown, but you need to go to work and build people because we got a meat payroll, but other than
*  Like let's stay low. Let's yeah
*  It's such a trying time
*  I'm just really hoping it's a wake-up call for some people that they really understand how important it is
*  It's not there's there's so many intelligent people that I know that treat exercise and diet and just your own
*  Physical well-being as if it's a frivolous pursuit pursuit of shallow minded people that that want to you know, the the
*  Egotistical vain people that want to have nice bodies and it's for fools
*  You know that the intelligent person concentrates on the mind the Intel but I think that's a really it's and that is in itself
*  It's an unintelligent way to approach it. It's not holistic
*  You should treat your mind as if it's a part of your body, right?
*  And that's that again that's more of that polarization that unfortunately we were seeing in the last ten years
*  It's just growing exponentially. So that's one thing
*  I hope out of this is that us amongst ourselves as Americans and as a
*  Larger family of people who only have one globe to live on I hope there's more I
*  Hope to see this create more cohesion more more of a unification amongst all mankind
*  Yes to realize we all are dealing to different extents with the same challenges the the same
*  Potentials the same liabilities and get people back
*  Tribally like
*  Yeah, Heather. Yeah, I couldn't agree more and I think that sometimes it takes a real
*  Outside challenge to bring us together or a scare. Yeah a scare. I think this is a scare
*  I mean, it's a challenge and it's such a reminder because I've always felt this
*  It's also fragile
*  Right, like even our Western
*  Reality like okay just just from a small business owner, right?
*  Like I think it's probably fair to say that nationwide any business that's under say whatever
*  20 million a year
*  Are kind of hand-to-mouth give or take a couple months. Yes, right
*  Then you look at our distribution systems our infrastructure all of it. It's it's all so fragile
*  so any arrogance because of convenience or
*  Wealth or resources or connections that we all have it it's pretty quick that none of that shit matters
*  Yeah, and like it's also fragile, but I hope again that there's a positive spin to that where people can understand it
*  Acknowledge that and therefore learn and connect and have greater consideration for our neighbors ourselves
*  Our own bodies our mind our spirit, but like get people more connected and like face out of their fucking phones
*  Yeah
*  I'm really interesting really interested to see what happens coming out of San Francisco because they're the first ones to impose a real lockdown
*  Like you're not even supposed to go to work. No, I don't know how they can say that
*  I don't know how they can do that and I don't know what's gonna come out of that
*  You know, but again, they're still dealing with medieval diseases on the street because people are shitting everywhere. I mean
*  So you're really concerned with it should have been first
*  Well, I mean you're really concerned with with people's health and you've got people literally diarrhea on people's cars all over
*  Hey, Dash, Barry. I mean, it's it's fucking not San Francisco is there's apps where you can see the human waste
*  Scattered out throughout the city so you can you can people when they see human shit they entered into the app and it's
*  Spectacularly disgusting when you look at the map of San Francisco and and human shit
*  it's all over the place and they don't do a goddamn thing about it and you know,
*  They seem to think that these people need help and these people need but it's like if those people were murdering people or
*  Assaulting people everywhere if all homeless people assaulted people would they treat it the same way?
*  Well, you know they would say well these people are breaking the law now we're gonna arrest them
*  Well, they're breaking the law they should be breaking the law if they're camping out and throwing garbage everywhere, too
*  I'm not saying you should arrest all of them, but you need to do something
*  You can't just look at it like it's not a gigantic public health
*  vexing vexing issue and the the diversity of
*  Situations and stories that lead people to be into that situation is so complicated
*  It is and you're gonna see more of it if you force people to be out of work like OPC is a big charity in LA
*  That's working on that that my children's charities had some some sort of Kevin Bacon moments of interrelationship
*  and I look at all the efforts of charities like theirs and how they address it and it's like
*  Fuck, that's a tough one. Like I don't understand how how you'd even approach it's gotten so far gone
*  I mean it should have been nipped in the bud
*  They should have figured out a way to stop it as it was happening and put a considerable amount of resources towards that
*  But all these other problems seem to be more on the forefront and more on people's mind when they were when it comes to elections
*  And so they just sort of let it happen. I think like you said back with Reagan that they're not being a forcible
*  State multiple state lawsuits against the federal government because of the load put on the state
*  Systems by that federal change and the limit of health care for for mental issues
*  Yeah, that was really kind of the root of it, right?
*  I mean I grew up in New York City in the 70s and it was a fucking zoo
*  But that now even pales to what you're seeing like I went to visit a supplier
*  Three weeks ago in downtown LA and like just trying to drive down his street to get in his parking lot
*  It was like it was like a circus man. Yeah, and like they've not only taken over the curb in the street
*  They're walking down the middle of the street with an attitude like I shouldn't be driving on this
*  And like half the businesses on the block literally gave up and closed down and they can't even like my friend wanted to move his
*  Company and the realtor is like see her fucking dreaming like never gonna sell this building right now
*  Like look at this neighborhood and there's nothing they're doing. Yeah, then I don't know
*  You know, it just keeps getting worse when I was filming fear factor down there in the early 2000s. It was bad
*  I mean I was like does everyone know about skid Row like this is crazy
*  You drive down skid Row and you'd go what in the fuck is this is a zombie movie and it is tenfold worse now
*  There's 70,000 homeless people in Los Angeles. I mean that that's an enormous amount of people
*  That's you know, the way I describe it is it's basically almost the size of Boulder, Colorado
*  But homeless the entire city of Boulder homeless. That's what it's like
*  It's crazy how many people there are and that's just documented. They don't really know how many there are
*  I mean, it's it's an enormous number. It's just a rough estimate and
*  That's like all these kovat estimates. Wait a minute. Yeah, and the two minutes ago you were saying no
*  No, that's a test. So how are we supposed to trust any fucking thing? You're telling? Yeah
*  No one has any idea and also the fact that so many people are asymptomatic
*  So they're wandering around with it and you know, and the real issue is the immune compromised folks
*  and then I'm worried as a business owner like cuz at some point in my
*  disrespecting my
*  Employees my culture by staying open
*  Like should I be closing or am I breathing into it's like I'm torn between
*  This is social media gone wrong too much hype and too much bullshit versus
*  Speaking to friends a friend who's a scientist in the viral field and what she's telling me and friends who are doctors and a friend
*  Is a doctor in Milan and the shit show he's dealing with it's like
*  Okay, no, it's not just like but it's it's it's very interesting trying to I think all of us in all of our lives
*  Right now picking our paths picking our priorities. How do we address this?
*  But then as a business owner again in California, there's liabilities to how you address or don't address it. Yeah
*  So it's it's very interesting. Do you think you'd move to Texas?
*  No, no couldn't do it frankly if it got that bad
*  I'd rather sell the company to someone who thinks they're smarter than me and they can do it and scale it and go there
*  I just stay in my happy space and just make leather jackets
*  Yeah, just make shit travel the world spend time with craftsmen spend time with my family when you're you mean
*  you've you know made this very very successful business and very I
*  Hesitate to use word iconic but it is do you have goals?
*  Outside of what you've already done or do you just do what you enjoy doing? I do what I enjoy doing having said that I
*  I need to listen to the capitalist pig on my right shoulder versus the creative geek on my left shoulder in that I
*  We've been quite successful as a company. I'm honored how many people know the brand
*  But I haven't like amassed some, you know great personal wealth if the shit blows up tomorrow
*  You know
*  I'm looking for a job, you know, so I I need to figure out how to cash in so to speak on the
*  The equity the brand is created in ways that don't step on the brands. We we so like
*  I'm dying to get into all different aspects of industrial design
*  I'd love to do that on my own or through collaborations
*  But I think my goal would be to diversify my product line
*  To keep revisiting classic design in a modern context
*  But in many different ways in many different product segments
*  So like I am right now and part of the trip to Mexico and to Morocco
*  Those trips were and the last three years of practice and building prototype wallets
*  And you know sort of side hustle on Instagram and stuff is really getting granular with it
*  Because I do want to start a leather goods brand
*  As it to make a jacket like that. I'll buy it. Yeah that jacket looks sweet
*  Yeah wallets and belts and Jack do you make them for champs?
*  I literally like this this jacket is like
*  hand
*  Cut hand stitched hand not a single machine used like shit show commercially and viable
*  But I'm working with Horweene Leathers in Chicago and a friend's brand
*  Called Black Bear and we're like studying different patterns and prototyping so I think I'm pretty soon
*  I'm gonna launch like a
*  limited run kick-ass
*  Jacket that's like layers of story down to why that leather and who made it and how and on and on and on man
*  Yeah, tell me when I'm in start exploring. Well, I was like ready to go and now I'm thinking I'm an idiot to start a new brand
*  Right now so I might show for a bit. Yeah, who knows what the fuck is gonna happen this economy
*  And like I said, I'm really interested to see what happens out of San Francisco because they I think they've imposed a three-week mandatory lockdown
*  Yes, three weeks. That is a long time to go without income a long long time
*  Especially the burn rate of a company of my size. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's what people don't understand. I mean, I mean when someone looks at
*  Something that you create like an icon Bronco and you know
*  They look at the expense of that thing and how boy must be nice like that's crazy
*  Like this guy must be making money for 30 grand. Yeah, well they just the I mean
*  I went to visit the car when you were making it the level of detail is off the charts from the polyurea
*  Coating of every fucking component under the undercarriage of the car to the media blasting this and they're replacing all the bolts and all
*  The wiring all of this you don't you don't really understand what it's like to see
*  Handmade car built from the ground up unless you watch it. Yeah being built from the ground up asinine is stupid
*  Yeah business the amount of money that goes to that costs to build one of those things is fucking crazy
*  You know when people think of a car, oh
*  But you can get an f-150 for 39 grand which I look at and go how's that possible?
*  Like that's amazing. You guys can do it. I'm gonna pick it apart. Oh, we were yeah, that's amazing. It is amazing robots
*  I mean the I mean efficiency of the production modern production line look at it all blows up tomorrow. I have had
*  multiple lives in multiple careers that have all been
*  Amazing experiences. I wouldn't change and a single aspect of my life thus far other than my wife's cancer battle
*  Like it's just been an amazing ride and if you should all blows up tomorrow on this is as far as it goes
*  I'm honestly I'm stoked. It's been amazing the perfect world. I'll keep pushing limits
*  I'll keep trying new platforms. I'll keep pushing tech and
*  As long as I'm able to not have a real job, I am just super stoked
*  Yeah, well, that's the key. That's the goal the goal is to get through life without a real job, right? Totally
*  No, like literally
*  We ran it about this if anyone wants to listen to our first podcast when we first met and just we geeked out for hours
*  And hours but like the whole educational system alone like should be focused on helping our youth
*  Understand what they're passionate about if someone finds their passion and can make it their life. They're a happier
*  Individual and they're gonna break new ground and be of great value versus trying to fit everyone into these bullshit social silos
*  Yeah, most of which are broken and overflowing now like the Watson computer is better than general counsel
*  I'd like at a huge percentage difference of AI can outdo these lawyers in like coming out of school and six digits of
*  Debt and they can't get jobs. Yeah, that model doesn't even work anymore
*  So let's get back to like honoring tinkerers and craftsmen and free thinkers and innovators and they're yeah
*  Encouraging people to think outside the box total encouraging people to be creative and I think there's also an issue in
*  Teaching people at scale, you know, I just I don't I think people need individual attention
*  They need some sort of a mentor figure that can tell them. Hey, I did what you're doing
*  I went through what you've gone about just understanding that individual kid and understanding is
*  Does he learn best by seeing does he learn best by doing?
*  Does he learn like even understanding that interface? Yeah. Yeah, it's um, it's a mess, you know
*  and the only thing that gives me hope is
*  Now because the internet there's so many other resources for kids
*  There's so many YouTube videos they can watch and so many articles they can read and there's so many just there's documentaries
*  There's all these different stories of someone like them that also followed a dream
*  And you know when I was a kid there was none of that shit
*  It's true. Well, I didn't even know you could
*  Being an industrial designer was a career path. Sure. I was well beyond having the opportunity to have properly trained it
*  Well, there was no such thing as being a podcaster, right? I mean it didn't exist but now it exists and there's
*  900,000 podcasts literally really. Oh, it's so crazy
*  They think one there's some crazy number like it's one out of every 400 people in America has a podcast
*  And it's mostly real. Is that a real number? What is the number? It's 330 million people. Yeah, that's the number
*  There's a million podcasts that's close to it. Yeah, it's in the 50. It's in the neighborhood
*  It's in the neighborhood of one out of every four and even you right you had no idea
*  I've no idea. Yeah, no, I know
*  But I mean you didn't know the magic carpet ride you were getting on now you did this as a passion play, right?
*  Yeah, I wanted to have interesting conversations and meet diverse people and you kind of needed a gig, right?
*  You wanted to this sort of was it I don't want to say a hobby
*  But it grew very organically for you 100% organic
*  You had no clue was gonna turn into this empire of craziness, right? No, it costed money for most of the time
*  It was just for fun
*  Yeah
*  It was a hundred percent just for fun and an opportunity to get together with my friends one of things that I figured out early
*  On that's beautiful. I love the honesty of that. Yeah, it is
*  Yeah
*  I mean
*  But one of things I figured out early on is like I spend the most time with my friends
*  When we sit down and do podcasts because then there's no phones involved. It's just three hours and just talking to each other
*  Whereas you know if we go to a restaurant we'll talk for a little bit
*  But we only do it once every now and then and they're on the road and I'm on the road and so
*  Getting together was like a communal thing and then it became a clubhouse thing and then we started doing it at the ice house
*  So he's at a comedy club
*  So we do it
*  Coincide with shows and that was a lot of fun and then slowly but surely the numbers started growing and as the numbers started growing
*  Then I started getting guests and then as I started getting guests
*  I started understanding what I'm actually doing and getting better at talking to people and then realizing that
*  What you're doing is you're linking up with one person though the less distractions the better the less bullshit the better
*  It's just you and a person talking and then I got better at that and then I started
*  Thinking about what I'm doing wrong what I'm doing and then I realized like oh this is a skill
*  Just like everything else is a skill like being annoying to listen to is a failure
*  To do the job right like you're not it's not just that that's who you are. That's not what it is
*  It's just you're you are who you are because of a lack of attention
*  man
*  I've done tons of interviews and tons of podcasts and tons of media over my various careers and stuff and I honestly like
*  You know our conversations and the my last experience here and again talking with you today, I mean I love it like there's such great
*  Conversations and I honestly like it's we were direct in eye contact. It's been personal
*  It's about whatever the hell we come up with that we end up just naturally flowing into and that's so it's so rare
*  It's what's rare for people to listen to too. And the firm for me, it's
*  It's very educational and it's also the beautiful thing about it is that
*  The only people I'm talking to is people I want to talk to so there's no one
*  That's telling me who to talk to so, you know when I reach out to you and I said hey man
*  You want to do another one? Yeah, fuck it. Let's do it. I'm like, alright exciting
*  So it's only people I'm interested in talking to so that makes it so much better for the listeners as well
*  Because you're getting genuine enthusiasm. Just like me when clients call
*  Something that sounds like it would suck and I'm not interested
*  Yes, so bless us right while we have the power to say no
*  Yeah
*  And to control what we do what we say yes to and what we say no to
*  As long as the market allows both of us to do that. Yes, stay in our little happy place for sure
*  I what I hope out of this coronavirus thing is other than people stay healthy. Of course is that
*  People do revisit what they do with their lives as well and recognize that fact that all this shit can go away
*  and even if you're a good boy and you show up at work every day for some fucking job that sucks and
*  You feel like you're putting your time you're doing the right thing
*  They could take that shit away from you ain't none of us getting out of here alive
*  Yeah, exactly and you can jump off that fucking ship and I bet you can make it to the shore
*  I bet you can but you you have to do the due diligence
*  You got to do the work and you have to understand like this is not gonna be easy
*  This is nothing that's worth doing is easy, but I think once someone understands the importance of
*  being impassioned about
*  What they do even like what relationships they're in how they spend their time, you know
*  What they schedule their day about once you really own that to a deep extent like the risk
*  It's it's not even
*  Leave the shit job leave the unhealthy relationship take better care of yourself your body or whatever
*  But like once you make that first acceptance and understanding the rest of its breeze
*  It'll be such a happier world if people have that connection. It will and I'm with you
*  I hope that grows from this one of the unintended positive
*  side effects of podcasts is that they get to listen to people that have done that people like you and
*  Other people that have had on that are living their life the way that they chose to and they realize like this is
*  And then you get to hear the story like oh, this isn't like they weren't handed this they didn't get a Willy Wonka golden ticket
*  They had a passion and then they followed through I had ten grand two piece of shit cars and four credit cards
*  I saw I started the company and I walked away from a lucrative career. Yeah, that's walked away
*  There's a million stories like that, you know, and those are the fun ones. Those are the fun stories
*  I'm just happy there's people out there that are
*  Living that example, you know, and I really do hope that some people I mean it's not for everybody
*  But some people out there that are hearing this
*  that are in this situation like fuck like I did all the right things and my job is still gone now and my
*  You know my pension my 401k tank blah blah. The real problem is people with families
*  People with families and people with mortgages and they can't jump they have leases
*  They have you know rent to pay and it's still argument nights and weekends
*  Later nights and weekends nights and weekends even if it just gives you the creative
*  Creative juice. Yeah that juju flowing and then you can dabble in
*  Is there a rev model is this a viable business or where can it go?
*  but then nights and weekends thing like
*  motivated and
*  Excited and thinking and stretching and trying
*  Versus just you know plugging in and watching the same shit being yeah on our throat by media
*  Like there's so much that can be done even just at that level the effort to push that car and then jump start it as it
*  Gets rolling. It's really hard to push that car
*  But if you can get it going enough and jump in and push the clutch in and throw it into first and
*  And then it's then it's moving but it's that initial effort. It's so fucking hard
*  But once you do it like this podcast is easy to do now. It's easy to show up and do it
*  It's easy
*  But you do it from scratch if someone had to start it tomorrow if you think it's gonna be easy it's not I look back
*  actually just today I was going through an image catalog as this update in the site and I
*  Don't remember what it was. It was some some image. I was editing for the site. I was going
*  Fuck this is complicated like
*  looking back it's it seemed it seems somewhat easy like
*  There's so many aspects and so much complexity in this business that looking back at it like
*  It grew merely out of the passion and when there wasn't by focus groups or you know
*  Analysis or anything it was I just fucking jumped in and started doing it made it work and you keep grinding
*  That's the thing the grind is amazing because it does really achieve results
*  You just keep doing it you keep doing you keep working keep showing up keep pouring your passion to it
*  And then you look back two years three years five years, you know, holy shit
*  Look at the distance look at all this look at all the projects
*  Look at all the stuff that's been done and I went through a year before we did this
*  I went through your YouTube channel and I started looking at some of the newer projects some of the older projects
*  I'm like look at the fucking amount of work that's come out of your shop. It's really crazy. Yeah, it's pretty nice
*  Amazing three hundred and thirty some vehicles out of icon and then
*  Couple thousand out of the first brand on a teal. What is that like a week at a GM? Not even right?
*  How many days is that? That's like I'm cars fart. That's like a that's like a half day
*  Probably right. Yeah, it's cool though. I mean, it's it's a very unique field the field of people making cars
*  You know, I would hate to see
*  The regulations and all the bullshit get down to you
*  I love the fact that you're a 15 minute drive away and go check out the shop. I will beat him
*  It just sucks that I have to convince them that I'm a valued member of
*  California's crazy
*  Society and especially the city that should be right side people pumped that you're there
*  I mean, I just don't get it used to be mayor Villa Raghosa family the damn building personally like like they were they were great
*  But I don't know I think you know what a lot of people are telling me and we're seeing this even at
*  Bureau of automotive repair California Resource Forces. There's a lot more regulation occurring now
*  because since California and the Trump administration have gotten pretty deep in this argument over
*  Does California have the right to create its own air quality control mandates or not?
*  That it's sucking so much money out of the California system that they're having to scramble to come up with new rev models
*  So like a lot of the aftermarket automotive like for off-road use only
*  marketed parts
*  They're now pursuing the distributor the manufacturer the retailer the fucking web host the
*  Consumer and like penalizing everyone up and down the chain. Mm-hmm to create this rev model to keep it keep it going
*  It's it's a real bummer man. It's a real bummer
*  I mean, I understand the the desire to keep air quality high
*  But I don't understand that you're using all these cars that are you know, you're using these emission compliant engines
*  I mean these LS engines that you use these crate engine. Yeah, I'm putting cats and systems into cars that never had
*  Yeah
*  All the vehicles that we create actually emit less being driven like an idiot than the stock one did sitting in a parking lot
*  Not even being driven if just by fact of the charcoal canister in the non vented fuel system. Just that alone just that alone
*  So just sitting around the admit to yeah. Oh, yeah, cuz it was the the tanks
*  It was vaporizing fuel rise out and all those particulates go flying
*  Well, this is no different than a modern car was my point
*  I mean if you buy a modern f-150 or you buy one of your cars which with a crate engine
*  It's the same it's the same as far as the amount that it releases into the air and we're exempt
*  You know all the platform mirrors are the vast majority of them that we work with
*  Yeah pre 75, but I'm just doing it because it you'd be a dumbass not to so right thing
*  There's yeah
*  and it's not like the 90s where you're putting in EGR and the smog pumps and five miles of vacuum tubes and
*  Shit that's not gonna be reliable
*  I mean now it's all about wideband o2s pre cat post cat o2s boom boom and a clean program and like it
*  It's better. It's a better experience
*  What about hydrogen is anybody come up with a viable method of I mean?
*  I know that there's people that have done some hydrogen systems and cars have you ever fucked with that
*  No, and I've been curious about it. But from what I understood the
*  Distribution of hydrogen was the big deal breaker in that the hydrogen that is readily
*  Distributed if I recall correctly was lower grade that would not work in the systems required for hydrogen powered automobiles
*  So it was a complete infrastructure shit show to get it to the point of viable same with like capstone that was doing those
*  Micro turbines out in Chatsworth, Kanoga Park. I don't know what that is seem quite quite viable. What was it micro turbines?
*  So turbochargers and but they were micro. It's a full turbine
*  So think industrial commercial application turbines power sources, but for for road going vessels
*  Oh, so that was the actual for the vehicle. Yeah, but apparently they burn pretty dirty
*  Okay, I don't know what I'm talking about
*  But that's what I was told when I was starting to dive into it. I remember there's an ice one a bloom box
*  Yeah, whatever the fuck
*  That sounded cool
*  Anything else should we wrap this up? Sure. No, I just I love being here
*  And I really appreciate your time and your intellect and your diversity and thank you my thanks, man
*  I appreciate what you do. I really do. I mean, I'm happy there's Jonathan Ward's out there. Keep on trucking
*  Alright, bye everybody. Stay safe. Stay healthy. Bye
