# Joe Rogan Experience #1513 - Andrew Huberman
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 23, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLJowTOkZVo)
*  Andrew, how are you? What's happening man? Doing great. Nice to meet you. Nice to
*  meet you. Excited to talk to you about this. Just sort of for an introduction,
*  tell people what you do. So I'm a neuroscientist, I mean I'm a professor of
*  neurobiology and ophthalmology, Stanford School of Medicine. So I run a
*  laboratory. I teach a little bit. I teach neuroanatomy to medical students but
*  mainly my lab does research. So I've got students and postdocs and we're trying
*  to figure out the answers to two problems. The first problem is how to
*  regenerate the damaged nervous system, in particular the connections between
*  the eye and the brain to restore vision to the blind. So that's a big mission of
*  ours and to prevent vision loss in people that are losing their vision. And
*  the other thing that we're doing is we're focusing a lot on stress and other
*  states of mind. So I'm obsessed with the idea that all our states of mind come
*  from the brain and the body and we're trying to figure out what happens in the
*  brain and body when we're stressed and how to control it. What happens in the
*  brain and body when we are creative and how to control it. And essentially for
*  all states of mind. But rather than try and tackle the really high-level stuff
*  like flow and states of awe, we're really focused on these states of stress and
*  things like focus and the ability to think clearly and do certain things
*  athletically or cognitively because first of all there's a lot of suffering.
*  There are a lot of people out there that are suffering from an inability to control
*  their states of mind. And also there's great potential for people who aren't
*  suffering to be able to create and perform and do better things once we can
*  understand how those states come about. That's an interesting way of putting it.
*  Suffering because they can't control their states of mind. That is the case
*  but that's not like a politically correct way of describing it. I guess I
*  never thought about that. Will that be accurate? Well I think it's fair to say that all our
*  states of mind and body and I say mind and body because the nervous system
*  which is the brain, the spinal cord and all that stuff, it connects to our body
*  and our body connects to our brain. So we can't really separate those. But states
*  of mind which include the stuff in our skull and the body, those essentially
*  dictate our whole life experience. So whether or not we're feeling calm
*  when we want to be calm, whether or not we're feeling stressed when we'd rather
*  be calm, whether or not we are feeling focused when we need to do work or
*  whether or not we're feeling creative when we want to be creative. All of that
*  stems from the nervous system. The other organs of the body are involved but the
*  nervous system, the brain and those connections, it's really what it's about.
*  So if you see somebody who's in a state of depression or you see somebody who's
*  in a state of flow and creativity, you can be pretty sure that that's
*  reflecting the activity of neurons in the brain. The idea that the body
*  and the brain are inseparable. Most people who are physically active accept
*  that and appreciate that and they know that this is probably true. But there's a
*  lot of people that kind of want to deny that and concentrate only on the brain.
*  And particularly like there's psychiatrists that will prescribe
*  medication before they'll prescribe exercise. And this is, it's a
*  controversial subject. That's what I meant by saying like that you are
*  unable to control aspects of your brain or aspects of the way you're viewing
*  things the way you feel about things.
*  But yeah so I think if we take a step back and we just kind of think about what the
*  brain and nervous system does and again nervous system includes all of it. We can
*  say the brain is special right? This brain there is something fundamentally
*  important about the brain part because it's somebody who let's say has a limb
*  amputated. It doesn't fundamentally change who they are. It can change what
*  they can do but there and there will be aspects of their personality and
*  temperament that might shift but who they are hasn't changed. Whereas if
*  someone has a brain lesion or the brain is degenerating that person is
*  fundamentally different. So there is something special about the real estate
*  in our skulls. But that said the job of the brain is really to combine our
*  experience of what's going on in our body with what's going on in our mind
*  and to react and behave to things in an adaptive way. So if I may there's just
*  sort of like if we take a step back and just think there are basically five
*  things that the nervous system is responsible for doing. First is sensation.
*  Sensation is non-negotiable. It's happening all the time. Sound waves are
*  coming in. Your feet are in contact with your shoes or the floor. That's all
*  happening and you can't control it because we have sensors, things in our
*  eye, our tongue, our nose, our skin, our ears that take physical events in the
*  universe. Photons of light, sound waves, touch, you know, physical pressure on
*  the skin. And it transforms that into one language and the language is the
*  language of electricity of neurons. Now perception is the next thing that the
*  brain does. And perception is all about which sensations we are conscious of. So
*  if I say, you know, the contact of your hands with the table, now you're
*  conscious of it. That's just your perceptual window. It's like a spotlight.
*  It just goes straight to your hands. So there's sensation, perception. And then
*  there are these things we call emotions, which are brain body states. They tend to
*  make us either want to get up and move or stay still. They tend to make us think
*  this is a good place for me to be at mentally and physically or I want to
*  shift this. And then there are thoughts, which we could discuss in detail if you
*  want, which kind of arise spontaneously. They're kind of running in the
*  background all the time, like pop-up windows on a badly filtered internet
*  connection. But we can also deliberately have a thought. Like I can say, that
*  pad of paper to my right is yellow. I can decide that. In the same way I can do
*  the fifth thing, which is an action. So you've got sensations, perceptions,
*  feelings slash emotions, thoughts and actions. And all five of those include
*  the brain and the body. But how much brain and how much body is shifted by a
*  kind of underlying, let's just think of it as a tide, like the level of the tide.
*  And that's the autonomic nervous system. So if I'm suddenly stressed for whatever
*  reason, my perceptual window is going to shift. My eyes are literally going to
*  change their focus. My world will become more like portrait mode. I'll see you
*  and everything else will become blurry. When I'm calm, I actually have panoramic
*  vision. I can see everything around me. So I better, so my state, my internal
*  state of alertness or sleepiness impacts all this. And in sleep, which is kind of
*  the opposite extreme of stress, I'm not in relation to anything outside me. I'm
*  not perceiving anything. I'm sensing things. It's non-negotiable. I'm not
*  having real thoughts, but the thoughts are kind of disoriented in space and
*  time and behavior is done. You're lying down. You're sometimes paralyzed in
*  sleep. So when I say states, it's really about this dynamic shift between what
*  we're perceiving and how we're perceiving it. And we could go really in
*  depth in this or not, but states of mind are fundamentally, I think to me anyway,
*  are the most important aspect of trying to understand how the brain works.
*  Because ultimately, if you want to understand mental illness and mental
*  health, if you want to understand high performance, which is something my lab is
*  really interested in, if you want to understand any of that, you have to
*  understand how these states of mind and body relate because the autonomic nervous
*  system, which is strongly impacting these states is in the body. It is the
*  basis of it is connections between the brain and body.
*  So you're analyzing people in stress states. And are you doing cognitive
*  function tests on these people in stress states versus people in calm placid
*  states? Like how are you doing? Are you doing like similar tests?
*  Yeah. So there are two states that like we can take that whole tangle of mess
*  that I just threw out on the table and simplified and say, look, there are two
*  states that I think if we could really crack, we could really understand the
*  underlying neural mechanisms and we could understand how people could get
*  themselves into these two states, we would greatly improve human health and
*  human performance, cognitively and physically.
*  Okay. And those two states are the state of sleep. So not just the importance of
*  sleep. I know you had Matt on here. So you're a great sleep researcher. Not
*  just that sleep is important, but how to get better at sleeping, how to access
*  sleep. So if you, a lot of people struggle with that. And the other state
*  is clear, calm, focused. Those two states for my lab right now are the target
*  states. But you know, there's so many states, but if we can figure out how
*  those work and how to put, allow people to put themselves into those states, I
*  think it's my belief that we'll do humankind a great service.
*  Okay. So when you say sleep, the state of sleep, like what techniques are you
*  talking about to achieve the state of sleep or do a better job of sleeping?
*  Yeah. So when people come into my laboratory, we essentially start
*  pressure testing them from the moment they walk in the door. So we have a
*  laboratory, we do some animal work, we work on mice and we study states like
*  fear and courage. And we're interested in what leads to winning in certain
*  forms of competition between animals and these kinds of things, aggression,
*  those kind of very primal states. We also have a human lab. So people come
*  into the laboratory, we have an equivalent lab, essentially to our mouse
*  lab, people put on VR goggles, we wire them into a lot of gear that allows us
*  to measure things like heart rate, breathing, we're measuring pupil size,
*  eye tracking. And in some people, because they are neurosurgery patients,
*  we have access to the brain, we drop electrodes down into the brain, record
*  from the human amygdala.
*  So you have a hole in their head?
*  They have a hole in their skull. The neurosurgeons actually, which I am not,
*  tell us that, you know, it's no big deal, right? That, you know, that basically
*  they look at the skull as kind of a poorly evolved device. They always tell
*  me, you know, you're much better off with a titanium plate there anyway, it's
*  much stronger. So they don't have a problem putting a little hole in the
*  skull. These are surgeons, these are patients that have other issues, right?
*  So they're saying you're better off with a titanium plate than skull bone?
*  Well, if you're concerned about concussion or anything, if you really want
*  to protect the brain, you would, you know, you could build a better device to
*  protect the brain.
*  But isn't, but isn't the real brain damage comes from the brain slamming
*  against the inside wall of the skull?
*  Yeah.
*  And how is that going to be better with titanium?
*  Yeah. I mean, this is neurosurgeons and they're, you know, they're in it.
*  There's some foam inside the...
*  Yeah, there are synthetic materials that, you know, they use to protect against
*  sloshing around.
*  Do they, how much, how far do they go with this?
*  Have they ever like remove the top of someone's head and replace it with
*  titanium?
*  Yeah. Large portions, large windows.
*  I've seen windows in the skull that are, you know, the size of an iPhone.
*  What?
*  Yeah. Sure. You don't flip it open.
*  Oh no.
*  No, but now keep in mind that these are...
*  Like a lid, a manhole cover for your brain?
*  Basically.
*  Really? Is that available online?
*  Can Jamie look that up?
*  He's looking at it already.
*  Well, you know, a guy who used to work in my lab, who's now at Neuralink, a
*  neurosurgeon.
*  Oh, one of those guys.
*  One of those guys.
*  Ready to fucking bring on the AI hyper world.
*  I'm scared.
*  Among other things.
*  I mean, I think that, well, I always say, you know, all of human evolution is
*  based on human neuroplasticity, the ability to learn and acquire new functions
*  in the nervous system or where our biology kind of cliffs off and can't
*  support us in what we want to do.
*  We build technology.
*  Right.
*  And this is the idea.
*  The innovation steps in and says, I've got an idea to accelerate this process.
*  And then you get Captain Supergenius who thinks it's no big deal.
*  Cut giant holes in the top of your head and stick these wires in there.
*  I mean, I think there's that version of it.
*  And I think what I haven't spoken to them directly, but, except this one
*  individual there, but you know, first of all, they're not, I don't think they're
*  thinking about large windows in the skull unless there's a clinical need.
*  They're talking about behind the ear.
*  It's about a quarter.
*  Behind the ear.
*  Yeah.
*  The route in through the bone there.
*  And the other thing is that I think it's very likely that the first 10 years of
*  that work will be clinical in nature.
*  Movement disorders, Parkinson's, you know, and of course, because I said that
*  they'll probably beat that by, you know, five years.
*  Well, the quote that made me uncomfortable was when Elon told me, you're not going
*  to have to talk to communicate anymore.
*  I was like, Oh Jesus Christ, where are we going with this?
*  Well, this is interesting because, so I have a good friend who's a neurosurgeon
*  at UCSF, we've known each other since we were little kids, since we were nine.
*  His name is Eddie Chang and he's kind of the world expert.
*  He's a neurosurgeon, but he's also the world expert in speech and language.
*  And what he's been doing is decoding, essentially figuring out what neural
*  signals come out of the brain that allows us to speak in a certain way.
*  So let's say I, I wanted to build a device that would allow you to speak eight
*  languages tomorrow that you don't know today.
*  The reflexive idea is that people like Eddie and people like me and maybe the,
*  the Neuralink folks are going to go in and build chips that are going to stimulate
*  the hippocampus and you're going to learn faster and do all that.
*  But there's a whole other version of this.
*  And it gets right back to this issue of brain and body that we were talking about
*  before.
*  Now, speech is a brain thing.
*  You think about what you want to say, maybe for a joke or here and it's in your
*  head, but it's transformed, meaning those nerve signals go in the form of
*  electricity to the pharynx and larynx.
*  And you say things like, hello, my name is, you know, in my case, Andrew, right?
*  That transformation is happening at the muscle.
*  So in theory, if I know that in English, right.
*  And I know the nerve signals that come out of that area of cortex, that speech
*  area that say, hello, my name is Andrew.
*  Well, I can take those, look at how it controls the pharynx and larynx and insert
*  maybe a little box.
*  Maybe I don't even have to put it under the skin.
*  Maybe it's a device that I hold so that when I say, hello, my name is Andrew, but
*  I dial it to Mandarin or French, I'll just say, and I can't do this because I
*  don't speak Mandarin or French.
*  Hello, my name is Andrew.
*  I'll think that say it in English in my head, but my pharynx and larynx will say
*  it in Mandarin or French.
*  But isn't the problem with the way language is structured in different
*  languages, like just it wouldn't, you've, I'm sure you've read translations from
*  like Russian to English.
*  Sure.
*  It's really weird.
*  Very different.
*  Or English to Russian is even weirder sometimes.
*  Right.
*  So this is really Eddie's work, but because we're such good friends, we talk
*  about this a lot.
*  One of the fundamental discoveries that he's made, and I should just mention all
*  these neurosurgery patients, they have epilepsy or something else.
*  There's a reason for opening up the skull and going in there.
*  They're not, we're not just, just curious.
*  There was a time a couple of decades ago when you could do this kind of stuff.
*  And there's some very interesting experiments that came out of that just
*  because you could decide to study rage in humans and go in there and start probing
*  around, but lobotomies.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a, obviously really interesting and famous and kind of sad history around
*  that, but also some interesting data came out of it.
*  So, you know, a patient will come in, they'll do this, they'll record these
*  areas and what, what he's found.
*  It's so interesting because if I, let's just say with that same statement, hello,
*  my name is Andrew.
*  There's a neuron in my cortex that responds when I say that and when I want to say
*  that, but if I just change it slightly and I say, hello, my name is Andrew, I make
*  it a question, there's a neuron right next door.
*  That's encodes that turns out there's a map of inflection.
*  So regardless of language, there's a map of, it's not quite meaning, but there's
*  a map of intonation and inflection in the brain.
*  So in theory, because that map is so regular across cultures, he's looked now in
*  China, in Chinese speaking people, in English speaking people, and people who
*  have a second language.
*  He's even has some interesting data about people who have up speak.
*  They're really annoying.
*  Oh, I hate that shit.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a lot near where you live.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a San Francisco tech thing.
*  Is it?
*  Yeah.
*  It's like what they're doing is letting you know that they're one of the tribe.
*  Okay.
*  And we're all in this together and I think like you do and you can trust me
*  because I'm unoriginal.
*  Well, it might reflect a subtle brain damage.
*  You think?
*  I think the data show that it's a distortion of the, of the regular map.
*  I think it's the same thing as a Southern accent.
*  I think you're just fitting in with your environment because I know people that
*  have adopted that shit once they've gotten into the tech world.
*  I'm like, Hey, fuck face.
*  You didn't used to talk like that.
*  Or the people that go to, to, you know, England and start speaking with the
*  British accent.
*  Oh, like Madonna.
*  Oh, did she do that?
*  Yes, she did.
*  I don't follow pop culture carefully.
*  Yes, she did.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm moving to Texas.
*  I'm going to start saying y'all two weeks in.
*  I'm giving myself two weeks.
*  So I'm going to try out y'all.
*  Well, some of this stuff is learned.
*  Are you moving?
*  Is that?
*  Oh, you are.
*  I've heard rumors of that, but I guess, okay.
*  Um, sorry to hear.
*  Sorry for California.
*  Um, congratulations, Texas.
*  Um, there, you know, these maps have some regularities across people because when
*  we're born into the world, you know, we are not a completely clean slate.
*  There's a kind of a map that expects the world, including language, to be a
*  certain way.
*  And we can't expect that we're going to be born in China or born in France or
*  born in California or Northern California for that matter.
*  So the map is what we call semi malleable.
*  It's not a rigid concrete hardwired map.
*  So what makes you think that this up speak is like damage?
*  Well, so I asked Eddie about this.
*  Um, Eddie Chang, my friend, this neurosurgeon who is, you know, kind of
*  premier world, not kind of.
*  He is the world expert on speech and language and the neural transformations
*  and how it controls the pharynx, all that stuff.
*  And I said, what's with the up speak thing?
*  He said, yeah, you know, we see that sometimes and I'm concerned about that.
*  And when a neurosurgeon tells you they're concerned, you kind of go, okay, what are
*  you concerned about?
*  And he goes, there's something wrong with the map and this kind of, you know, so
*  maybe that's, uh, you know, it could be because of upbringing and people, uh, you
*  know, the brain is plastic as adults too.
*  And, um, not in the same way it's plastic in childhood, but, you know, if you are
*  forced to learn another language, your brain will fundamentally shift.
*  Neuroplasticity is a real thing.
*  And I think, uh, it's interesting you raise this kind of cultural component
*  because actually it was Eddie's, uh, advisor guy named Mike Merzenek was really
*  the one who discovered adult neuroplasticity, you know, in the 70s and 80s.
*  And my actually scientific great grandparents, David Hubel and Torrance
*  and weasel won the Nobel prize for showing there are critical periods, these
*  periods of development after which the brain cannot change.
*  And they had important implications for.
*  Amblyopia and I stuff.
*  Merzenek came along and said, you know what?
*  I don't buy that.
*  And he started doing experiments with his students and post-docs where they would
*  create an, an essential need or contingency.
*  Like if the animal doesn't eat unless it learns something, then the brain can
*  change.
*  If you break down learning events into kind of smaller, more focused events, the
*  brain can change as an adult at essentially any age.
*  And so the strongest drive for adult neuroplasticity is focus.
*  It's the ability to say, this is really important.
*  It's making a soda straw view of the world.
*  It's almost like being in a state of stress.
*  And the best way to do that for a young person in adolescence or maybe even older
*  is the social pressures.
*  If they're strong, they will shape and rewire the brain.
*  I mean, I look at what's happening in the world right now.
*  And I think we are in a state of immense neuroplasticity.
*  Everybody is having to rewire their understanding what's going on.
*  So just to sort of put a, you know, kind of a bow of some sort on the speech and
*  language thing.
*  I don't think brain machine interface is going to be all about sticking chips in
*  the head.
*  Let's get back to the up speak thing.
*  Sure.
*  Why does he think it's damage?
*  Like, what is it about up speak?
*  Well, he just thinks that the map, which shows up kind of normally in, I mean, most
*  this is probably the first time in human history, people have used this up speak.
*  It's also the first time in human history, people have typed with their thumbs.
*  I was listening to two guys at the airport back when you can go to the airport.
*  And these two guys at the airport were talking in up speak.
*  And it was like as clear as day to me.
*  Like they were letting each other know that they're in the tribe.
*  And, you know, I remember Jamie had a tech problem once and he was on the phone with
*  this lady who was doing up speak when she was talking to him.
*  And we both looked at each other like, ew, yuck.
*  It does kind of create a kind of visceral like, like nauseous.
*  I can't trust those people.
*  I can't trust someone who talks like that because I know you're unoriginal.
*  Like you not not what not what most of us are clearly at least mostly influenced by
*  the people around us.
*  But it's not just that.
*  It's like you've changed how you talk to fit in with this.
*  There's a tech world.
*  There's tech language that's tech speak.
*  It's English, but it's tech speak English.
*  It's letting you know.
*  And there does seem to be a body response to the spinal extensor.
*  I don't trust them.
*  I don't trust them.
*  I think they're sneaky.
*  Well, I'll try and get the data from I'll try and get the data from Eddie being halfway
*  joking here. If you're like an up speak person, like, hey, man, I've always loved your
*  show. But then you said you don't trust people who talk like me joking.
*  But also stop doing that.
*  Stop fucking doing that.
*  I know what you're doing.
*  I think I think Eddie would say that there's some distortion in the way they're using
*  this map.
*  But how did it start?
*  I think it started with one really smart person who's probably a little autistic who
*  talked like that because they were trying to keep it together.
*  And then everyone else is like, I want to be as smart as John.
*  And then they started talking like that.
*  And then it became a thing sort of like accents like I grew up in Boston.
*  Right. They talk in a weird way.
*  And I picked it up.
*  And then one time I heard myself on television.
*  I heard myself talk like that when I was 19.
*  I was like, oh, my God, I sound like a fucking idiot.
*  What is wrong with me?
*  Like, because I had only lived there at that time for like six years, but I adopted a
*  whole hog.
*  And I was like, what's wrong with me?
*  Like, why am I?
*  I wanted to fit in.
*  That's what it was.
*  I moved there when I was 13 and I tried to fit in.
*  And so I had adopted the speech pattern.
*  I didn't realize it until I heard it.
*  Like you listen to a tape of yourself.
*  You actually find out what you really sound like.
*  You're like, ew.
*  Do you watch your performances?
*  I have to watch stand up.
*  I have to watch some of those podcasts.
*  I try not to unless it's important, unless it's like something that I need to watch
*  over again.
*  Like, I'll probably listen to this one over again, because you're probably going to
*  say some things that you already have that I need to reflect on and research.
*  And, you know, this is a very interesting subject to me.
*  It's very important to me.
*  And there's many different parts of this that I wanted to talk to you about,
*  particularly how people respond to damaged brains and what can be done to repair
*  damaged brains and stress and what we're talking about earlier, states of stress
*  and how they reflect on your ability to think and assess and resolve problems.
*  Because it seems to me that me personally, if I'm tired, if I'm like particularly
*  working out, right?
*  Like if I'm working out with like a, like a Muay Thai trainer and he has like a
*  particular combination that he wants me to do, if I'm exhausted, it's like my
*  monkey brain can't put that combination together.
*  I'm like, what do I do again?
*  Left, right, low kick, body, knee to the body, elbow, clinch.
*  Like, what is it again?
*  Like it's simple.
*  It's very simple, right?
*  But if I'm tired, it's not simple anymore.
*  So what's going on?
*  Like why, why does being tired have an effect on the way you perceive things and
*  what memory and combinations of things that you have to put together?
*  And that's nothing.
*  That's just being tired.
*  That's not your life depending upon it, which is a huge factor.
*  And for fighters, there are many, many fighters who do really well in the gym
*  when there's no pressure, they're comfortable.
*  You look at them and you're like, wow, that guy's incredibly skillful.
*  He must be incredible.
*  Like when he fights, he must be amazing.
*  Then you see him fight and they just lock up.
*  Like for whatever reason they can't, they can't rise to the occasion.
*  They are, they are dwarfed by the moment and whatever it is, whether it's the way
*  they're perceiving these threats, the way their mind is just wired or the way they
*  have learned to handle situations.
*  Maybe they have a series of bad memories that gets relayed every time they're in
*  a situation and they, they, they start concentrating more on failure than on
*  staying calm and trusting the process, which is a big factor.
*  Your training is supposed to come out almost in a Zen like state.
*  And when you're fighting, the whole idea is to maintain calm and maintain this
*  sort of center as much as possible.
*  And when someone's pressuring you and attacking you and talking shit to you
*  in particular, what they're trying to do is weaken that center.
*  What they're trying to do is break that up.
*  So you can't have a happy place.
*  There's no happy place for you.
*  And then you see people fall apart.
*  You see them fold and it's fascinating because it's not a physical thing.
*  Like the physical body is still capable of performing, but there's something
*  going on with stress where the brain can't send the orders to the body correctly.
*  And you're so overwhelmed with anxiety or fear of failure, or just the
*  overwhelming reality of the consequences of making a mistake that you crumble.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, this is why we're obsessed with clear, common focus or sleep as a good
*  jumping off point for, you know, because we eventually want to tackle all the
*  states, but that's a good jumping off.
*  Jumping all over the place, but let's go to, we started with sleep.
*  So let's get back to sleep.
*  So sleep and stress make a good sort of counter examples.
*  So, but if we're just going to focus on sleep, first of all, sleep is the only
*  time that you're in complete relation to only one thing and that's yourself.
*  It's also a time in which there's a core operation of the brain in wakefulness.
*  This is especially apparent in stress, but it's happening all the time where
*  your brain is trying to do two things in wakefulness.
*  And I realize we're talking about sleep, but most of what your brain is trying
*  to do is pass things off to reflexive behavior.
*  So I don't have to think about picking up water.
*  I don't have to think about walking down the hall.
*  I just do it.
*  I just breathe.
*  I just move.
*  I eat.
*  I am not conscious of it.
*  There's another mental operation, which is very demanding, but extremely
*  important, and this is encompassing a lot of different aspects of neural
*  circuitry and function, but the brain wants to figure out duration, path and
*  outcome, how long something going to last, what's the path to do it and how
*  is it going to work out.
*  Those are the two things that the brain is mainly managing during waking states.
*  And of course it's keeping your heart rate going and your breathing going,
*  you're digesting going, but that's all running in the background.
*  When you go to sleep, your perception of space and time, not outer space, unless
*  that's what you're thinking about, but space and time becomes untethered.
*  It becomes very fluid.
*  So when you lie down to go to sleep at night and you're drowsy, you stop doing
*  these duration path outcome analysis.
*  And if you have trouble sleeping, it's because you're still doing, what's
*  the duration, what's the path, what's the outcome, your brain's looping in that.
*  So when you go into sleep, it's the one time in which the brain can
*  untether space and time.
*  Like if this were a dream, you know, your dog could float in here and sit down on
*  the table and then morph into somebody that you know from long ago and we'd be
*  okay with that because it was a dream.
*  So that period of six to eight or 10 hours, whatever you need is essential
*  for resetting neural circuits in the brain.
*  There's some chemical events too, but neural circuits so that during wakefulness,
*  you can do duration path outcome, like learning a new martial art move.
*  So it's the untethered aspect of it is crucial.
*  It's absolutely crucial.
*  And how do we know this?
*  We know this.
*  So when people come into my lab, we study these two states, we put them into VR
*  goggles and we deliver very real, not cartoons and animation, but very real
*  360 video things like claustrophobia.
*  If you're claustrophobic diving with great white sharks, if you don't like sharks,
*  spiders crawling up you, we find your pain point.
*  We bring you into a state of stress and we find in everybody, and this is not
*  necessarily a new phenomenon that your pupils dilate.
*  When your pupils dilate, the optics of your world changes and you are looking at
*  the visual world, which is space, physical space, and you start slicing time
*  differently. If you've ever been stressed, it feels like things are taking forever.
*  That's because your body is sending your brain more signals per unit time.
*  It's saying like, my body's active, my body's active, my body's active, my body's
*  active. Think about when you're drowsy, your body is sending fewer signals to the
*  brain per unit time.
*  And what ends up happening is the brain uses physical space and use these signals
*  from the body.
*  We know this from neural recordings to start creating a space time relationship.
*  The space time relationship really says, let's just take the jujitsu example, even
*  though I've never done jujitsu.
*  You're trying to figure out where do I place my hand?
*  Where's my grip?
*  How do I move my leverage?
*  What am I going to do when you're trying to sequence thing?
*  It's duration, path and outcome.
*  In sleep, the forebrain essentially shuts off.
*  There's some other things that happen too, of course.
*  And the brain starts to drift and idle into these states that where duration, path
*  and outcome analysis become impossible.
*  We also put people into deeply relaxed states.
*  So we're studying three different ways to do that.
*  One is hypnosis, which is not like, you know, charm hypnosis, stage hypnosis, but
*  medical hypnosis.
*  My colleague, David Spiegel, in the department of psychiatry is kind of world
*  expert in hypnosis for pain management, et cetera, trauma.
*  You can put people into hypnotic states, which are very sleep like.
*  They're a little different than sleep, but they're like a shallow stage of sleep.
*  We also use particular patterns of breathing or respiration to bring people into states
*  that are sort of like sleep.
*  It's like a very shallow level of sleep, but they're completely immobile.
*  Or in some cases, we've, we've studied things like more traditional forms of
*  meditation, although that's less the focus these days.
*  What we find is that the brain can go into states where duration, path and outcome,
*  what, you know, cognitive processing, physical activity is impossible.
*  And the brain starts to show wave like activity that's very similar to sleep.
*  And what I didn't tell you is that we also have people do a cognitive task.
*  So while they're in a very stressful environment, like with heights or the being
*  bombarded with, you know, snake experience, or, or we have a bunch of different
*  experiences, they're required to do a cognitive task, which is a duration path
*  outcome task.
*  And then we put them into these states of pseudo sleep, and then we evaluate their
*  ability to perform in these tasks again.
*  And we, what we found is interesting.
*  What we found is that they're, first of all, these sleep like states can be very
*  restorative.
*  I imagine that you mentioned the float tank earlier, like maybe float tanks.
*  And we could talk about why the float tank would put you into a pseudo sleep like
*  state.
*  Certain substances put us into sleep like states, naps and just letting the mind
*  drift can put us into sleep like states.
*  And those sleep like states do two things that are very powerful.
*  One is they reset our ability to do these very taxing, demanding duration path
*  outcome kind of brain functions as well.
*  They allow people to access sleep more easily.
*  You know, so we want people to be able to get into deep sleep because nothing is as
*  restorative as deep sleep, because in deep sleep and in the states that I'm talking
*  about, these deeply relaxed states, duration path outcome analysis are impossible.
*  And I think being able to toggle back and forth between these states is really where
*  high performance emerges.
*  So for the very stressed human being who's suffering from generalized anxiety, we
*  study those types of patients.
*  But in addition for people who are doing well in life, but are high performers.
*  So we do some work with elite military, with some athletes.
*  We've had David Goggins out to the lab.
*  We talk about it.
*  You can't use him.
*  You can't use him.
*  So he's an extreme outlier, right?
*  He's too far on the outside.
*  So what's remarkable about him is he has figured out how to tap into.
*  He can force himself into duration path outcome.
*  Now, I don't know his state while he's running, if he's relaxed, if he's aggro the
*  whole time, I don't know.
*  But he is a bit of a mutant in the sense that, but he's created and his words, he's
*  created himself into that.
*  He's figured it out.
*  He's figured it out.
*  He was not born that way.
*  We know that.
*  Well, that's the most special thing about him really is that, and also that he's
*  willing to share that he was at one point in time, a large, fat, lazy guy, you know,
*  and then he became this savage that you see.
*  He forced his mind into that particular state.
*  Well, and the states that will allow people to go there often are fear states,
*  anxiety states, things that are extremely high pressure because the adult brain
*  especially doesn't want to change.
*  You know, we're basically born, we get wired up by our experience.
*  We get wired up by what we're exposed to.
*  Brain plasticity is very passive for the first 25 years of life.
*  You know, if you're a child, the things you hear and see and do are shaping you.
*  My kids come home saying things they've never even heard before.
*  It's amazing.
*  And as an adult, you have to crack into that neural circuitry and reshape it.
*  And why is that?
*  What is it about adults?
*  Because I have my own theory and this is just a martial arts based theory.
*  Young kids learn so fast.
*  They learn so fast.
*  But I always feel like it's because they don't have jobs.
*  They don't have a family to take care of.
*  They don't have a girlfriend who's on their back.
*  They don't have bills and the IRS breathing down their neck.
*  They don't have anything.
*  So they can just think about it and their mind, like if they have a hard drive,
*  right, and they have a one terabyte hard drive, they got like a hundred gigs full.
*  They have all this space.
*  You could fill that space up with technique and movement.
*  And it becomes their whole life because it's thrilling and it's exciting to learn
*  and their body heals quicker so they can they can force themselves into situations.
*  With adults, it's extremely difficult to find the bandwidth, to find the amount of time,
*  to really completely focus on something because you have so many distractions.
*  Does that make sense?
*  That?
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  What you just described is a beautiful description of the top contour.
*  And below that, what's happening is in childhood, the whole brain is literally more
*  plastic because there's more space for the neurons to move around and make new connections.
*  The whole environment, the chemicals that are swirling around in there are set for
*  plasticity because we were basically designed to come into the world and be
*  customized to our experience.
*  I mean, if the human animal is exceptionally good at any one thing, it's that.
*  So if you're an adult, say if you're a 35 year old man with a family or a 35 year old
*  woman with a family and a job and you want to learn a new skill, what is the best way
*  to force your brain to accept these new patterns and learn this quickly?
*  By attacking two separate parts of a process.
*  Neuroplasticity is not an event.
*  It's a process and has two parts.
*  The first one is if you want to learn and change your brain as an adult, there has to
*  be a high level of focus and engagement.
*  There's absolutely no way around this because so focus and intensity and that kind of the
*  Goggins phenotype, right?
*  I think Goggins is now a noun, a verb and a pronoun, right?
*  It's like it's amazing.
*  So if you're going to Goggins this process, we need to do is you need to regardless of
*  how agitated you feel, you have to lean in and focus extremely hard.
*  Now, the reason for that is that there's a neurochemical norepinephrine also called
*  adrenaline. Same thing that's released in the brain and body.
*  Most people back off at that point because they feel this agitation.
*  But we have to remember that that neuroadrenaline was designed to get us into movement.
*  That's the purpose of neuroadrenaline to take us out of stillness and into movement.
*  And then the other thing we have to do is we have to take that elevated level of alertness
*  and we have to focus it.
*  And there's a second neuromodulator called acetylcholine, which is secreted from this
*  little structure in the base of the forebrain when we visually focus on something.
*  Or in the case of maybe if you're doing auditory learning, when you focus with your
*  auditory attention.
*  Can I pause you there for a second?
*  Yeah.
*  So acetylcholine you could take in a supplement and norepinephrine you can actually get
*  from float ice tanks like you can get it from cryo chambers.
*  You can get it from cryotherapy.
*  So using those strategies of taking like acetylcholine is actually an alpha brain.
*  One of the supplements my company sells when you take that along with float tanks and
*  or, excuse me, cryo chambers and do some intense exercise or whatever you're trying to
*  get good at with intense focus.
*  Couldn't those things accelerate that process?
*  Almost certainly increases the plasticity, the rate of plasticity.
*  So you would recommend if someone was trying to get better at something like a cryo chamber
*  would actually accelerate the process of learning?
*  Yeah.
*  So, yes.
*  So the reason for that, though, but you don't necessarily need a cryo chamber.
*  What you need are so we have these requirements.
*  We need urgency and focus to trigger plasticity.
*  Right.
*  That's one part of the process.
*  I haven't mentioned the second part yet.
*  Neuroplasticity is triggered when urgency and focus combine.
*  Acetylcholine is released for the aficionados out there.
*  It's called the nucleus basalis, but that doesn't matter.
*  There's a little compartment of neurons in the base of your forebrain that doesn't like
*  to release acetylcholine on a regular basis.
*  It's a it's greedy.
*  It's greedy.
*  And it doesn't want to use that with your child.
*  It'll rain your brain with acetylcholine.
*  But as an adult, 30, 40 update.
*  Why is that?
*  Because, you know, Mother Nature designed us to learn what we need to learn and then
*  do that, reproduce and die.
*  I mean, not to be, you know, how rude, dark about it.
*  But I would say evolution is not about us.
*  It's about the offspring.
*  Yes.
*  100 percent.
*  You know, it's and then it's not even about them.
*  It's about their offspring.
*  Exactly.
*  Never ends.
*  We are being manipulated from the inside.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, that's what, you know, kind of drew me in neurobiology is that all these complex
*  things you see in the world, it's all internal.
*  So, you know, if you get urgency, it can come from let's use David as a he's a shining
*  example of this, right?
*  You can sit there and just ramp up your level of urgency through purely psychological
*  means. You could take an ice bath.
*  You could do high intensity breathing, anything that brings your level of alertness up.
*  Can I ask you this?
*  If you were going to try to improve your ability to get better at something, when
*  would you use that ice bath or the cryotherapy?
*  Would you use it before?
*  Would you use it afterwards?
*  Definitely before.
*  Before.
*  Before the learning.
*  What we're talking about is a two part process.
*  The first part is the learning trigger.
*  The learning trigger is gated by two things.
*  Adrenaline, which is also norepinephrine, same thing, and acetylcholine.
*  And so you need that level of alertness up and you need acetylcholine released at the
*  location in the brain that corresponds to what you're trying to learn.
*  So things like supplements and certain nutrition regimens can assist the process for
*  sure. There's no question about that.
*  Things like alpha GPC, caffeine will bring up the adrenaline and kind of anything to
*  raise that alertness.
*  Doesn't nicotine as well?
*  Nicotine has some sort of a nootropic benefit to it.
*  Not encouraging people to smoke, but you know, you could take it in various forms,
*  particularly gum.
*  I know people take it in gum just for the nootropic benefit of it.
*  Yeah, I'm not encouraging people to take anything, but there's a very,
*  very famous Nobel Prize winning neuroscientist who I went to his office to
*  visit him in New York and he chewed seven pieces of Nicorette during that half hour
*  meeting. And I was like, what is going on here?
*  And he said, well, first of all, it increases plasticity.
*  And second of all, he has the belief, and this is not a clinical study, but he
*  thinks that it can also hold off certain forms of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.
*  Didn't Bertrand Russell, wasn't he like a famous smoker?
*  Like, it wouldn't even, I don't know.
*  I think you wouldn't even go on a plane unless there was a smoking section,
*  because you couldn't imagine not having his pipe for a certain amount of time.
*  Well, creatives, you know, when I think when smoking became less in vogue, I think
*  creatives really suffered because it's very clear that so Nicorette is nicotine
*  and the acetylcholine binds to the nicotinic receptor.
*  So when you take nicotine in cigarette form or in nicorette form, you're actually
*  increasing the release of acetyl, the action of acetylcholine in the brain.
*  Yeah, I don't smoke cigarettes, but I have.
*  And the only time I have is before shows, because I have friends that are comedians
*  that would smoke and I'd be like, give me one of them things.
*  Let me see what's going on.
*  And I smoked, I was like, whoa, dude, you get high off these things.
*  This is crazy.
*  Particularly if you don't smoke cigarettes, you get this really weird high.
*  Well, your receptors have never seen that level of nicotine before.
*  Right.
*  They like that.
*  It's exciting.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And so for those moments, you know, your, your acetylcholine is like a spotlight.
*  It brings your vision literally into this more kind of portrait mode where you can
*  see more like a narrow window of what's going on.
*  There are behavioral ways to access this too, before a fight, you know, somebody's
*  really ramped up their world is not, they're not seeing everything.
*  They're probably, I've never done the walk, of course, but probably walking out to
*  the octagon, they're not seeing Elva, the color of the hat of the woman in the
*  corner, you know, they're not relaxed.
*  They're hyped up, but that's a trigger for plasticity because the brain needs
*  some way to cue this plasticity prostitute, let itself know, because it's
*  a self-learning organ, let itself know that something's really different.
*  That's adrenaline.
*  Something's changed.
*  Then there's focus.
*  What's changed.
*  So in the jujitsu example you gave earlier, it's the ability to focus on what
*  the sequence is, what happens when, and okay, I did that correctly or I didn't do
*  that correctly, but that's duration, path and outcome again, and having a
*  cedocoline and noradrenaline up, that sets the plasticity trigger.
*  However, that doesn't guarantee that those synapses are going to change.
*  It does not mean that you're necessarily going to learn.
*  Oh no.
*  What guarantees that that process will be converted into literally the change in
*  the connections between neurons, sometimes new neurons, but mostly the
*  change in the strength of the connection so that eventually you don't have to do
*  duration path outcome, you can just be reflexive about it is states of deep
*  sleep and any state where you're not doing duration path outcome.
*  So we know from two recent studies, some of this was done by my lab, but by other
*  labs as well in humans, which I think is important to distinguish between mouse
*  and human when, where we can, a lot of the changes in these brain structures
*  occurs after learning during deep sleep in particular slow wave sleep, but it
*  also occurs during periods of naps and shallow sleep, or even just periods where
*  people deliberately decompress, where they're not focusing on any one thing
*  in particular.
*  So if we were going to kind of operationalize this process, it would be
*  focused intensely, have an intense period of urgency, and then access the deepest
*  rest you can where you're not thinking about anything where space and time
*  becomes very fluid.
*  So stress in that case, post exercise or learning session would actually hinder
*  your ability to grow and get better.
*  Absolutely.
*  And elite performers like elite military, elite athletes, I'm sure you're familiar
*  with this.
*  They understand that the ability to toggle back and forth between these high alert,
*  high attentional states and deep rest is not just the key to performing what you
*  can already, what you can already do.
*  It's also the ability to get better over time.
*  You, you know, I think Goggins again is such a remarkable example because it
*  seems like it's all gas pedal, but I'm guessing I've never asked him about this,
*  but I'm guessing that he has his ways of recovering so that he can remain in that
*  heavy gas pedal all, you know, significant amount of the day all the time.
*  I don't know about that.
*  Maybe he's just all gas pedal.
*  I think he's all gas pedal.
*  I mean, he eats well.
*  I mean, you know, he does sleep, but he prides himself on his ability to just go,
*  let's go motherfucker and just force himself to do it.
*  It's so impressive because, you know, I think most everybody struggles to try and
*  get themselves in action.
*  I mean, we, we know that actions are the key to neuroplasticity.
*  I mean, yeah, you can do some mental training and that can be powerful.
*  You can do meditation.
*  You can learn to access sleep, but all that stuff, but ultimately to get better at
*  anything, you got to get your reps in whatever that is neurosurgery or running.
*  That's interesting.
*  You say that because that's what he does with his mind.
*  He's getting his reps in and he describes it.
*  He calls it armoring your mind.
*  You have to armor your mind.
*  And you know, like he, he told the story once about being on a plane.
*  Some football player said, uh, you know, how do you, you know, you, how do you keep
*  that dog alive inside of you?
*  And he goes, it is like a dog.
*  He goes, my fucking dog, if I feed my dog, he goes, and I feed him again.
*  That motherfucker is always hungry.
*  He goes, he's always hungry.
*  He's never not hungry.
*  He's like, you gotta be that dog.
*  You gotta always be there.
*  So he's always there.
*  And this doesn't mean he's not a pleasant guy.
*  I love the guy.
*  I love hanging out with him.
*  He's great.
*  He's great to have dinner with.
*  He's fun.
*  He's a good guy to be around.
*  He's not like an asshole or anything.
*  He's fun.
*  But when it's go time, he's fucking ready.
*  David, David Goggins.
*  Yeah.
*  All the time.
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  Four seven ready to go.
*  Wake them up four in the morning.
*  Time to run.
*  Let's go motherfucker.
*  You know, stay hard.
*  I mean, that's, that's what he does like all day long.
*  He is every bit as intense as that public persona.
*  When he came out to the lab, it was kind of interesting because we had just built
*  this great white shark experience and I'd gone down to Mexico.
*  We had dealt with these sharks and my friend, Michael Mueller, he's got this
*  whole thing where we could leave the cages and we did all this and it was, it
*  was fun and crazy and probably a little stupid, frankly, but we bring it back.
*  We build this VR stimulus and he and a couple of other team guys came in and.
*  You know, so I'm explaining what we're doing and we show the shark thing on the
*  screen and, and he goes, I don't like sharks.
*  And I'm thinking, okay, so we'll give them something else.
*  And then we go through the whole thing and I'm explaining how we wire people in
*  and we record from the brain.
*  And I said, all right, so who would like to try the sharks?
*  David, I'll go like just, he just wanted to be first.
*  And I realized, I was like, okay, he wasn't showboating.
*  That's just the way he is.
*  It's just, if there's something that creates that sense of agitation, that's a
*  signal for him to go forward.
*  Do you know what he does in the summers?
*  I don't.
*  He goes to Montana to fight forest fires.
*  Does he really?
*  Yeah.
*  He doesn't even make any money.
*  Amazing.
*  He just goes there.
*  He's rich and he gets fucking dropped off in Montana, in the woods camps out there
*  and fights forest fires with a bunch of other savages.
*  And he does it to keep his brain hard.
*  That's fantastic.
*  That's he's the real deal.
*  He is the real deal.
*  Imagine you got millions of dollars in the bank and you're like, I'm going to go
*  fight forest fires all summer.
*  Yeah.
*  Just to stay hard.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe I would have done that when I was a teenager to impress girls, but I don't,
*  I don't think he's 40.
*  He's doing it for him.
*  Fuck.
*  Well, that's the thing is I think that's the, that authenticity is a real thing.
*  I mean, there is a kind of a third kind of secret.
*  There is a secret sauce in this whole mix.
*  And this is kind of what brought me to some, my lab, you know, we do work with
*  typical people, but we also, and do some work with people from David's former
*  community and domestic and foreign special operations who are interested in
*  this process for obvious reasons.
*  How can you leverage the nervous system to build better, longer lasting warriors?
*  It's a really interesting question.
*  And you could do that with brain machine interface.
*  You could do that with, you can imagine doing that with drugs or with, you know,
*  supplementation or nutrition, all of that.
*  But since the nervous system sits at the foundation of any of those, we started to
*  think about this problem and there's actually another element to it, which is
*  the reward pathways involving dopamine.
*  So you asked about kids, like why they can learn all day long.
*  So their brain is very different, but it still needs some degree of focus and
*  they still need to get their sleep.
*  They'd still have to obey those two rules of this process, but they engage in
*  something else, which is really powerful, which is play.
*  A lot of their learning is through playful exchange, especially with the little kids,
*  like in kindergarten and nursery school.
*  And then as they get older, the social dynamics can be kind of harsh, but they
*  can also be really pleasureful and fun.
*  So the molecule dopamine is a really misunderstood molecule.
*  We all make it from a location in the back of our brain.
*  And people think of it as like reward, like, oh, I got a bunch of money or I, you
*  know, did a great performance.
*  Dopamine is responsible for that feeling of feeling great.
*  But in addition, dopamine is what's released any time an animal or human
*  thinks it's on the right path.
*  And that's very subjective.
*  So this is not, and I want to be really clear that this is not positive thinking
*  or, you know, the secret or telling yourself that you're performing well, even
*  when you're not.
*  Right.
*  Like if you are a rioter and you break into a courthouse, but you feel like
*  you're on the right path, you're going to get a release of dopamine.
*  Heavy.
*  Even if you're, yeah.
*  Even if you're committing a crime and you really probably shouldn't be doing that.
*  Yeah.
*  Mother nature built these systems, adrenaline, acetylcholine, dopamine, to be
*  very generic in terms of what can activate them on purpose.
*  You know, cocaine will cause a tremendous release of dopamine.
*  So will methamphetamine.
*  The problem is it sets a focus on just getting more of that thing.
*  Right.
*  So dopamine is evoked through play.
*  It's evoked through humor, right?
*  If you've ever just been working like mad or you see this in, you know, team guys
*  know this really well that, you know, cause they tell me that you can be in the
*  worst situation and somebody will crack a joke.
*  And all of a sudden it's like, you have energy.
*  Now that couldn't have been glycogen.
*  That wasn't cause you're ketogenic.
*  It wasn't cause you're whatever that's neural energy.
*  And that neural energy is dopamine.
*  Is that what happens when you hear a great song and you get pumped up?
*  Is that the same thing?
*  Absolutely.
*  And the reason dopamine is so powerful in this process of neural plasticity is
*  that dopamine has the ability to buffer nor adrenaline.
*  So that stress that you feel when you're in effort, it's very hard for
*  most people to keep that going.
*  But when you get a shot, I mean, internal release of dopamine through humor or
*  through the sense that you're on the right path, let's take the fight example
*  where it's stressful and you're getting beaten down.
*  All of a sudden you land one or you do something properly and the other guy
*  starts to timber a little bit or shuffle a little bit, you gain a chemical
*  advantage and it comes in two forms.
*  One is it triggers marking of the synapses that likely will change later.
*  We rarely forget the events associated with dopamine for that reason, because
*  they signal, Oh, whatever's happening now, that was good.
*  And in addition to that, they start pushing back on the level of
*  acetylcholine, excuse me, nor adrenaline in the brainstem.
*  And this is crucial because there was a study that came out two years ago, not
*  from my group that asked, why do we quit?
*  You know, if you set, you know, 800 or even 500 pounds on the bar out there, I
*  can't lift it.
*  So I'm not talking about that kind of quitting.
*  I'm talking about a long run.
*  Why do I quit?
*  If I'm not injured, like what actually causes quitting?
*  When do we decide that something is futile?
*  And it turns out that for every bit of effort, any bit of ever lifting a glass
*  of water or running up a hill or in a fight, there are little bits of us of nor
*  adrenaline, adrenaline that are released in the brain and body.
*  And there's a counter, there's a cell type, which are called glia, which
*  literally means glue in Latin.
*  These cells are paying attention to how much norepinephrine is coming.
*  And if it hits a certain threshold, the brain stops voluntary control over the
*  muscular, she says, that's it.
*  I quit.
*  And there are these beautiful experiments where they manipulate the visual
*  environment so that this isn't there.
*  Certain that this isn't lack of muscle fuel, this or liver fuel.
*  This is lack of neural fuel.
*  Dopamine pushes back that level of noradrenaline and it gives you more gas.
*  It lets you go further.
*  And you see this through teamwork.
*  When you feel like you're supported, when you're in cohesion, humor, play, if, you
*  know, if you're in serious effort and it's just, things are going terribly.
*  Maybe I've never done comedy, but you're trying to write a joke and it's just
*  frustrating. And then suddenly you just kind of laugh at how ridiculous the
*  process is.
*  There's a kind of loosening or a lightning and you have more energy.
*  That energy is reductions in epinephrine.
*  And so I don't know how David Goggins has done it, but everyone does this a
*  little bit differently, but it could be, and I'm speculating here, of course,
*  never done the neurology, but that David has somehow figured out that the leaning
*  in process for him is the dopamine trigger.
*  Like there is a kind of sicko thing about the way he talks about it.
*  Like it's like a, it's a little bit masochistic.
*  And for him, maybe it was that way.
*  And it's rooted in his origin story for other people.
*  They find this in purpose, like that you're doing this for your kids or you're
*  doing this for somebody else.
*  You know, I think that the human animal has a capacity to push, has a capacity to
*  focus, has a capacity to learn at all ages.
*  But these gates on plasticity are set by certain requirements.
*  And, you know, when I look out there and I see all the stuff about, you know,
*  psychology and all of self-help and wellness stuff, you know, I'm a
*  neuroscientist, though I look at the lens of everything through neurochemicals
*  and neuroscience, but it all kind of boils down to a couple of basic chemicals
*  and systems or what we call circuits in the brain.
*  What's the difference between noradrenaline and norepinephrine?
*  Yeah, great question.
*  So same thing.
*  So adrenaline and, and norepinephrine, excuse me, adrenaline and epinephrine,
*  same thing, same thing.
*  Norepinephrine and noradrenaline, those two things are the same thing.
*  It was a naming war.
*  So scientists are like, they have egos, some more than others.
*  And there was a naming battle.
*  And so if you go to Australia, they call it one thing in England.
*  They called it another.
*  And basically it was two labs discovered the same thing.
*  And it was a pissing competition.
*  Oh, well, how confusing for everybody else.
*  Exactly.
*  And you can find that over and over and over again in science, because no one
*  ever comes in with a gavel within like nomenclature committee and says, we're
*  just going to call it this.
*  Noradrenaline so much easier to say.
*  It is stick with that.
*  Nor epinephrine.
*  Like I've fucked that up a hundred times.
*  Well, and it gets worse because like you think about the autonomic nervous system
*  and they're like sympathetic, parasympathetic, sympathetic sounds like
*  sympathy, but it's actually the stress state.
*  Do you think that you would benefit from data from real world situations in a
*  much more comprehensive way than you would from these virtual situations you're
*  putting people in?
*  Because I, you know, we have a VR thing out here.
*  We have a, an Oculus and it's pretty cool.
*  And there's one of them where you walk on a plank and you really do feel like this
*  plank is over, like it's on the 60th floor of a building and it goes out a window.
*  And you really do feel like you're kind of, but you know, you're not right.
*  It's a diff.
*  There's a difference.
*  Right.
*  You get a little bit of it, but you don't get the real thing.
*  Like, like being in the jungle and the leaves part, and there's a real tiger in
*  front of you.
*  The feeling that you would get would probably be, you probably wouldn't be able
*  to recreate it with virtual reality.
*  There's some part of your brain that knows this is bullshit.
*  Yeah.
*  So we have three, three laboratories to explore this.
*  One is the virtual reality and virtual reality can give you what the scientists
*  call presence, the sense that you're really in that environment.
*  And that's mainly visually and auditory driven.
*  My colleague, Jeremy Bailenson, who's on the, I'm in the medical campus.
*  He's on the other campus.
*  He's studied this a lot.
*  Like what are the requirements for getting people to feel presence?
*  So people who come to our lab, they don't think they're underwater with a shark,
*  unless they're afraid of great white sharks.
*  And for that moment where one of these guys is coming in and it opens its jaws
*  for that person, it's every bit as scary as the real experience.
*  No way.
*  If you look at their auto, well, we don't know cause we don't put them in the
*  water, but I just can't imagine.
*  Well, here's the, here's the check.
*  Close.
*  I agree.
*  I mean, here's the challenge.
*  We needed to, we need to stress people and we needed to do it really well for a lab.
*  And if you look historically, the experiments that came before ours were really lame.
*  It was like picture of someone with a knife in their arm.
*  For some people that's gross.
*  For some people that's scary, but that's not really fear, right?
*  Or they'd startle people, but I can jump out of, you know, probably not to you,
*  but I could jump out in front of a typical person with a teddy bear and they'll
*  get startled.
*  Doesn't matter.
*  It's a teddy bear.
*  So that's different.
*  That's not fear.
*  So VR allows us to access States.
*  The more sensory stuff that we can include the better.
*  There are some now that include smell.
*  We have that we're working with augmented reality.
*  So, uh, which is a little bit like the star wars thing of projecting a chess
*  board, that kind of thing.
*  We find people's pain points, meaning we find the places in which we can trigger
*  their autonomic function.
*  We also run studies outside the lab.
*  So I have a large scale study running right now with David Spiegel, my colleague
*  in psychiatry, where people are equipped with whoop bands.
*  So we're monitoring sleep.
*  We're going to expand this to include some other devices that actually allow us
*  to look at a heart rate variability and body cavitation and some other things in
*  some interesting ways, but also body position.
*  So we're tracking them 24 hours a day.
*  And those people are reporting back to us, levels of stress, life events,
*  that kind of thing.
*  So this is outside the laboratory, but we can do this in real world essentially.
*  And those people were using interventions, which are mainly respiration based.
*  So, which are looking at specific patterns of breathing that trigger particular
*  states in the brainstem that allow people to either sleep better or buffer their
*  stress in response to life events better.
*  So this isn't really breath work as much as it is teaching them specific patterns
*  of breathing that capture these neurons that switch their brain states.
*  It really is fascinating that these periods of rest are crucial to learning
*  and developing.
*  They're absolutely crucial.
*  They are there every bit as much a part of the process as the actual trigger
*  event.
*  And I was the athletes, the people, the high performers that I've encountered are
*  all really good at accessing those states.
*  Also, is it, is there a desirable ratio?
*  Right.
*  So you want to focus as long as you can focus well, and then probably a little
*  bit longer because there's also plasticity of the circuits, the control
*  focus.
*  So as, so going back to your jujitsu example, as you get to the point where
*  you're starting to not be able to do this duration path outcome stuff, which
*  involves motor movements and mental thinking, you were saying you're getting
*  tired.
*  You're literally going into a sort of sleep like state where space and time
*  duration path outcome becomes hard.
*  What you can do at that point is to start buffering the nor, nor adrenaline nor
*  open effort.
*  Now I don't know which one to say, but I'll just keep going with whichever is
*  reflexive and you can start to buffer that through things like humor, through
*  things like setting the urgency higher.
*  That is not a time to relax and taper out.
*  That's a time to ratchet up the intensity if you want to grab a stronger trigger.
*  So, but that period can't last infinitely.
*  And the question is how long?
*  Well, we know that you can do more short bouts of that each day than you could
*  ever do one long, long bout.
*  We know that.
*  So you could maybe do two or three bouts of that a day, or if you are doing it
*  several times a week, you basically want to dose it about twice as much as deep
*  stress as you do the deep focus, excuse me, deep sleep as you do the deep focus.
*  So if you're, I don't know how long these training regimes go, but part of that
*  training is reflexive for you.
*  I wouldn't count that in the learning process because it's dialed into your
*  nervous system, but at the point where it becomes challenging, a clock sort of
*  starts and when that period ends, I think at least double that amount of time of
*  deep rest, if you want to maximize learning.
*  There's been a lot of work done on visualization and learning through
*  visualization, and they found that you can get a similar benefit to actual
*  physical training, obviously not with the endurance and the strength and all those
*  other things, but in terms of skill learning, you get a similar benefit from
*  an equal time of visualization.
*  What, what do you attribute that to?
*  Like how, how is it visualization?
*  How can you learn things through visualizing?
*  Yeah.
*  So that's visualizing is setting the brain through these duration path
*  outcome circuitry loops.
*  It's, it's running the script essentially.
*  And it's important to move the musculature.
*  It's important to say the words.
*  If you're say, you know, learning a motor skill or learning a movement,
*  a language, excuse me, but at some level, the brain doesn't really know
*  what's going on in the body.
*  It's the command center, except what signals it receives back from the body.
*  And so if the visualization is intense, the brain isn't completely
*  convinced, but it's pretty convinced that you're actually experiencing
*  that thing and rehearsing it.
*  It's a little bit of your own internally driven virtual reality is what you're
*  doing.
*  And so you're creating.
*  And so I think mental training is powerful, but there's no
*  replacement for repetition.
*  So what about you?
*  Obviously physical training has its limitations in your, your body's ability
*  to keep doing the movements.
*  You're going to get tired and you're going to break down.
*  Would it be more beneficial to get more rest or would it be more beneficial to
*  get rest, but also spend a significant amount of time visualizing?
*  We haven't looked at visualization specifically.
*  The one thing that is very close to visualization, which is very powerful
*  based on neuroimaging studies.
*  So legitimate science, I should say is hypnosis.
*  Hypnosis is really unique state.
*  And this is of mind and body.
*  Have you been hypnotized?
*  Many times.
*  Yeah.
*  And I'm very interested in hypnosis because of the work with Spiegel and the
*  incredible success that he's had with pain management, smoking sensation, these
*  kinds of things.
*  Hypnosis is a state of deep relaxation, not unlike sleep, but also deep focus.
*  So it's very unlike any other state of mind.
*  You're either usually asleep or you're focused or somewhere in between kind of
*  drifting back and forth in between.
*  But hypnosis is a deliberate narrowing of context.
*  So the person or the audio script is bringing you into a state of mind that's
*  centered around particular types of events, but you're in deep rest.
*  And the idea is that you're taking that plasticity process of focus and urgency
*  and then rest, and you're combining them into a single session.
*  And so hypnosis and deep hypnotic states are the place where neuroplasticity can
*  be accelerated.
*  So when you say hypnosis, what kind of sessions are you talking about and how
*  often, like say if you're an athlete, like let's say maybe you're a basketball
*  player and you want to get better at basketball.
*  You train as much as you possibly can, but there's limitations to that.
*  You sleep as much as you possibly can.
*  How often would you recommend someone doing some sort of a hypnosis?
*  Session to try to improve their skills.
*  Probably one.
*  Well, it depends on how intense their training is for some of the people I'm
*  doing work with in, in athletics and in the military community, uh, you might,
*  they have extremely demanding lives, right?
*  And certainly for the military folks, it's, you know, high risk, high consequence,
*  you know, even when they're in non-deployment.
*  So under those conditions, maybe every day, 30, 30 to 45 minutes as a replacement
*  for some other standard form of nap or meditation.
*  I mean, not necessarily lumped on top of that.
*  So the standard eight hour sleep and then on top of that, some sort of meditation
*  for like 30 minutes, like, yeah, there's a, um, a process of doing this.
*  We have a script that we use in our lab.
*  I'd be happy to send it to you.
*  That takes you into these deep, uh, sort of relaxation states.
*  They're sort of meditative.
*  Some people can self-hypnose by induce, you know, some people call them
*  intentions mount like that, cause it sounds a little bit too much like a
*  uncomfortable set of yoga classes I've taken where they start with though.
*  I don't know really what that's about.
*  And they make you use complete declarative sentences.
*  It feels weird to me.
*  Um, that's just my own bias.
*  Um,
*  Oh, they mean they make you set your intentions.
*  Like I am this, this, and this or say it out loud or, oh, no, I would not.
*  I would send me out of the room.
*  Yeah.
*  Even though it's like this, right?
*  Well, if they combine the up speak, then I'd probably, yeah.
*  Intentions.
*  Then I'd, then I'd file a complaint, but, um, yeah, they even, sometimes it's
*  really bad sometimes they even make you work a pronoun into it.
*  So you'd have to say, Joe, you know, anytime someone's fake pronoun, like one
*  of the new ones, that's, that's it.
*  I don't know.
*  You might, I don't even know how to go there.
*  You stunned, you stunned me.
*  Um, probably, probably we're all going to be required to at some point.
*  Um, maybe not.
*  Maybe not.
*  Um, hypnosis is powerful.
*  And I think stage hypnosis has done a great disservice, no disrespect to the
*  stage hypnotist out there to detract from the power of hypnosis as a medical
*  tool and a high performance tool.
*  For my own personal experience is that, uh, I didn't understand what hypnosis was.
*  Um, my first experiences with hypnosis where there was a guy named Frank Santos.
*  It's a famous in the Boston area.
*  He's a very famous comedy hypnotist.
*  And he was an actual hypnotist would, would hypnotize people and get them to
*  quit smoking things along those lines.
*  But then would do this comedy hypnotism show where he would get people on stage
*  and man, like we would walk me and a bunch of other comedians would go and
*  watch it every week because it was crazy.
*  He would put them under, they would definitely be under and they would
*  think they were having sex.
*  They would think they'd be in a boat.
*  They'd think they'd be in the water.
*  They, it was weird.
*  It was really weird to watch.
*  And I always just thought it was like really weak minded people.
*  My thought was, and obviously I'm 21 at the time.
*  I didn't know anything, but my thought at the time was, okay, there's certain
*  people that are just, they have nine volt brains and you can trick them into
*  doing anything and that explains cults and a lot of other shit and televangelists
*  and all sorts of nonsense that should be like really obviously fake to people,
*  but they fall into it anyway.
*  And so that's what I thought.
*  I thought it was just really dumb people that he was tricking.
*  Well, some people are more easily hypnotized than others.
*  And it's, it's actually pretty predictable.
*  There's actually a test that we could do right now that yeah.
*  So can you do it to me?
*  Uh, yeah, I can use the one that, that Spiegel taught me, which is, so you look
*  up at the ceiling and you're going to look and now try and now close your
*  eyelids.
*  Uh, you're not very hypnotizable.
*  How's that?
*  Look up one more time and then close.
*  Yeah.
*  So probably not as hypnotizable.
*  Why?
*  So for people that are very hypnotizable.
*  Is that a word?
*  Uh, yes, it is hypnotizable.
*  At least if it's not, then I, I just, I'm stamping it in nowadays.
*  I just, I'll put a Wikipedia entry.
*  It'll be there.
*  No, I don't know.
*  I, I've heard Spiegel use it before.
*  Susceptible to hypnosis.
*  Um, I asked Spiegel how you measure this kind of back of the envelope, you know,
*  curbside consult as they call it.
*  And people who are more hypnotizable, their eyelids will flutter in an attempt
*  to go down.
*  The reason is that a lot of hypnosis is anchored on the ability to go into these
*  deep, really relaxed states.
*  And some people's autonomic nervous system gets locked in a state of more, excuse
*  me, of a more attention and kind of higher levels of alertness or levels of
*  sleepiness.
*  So think about like a seesaw.
*  So you can either be really stressed.
*  So when you're really stressed, like you're analyzing time, you're analyzing
*  space differently, duration path outcome, what's going to happen?
*  When's it going to happen?
*  Real emergency.
*  The other state would be sleep, right?
*  That's the other extreme duration path and outcome are essentially non-existent
*  space and time are fluid, whatever the hinge in the middle of that seesaw for
*  some people is very tight.
*  They get locked over here or locked over there.
*  They can't get the energy or they can't de-stress.
*  Hypnosis involves taking somebody from a state of alertness like you and I are in
*  now and bringing them into a almost sleep-like state.
*  Now, for some people, their autonomic nervous system isn't that willing to do
*  that. It's almost like the hinge on that seesaw is locked.
*  It doesn't want to budge.
*  And this fluttering of the eyelids is reflective of a peripheral nerve, believe
*  or not, that originates in the brainstem.
*  That's a central part of the autonomic nervous system.
*  The other thing that they'll do, you ever see on the stage hypnosis where they'll
*  have people look up at the ceiling and then they'll sometimes shine a light in
*  their eyes or they'll like have them look at a light.
*  They're looking at how how we call it labile, but how rigid or labile,
*  how willing to move the pupils are because autonomic arousal impacts the
*  pupils of the eye. So it's an external read of what's going on in the brain.
*  A lot of people don't know this, but your eyes are not connected to your brain.
*  Your eyes are brain.
*  They are central nervous system and their brain, your neural retinas that
*  you use for seeing things around you are part of the central nervous system.
*  They are the way that you know when to be alert and to be asleep.
*  And they are two pieces of brain that during development got squeezed out of
*  the skull and placed outside the skull.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah. They're the only two pieces of your brain that are outside your skull,
*  assuming that you don't have some sort of damage.
*  That is fucking crazy.
*  Your eyes are a part of your brain.
*  Yeah. And that's why when people tell me, oh, you know, the eyes are the
*  window to the soul. I'm like, well, look, I don't know about souls,
*  but they are definitely your brain.
*  So when I look at you and now it's weird cause I'm looking at, you know,
*  we're not looking at each other's pupils. Right.
*  But when the hypnotist, I should say, looks at the pupils, they're saying,
*  you know, the pupil size is a direct readout of, of that, of how loose that
*  hinge is. So when they shine light in someone's eyes and they take it away and
*  they go, that's so weird that you can look in someone's eyes and there's
*  something about, like, you can kind of tell what kind of a person they are.
*  In some ways, or at least tell how they're thinking.
*  Like if someone's uncomfortable being around you, like, you could see it in their
*  eyes. If you tried to write that down, like, what are you seeing?
*  You try to explain it to someone. Good luck. Good luck writing that down.
*  I don't know what that is. Like, but I know when someone's full of shit, right?
*  Like if someone's lying to me or bullshitting me, I'm not always aware,
*  but I'm aware a lot. You know?
*  Well, and it's not just their individual eyes,
*  but it's also the way that they focus their eyes. So, um,
*  you know, the myth of the cyclops, right? One eye in the middle of the head.
*  That myth has origins in the fact that the cyclops was one dimensional anger.
*  And it turns out that when we are experienced an increase in autonomic
*  arousal, so let's say we decide we're going to fight,
*  we decide we're going to learn, or maybe we're just,
*  we're going to write something important. Something's important. Our eyes,
*  the pupils change shape, but because our eyes don't really move in our skull,
*  they actually do what's called foveate in a little bit. They,
*  there's an eye musculature reflex that gets triggered in.
*  And so you can see that sometimes in people that are getting ready to fight,
*  their eyes are actually brought inward.
*  That triggers another neural circuit to increase levels of autonomic arousal and
*  starts deploying resources internally, fuel resources, fuel for,
*  you know, bouts of, of intense stuff, whatever that intense thing is going to be.
*  When we're relaxed, like we view a horizon or we're just walking,
*  or we're in what's called optic flow. When things are flowing past us,
*  we go into panoramic vision. So in panoramic vision,
*  you go out of that soda straw view of the world,
*  and you start being able to see the corners of the room, the ceiling, the floor,
*  and what's, and that's a relaxed state.
*  So sometimes we're even subconsciously perceiving how stressed or relaxed
*  somebody is, not by necessarily their pupils, although that might play into it.
*  It certainly has a role,
*  but whether or not based on your prior kind of intuitive knowledge about that
*  person, whether or not they're like Cyclops or whether or not they're in panoramic
*  vision. And this is important because it changes the way we perceive time.
*  If we are in Cyclops vision, soda straw view, that high intensity,
*  we tend to do two things. One is we tend to be more in tune with what's going on
*  inside us. We start, you know, the brain does this other thing,
*  which is called interoception.
*  It's like paying attention to what's going on inside us versus outside us.
*  And when we're stressed, time outside of seems to go really slowly.
*  It's like you're in the security line at the airport and you need to get your
*  flight.
*  It's a very different perception of the person in front of you and what they're
*  doing than when you're relaxed and you got plenty of time.
*  And that's because outside events start to feel slower.
*  This is why after a car crash, people will say, you know, oh,
*  everything was in slow motion or I've never actually looked at fighters,
*  but I visited the UFC training center, Duncan French.
*  I went out there and talked to him about this. Shout out to Duncan. Yeah.
*  He's he's done some beautiful,
*  his graduate thesis is like this beautiful work related to this.
*  Although not directly has important implications for this,
*  which is when you're in these high adrenaline states,
*  you parse time differently. And when I hear about fighters, you know, say,
*  like being able to time the fight or they,
*  it's almost like they can see things coming in slow motion.
*  That's because their internal level of arousal is really, really high,
*  but it feels like relaxation. So there's like sleepy, not feeling so good.
*  Everything feels like it's going on really fast. I can't deal with life.
*  Then you ramp up your level of intensity and everything outside you feels like
*  it's going a little slower. Maybe you're matched to that.
*  Like I'm a pretty high intensity guy. When I'm in New York, I feel great,
*  at least before the COVID thing, people walking down the street,
*  I finally feel like the tempo is kind of matched between internal and external.
*  But is that why like those high functioning people enjoy Manhattan?
*  Yeah, there's a wide neurotic people like, yeah, you take a neurotic person,
*  you put them in Manhattan. They're like, yeah, yeah. They love it. Yeah.
*  A lot of my friends that are neurotic, they love it there. Yeah.
*  I come from neurotic lineage.
*  I'm constantly trying to get to the other part of the seesaw, but, but I get it.
*  You know, I get out of the subway in New York and I'm like the walking speed,
*  the speed of everything. It just,
*  I finally feel like internal to external match.
*  Does this thing that connects the fluttering of the eyelids to being able to
*  be hypnotized more easily, does that coincide with a personality variable?
*  Not that I'm aware of. I'd have to ask David,
*  I don't want to throw something out there that's wrong. I'd have to ask him,
*  there, there's a whole set of personality traits and coping traits that relate to
*  hypnotize ability. There's a small subset of people that just cannot be hypnotized.
*  You can't, you can't really force hypnotism on people.
*  But is it, they cannot,
*  or they are not willing to let themselves be because I've been hypnotized.
*  My friend Vinny Schorman, he works with fighters. He's a, he hypnotized,
*  he calls it a mental coaching, but he, and I was like,
*  I want to know what you're doing. Like he's been on my podcast before.
*  I'm like, do it to me. Let's see. What's up. It was very weird.
*  Did you find it beneficial?
*  I think I did. I mean, I only did it once, but I was,
*  I was kind of stunned by it. I'm like, oh,
*  this is a weird state where you're kind of there, but not there. Like,
*  it's not like you don't know what's going on. You do know what's going on,
*  but you're in this weird sort of quasi relaxed, sleepy thing.
*  It's a very unusual state. This match of high focus,
*  deep relaxation is not a brain state that we can
*  access very easily without a hypnotist. I mean, there are other ways to do it,
*  but that state would be super beneficial for people
*  wanting to learn something because it would relax them much more deeply
*  than it would just ordinarily everyday life while you're conscious.
*  That's right.
*  It's taking the two pieces of the plasticity puzzle and putting them in the
*  same event.
*  So I don't think it should be the only way to learn new things because there
*  are things you can't do in hypnosis, like, like roll jujitsu. I mean,
*  for instance, but as a tool for accessing faster learning,
*  it's quite powerful. Just like sleep. I mean,
*  I think the work of Matt Walker and Bill Dement at Stanford and others had just
*  shown, like, if you want to pull someone apart,
*  you want to just make them insane and unable to do these duration path outcome,
*  you know, mental operations, you sleep to practice them.
*  There's a thing that people do,
*  the sort of reductionist dismissive way of viewing meditation and viewing states
*  of mind. That is really weird to me because smart people do it occasionally.
*  And there's a guy that I think is very smart and he was talking about it on
*  Twitter, like mocking meditation.
*  Well, and I was like, man, this is a guy who's probably never really meditated.
*  Well, meditation, you know, I guess growing up in Northern California,
*  the whole mindfulness thing, that's the problem. So it's the stuff,
*  it's the stuff around it often, you know,
*  and I think this is why like it's exciting that respiration slash breath work is
*  now making a, you know,
*  a big showing in the world because I think it has tremendous value.
*  I think that it's the stuff around it that causes problems and can get it pushed
*  into like the naming. I mean, like, I mean,
*  I have nothing against yoga. I mean, there's a lot of powerful tools in yoga,
*  but it's the Ashundas and the none, all the stuff around it makes it sound a
*  little bit like religion and a lot of people in medical communities and other
*  religious communities back off from that.
*  Well, there's a problem with yoga that I actually had a conversation with my yoga
*  instructor about because I do a Beakroom class and they say things in the class,
*  like you're massaging, you're descending, calling. I'm like, no, you're not.
*  You're definitely not doing that. You should probably stop saying that,
*  because that's not really possible.
*  You're not massaging your fucking colon while you're stretching. That's,
*  that's nonsense. Are you, are you increasing your flexibility? Yes.
*  Are you strengthening your, your, your balance and your stability? 100%.
*  But there's so much nonsense that goes with it that they, you know,
*  if you talk to a doctor, they're like, uh-uh, you're not doing that.
*  Cause I have talked to doctors. I'm like, okay, before I criticize this,
*  is it even possible that this is going on? Like, no.
*  Right. And the medical community can be a little bit too one-sided as well.
*  But, um, you know, I think Stanford's a very progressive place.
*  The fact that Spiegel and I have this study looking at respiration and its
*  impact, I think is a sign that the times are changing. Um,
*  we're not doing this in any kind of mystical way.
*  The fact that people in military special operations and athletics are starting to
*  think about the mind and the tools to access the mind is a sign that there's
*  been a tide change.
*  I had James Nestor on the podcast recently and we talked about his new book
*  breath and just the,
*  the ability to control various aspects of your nervous system and even your
*  immune system through breath work. It's very confusing because everybody breathes.
*  So you can, we're all, you and I are both breathing right now.
*  We're not doing breathing exercises, but we're breathing.
*  So what is it about breathing exercises that accentuate these,
*  these aspects of autonomic system and sympathetic system?
*  Like what's going on?
*  Um, first of all, I think James book is great. It's amazing. Uh, you know,
*  it sounds like I'm just shamelessly plugging Stanford constantly, but you know,
*  like most of the studies he was referring to were done by my colleagues,
*  the Paul Ehrlich, Sandra Khan, stuff in my lab. Um, Mark Krasno, these are,
*  these are people,
*  these are serious scientists and serious physicians who are saying, look,
*  respiration has an important role in balancing oxygen and carbon dioxide in,
*  in the body and in the brain.
*  And that has an important impact on states of mind and body.
*  I think that's just no medical professional, uh,
*  presuming there any good could argue that. So take, for instance, um,
*  Mark Krasno's lab and a neighboring lab at Stanford discovered that animals and
*  people periodically throughout sleep and throughout the day will do what's called
*  a physiological sigh. These have been known about since the thirties,
*  but it turns out there's a set of neurons in your brainstem and my brainstem
*  that every once in a while on the level of carbon dioxide in your bloodstream
*  gets too high. You do a double inhale and an extended exhale.
*  So it's sort of like two inhales through the nose and extended exhale.
*  Your dog does this right before it goes down for now. Yeah.
*  To offload carbon dioxide, that double inhale.
*  I don't think James talked about this. Um, if he did forgive me, um,
*  the double inhale maximally inflates the little sacks in the lungs,
*  the ovule of the lungs,
*  and that pulls carbon dioxide out of the bloodstream at a higher level so that
*  you offload it more in the exhale. Now,
*  these physiological sighs are the fastest way that I'm aware of from work in our
*  lab and with Spiegel to take the,
*  that seesaw from too high level of stress to a little bit calmer,
*  double inhale, exhale. So this is in breath work.
*  This is a set of neurons that every kid and every adult has,
*  they use periodically, but we can also consciously control through the diaphragm.
*  So that's one way to bring things more calm. I think, you know,
*  James talked about this in his book, but those breath work of the sort where,
*  you know, kind of two more type breathing of doing, you know,
*  30 inhales and really offloading a lot of carbon dioxide that causes the
*  release of noradrenaline, nor epinephrine and noradrenaline,
*  nor epinephrine are mother nature's way of buffering us against
*  infection and disease. Everyone thinks stress kills your immune system.
*  It's the opposite stress activates your immune system. And that makes sense.
*  If we suddenly had to forage or go out and find water,
*  we need two or three days and we didn't know what we were going to,
*  you can't afford to get sick. This is why if you work, work, work, work, work,
*  and then you finally rest,
*  you're more likely to get sick as you go into that more parasympathetic
*  relaxed state. Cause your immune system also gets shut off.
*  Is that why people in prison that are getting COVID-19 are not really getting
*  sick? There's so many of them that are asymptomatic.
*  Could be. I didn't realize they were asymptomatic.
*  Or if you're very stressed for a very long time,
*  eventually the immune system can't deploy these killer cells that it needs to
*  deploy.
*  So there's a certain amount of stress that's actually beneficial to you and your
*  immune system. Right. But I get very, um,
*  I start doing eye rolls and I get a little frustrated when people are like
*  adrenal burnout. Look,
*  your adrenals were designed to take you through two lifetimes if you need to.
*  The idea that your adrenals are just going to shrivel up into, you know,
*  somebody told me that their doctor told them that coffee's giving them adrenal
*  burnout. Is that nonsense?
*  I want to see, I mean, I teach neuroanatomy, show me adrenal burnout,
*  show me an adrenals that won't secrete adrenaline anymore.
*  So why are they saying that? Like, where'd that come from?
*  Sounds good. Sounds better than parasympathetic sympathetic. Yeah.
*  Yeah. That's like this doctor was telling my friend that drinking coffee is
*  burning out his adrenals.
*  Yeah. I mean,
*  it may be putting them into a state of heightened activation and they can't
*  take it down a notch in the evening. They don't know how to relax.
*  They don't know how to turn on the parasympathetic nervous system without doing
*  things like eating or something, which is one way to do it. But,
*  and I think as a society, we're struggling to manage this seesaw. I mean,
*  we know that being in a chronic state of stress is bad physically.
*  You don't want to do that, but you also don't want to do it for your mind.
*  I mean, anytime you're stressed,
*  you're also able to be recruited better by other people's stress. We know that.
*  Recruited by other people's stress.
*  Yeah. So my lab has also looked at like how stress spreads between people,
*  how the autonomic nervous systems communicate.
*  And we know that the best way to get what's called emotional contagion is to get
*  people into a heightened state of alertness. I'm guessing,
*  and I have no knowledge of comedy whatsoever,
*  but I'm guessing that the comedian that's less funny that comes out before the
*  main person, I'm guessing they're trying to get them like ramped up.
*  You can create a more emotional contagion.
*  You have to take them from the floor all the way up to the ceiling,
*  kind of get them up a level. Is that right? Or am I way off base with that?
*  Well, it's interesting that you put it that way.
*  It's actually a problem that comedians that have sensitive egos will bring less
*  funny comedians with them on the road. So they look better. And,
*  it's like amongst elite comics,
*  it's actually very frowned upon because it's you're setting yourself up to look
*  like a hero.
*  You rescue the audience from some terrible comedian that you had open for you.
*  If you, you could judge the ego or the health of the ego of the headliner by
*  what kind of comedians they consistently take with them on the road. I mean,
*  you know, everybody has bad sets occasionally,
*  but a lot of times these weak minded guys will bring these terrible comedians on
*  the road with them. Interesting. Yeah. It's,
*  but the reason is because they don't want to be outshined. That's what it is.
*  Makes sense. Yeah. Well, that's anchored in a neurobiological phenomenon.
*  Forgive me. This is all I think about called dopamine reward prediction error.
*  So it's, it's very simple. Really.
*  It basically says that the degree to which something feels really good or you
*  experienced it as great could be a great meal or comedy set from the perspective
*  of the audience,
*  of course is going to depend on how much dopamine you got before.
*  So if I tell you we're going to go to a restaurant tonight, this is amazing.
*  I got the most amazing stakes, amazing stakes. And we get there.
*  There's a higher probability that steak isn't going to taste great to you.
*  Really? Absolutely. Reward prediction error means that what if it's really great,
*  it has to exceed the dopamine that you had and root.
*  You can't bullshit people. That's what you're saying.
*  You basically can't bullshit people. Right?
*  Well there's something that does happen.
*  There's a contagion that does happen when people are funny,
*  where it's contagious and everyone around you starts laughing more because
*  there's more people around you laughing.
*  Like if I'm in a room and there's a funny comedian on stage and there's a bunch
*  of people to my left and right that are laughing really hard,
*  I'm more likely to laugh. Right. There's something weird that goes on.
*  And one of the things that I've always said about standup is I think it's
*  kind of a mass hypnosis. It's not just funny, you know,
*  because if it was funny,
*  there's these comics that are doing these zoom comedy shows and I,
*  I encourage them to all stop doing it immediately because it's fucking terrible.
*  Even great comics look fucking terrible because you're lacking that critical
*  element of an audience.
*  Standup comedy is one of the rare art forms you really can't do on your own.
*  You have to do it in front of people.
*  And I think what's happening is when it's not just when the person's on
*  stage, it's really good. It's not just that they're funny.
*  It's not just their timing is excellent.
*  It's not just they have these really,
*  really insightful ways of looking at things that make you laugh.
*  It's also that you're around a bunch of other people that are experiencing it
*  together. And when that person's good, you are allowing them to think for you.
*  There's some weird, like if I'm watching a guy on stage and he's really good or
*  girl on stage, she's really good. When someone's killing,
*  I'm allowing that person to think for me. I'm like sitting there,
*  just like, go ahead, take me for a ride. Let's go. And,
*  and then they're making you laugh, but it's,
*  you're also aware that you're in it with these other people.
*  So you have this enhanced state because all these other people are around you and
*  you're all experiencing it together.
*  This is I don't know much about comedy at all. So forgive me.
*  But comedy to me is very interesting because it's a,
*  and I don't know how the comedy scripts are written,
*  but I find them incredibly fascinating because it seems like almost all jokes
*  are a break from the space time rule that the brain expects.
*  Close contact card magicians do this very well too.
*  It's like you're expecting something to happen and I think he's going there.
*  So it's sort of duration path outcome like this.
*  And then all of a sudden you get hit with something that's surprising.
*  This is probably not funny. Maybe it is to you or not,
*  but there's a Steve Martin thing from way back when where he,
*  he basically does comedy for dogs or something. He brings out dogs and, and,
*  and it's a perfect example of just breaking all the rules.
*  The dogs are telling him what to do. And at first it's not funny.
*  And then he keeps going with it. And what you realize is he's,
*  I don't want to use the word hypnotize incorrectly here,
*  but he's bringing you into a reality where the dogs are setting the rules.
*  And it's hilarious because the brain, when it sees surprise,
*  it could be a card that you know, you pick, and then I tear it up.
*  And then you've suddenly produce it from my shoe or something like that.
*  Extreme magician type stuff or really funny joke.
*  It's like the brain wants to go one place.
*  And when something unexpected happens, dopamine is released. We know this.
*  It's like surge of dopamine. And all of a sudden it's like,
*  I'm in a state where then you can take me further up the staircase.
*  The one thing we know about dopamine was why it's so powerful.
*  It's not just that it can buffer these feelings of effort,
*  but that it can take you into new ways of thinking about a problem. I mean,
*  this is why a lot of, and this isn't work that I'm involved in,
*  but this is why a lot of the excitement about the therapeutic use of MDMA and
*  things that increase dopamine are windows into modes of processing information
*  that are very different. Now on the dark side of that,
*  if you think about cocaine or methamphetamine,
*  you've got dopamine coming in artificially and it tends to create a problem.
*  It tends to make people super focused on everything outside them and in pursuit
*  of more stuff. That's what happens with really high dopamine,
*  but dopamine appropriately dosed allows us to explore new realities of how,
*  you know, what led to that joke, a new variation. Anyway, I'm sorry,
*  like parsing comedy. I don't know anything about it, but when I watch comedy,
*  I'm always looking for that element of surprise.
*  And sometimes I think you're laying out crumbs for me and then you'll hit me with
*  something I had no idea. And that's twice as fun. Then you get that pop.
*  That's the pop that's dopamine.
*  When someone does cocaine, do they wear out their dopamine receptors?
*  So in a short, in short, yes,
*  the dopamine receptors are very prone to saturation. Remember the,
*  the they're like parking spots and you can fill those up very quickly.
*  And there's actually changes that happen at the genetic level in cells when
*  there's too much dopamine in the system for too long,
*  like with dopamine addiction or crack cocaine addiction,
*  the cells actually start modifying the way they work so that they become better
*  and better at gobbling up dopamine.
*  The whole system becomes a dopamine pursuit system. And, you know,
*  in thinking about the brain for these kinds of, you know,
*  very top contour conceptual levels,
*  we can think of addiction as just a narrowing of the things that bring you
*  pleasure. And so what you want is to obviously not use cocaine.
*  What you want is to access the dopamine system through whatever
*  process appeals to you, provided that it doesn't deplete that dopamine system.
*  Right. You can,
*  you can maximize this to the point where things don't work anymore.
*  And there is a like kind of a little weird techie cult thing happening in the
*  Bay Area. They call it dopamine fasting, which has no basis in physiology,
*  where these kids are like literally,
*  they're not looking at each other in the eye because like, Oh,
*  it's too much dopamine. And then I, yeah, I swear it's a real thing.
*  I get asked about this a lot. And it, and if anything,
*  it would have the opposite effect that they're seeking.
*  No wonder why there's bums just shitting in the street up there.
*  Everyone's losing their mind.
*  I have to be a little defensive of Northern California.
*  It has a lot of problems, but when I go down to Venice, which I love,
*  and I love LA also, I'm not one of these Southern California hating Northern
*  California's, there's a pretty serious homeless problem here too. Yeah. Yeah.
*  But San Francisco homelessness is it. It's on another level. I mean,
*  I don't go to the city anymore. I don't go to the city.
*  Either as the kings of the homeless people, not a title. We Gavin Newsom.
*  You did it. You motherfucker. You started it. It's a, you know, I have a,
*  I live in the East Bay side on the Oakland side and we have that problem there,
*  but Oakland's always had a lot of problems.
*  Well it's one of the side effects of a really tolerant progressive community for
*  whatever reason you're,
*  you're tolerant to drug addicts making tent compounds,
*  you know,
*  and it's a it's very unfortunate because it ruins everything else.
*  And so I get the idea behind it. I get it. But in practice,
*  it just is not effective. It's not good for them. It's not good for you.
*  Certainly not good for property values. It's not good for safety. It's just not,
*  it's not good for sanity. It's not good for sanitation.
*  It's not good for anything. I mean fucking downtown LA,
*  they're finding typhoid like they're bringing back middle aged or a mid,
*  what is it? Not middle aged. What's the word I'm looking for? I've done this.
*  Middle ages. Medieval. I always fucked that up. I fucked that up. Yeah.
*  Medieval medieval diseases.
*  They're bringing out diseases that haven't been around for fucking thousands of
*  years. We're, I don't know why that can't be solved.
*  I just don't understand that problem. The homeless problem to me is so,
*  it's so odd that they just let them camp out.
*  Like I went to Venice the other day for dinner and we're driving by this house
*  and there's a beautiful house to my left.
*  That's probably worth like $5 million and in front of it there's 13 tents.
*  I'm like, this is crazy.
*  Yeah. The last, the last time I was down here was in March,
*  right before COVID hit and or around the time, who knows when it hit, but, um,
*  there's a block on Venice Boulevard leading down to that Arowan market that was
*  maybe one block and I drove in the other night and it extends, you know,
*  seven blocks. Yeah. And they don't do shit about it.
*  And I don't know what they're going to do. Every time you go into an underpass,
*  you're entering a homeless encampment. Now they've even the one over here on
*  Wanetka, they put a porta potty there and a hand washing station. Like we give
*  up here, shit in this bucket. It's crazy. Like, wow, this is,
*  it's just, I mean, I don't know, maybe there's bigger fish to fry.
*  Maybe there's more important things right now with COVID.
*  I can't think of anything more important than making sure that citizens have
*  healthcare and shelter. And the route to do that is not my expertise.
*  I don't have any great ideas about that, but I just,
*  the homeless problem to me is very bothersome.
*  There are neighborhoods in Berkeley, you go down towards the fourth street,
*  fifth street. It used to be kind of an artist district.
*  Get down near their skateboard park.
*  They call it the Aaron Brockovich park because it had all this like sewage and
*  toxic waste seeping up and kids were getting infections and stuff.
*  So down near there now everyone wants to go there, right? But, um,
*  bus after bus, after tent, after tent,
*  it's an entire city now of people living in the avenues back there.
*  Yeah. And I don't know what they're going to do about it.
*  And there doesn't seem to be any solution. I mean,
*  there's nothing on the table. No one's doing anything.
*  They're just letting it grow. It's so weird. It's so weird. I mean,
*  I don't want to be the person that engineers the solution. I've got shit to do.
*  Aren't you fuckers? They're mayors and congressmen. That's your district.
*  They'll go do something. Yeah. I mean, I'm, I'm not a very political person,
*  but I'm, I'm very disappointed at, uh, well, a lot of things,
*  but, um, I see a lot of great things happening in the world,
*  but I also see a almost total failure,
*  even in the, on the part of the scientific community to communicate accurately
*  what's going on right now. There's so much confusion and you know,
*  I don't want to get into the COVID thing because it's not my expertise.
*  But the fact of the matter is that science has also, you know,
*  there are a lot of people that don't believe in science,
*  but science has also failed at some level to get out there and explain to people
*  what they need to know. Who are the people that don't believe in science?
*  Well, there are the anti-vaxxer flat earth people.
*  Yeah. Schizophrenics. And that's the most part. And I think the ease with which,
*  you know,
*  a celebrity can just decide that vaccinations work a certain way or don't work
*  a certain way. And it spreads so quickly. And people love that idea that, you know,
*  I try and look at it through the lens of neuroscience.
*  I say, what is it about the mind where people can't seem to connect to logical
*  ideas when it's inconvenient for them,
*  but they can string together all these random dots into a theory that this was
*  all caused by, you know, 5g or something that makes no sense at all.
*  So it tells me that, um, yes, people are, um, challenged.
*  But in addition to that,
*  I do think that the scientific community has a responsibility. You know,
*  let's not go after Fauci specifically,
*  but why isn't there a team of scientists out there saying as a team,
*  we figured out this, that, and the other thing there.
*  Jamie was just bringing this up earlier before the show that someone was being
*  criticized because they said we should have more experts to draw upon other
*  than Fauci and this person who was interviewing and explain what they were saying.
*  Yeah. I was on CNN this morning. It's just, they were,
*  she just kept asking what's your problem with Fauci. And he said, well,
*  there's other, why don't you talk to somebody at Stanford?
*  He named someone specifically. I don't remember off the name.
*  But just talk to other people. And she's like,
*  well we have other epidemiologists coming on the program or whatever,
*  but he's just like, they're why not try this person, this person, this person.
*  Like she just kept grilling them on Fauci. Why, why do you keep asking about Fauci?
*  What's the problem with Fauci? Very strange.
*  That's not what the issue is. The issue is divergent opinions are important,
*  particularly when it comes to medicine and science,
*  like there's different perspectives and also equally educated
*  experts who vary on what they think the approach should be.
*  And I think regarding the, this thing, this is a,
*  the COVID thing is completely unique, right?
*  Because it is a novel coronavirus. So we really don't know.
*  We don't know.
*  And you go back and listen to what the World Health Organization was saying in
*  January versus what Fauci was saying in March versus what they're saying
*  today in July, it's very different.
*  So clearly there's no one expert who has a fucking finger right on the
*  pulse and like, I got this, this is what we need to do. Listen to Fauci,
*  listen to Joan over there, whoever the fuck it is. That's not the case.
*  We need a panel of experts. When the space shuttle exploded,
*  we had a panel of experts. Now Richard Feynman was the one who was kind of the
*  front runner and he's the most eloquent and he knew how to speak to the general
*  public. And so he was the one that got all the attention for figuring out it was
*  a, you know, a washer ring that heated up or got cold. I forget what it was.
*  Yeah. Feynman figured that out. In addition to doing so many other amazing things.
*  And chasing chicks, playing the bongos.
*  What he did then would have gotten him fired today very quickly. Well, yes.
*  Well, my dad's a physicist. So according to my dad, it was,
*  it was bongo drumming naked on the roof of Caltech. Yeah.
*  So he took it to a whole nother level. Also a guy who was very into float tanks.
*  He really was into the float tank thing. But I think like anybody who tries them,
*  gets into them.
*  I've never tried.
*  I know we need to get you in one.
*  But my prediction,
*  my hypothesis is that it's dramatically changing that sensation piece of the
*  equation so that your perception can now move and kind of float.
*  No pun intended that you're,
*  it makes it hard to do this duration path outcome kind of rigid thinking in
*  there because you,
*  my understanding is that the salinity of the water and the temperature of the
*  water makes it so that you kind of don't notice the boundary between yourself and
*  the water becomes one environment.
*  So Feynman actually talked about this as a way to access space time
*  relationships of the mind that he anchored to physics principles.
*  And so he was a big proponent of the, of the float tank.
*  I think also because he was a little afraid to try psychedelics.
*  I want to talk to you about the float tank,
*  but I don't want to steer away right away from science and the responsibility of
*  science. Cause I don't think the responsibility is in science.
*  I think the problem is, and this is a new problem,
*  the new found ability to communicate online and reach massive amounts of people
*  without any expertise whatsoever. That's what this podcast is. I mean,
*  I've said a bunch of stupid shit on here that's not accurate and you can get away
*  with it, you know,
*  and at least I'm ethical in it that if I do make mistakes,
*  I will correct them and I'll try to be as honest as I can about what I know or
*  what I don't know.
*  But when someone's slightly schizophrenic or delusional and they're
*  more prone to believing in conspiracies because conspiracies,
*  they activate some weird spot in your brain. And maybe we could talk about that.
*  I don't know what that spot is, but there's,
*  there's some weird reward mechanism that comes from discovering things that are
*  hidden,
*  that people don't want you to find out that everybody else doesn't know about.
*  And you could be the fucking Paul Revere of 5g and you could be the guy running
*  around, you know, 5g is coming, 5g is coming, you know,
*  there's something about that that really dumb people really gravitate towards.
*  And some really smart people with some mental ticks,
*  some things that are off and it's a,
*  it's a real problem because it's a giant distraction.
*  I don't think the responsibility lies in science because science is supposed to
*  be about data, analyzing these things,
*  coming up with cold hard facts that you could, that are provable, right?
*  Things you could show. This is repeatable. This is,
*  this is what the situation is and this is how we know.
*  A spokesperson for science would be wonderful, but there are people like that.
*  There's Neil deGrasse Tyson does a fantastic job about the cosmos. I mean,
*  I love his work, but you know, there's this,
*  there was this culture in the eighties and nineties around, you know,
*  and I grew up sort of in this cause my dad's a physics, you know, he's physics.
*  We spent some time around a lot of physicists,
*  the cosmos and astrology that gained immense popularity.
*  It's very exciting and very interesting and mostly irrelevant to what we're
*  dealing with right now in 2020. Right now it's about biology, virology,
*  epidemiology, and there has not been a voice for that besides Fauci.
*  And I think he's doing the best he can with what he's got. I do.
*  I have to believe that.
*  But I think a panel of experts who could appeal to different types of people
*  through different types of mediums would assist in at least letting people know
*  what the process is. You know, we've sort of said,
*  there are people out there who don't think COVID exists.
*  You've got people that are just waiting for a vaccine.
*  They're not going to leave their house until there's a vaccine.
*  You've got people that are afraid of vaccines.
*  There needs to be some structure of communication about what scientists are
*  doing because there's incredible work happening in laboratories at Stanford,
*  all over the world, trying to figure out the solution to this problem.
*  And at the same time, people are very stressed. You know,
*  for the person that doesn't have a W-2 or regular 1099 income,
*  this period of time is immensely stressful. And the more stressful something,
*  the more stressed a human or any animal gets,
*  the easier it is to recruit them into some sort of delusional thinking.
*  Yes.
*  You know, it's, you know, psychosis is defined as ascribing
*  meaning to something for which there's none. You know,
*  if I suddenly tell you that the brick in that corner is sending me messages about
*  what I should say next, that's breaking with our space time,
*  understanding what's allowed here.
*  People are doing that in subtle kind of incremental ways.
*  Some of them might be diabolical and evil,
*  but what we know is that the more stressed people are,
*  the better people are able to recruit them into ideas where they can connect
*  dots that otherwise might not be connected.
*  And it has everything to do with the way that the brain comp, you know,
*  computes information.
*  So I'm not saying a panel of experts would necessarily buffer us or inoculate us
*  against those kinds of forces, but I do think that there was a time in this
*  country, at least when I was growing up, I'm 44 years old,
*  where at least there was some faith that the figures that you saw on a screen or
*  that we're talking to you, we're putting in a best faith effort.
*  I mean, there might've been a lot of shady stuff going on behind the scenes,
*  but I think that has completely fallen away. And so now it's all, as you said,
*  very aptly, it's all about following individuals who can be most convincing in
*  the moment. It's about capturing people in these highly dopaminergic anxious
*  states where you can start leading them down a thought path. And pretty soon,
*  there's no notion of science. Pretty soon you're talking about flat earth.
*  And it's, and it's scary. And other countries aren't doing this.
*  China's not doing this in China. They are, they are working chipping away in Europe.
*  They are working and chipping away in a way that is in keeping with the reality
*  that is broadly presented to them here. Reality is getting very distorted.
*  There's also a problem with, and it's not because of Fauci,
*  but Fauci represents to a lot of people, uh,
*  a point of ideological loyalty, right?
*  You believe Fauci because you think Trump's a moron, you know, or,
*  I believe Fauci because I think he's a scientist who's got the best set of tools
*  to look at the problem.
*  Right. But you know what I'm saying?
*  So anything that opposes his perspective gets diminished,
*  even if it's a legitimate scientist that has an altered perspective, you know,
*  like, or someone who, um,
*  instead wishes that we focus the public on how to
*  strengthen the immune system and the techniques for strengthening the immune
*  system, which we are aware of. These are real things.
*  And you don't hear a peep out of this, which is to me very frustrating.
*  And it's, I'm very disappointed.
*  I guess that's what I was saying poorly before. And you said much more clearly
*  now, which is, you know,
*  I'm disappointed that he's the only person out there and the only voice,
*  not because I don't believe what he's saying is valid,
*  but because I think there are other things that are important. First of all,
*  the stress problem has not been addressed. You know, the, you know,
*  I work in my laboratory, but one of the reasons I'm getting out there and trying
*  to talk to people about stress and these systems and trying to provide tools is
*  because people are stressed. And for that person,
*  whether or not they're wearing a mask and washing their hand 25 times a day and
*  staying at home or going out stress, there are tools for that.
*  And we have an obligation to teach people those things. And I, we have,
*  there are tools for enhancing the immune system and we need to teach people those
*  things.
*  Yeah. I wish that was a big part of the government,
*  whether it's local government or national government,
*  the focus of not just telling people to stay inside and be scared and wash your
*  hands and wear a mask, do all those things, but also exercise,
*  drink more water, take vitamins, you know,
*  teach people meditation techniques,
*  give people some tools that can help them get the proper sleep that they need.
*  Because I think these are all immense factors.
*  I agree. I mean,
*  the foundation of our wellbeing is through the very basic kind of almost boring
*  stuff. It's hydrate sleep, gratitude,
*  social connection, nutrition, exercise. You start hearing about this thing and you
*  kind of go, well, it's not exciting. It's not the magic pill.
*  But I think of that all that as kind of the tide that comes in,
*  that's required to bring the boat out to sea. You know,
*  I think people think about the thing that's going to trampoline them up to the
*  highest position, you know,
*  that's going to suddenly turn them into a high performer, you know?
*  And I have, I'm doing some work with a former team guy,
*  his name is Pat Dossett and Blake Mycoskie who started Tom shoes.
*  So just full disclosure, cause I have a position on their company board.
*  I want to do full disclosure. It's not work in my lab. And they've got this,
*  you know, this company,
*  this program that's really about building foundational tools for people,
*  like for the every person that it's great.
*  And I also feel like our government should be sending these messages out there
*  because we're really lacking that.
*  And I think the instability of the situation that we see today has a lot,
*  the psychological response to all this has a lot to do with the fact that we
*  didn't hit COVID prepared. We didn't hit this situation prepared.
*  The world was, you know, that the United States is badly obese.
*  There's a real serious medical problem. I'm not even touching the psychology,
*  just medical problem, badly obese and stressed.
*  I'm going to send you a,
*  I'm going to send this to you Jamie so you can put this up on the screen.
*  Cause a Bridget Phetasy sent me this today and it's fucking,
*  appropriate and hilarious. And it's about, uh,
*  what we're going through right now in terms of obesity and stress and all these
*  poor people. Hold on a second. Give me a second here. I'm going to find it.
*  God damn. I got a lot of text messages. Whoa. I can only imagine. Oh,
*  I can't even imagine. I'm like, what the fuck is this? Um, sorry.
*  One more second.
*  God damn. I have 150 new text messages here.
*  Okay.
*  Here we go.
*  Um, sending this to you right now, Jamie.
*  A lot of dead air here, kids.
*  Hey, here we go. Jamie. Bam. Bam. Okay.
*  Well, I will say my physician friends tell me that one of the major threats to,
*  you know, one of the major risk factors is obesity. Yeah, this is, um,
*  Pfft.
*  There was you looking at a lady that weighs about 400 pounds in a scooter,
*  uh, yelling at a fit woman, put a mask on,
*  you're putting my health at risk and she's got a McDonald's bag in her hand.
*  That's a lot of what's going on.
*  I was hoping that what this was going to do was it was going to be a wake up call
*  for people. And we're,
*  I was going to see obese people really take their health seriously and go, well,
*  while I'm alive,
*  like what are the primary factors that lead to really bad results with COVID?
*  Well, according to, uh, the doctors that treated patients in Manhattan,
*  the number one factor was obesity. That was number one.
*  And so there's older people that, uh, you know,
*  did way better than young people that were obese.
*  So it's not just an age related thing. It's an obesity related thing,
*  but people, as long as they're okay,
*  they can, they could stay inside and wear a mask. They're healthy.
*  They'll just eat ice cream and watch TV and hope someone comes up with a
*  solution.
*  The daddy government comes along and fixes the problem,
*  but it should be a wake up call should be a health related wake up call for
*  people.
*  It should. I mean, I think that we saw in the eighties and nineties, you know,
*  fast food and cheap calories became so prominent.
*  And we see the effects of that now, right? That's, that's, that's here. Now,
*  the problem is now,
*  I think the other problem that's happened over the last 10 years and we're
*  starting to see this emerge in much in the same way that we've seen obesity
*  emerge is the phone. And I love the phone.
*  I'm born and raised in Silicon Valley. I use the phone. I love the phone,
*  but it is a complicated device because we are bringing a ton of our attention to
*  it. Social media is very complicated. It has wonderful aspects,
*  but there are ways in which it's converting and engaging neural
*  plasticity in the young brain, the way it's, you know, engaging our attention.
*  Think about how much attention people will place on that little phone,
*  but they can't read two pages of a book that worries me. And not because I'm,
*  you know, university professor and I need everybody, you know,
*  doing equations or learning about neuroscience. Not at all.
*  I just worry about the neural plasticity of learning to be defocused and
*  scatterbrained.
*  There is a time to put the brain into states of space,
*  time fluidity to come up with new comedy routines or scientific ideas. You know,
*  you could take a walk, you can run, you can put the float tanks.
*  There are a bunch of different ways to do this,
*  but the phone is starting to gobble up all that dopamine and all that space,
*  time duration, path, outcome stuff.
*  And we are wasting our cognition and we're wasting the most precious gift we
*  were given by mother nature and evolution as a brain that can teach itself
*  things and that can predict things and that can look at the past,
*  can learn from elders and gain wisdom. I mean,
*  all that stuff is what we were put here to do. And, you know,
*  my dad said, you know, he thinks,
*  I asked him if he thinks there are other galaxies, you know,
*  because he's more versed in the, in physics and the cosmos than I am.
*  And he said, I don't know, but if there was, they,
*  they probably extinguished themselves with social media because it's like mental
*  chewing gum. People just kind of throwing away their cognition and the dopamine
*  thing. It's not that they're getting so much dopamine from using the phone.
*  It doesn't feel like a big win. It's that they're spending it out, like spending,
*  you know, $5 bills all day long. Pretty soon you're broke and you're exhausted.
*  And so I worry about our use of these devices and what it's doing to our
*  neurology. But I also know they're extremely important.
*  Alan Levinovitz who was on the podcast recently had a book called natural.
*  And it's one of the things that he, he talked about in the book was that what
*  we're doing is essentially the, the ver it's weird.
*  And he talked about this on Twitter and that's how I engaged with him. We were,
*  we're taking most of our information and we're making it processed information
*  by getting things off of Twitter, by getting things off of social media,
*  you're getting this very weird interaction with people.
*  It's boiled down to this very strange 280 character version.
*  That's not equivalent to an actual conversation with a human being or reading a
*  book or watching a documentary or any of those things.
*  It's this weird thing that's most of the information that you're receiving.
*  And if you look at human beings that are on processed food diets,
*  you see the body behaves very poorly and it just reacts very poorly and it's,
*  it's terrible. It's just not good for it. It's unhealthy. Well,
*  equally unhealthy is processed information. And that was,
*  this was his argument in his book. It's a great argument. It's a great argument.
*  It's a,
*  I think we are in an adolescent stage of this technological intervention and
*  this,
*  this will lead to whatever Neuralink is going to be and whatever the successor to
*  Neuralink is going to be. I think things are going to get way weirder, I think,
*  but there's potential for a beneficial aspect to it.
*  And I think one of the potentially beneficial aspects are,
*  is that it seems like all of technology is moving us through,
*  at least in this virtual sense of using phones and computers,
*  where the boundaries between people and information are becoming smaller and
*  smaller.
*  The problem is the boundaries between physical people are becoming greater.
*  There's more separation, particularly with COVID, right?
*  There's more physical separation between people,
*  but the boundaries between being able to access the thoughts of people is smaller.
*  So it's the beneficial aspects of like what we talked about with your immune,
*  even your immune system and your health and just overall mental wellbeing,
*  community, love, friendship, all those things. You need to be right there.
*  You need to be right there with it. You need to hug each other, all that stuff.
*  That's, that's, that's crucial. That's everything.
*  And hardwired intents.
*  And with COVID that's first of all,
*  everyone's scary because everyone could give you the bug and could kill you or
*  kill your grandma. And then on top of that,
*  you're engaging in this processed form of communication all day long.
*  And most of it is toxic. I mean, if you're engaging with people on social media,
*  then I mean, I've talked about this multiple times in the show.
*  There's people I follow that don't even know I'm following them because I just
*  have them bookmarked because they're just so toxic. I go and just,
*  I want to know what they're doing. I'll just go to them.
*  I'm like, look at this motherfucker. He's on Twitter 12 hours a day,
*  yelling at people, arguing constantly.
*  And I just imagine that their mind is a fucking chaos,
*  just a wreck, just potholes and burning buildings.
*  Their head is just filled with shit.
*  But it's effective. You know, in a terrible way, it's effective.
*  It's like in the engineers, you know, talk about signal versus noise.
*  And the brain is essentially an engineered machine.
*  It looks for where signal is high and above the noise.
*  And so there really is a payoff nowadays, a short term,
*  deleterious payoff, but payoff nonetheless,
*  for being able to recruit people's attention,
*  recruit their autonomic nervous system, get those into them,
*  into those modes of having to click and follow and scroll. Now,
*  I agree that I think social media, like for instance,
*  I teach some science on social media. I've managed to make great,
*  make great connections through social media,
*  but we have to be very judicious in our use of it.
*  And that's hard for most people.
*  And what I think is going to happen is that we're going to talk about signal
*  and noise.
*  I think what's going to happen is we're going to start selecting for people
*  that are very good at controlling their attention,
*  are very good at separating themselves from technology as well as using
*  technology.
*  And so for people that are just rabidly consuming technology and information
*  and thinking, this is the way to live a good life or to get ahead,
*  they're actually just falling into the noise. And the people that are,
*  I think it's one of the reasons why a select set of individuals have been so
*  effective at controlling the landscape, the political landscape,
*  the lots of landscapes, let's just say that.
*  And I think that we need to think about whether or not we're in the noise or
*  whether or not we're, you know,
*  paying attention when these big peaks of signal and what's that we're getting
*  recruited. We're getting, you know, kind of groomed by these things.
*  And it is scary. And at the same time, I agree.
*  I think that eventually we will break through this. I do,
*  because that's what the human animal is really good at.
*  Yeah. I think we're in the technological dark ages. That's what I think.
*  I think we're just some weird thing where there's a lot of people going,
*  this is not good kids. This is not good. But most people are like, fuck you.
*  And just in the, just wading into the fray.
*  Cause it feels kind of good.
*  Yeah. Well, especially when you don't have real meaning or purpose in your life
*  cause you're unemployed and you're stuck at home because of COVID and you're
*  scared. Well, that's,
*  that's a way that people occupy their mind and engage and you're seeing a big
*  uptick. Big uptick. And well,
*  at least the people that I'm paying attention to and the toxicity of their
*  inner, their exchanges. It's just,
*  well, this is kind of scary. And I, I, um,
*  I sort of hesitant to just kind of flip to another research site,
*  but there was this guy in the sixties,
*  this guy Robert Heath who didn't need patients who had epilepsy.
*  He just got permission to record from the human brain.
*  And so he put electrodes into their brains and he let them stimulate any area
*  of the brain that they wanted. This was like this, he just did it.
*  And they'd stimulate one area and they'd feel kind of drunk or they stimulate
*  another area. They'd feel sexual arousal. They stimulate another,
*  and they start laughing.
*  The number one area that people like to stimulate created a sense of mild
*  frustration and anger, which is totally perplexing on the face of it.
*  You say like,
*  why would people like that more than sexual arousal or feeling drunk or happy
*  or giddy or whatever?
*  It turns out that this dopamine system we were talking about earlier is tethered
*  to that. And it very likely explains not just the human animal,
*  but all animals ability to lean into challenge in order to acquire more
*  resources to fight and overcome that. You know,
*  if you had a bunch of whole species where everyone just backed away from any
*  frustration and challenge, that would be very problematic.
*  And so right now I see us in the state of extreme anger and frustration or mild
*  anger and frustration.
*  And some people are going to drill through this and they're going to make things
*  work. You know, they're going to Goggins it, you know, to make it the verb,
*  you know, but,
*  and a lot of people are just going to feed that frustration anger,
*  but in a loop,
*  it's just a closed loop where they're just clicking and scrolling and clicking
*  and strong scrolling, and they're not building anything out of that.
*  So this circuit is really important.
*  It's actually part of the circuit that underlies the state that we would call
*  courage in my labs worked on it.
*  And this relates to some of the stuff done with military groups,
*  but it, those states of courage were designed to accomplish specific
*  goals, you know, find food, find mates. And then in the world of military,
*  you know, conquer this or learn that and, you know, learn a new skill.
*  Right now the phone in many ways is hijacking some of that circuitry at a low
*  level. And it's, it's never, the subtle stuff is the stuff that scares me.
*  It's, you know, obviously I'm very disturbed when I see rioting and looting,
*  but when I see a technology that is kind of gnawing away at our neurology little
*  by little, and then we kind of go, Oh my goodness,
*  we can't cope with life and what's being thrown at us. I think that's when I
*  think, ah,
*  we really need to look at what that that neural circuitry was built for and start
*  building new technologies to take us out of this mess.
*  Yeah, that's what I'm hoping the future of these,
*  whether it's neural link or some other sort of immersive technology that allows
*  people to communicate in a very different way. You know,
*  when Elon is saying you're going to be able to talk without using words,
*  what I'm assent, what I'm really hoping, and this sounds really crazy,
*  but I think what could help is if we could read thoughts and clear the
*  intentions,
*  re really understand intentions versus interpretation of intentions.
*  Like someone could say something sarcastically and you could read it the wrong
*  way and you can get upset at them. If you read it in text,
*  it's even more easy to misinterpret what someone's saying or to purposely,
*  ah, deceptively frame what they're trying to say.
*  But if you can just read someone's mind, we're gonna,
*  we're going to have a much better understanding of each other and the rewards
*  versus the positives versus negatives of holding onto these really toxic patterns
*  that people are swimming in right now with social media.
*  I agree. And I do think that neural plasticity,
*  in addition to brain machine interface, you know,
*  so it probably will involve machines that we put on our faces or whatever,
*  but neural plasticity is the way out of this, right? I mean,
*  that's what the brain can do. It can learn new contingencies,
*  new ways of relating.
*  That's why I'm so adamant about understanding this process and really feeling so
*  much importance on, you know, especially with kids,
*  because it's all so passive,
*  like their brains are just passively shaped by experience.
*  So that could be a little scary to people.
*  It's also beautiful because it means that you set one proper intention or one
*  rule that they should learn and adopt. And that can have a long lasting effect.
*  The ability to de-stress themselves, self-soothe, the ability to, um, you know,
*  work through a hard tangle of a problem interpersonally or academically,
*  whatever problem that can be done. It's just that we, I do think,
*  especially in this country,
*  we've learned to back away from that internal sense of agitation and, you know,
*  kind of going back to what we were talking about earlier,
*  that agitation is the first requirement for getting plasticity.
*  There's no way around that.
*  And we have this kind of obsession with flow states,
*  which I think are great and all this stuff. And we think it's,
*  that's the portal to it. But I think,
*  I'm certain actually that it's not the portal.
*  The portal to changing the brain is these high urgency,
*  high attentional states followed by rest and just keep going,
*  toggling back and forth and back and forth.
*  That is what's really important, right? That you,
*  you cannot strive for a life of total relaxation cause you're not going to get
*  shit done. There's nothing there.
*  It's not the active state of the human mind. It doesn't,
*  it doesn't thrive under those conditions,
*  but we're also concerned about stress and we're so concerned about the
*  pressures of whether, you know,
*  you're in some sort of a competitive environment or a job that you're involved
*  in that requires an immense amount of your focus and your attention.
*  We're all striving for that state where you're like a monk in a
*  lotus position, not doing anything.
*  Yeah, that seems terrible to me because it's divorced from everything we know
*  about competition winning in the brain.
*  There's a cool set of experiments that I think you might especially appreciate
*  given your background in martial arts,
*  which is called the tube test where they take two rats or two mice and they put
*  them in a tube. Typically it's male mice, but also female mice.
*  And they start fighting for position in that too.
*  One mouse pushes the other mouse out or rat inevitably.
*  That one is the winner. The one that got pushed out of the loser.
*  We know that statistically,
*  if you put those mice back into another tube test, even with another mouse,
*  the winner has a higher probability of winning and the loser has a higher
*  probability of losing. Even if you push the winner from behind.
*  So you take a loser and you push it from behind with a stick and it wins.
*  Even if it doesn't win on its own effort, it becomes a winner.
*  Now this is totally weird. And for about two decades,
*  this really perplexed neuroscientists and this was taught in psychology classes,
*  but not neuroscience classes. So in the last five years,
*  neuroscientists come in,
*  we have a lot of new tools now that let us monitor the brain and look at the
*  brain in real time as rodents or people are doing these kinds of things.
*  And so they figured out that there's a specific area of the frontal cortex that
*  becomes more active in the winner and less active in the loser.
*  So much so that if you shut down that brain area,
*  the winner suddenly becomes a loser. You increase activity in the loser.
*  It becomes the winner. So you ask yourself,
*  what in the world is this brain activity or brain area doing?
*  It turns out it's taking the feeling of stress and arousal,
*  which both of them are experiencing. It's a battle.
*  And it converts it to more steps of forward movement per unit time.
*  It's just forward movement.
*  And so one animal is feeling stressed and is pausing more or is backing up.
*  The other animal is feeling the same level of stress and is moving forward,
*  just physically. And it's wild. Cause you can even take an arena,
*  make it really cold, which mice don't like,
*  put a warm heat lamp in the corner.
*  And the animal that won at the tube test gets the sweet spot every single time.
*  And so what this says is that the, you know, those are mice, we're humans.
*  My lab's been looking at this.
*  We had a paper a few years ago identifying the area in the brain that actually
*  leads to forward movement and rewards it with a dopamine reward.
*  This was a paper we published in Nature.
*  The area of the brain is interesting only because it maps exactly to that brain
*  area that Robert Heath found people like to stimulate frustration and anxiety.
*  Anger.
*  So frustration and anger were designed to get us to move forward adaptively.
*  Now I don't know how this plays out in the octagon where you're seeing somebody
*  get beat up and you know, but,
*  and then they're all of a sudden they're winning and it's switching back and
*  forth. But you know,
*  my dream experiment will be to record from the brains of those guys in real time.
*  We don't have the tech to do this right now, but someday we will.
*  And I bet you that every forward step or perception that you have an advantage
*  over the other guy or gal leads to a dopamine increase.
*  It lowers that norepinephrine and allows them to keep moving forward.
*  They get energy. They it's, you know, it's not gassing at the level of,
*  you know, can't breathe or gassing at the level of conditioning.
*  It's something's happening neurally.
*  So as a society right now we are stressed and this is not the time to back off,
*  go into the lotus position. And people come at me from times.
*  I do think we need tools to buffer stress. I want to be clear about that.
*  I don't want people stressed all the time or seeking stress, but goodness,
*  we were given and we were endowed with this amazing neurology that allows us to
*  do this. We did it in famine. We did this with foreign invaders.
*  We did this with animals and storms and we did this and here we are.
*  We've got severe challenges, but forward movement balanced by rest is the solution
*  that's worked for us for tens of thousands of years.
*  And it's what's going to work now.
*  And it all comes back to just a few select brain areas because this is a
*  primitive situation we're in. It's not a sophisticated situation.
*  Yeah, that's a,
*  that's a uncomfortable reality for a lot of people that the struggle is good,
*  right? That there's, there's benefits to it,
*  particularly if you're looking for growth and also if you're looking for
*  stimulation and a sense of meaning.
*  I think people for whatever reason are hardwired to try to figure things out,
*  to try to get better at things and to have a purpose.
*  And a lot of times the purpose that they feel other than family and loved ones
*  and friends and things along those lines,
*  there's a purpose of success in their chosen field,
*  success in whatever endeavor, even if it's a hobby, you know,
*  like whatever the thing is that they obsess upon,
*  that's what gives people this sense of meaning of,
*  and I think that's why there's buildings. That's why there's cities.
*  That's why we figured out the wheel.
*  There's something about people that need a problem to solve.
*  And then once they've solved that problem, they need a new problem.
*  And that's what the nervous system was fundamentally designed to do that and
*  make sure our offspring make it to the next.
*  So when you see like riots and looting and you see people pushing against the
*  building and let us in, do you,
*  do you look at it from that perspective like, Oh,
*  there's a sort of a battle going on here. And there's a problem.
*  They're trying to win just like the mouse in that tube.
*  When you see those protesters in Portland or try to get into the courthouse,
*  like what are they doing? They're trying to get in there because it's locked.
*  And they, they, they, they have this idea in their head that that's going to be
*  the conquest. But you saw like what a Chas remember that the, the,
*  the zone in Seattle, six blocks, they let them have it. And then what happened?
*  They fucked it up. It fell apart, fell apart, fell apart because there was,
*  there was no end goal then once they have it, like,
*  what are you going to do? You're going to sustain it? No,
*  people started leaving murders took place. They started beating people up.
*  They were filming things. They were behaving like the police. It was crazy.
*  They put boundaries up.
*  They essentially turned it into a far worse version of the United States.
*  But in their mind, they thought if we just take this over,
*  if we, this is this right now is not ours, but if we take it,
*  there's a policing police precinct there.
*  If we storm the precinct and occupy it, then we're going to win. Yeah, we're in.
*  But then once they're in, they're like, now what? Well, there's no resistance.
*  Once there was no resistance, they didn't, they didn't have a fight.
*  There was no battle.
*  It was very primitive. And actually I hadn't thought about it.
*  It's a perfect example of real life example of the tube test. These, you know,
*  two opposing forces pushing back and forth. And we know that the more they,
*  you know, we call it autonomic arousal, but the more stress you get,
*  the more your mental and visual landscape becomes that soda straw view where all
*  you can think about is the adversary. You know,
*  now in a fight in an octagon or a boxing ring or jujitsu match,
*  that's great because that's everyone's agreed to that.
*  But it that's not designed to be played out in society over these
*  micro wins. It's not even clear that they're wins because what's really changed.
*  I think that working through legislation, working through top down legislation,
*  identifying specific things to go after. I mean,
*  that was the beauty of the civil rights movement, you know, in the 1960s, you know,
*  Brown versus the board of education. Like what,
*  what a beautiful thing to create openness in schools, you know,
*  where anyone could attend going after specific legislation.
*  And that's far and away a different way of looking at a problem and solving a
*  problem. And, you know,
*  I don't have a lot to say about the situation in terms of the process.
*  I saw a lot of looting where I live in Oakland.
*  I'm the first house in on a commercial district, drove a car through the window,
*  looted the place three times, a pharmacy three times. I mean,
*  it was right up next to me. So, you know, I think that,
*  but that's, that seems to me to be just opportunists.
*  They're taking advantage of the chaos. It was clear. It was not the protesters.
*  There's many things going on simultaneously into like to kind of conflate them
*  all together. It seems disingenuous.
*  Well, this is a problem in science. We have a phrase,
*  you're either a lump or a splitter.
*  The lumpers like to kind of lump everything together and push forward a grand
*  theory. Now today I'm using some generalizations and I don't want to get too
*  far down in the weeds,
*  but I'll stand behind anything I've said because it has detailed background to
*  support it. But the splitters as annoying as they can be when they come to
*  meetings. No, but this, but that you need a certain number of splitters.
*  This is why I think like a panel of people is good. You get a lump or a lump,
*  or in a splitter. And then pretty soon the splitter is annoying everybody.
*  Cause you just want to go for coffee or you want to just break and the lumpers
*  are done. But the splitter says, no,
*  we're actually not thinking about this problem in a nuanced way.
*  And this is where I think maybe it's not specific scientific information,
*  but a scientific training and ability to think about a problem and be comfortable
*  knowing you may not solve it today or ever,
*  but you're going to lathe into this thing over and over and over.
*  That's the kind of training that a scientific thinking will give somebody.
*  You don't even have to want to be a scientist to do it.
*  I don't know if anyone wants to be a scientist nowadays. I certainly hope so,
*  but we need to have more nuance.
*  We need balance between the lumpers and splitters. And as you point out before,
*  social media is all about lumping and high emotional states.
*  And that's the worst combination.
*  Yeah, I think, and that what you just said is perfect. I mean, that,
*  that's really what we're dealing with today is this inability to recognize
*  nuance and to accept nuance and to be rigid and committed to your position.
*  And your position is something you defend because your position essentially is
*  you, right?
*  This is one of the problems that people have with ideas that they marry their
*  mind to these ideas. And if these ideas prove to be,
*  even if objectively they know that this idea has holes in it,
*  they will still defend that idea tooth and claw because that idea represents
*  their ego or represents them as a, as an individual. And that,
*  that's unhealthy for everybody, but it's also,
*  it's part of being a human being, this instinct to do such a thing.
*  Absolutely. There's a paper that came out recently in the journal, Neuron,
*  excellent journal that was all about the dopamine system being attached to
*  beliefs. So beliefs and thoughts we think of as kind of these vague, you know,
*  like what are our thoughts? You know, I have thoughts all the time,
*  but I can also deliberately have a thought beliefs are almost like actions in
*  the sense that they can recruit dopamine release.
*  What this paper showed is that people just believing thinking more and more
*  about what they already believe leads to these dopamine increases.
*  It literally reinforces the belief they have from the inside.
*  That presents a certain particular type of problem for trying to convince people
*  how to change their opinion.
*  It means I have to take your mind or the person's mind into a completely different
*  state in order to change it. It's, you know,
*  maybe it's hypnosis, maybe it's proper landing of media ideas.
*  I don't know what that form would take,
*  but changing people's minds provided that they are older than 25 has to be done
*  by the person themselves. I can't change your mind unless you're a child,
*  a child can, you can impact them. But once you're an adult,
*  only you can direct your own plasticity. No one can do it for you.
*  So we are becoming more and more polarized and because of the nature of the AI
*  bots that drive social media, the information that we're,
*  that you're getting and then I'm getting, well,
*  hopefully that's more aligned than, you know,
*  some of the ideas that I'm getting and other people are getting where we
*  fundamentally disagree because social media and media in general is designed to
*  bring us into these high amplitude aroused States,
*  but we're getting different information. We're not reading the same newspaper.
*  And so our beliefs are actually diverging and being reinforced by dopamine.
*  So we are creating a bigger and bigger conceptual divide through the hijack of
*  these neural mechanisms.
*  I wonder if that's one of the really attractive things about these protests is
*  this internal recognition somewhere,
*  even if it's subconsciously that we don't connect with people enough and that
*  there's,
*  there's no greater connection than a group of 50,000 people that are supporting
*  an individual cause.
*  And working towards a common goal. We know this. If you, you know,
*  you really want to build team, you know, build a sense of community, you know,
*  you can have them all watch a concert,
*  bring them into a peak state or you can all have them fight the same fight.
*  I wonder if there's like a, a, a yearning for that because of the separation of,
*  I mean, think about the coinciding factors, right?
*  You have social media, which separates us.
*  You have COVID which separates us.
*  And then you have these protests, which unites us.
*  And it must be like incredibly satisfying for people that have been locked up and
*  are constantly on social media to be in this mass movement.
*  And you'll probably alter your own perceptions and beliefs to fit in better
*  with this movement. So people that would never be violent may be violent.
*  People that would never loot might loot people that would never use graffiti or
*  start smashing the windows of Starbucks might be so inclined because of the mob
*  mentality to join right on in just to be accepted and be a part of this group and
*  just to feel something, just to be excited by this, this gigantic movement.
*  And when it's so undeniable that the cause is worthy,
*  like the George Floyd murder, when you see that and you go, well, fuck this, man,
*  this is wrong. This is injustice.
*  And then everybody's on the street and they're chanting together. You're like,
*  it's, it's perfect. It's a perfect combination of things.
*  It is the perfect combination. And, and it is a combination, you know,
*  up until now I've been talking about, it's like just frustration or just winning,
*  but you're talking about group cohesion. You're talking about fighting a fight.
*  You're talking about being locked up before. So all these forces, you know,
*  pulling on the same neurochemical forces,
*  there aren't many neurochemical ingredients. There are a lot of ways to access them.
*  And I look at the what's happening now and I sort of go on sort of like the
*  inverse of Burning Man. I've never been to Burning Man.
*  I'm probably the one person in the Bay area hasn't been to Burning Man, but,
*  you know, going out to the desert, every, no money, everyone's going to get along.
*  Like there's going to be a lot of sex and like everyone's going to get along and
*  everything's great, you know, no rules basically, except be kind.
*  And now we're seeing the exact inverse of that.
*  And so there needs to be something that can satisfy this yearning for connection
*  and that can make us feel like we're building. And, you know,
*  back in the last century's history, I mean, you know, the build after the war was a,
*  you know, everyone community building.
*  There were a lot of problems with the way that was played out. Of course,
*  was not done equally among race, racial groups, et cetera. But a common goal,
*  a common battle, a common fight is very good at recruiting these systems in the
*  brain. And I don't know how that's going to come about. I keep hoping,
*  you know, I have this 14 year old niece and I just keep hoping that like her
*  generation is looking at all this. And then just like, we're going to work this out.
*  Well, I think what's going to happen with places like Seattle and Portland,
*  unfortunately, I sense a mass exodus of rational people from the area.
*  I think they're probably going to go, okay, you people have lost your marbles.
*  We're going to get the fuck out of here.
*  And we're going to take our tax dollars with us and leave you with your Marxist
*  mayor and congratulations. You fucked the whole city up.
*  And then there needs to be some sort of a recognition of the mistakes and then a
*  correction. And that's probably what's going to happen.
*  You're probably going to see more and more of this more and more chaos.
*  And then like, you know, what's going on today in Portland.
*  And now you've got Homeland security troops, which, I mean,
*  I don't even know what branch of the military they are part of.
*  No idea.
*  So weird. They're all wearing camo and they don't have badges on. They just,
*  they just show up in minivans and pull people in the cars and everybody's like,
*  what the fuck is this? Like, what is going on here? Well,
*  there'll probably be a correction because of that as well.
*  It's most likely that what we're experiencing is just a lot of chaos and then
*  lessons will be learned. And unfortunately for a lot of people,
*  victims will be made, you know,
*  they're going to make victims out of a lot of people and a lot of people are
*  going to lose their businesses and their livelihoods and even their lives along
*  the way.
*  When we saw this in the sixties, you know,
*  the civil rights movement was incredible movement,
*  but we also had like the whole hippie movement.
*  There was like a lot of the same parallels were happening in the last 20 years.
*  I was watching this, you know, because I grew up in the Bay area,
*  people think of Silicon Valley is like very conservative,
*  but I remember a time growing up, you know, at least in my house, you know,
*  like the way that my dad talked about hippies was like, you know,
*  every doesn't lead anywhere. It's bad for everything. You know,
*  the counterculture movement. My mom was the opposite.
*  So I think neither was correct, but you know,
*  they had crazy stuff going on like this. There was this guy,
*  Uri Geller that was, you know,
*  he thought he could bend spoons with his mind, you know, spoon better.
*  That was the joke of my house. Don't be a spoon bender. You know,
*  like whatever you do, don't be a spoon better.
*  Cause it's like state attached to facts and things that are designed to move
*  human progress forward. That's really important. At the same time,
*  you had the whole counterculture thing going crazy.
*  And I feel like in the last 20 years, we've seen some spoon benders.
*  We've seen the, I,
*  the explosion of access to all things, you know,
*  and people being so hungry to have everything that everyone else has.
*  And there's been a gradual decline, at least in some sectors,
*  for, you know, an appreciation for hard work ethic. That's why I think David,
*  you know, I have a deep appreciation in this for the work with, you know,
*  people in the military, but people who, you know,
*  that whole American thing that I grew up with of you get up, you pick a vocation,
*  you grind away at it, whether or not it's, you know, garbage,
*  garbage man or scientist doesn't matter. You're just building your,
*  the same circuits are underlying all that. And I think right now people are feeling,
*  like they don't know which way is forward. Like we talk about moving forward
*  and pushing against stream, but I think a lot of people just don't know which
*  way is forward. So whatever thrown in their face, they go that direction.
*  Yeah. Well, they think they have a sense of what's forward and they're moving in
*  that direction. And a lot of them are very young too. And so they're,
*  their version of the world is not again, to use the word,
*  not particularly nuanced, which is, you know, they're,
*  they're imitating their atmosphere. They, they are a part of this,
*  what they think is a very valid and worthy movement and they're pushing forward.
*  And it's very attractive again. It's, it's a,
*  it's one of those things that I think ultimately we're going to get something
*  out of this. I think ultimately we'll probably be good.
*  And I think racially to be fantastic.
*  I think this is this big explosion of tension is going to be awesome when it
*  all settles down because we're going to realize how ridiculous it is to look at
*  people and base how you treat them or how you feel about them based on their
*  appearance because of what part of the world their ancestors came from.
*  It's just as stupid as looking at someone because of their hair color or their
*  eye color. I mean, imagine a world where all blue eyed people were devils.
*  We hate them all. It's fucking stupid.
*  It did things that are completely outside of your control should have absolutely
*  nothing to do with how a person values you as a human being.
*  And I think most people haven't experienced this, but there's a,
*  there's something out there. Maybe it's on the internet,
*  but my colleague Jeremy Balanson built this VR experience called a walk of a
*  thousand, a walk of a thousand cuts or 10,000 cuts. So you put the VR on,
*  you see yourself, a reflection of you.
*  And then you, they turn a dial or you turn a dial and then your skin,
*  if you're Caucasian becomes black African-American,
*  and then you walk down a city street. And it's very interesting.
*  I've done this experience and people look at you out of the corner of their eye.
*  And you're like, Oh, I've never experienced that before.
*  The virtual people, the virtual people looking at you out of the corner of the eye.
*  You go to them up. Can you beat up virtual?
*  And there isn't that option in there.
*  And there's a different VR experience where you can beat people up. There is,
*  there is, you should come up to the lab. You should come up to the lab.
*  But you don't feel anything. I have a VR boxing game and it's weird because when
*  they hit you, like you get a flash and it gives you,
*  it gets you a little nervous. Like you really do feel like you're sparring,
*  but when you hit them, there's no satisfaction.
*  Well, you're used to the real thing. There's nothing like that real impact,
*  right? There's, there's no replacement for hitting things, real sparring,
*  getting hit or even hitting a bag. I mean, it's, it would be nice. I mean,
*  you don't really have to hit a person, but if you, if you hit the thing,
*  like if, if they can figure out a way to make a robot, you know,
*  that was interacting with the VR program that understood where the
*  footsteps of the VR, so it's in the correct position. So like,
*  as you hit it, that's where it should be.
*  And you could actually push off of it and it would back up a little,
*  and then you could hit it. So you could combine. I bet it is.
*  It's coming. And I should be clear, like I'm not a total technophile.
*  I think we're using the tech that we have now, cause it's the best we've got.
*  And I hope that in five years with all these amazing engineers I'm surrounded
*  by and elsewhere that we won't be using that tech and we'll be doing something
*  completely different.
*  So I'm sorry to interrupt you.
*  So the, the,
*  when you are in this different race and you're walking down the street,
*  you get this, this feeling, is there overt racism?
*  Yeah. So you go to a job interview and you're standing there next to somebody
*  else. You're actually seated down. And then the interviewer comes in and says,
*  hello, nice to meet you.
*  And they put out their hand and shake the person's hand next to you white guy.
*  And then you put out your hand and they don't shake it. They go, nice to meet you.
*  They do the nah, they make eye contact.
*  And then you go into a different set of experiences.
*  It takes you through about 10 minutes of these experiences.
*  And what's interesting about it is none of them is so overwhelming that you're
*  like, Oh my God, this is what it must be like.
*  But what's interesting is I did that experience three years ago.
*  Every time I walk past a black person on the street, I now,
*  it triggers a frame of mind. I'm thinking about how I react.
*  I'm thinking about it. Whereas before I wasn't,
*  I've never considered myself a racist person. I don't now,
*  but it fundamentally changed the way that I experience interactions with people
*  on the street. And that was a 10 minute or so,
*  or 20 minute or so VR experience.
*  And that's just the tip of the iceberg about what's possible.
*  I think we really,
*  what it tells me is that because of how stringently gated plasticity is
*  plasticity is a vaulted by these chemicals.
*  We need to bring those chemicals into play if we want people to change the way
*  they feel. I don't think watching a protest on the street can do it.
*  I think the George Floyd thing absolutely did it. That was a very dramatic,
*  terrible example. It went, it was visceral to watch that.
*  And I think that's why it had the effect it did.
*  It underscores essentially everything we've been saying about neurochemicals
*  being the gates to changing the brain without that. It's not going to happen.
*  Talking about this VR program highlights.
*  One of the reasons why I don't like cities like Manhattan,
*  I'd like them to visit,
*  but I don't want to live there because you don't say hi to everybody. Right.
*  You can't. Yeah. You're just in the optic flow. Hi, how are you? Hey,
*  what's up? Hi lady. It's the human safari. It's like a,
*  I always say New York is like a human safari, but it's like the, again,
*  signal to noise.
*  Like a person has to have a cat on their head naked and on fire before you're
*  like, Oh wow. Maybe, maybe it's just that it's very impersonal. There's a,
*  there's this sort of weird thing that happens when you get around large numbers
*  of people where they don't become, they're not as valuable because they're,
*  you're overwhelmed by them. There's so many of them. Whereas if you're in a small
*  town, you know,
*  of 20,000 people and you walk down the street and there's a guy walking towards
*  you, you look at each other and go, Hey man, how you doing?
*  I like that too. I always,
*  what I liked about New York is I felt like it's you get had Italians and Irish
*  and black people and white people and Puerto Rican people. And so there's a,
*  you also experienced them. Right? You see that and you know, the Bay Area,
*  I love the Bay Area, but one of the problems I have with the Bay Area is it's
*  become, you know, people are hidden away a lot more. There isn't that,
*  in a lot of the inter culture as well. It's a car culture and,
*  and every place has its challenges.
*  But I think New York is such a beautiful experiment in putting a bunch of people
*  with different genetic and ethnic backgrounds together,
*  putting them together and saying, you know, you may not all get along,
*  but at least you will hear those, those accents.
*  You'll get cursed at in five different languages.
*  And I think there's a real beauty to it.
*  I wonder how much that's going to change because of COVID,
*  because obviously people are terrified of being jammed into a subway now with
*  strangers.
*  And that was one of the cool things about New York is that you did all walks of
*  life, poor and rich would interact with each other on the street. In LA,
*  there's virtually none of that.
*  And there's this weird sort of separation between people and where they live.
*  And then also the car thing, car cultures. I mean, it just,
*  you're in your own little environment.
*  You set up your own little world and that's your car and you're driving around
*  and these other people that you interact with,
*  that's a little segment of their world that they're taking with them on the
*  405. And because of that,
*  you don't have the same sort of melting pot aspect that you do get in New York.
*  New York really uniquely. I mean, I grew up in Boston. It doesn't have it.
*  You know, Boston has like, there's public transport. There's the T, you know,
*  you can ride the train, shit like that,
*  but it's not nearly as prevalent as the subway system in New York City or the
*  walking in New York City. Everybody's walking.
*  Yeah. And you have to be right up next to it. You know,
*  I think martial arts has this a bit as well.
*  I grew up skateboarding and that was my sport. And what I loved about it is,
*  first of all, it's like all ages. Sort of a weird sport in that way.
*  You got little kids hanging out with grown men and girls on it. Yeah.
*  And so you get this big mixing pot, but also ethnically so diverse.
*  It wasn't always like that, but you've got, you know, Vietnamese, Mexican, black,
*  you know, white kids, everything, right. Hanging out together,
*  whoever can get their tail down, drop in and go. That's great.
*  Science is making a, an effort. And I think now,
*  especially after the recent events in the world to try and bring in more
*  diversity.
*  And it's a desperate need because you want that diversity of
*  opinion. You want that diversity of outlook, et cetera.
*  We're fortunate to have a African-American colleague in our department,
*  which is actually a small department. And there's an immense need for that.
*  I think science is going to be more diverse in the years to come. That's it.
*  It's a focused effort now that the national institutes of health is going to
*  put money and energy into this, thankfully, but there can always be more done.
*  But I think when thinking about kids and neuroplasticity, like whenever,
*  you know, I'm not skateboarding anymore. It wasn't very good at it anyway,
*  but I did enjoy it. And I loved the community around that.
*  I think more of that, please for the next generation, more things like that.
*  I think martial arts is great. You go into gym and it's like,
*  it doesn't matter really where you're from, especially if you're going to spar.
*  If you're going to get in and, you know, start boxing rounds,
*  you have to be able to take it, you know, and it's not about background.
*  It's about what you can do.
*  Yeah, that is really important. I mean, and it's,
*  it's just more of those things where people can interact with all kinds of
*  different people gives you a more balanced perspective.
*  It gives you a, it gives you a broader perspective, right? You get to see,
*  and when bringing you back to the way the brain functions,
*  the more variables that you have in terms of when you see a person, you know,
*  you, you know,
*  so many different examples of human beings that you have more to draw upon.
*  And I hope that one of the things that comes out of this George Floyd thing,
*  and then the black lives matter protests is people have more open-minded
*  approach towards just human beings in general.
*  And I think these things like they happen in these big explosive mo these big
*  explosive events and then shifts.
*  And I think we're absolutely experiencing like a global consciousness
*  shift. And it's very chaotic and scary in some ways for a lot of people right
*  now. But I think ultimately we're going to come out of this the better.
*  And if you look at like say Steven Pinker's work where he covers, you know,
*  the history of human beings and interactions,
*  we are in the best time ever.
*  And it's hard to say that because you know,
*  there's still poverty and there's still violence and there's still crime and
*  there's still racism and sexism and rape and all sorts of awful shit,
*  but it's way less and way better than it was just a hundred years ago or 200
*  years ago. And it seems to constantly be moving in that trend.
*  And I'm hoping that that's going to be what comes out of this.
*  This is going to be another event that as the dust settles and as the lessons are
*  learned and as we kind of get our feet back on the ground and we understand what
*  went wrong and what happened to particularly because of this,
*  this Corona virus situation that we're in, we're, you know,
*  everything's in chaos. Everything's thrown up in the air.
*  30 something percent of people can't pay their rent right now.
*  It's nuts. It's terrible. Unemployment rates through the roof. It's crazy.
*  It's terrible. It's terrible. And every time I, you know,
*  I think being able to take someone else's frame of mind or reference,
*  just as an exercise, it's so hard.
*  I mean we become kind of autistic in our way of just feeling like our experience
*  is the one experience and just being able to try and think about what it must be
*  like over the last three months to not have any income, you know,
*  to see your gym or your business open and shut again, at least here in California,
*  incredibly stressful.
*  It's pulling on all the levers that create internal tension and outward
*  physical explosion. And we, yeah, I,
*  I am optimistic in terms of the long arc of this, but right now we,
*  we are in the pressure point. Yeah, it's rough. To bring it back to your work,
*  one of the things that you talked about was eyesight and regaining eyesight or
*  dealing with people that have weakening eyesight. My eyesight's going to shit,
*  man. Do you have a retinal condition? No.
*  And I'm just old 52 and just there's a, you know, macular degeneration.
*  Like I can, I mean I can read my phone.
*  I can read all these text messages that are coming in 14 new ones since I put
*  my phone down.
*  But what I do know for sure is that my vision is not as good as it was 10 years
*  ago and certainly not as good as it was 20 years ago. What can be done?
*  Okay. So there's what can be done now and where we're headed,
*  but I suspect you want to know what can be done now. Fix my eyes. Okay.
*  So we do have a clinical trial in my lab right now through my affiliation with
*  ophthalmology where people put on VR goggles,
*  very separate from the fear inducing thing.
*  It's actually a very pleasant experience and we use a particular pattern of
*  stimulation that activates the cells in the eye that are most vulnerable and
*  create vision loss.
*  It stimulates those in a way that reinforces their connections with the brain.
*  That's the logic.
*  So every cell in your eye has a different function,
*  but some of them their job is to transmit visual information to the rest of the
*  brain. They're called ganglion cells.
*  We know what patterns of activity make them healthy and what reinforce
*  regeneration.
*  Back in 2016 my lab published a paper showing that that particular pattern of
*  stimulation combined with a particular pattern of gene therapy.
*  So this is one injection into the eye of a gene that triggers growth of these
*  cells in mice that allowed regeneration of neurons that were damaged and it
*  actually reversed slightly, but it reversed blindness,
*  completely blind mice were able to see again. So that was in mice.
*  We then took that, built a human clinical trial using just the VR part.
*  However, some people in this trial are receiving injections.
*  It's about once every month,
*  very painless injection into what we call the vitreous of the eye.
*  They shoot it right in the eyeball. Yeah.
*  Just a little insulin syringe go right in. You look that way. Boom.
*  A skilled ophthalmologist can do this without any pain or anything.
*  I know it sounds terrible, but it's, it's very straightforward.
*  To inject something called C NTF ciliary,
*  nootrophic factor and the combination of this growth factor plus the visual
*  stimulation we believe is going to protect cells that would normally be lost from
*  getting lost.
*  So offset vision loss and potentially restore vision.
*  Now the results of this trial aren't done,
*  but we are recruiting people for this trial. Jamie, you're in right?
*  And if you're not prisoners, okay.
*  Prisoners are really bad people, but they can't see that good.
*  The injection part provided it's done by a really,
*  by a skilled ophthalmologist is, is a, it's a, it's a cinch.
*  You've been through way worse this morning on your way to work. Trust me.
*  So it's, it's nothing.
*  The other thing is that there was a paper published just recently,
*  a couple of weeks ago, not from my lab,
*  but from a group over at university college,
*  London looking at the effects of red light on mitochondria in a different cell
*  type, which are the photoreceptors of the eye.
*  So you've got the cells that connect the eye of the brain called the ganglion
*  cells. Then you got the photoreceptors,
*  which take all this photon information,
*  turn it into this incredible thing we call vision,
*  which itself is a whole galaxy of information, but is amazing.
*  And those cells degenerate over time. The photoreceptors,
*  they don't do very well in part because as we age,
*  the mitochondrial function gets disrupted.
*  This study was preliminary. It wasn't very many subjects.
*  I think it was only 20 subjects. Maybe it was 12,
*  but getting red light therapy,
*  just viewing a very bright flashes of red light of a particular wavelength.
*  So I don't want people going out there and blasting their eyes,
*  improved vision on vision tests almost immediately.
*  And that's a very noninvasive approach.
*  And I'd be happy to have one of those red light therapy machines,
*  one of those sheets. Yeah, it's probably a little different than this.
*  If you're interested in doing this, let me know. And we can, you know,
*  potentially plug you into this.
*  What would be the difference between that red light therapy and the other kind of
*  red light therapy? Cause I really liked that juve thing.
*  I'm not exactly sure what it does.
*  It's supposed to like regenerate collagen and do a bunch of different things.
*  It helps you, but it feels good. Yeah, it feels good to stand in front of it.
*  And the bright, you know, one of the things is, remember,
*  we're saying that the eyes are actually a piece of brain.
*  Your brain needs to know when to be awake and when to be asleep.
*  One of the best ways to wake up your brain is to view bright light. And,
*  you know, there are all these people that are fanatic about blue light out there.
*  Viewing bright light in the morning from sunlight is the, is the best thing.
*  Like in Southern California, you go outside two to 10 minutes of getting bright
*  light. And then you want to avoid light from like 11 PM to 4 AM.
*  Actually it's been shown to suppress melatonin. It can disrupt sleep.
*  It has a lot of problems.
*  You don't really want to be looking at any bright light in the middle of the
*  night. A lot of people get obsessed with blue light being bad.
*  You want bright light during the day and you don't want any bright light at
*  night, really too much of it. And people come after me though,
*  like the blue blockers, you know,
*  I call it like the blue block anista has been coming after me recently because
*  I'm out there saying like, it's like, what about the, it's like, look,
*  the blue blockers will help filter some light. It'll make things less bright.
*  It's hard to see with sunglasses in your house. So be my guest and wear them.
*  But really what you want to do is dim the lights in the evening, deeper sleep,
*  melatonin suppression isn't, won't be a problem. That'll, that's all good.
*  Get bright light first thing in the morning when you wake up.
*  And then the bright red light is probably having a dual effect.
*  It's probably increasing mitochondria in the photoreceptors.
*  If the study is right.
*  And I do believe this study is it looks really good to me and the person who did
*  it has been in the game a long time. So I trust him.
*  And in addition to that,
*  it's going to wake up your system and get the balance of these hormones.
*  Like you want cortisol high in the morning and,
*  and melatonin coming up about 16 hours later before sleep.
*  It's going to put all that into the right rhythm.
*  So I say go ahead and do the red light thing.
*  But if you want to pursue the red light flashes or the VR and maybe even the CNTF
*  injection, we should talk about that.
*  CNTF injection, I mean the bacteria, they squirt it right in your eyeball.
*  That's the growth factor. Yeah.
*  But I'm scared of that.
*  Well, well the good news is the good news is that the VR,
*  we do have a condition in the study where it's just VR. So it's a daily,
*  you're essentially, you know, neurons like to be active.
*  And these cells that connect the eye to the brain are the most above all others,
*  the most active neurons and cells in your entire body.
*  Do you know of anybody who's done this where they had the injections in the eyes?
*  Well, oh yeah. Many people now in the study have had the injections.
*  And what are the benefits of the, of the, well, so I want to be careful.
*  I can't talk about the results of a clinical trial,
*  but I can say they're promising and this isn't human.
*  Just wink, wink if you think I should do it.
*  Wink if you can fix my eyes.
*  Well, I think if you, if you qualify for the study,
*  I definitely think you should do it. Okay.
*  But I can't reveal that the results of the study,
*  cause I actually don't know in the name of good science,
*  I'm blinded to the conditions. No pun, right? Like I just don't know,
*  but we have, we have subjects or patients that are as young as 17,
*  as old as 80.
*  And the beauty of this is that it's if you decide not to get the injection,
*  it's completely noninvasive. Okay. And how many injections do you have to have?
*  I think it's like once a month for a period of about six months.
*  So would I have to go to the Bay area once a month?
*  No. So there,
*  so there is another version of this where there's a slow release polymer capsule
*  that's that's placed into the eye.
*  Oh, Jesus, that sounds even worse. Just inject me and get it over with.
*  Well, someday we will have drops that will get through the vitreous and down
*  there. Cause we're like, like we work on glaucoma in my lab.
*  People for glaucoma take drops for eye pressure. Um,
*  but getting things into, you know, remember it's brain.
*  And so there's a reason why you have this tough sclera.
*  I'm not going to be able to think that way. Okay.
*  The brain thing is really fucking my head up.
*  The fact that your eyeballs are your exposed two pieces of the brain.
*  That is so nuts. Two pieces of the brain.
*  And so visual repair is soon going to go the way of two other strategies.
*  And I think we're going to see this in humans in the next couple of years,
*  meaning two years, cause I hate the 10 years thing.
*  We've been here in the 10 years thing forever.
*  One is the work of someone that you've had on here before. David Sinclair.
*  Love that dude.
*  It's great. He's terrific guy, both for sake of his work on, um,
*  combating aging and also just,
*  I really have to tip my hat to him because he was really first man in in terms
*  of doing public facing science education through podcasts and things like that.
*  And you know, I'm,
*  I'm starting to do that and others are starting to do it and he deserves credit
*  for that is it puts scientists in a vulnerable place.
*  And I think he's doing it with a lot of integrity.
*  He's also got a fun personality. So it's a great guy. Yeah.
*  So for him to get the point across.
*  So David's not typically known for doing vision research,
*  but he paired up with another guy's lab, a guy named Zhigang,
*  he at Harvard children's hospital, someone I know very well.
*  We worked together on a number of things and they took advantage of what are
*  called these Yamanaka factors. Yamanaka won the Nobel prize for finding these
*  four factors that could essentially allow a cell to turn into anything,
*  any other cell type kind of create stemness in these cells,
*  make them pluripotent stem cells.
*  The problem was that tends to induce cancers in these cells.
*  So David's lab has combined an anti-cancer gene. I think these,
*  these work are still not published, but he's talked about them.
*  So I feel comfortable doing this suppresses cancer while turning these cells
*  young again. And at least in mice, they see some very encouraging results.
*  So that would be a sort of one injection kind of thing where you go in once,
*  you get the injection and then never again.
*  If I did an injection once a month, how long were we talking?
*  How many months do I have to do it for?
*  So the study would probably run for about six months or the embedded capsule,
*  the CNTF capsule combined with the VR.
*  Now you have to put those VR goggles on for 20 minutes a day and watch this.
*  That's easy. You can listen to music, do whatever you want.
*  It's a very passive thing that triggers activity. These cells,
*  the activity is key because we know that neurons, you know,
*  you hear fire together, wire together and all this other stuff.
*  But the fact of the matter is neurons that are quieted,
*  even if you cast an arm,
*  the neurons that support movement of that arm very quickly start to turn off and
*  eventually they can die.
*  So keeping neurons active and alive and healthy involves keeping them literally
*  active electrically. And so that's what this, the VR component's about.
*  So there's the Sinclair kind of turning back the clock stuff.
*  And then colleagues of mine at Stanford are doing incredible work with neural
*  prosthesis, so little robotic retinas,
*  as well as stem cells that are injected into the eye that settle down into your
*  eye and give you the cells that you've lost.
*  And we're not quite there with the human trials yet, but there's a group,
*  the retinal repair initiative. I'm part of this thing.
*  It has a kind of funny name, what it's called the retinal dream team,
*  which is a bunch of people brought together to, to cure blindness,
*  to solve blindness in a particular disease called neurofibromatosis.
*  So there are dozens of labs working extremely hard on this problem.
*  This is one place where I can say there's been tremendous progress in the last
*  five years. There are clinical trials now, for instance, the one in my lab.
*  And in two or three years,
*  you're going to start seeing people who would normally go blind.
*  You're going to halt that and you're going to see people who are completely
*  blind. I think eventually those people will see again.
*  Yeah. I have a, it's amazing. And you know, blind people,
*  the mental real, the mental real estate,
*  but like the visual real estate in the brain gets taken over by other functions.
*  I there's this guy, Dan Mancina. He's a skateboarder. He's completely blind.
*  It's amazing guy. And he boards blind with a cane rides up to rides up to curves
*  and handrails, all he's onto them. Kick flips out this kind of stuff. Regular.
*  Yeah. And, and I've talked to him a bunch of times because he was having some
*  issues with his sleep because one of the issues that blind people have is because
*  light is controlling when to be alert and when to be asleep.
*  He was having some issues with this. So he contacted me.
*  We're also in touch because we're trying to,
*  he's trying to build skate parks for blind kids so that they can, oh yeah.
*  Check out Dan. Wow. That's insane. Such a beast. I mean,
*  most people would be, would be afraid to do this without. Yeah.
*  That's crazy. Yeah. And what's, what's so great about Dan is he also,
*  you know, he's in, he's in graduate school. He's, I mean,
*  he is such a, he's tapping things so he knows where they are,
*  but how does he know the scale of the ramp or the, the pitch of the ramp?
*  He has an internal representation of it. Wow.
*  Yeah. That's bonkers. He's from Michigan.
*  You can see how cool it is.
*  Yeah. He's a, he teaches blind kids, like what's possible.
*  Cause talk about COVID and being indoors, blind people.
*  I spent a lot of time with blind people because of the visual restoration stuff.
*  And there are people like Dan who are out there trying to get blind people to
*  come out of their rooms to get into society. If you have a dog, you're better off.
*  Right. Cause the dog, you outsource your vision to the dog.
*  There are now glasses that blind people can wear and walk down the street.
*  And it communicates with somebody in a, like a dispatcher who says, Oh,
*  you know what? There's someone sketchy over there to your right.
*  You might want to cross the street and it works really well,
*  but it's very expensive. And of course, privacy is an issue. You get home,
*  you start undressing, you know, you don't want the person like looking at you in
*  the mirror. Right. You know, or maybe people do,
*  but that's a whole different business, you know, but,
*  but people like Dan are amazing. And, and I do believe, you know,
*  the hope is that people like Dan will eventually see again.
*  But that's going to require new cells and actually for him,
*  he's going to need new eyes. So Dan actually has had,
*  because he had this coats disease that led to a red, nice pigmentosa.
*  He had his eyes removed. So whenever people are like,
*  sometimes you'll see on social media, people will say, I don't believe he's blind.
*  It's like, guy doesn't even have eyes. Yeah. So anyway, there's a,
*  that's a whole universe of stuff.
*  But if you would like to explore visual repair and visual restoration,
*  offsetting vision loss more, be happy to further.
*  Yeah, I would love to. Yeah. I'll be a guinea pig. Let's get the party rolling.
*  Dude, we just did three hours. Oh my, not crazy. Sorry. No,
*  okay. Apologies. It was awesome. Great conversation. I really appreciate it.
*  If people want to get ahold of you on social media, what's your Twitter?
*  You have Twitter, Instagram. I have a Twitter, but I don't use it.
*  I'm on Instagram. It's Huberman lab, H U B E R M A N L A B.
*  I teach neuroscience there. I'm big on public education. Beautiful.
*  And we recruit subjects to the lab for studies every now and again.
*  I will announce them there. And yeah, that's the deal.
*  Eventually I'm supposed to write a book, but I'm, I've been too busy doing science.
*  Well, listen, man, this was so much fun.
*  And I think we could probably do a hundred of these. So let's do it again.
*  Thank you very much. Really appreciate you. All right. Bye everybody.
