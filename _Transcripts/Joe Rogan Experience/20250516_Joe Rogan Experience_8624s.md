*  My pleasure. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=56.0s)]
*  This is a long time coming. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=57.0s)]
*  I've been waiting for this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=61.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=62.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=63.0s)]
*  I mean, especially all the influence you've had and things you've done. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=64.0s)]
*  And I know the funny side of you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=67.0s)]
*  I know the UFC side of you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=69.0s)]
*  But watching the podcast and seeing all the characters, and I was just watching the Bill Murray interview the other day. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=70.0s)]
*  And I just look at it and I go, man, to hear those stories talking about Hunter and just all that and all the... [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=77.0s)]
*  I mean, it's pretty... [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=84.0s)]
*  You got to have your mind blown by now. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=85.0s)]
*  Yeah, my mind's been blown out. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=88.0s)]
*  It's kind of overblown at this point. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=90.0s)]
*  It's huge. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=93.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=94.0s)]
*  I mean, I think about what you did with Trump and all that influence that you made and you call it straight up the line. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=95.0s)]
*  You want to come on the show? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=100.0s)]
*  You want to do this? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=101.0s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=102.0s)]
*  And took the time to do it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=103.0s)]
*  I think it was a huge impact. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=104.0s)]
*  I think that we look at all the people that you've given a chance. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=105.0s)]
*  You've given them a platform. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=108.0s)]
*  And I think that's really... [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=110.0s)]
*  It's fair of you. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=111.0s)]
*  And the way you interview, the way I see it from doing a few interviews, you let people talk. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=112.0s)]
*  You let them speak their piece. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=118.0s)]
*  You continue to help them through not getting stuck on one thing. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=120.0s)]
*  You navigate them pretty well. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=125.0s)]
*  And it's really... [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=127.0s)]
*  I mean, it's from a guy that's in the business, not to this level, but got to the business. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=129.0s)]
*  It's respectful, man. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=133.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=135.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=136.0s)]
*  What is Knuckle Sandwich business? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=137.0s)]
*  You even have a... [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=138.0s)]
*  Your chain is a Knuckle Sandwich chain. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=139.0s)]
*  It's all has history. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=141.0s)]
*  Just kind of like as I toured the museum today. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=143.0s)]
*  Chef's hat with a skull. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=145.0s)]
*  Started with that tattoo. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=147.0s)]
*  One of the first tattoos I ever had. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=148.0s)]
*  Culinary gangster. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=150.0s)]
*  So my buddy Joe Leonard, monkey wrench tattoo, great friend of mine, did my first tattoo. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=152.0s)]
*  And he made that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=157.0s)]
*  He says, I have this drawing for you. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=159.0s)]
*  I want to show this to you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=161.0s)]
*  And that's pretty, you know, skull, chef. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=163.0s)]
*  Let me check it out. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=166.0s)]
*  So I don't put a tattoo on until he draws it on first. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=168.0s)]
*  I have to have it on for a while. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=170.0s)]
*  Like I have to look at it for a couple days. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=172.0s)]
*  Like does this resonate with me? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=174.0s)]
*  So that's how it started. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=176.0s)]
*  This way before TV, way before any of this. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=177.0s)]
*  And when I got on TV, when I got on Food Network, they were going to send me my first paycheck. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=179.0s)]
*  You wouldn't believe how much I made that first episode. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=185.0s)]
*  I mean, just huge money. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=187.0s)]
*  $1,250 an episode. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=189.0s)]
*  You know when you get started. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=191.0s)]
*  And I wasn't planning on TV. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=193.0s)]
*  But anyhow, I came back and I had all my buddies around my table. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=194.0s)]
*  My house was kind of like a soup kitchen. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=196.0s)]
*  And all my buddies come by and someone will bring, you know, crabs. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=198.0s)]
*  Someone will bring some steak or whatever. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=201.0s)]
*  And so I'm sitting there with all my buddies. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=203.0s)]
*  I said, hey, I got to think of a name for my TV, like my other business. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=204.0s)]
*  Because my restaurant business had a business partner and I didn't want the checks to come to the business. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=209.0s)]
*  So I said, what do you think? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=213.0s)]
*  My one buddy, Dirty, says, my nickname is Guido. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=214.0s)]
*  He says, how about you make us something to eat? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=218.0s)]
*  And that'll give us like some food for knowledge. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=220.0s)]
*  And then, and I said, you know, and I'm serious. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=223.0s)]
*  I want to come up with a name for the company. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=227.0s)]
*  I got to get this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=228.0s)]
*  I got to get my $1,200 check sent to me. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=229.0s)]
*  And I go, hey, Dirty, how about I give you a knuckle sandwich? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=231.0s)]
*  And he goes, that'd be a good name. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=234.0s)]
*  That's it? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=237.0s)]
*  That was it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=238.0s)]
*  And it was originally that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=239.0s)]
*  It was originally a sandwich with a ring on it and a sandwich made out of money. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=240.0s)]
*  And that was Knuckle Sandwich. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=245.0s)]
*  And then it just kind of all evolved from there. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=246.0s)]
*  And so all my companies go into the brand of Knuckle Sandwich. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=248.0s)]
*  But I never put a product of wine or tequila or anything I ever did. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=252.0s)]
*  And we started making these cigars. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=256.0s)]
*  And this guy that I'm partnered with is such a such a guru, a guy named Eric Espinosa. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=258.0s)]
*  And we sat there and talked about it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=264.0s)]
*  And I have another brand called Flavortown. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=267.0s)]
*  Like Flavortown is too whimsical and too, you know, it's got to be something. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=269.0s)]
*  I didn't want to call Guy Fieri. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=273.0s)]
*  You know, I didn't want to have my name on it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=274.0s)]
*  I don't want to do stuff that like buy this because it's my, you know, it's my name. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=275.0s)]
*  I just want to do something, you know, and we all thought about it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=279.0s)]
*  We said, cigars are that good. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=283.0s)]
*  And he's such a badass. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=284.0s)]
*  It's called Knuckle Sandwich. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=285.0s)]
*  Did you have any idea in the beginning of your career of being a TV guy? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=287.0s)]
*  Like, how did all that stuff start? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=292.0s)]
*  Because it's a weird world. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=294.0s)]
*  You know, I had a conversation with Jose Andres about this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=296.0s)]
*  I watched it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=299.0s)]
*  The emergence of the celebrity chef is like, I mean, it used to be like Julia Child, like way, way back in the day. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=300.0s)]
*  The OG. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=308.0s)]
*  Shoes. And then. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=309.0s)]
*  This one? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=310.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=311.0s)]
*  And I guess there's a few other people, but they never were like cultural figures. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=312.0s)]
*  I guess Julia Child was. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=318.0s)]
*  She was probably the only one. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=319.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=321.0s)]
*  She was really it, right? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=322.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was PBS. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=324.0s)]
*  You know, that was PBS. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=325.0s)]
*  I wasn't people really blowing it up. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=326.0s)]
*  I mean, I watched it because I loved that I was in love with food at a young age. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=329.0s)]
*  I mean, I just was one because I didn't really experience and like exactly what my parents are feeding me. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=332.0s)]
*  My parents are really good cooks. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=337.0s)]
*  They weren't in the cooking business. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=339.0s)]
*  But yeah, this whole food thing, I had before I got on Food Network, I had never watched the Food Network. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=340.0s)]
*  And not because I don't believe in it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=346.0s)]
*  I mean, food's my epicenter of what I do. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=348.0s)]
*  But the last thing I was going to do working seven days a week, 12, 13, 15 hours a day in the restaurant. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=350.0s)]
*  Come home and watch more food. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=356.0s)]
*  It's going to watch somebody make me a pot pie. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=357.0s)]
*  I'm like, I got enough. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=359.0s)]
*  Plus, I also didn't really have a true understanding of what was going on. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=361.0s)]
*  Knew who Emeril was. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=364.0s)]
*  I mean, you couldn't. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=365.0s)]
*  Or he's another one. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=366.0s)]
*  Remember when he had that sitcom? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=367.0s)]
*  His tagline, bam. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=369.0s)]
*  Like they decided to try to put that into a sitcom. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=372.0s)]
*  We just had that conversation the other day. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=376.0s)]
*  Yeah, we just had that conversation. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=378.0s)]
*  But Emeril's the OG. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=379.0s)]
*  I give such appreciation and accolades to everybody that did it before me. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=381.0s)]
*  There were so many people that helped pave the way in one style of another. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=386.0s)]
*  And some in TV, some literary, some just keeping the energy of the industry alive. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=390.0s)]
*  Because if you're not from the industry, you don't quite exactly get what it is. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=398.0s)]
*  But it's like understanding UFC. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=402.0s)]
*  The bigger fan you become of something, the more you start looking at it and just going, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=405.0s)]
*  it is so much more than what you're watching in the ring for the next 20 minutes. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=410.0s)]
*  It's really deep. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=415.0s)]
*  And there's so much more. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=417.0s)]
*  There's so much, it's not just lifestyle, it's attitude, it's energy, it's connectivity, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=418.0s)]
*  it's family, it's community, it's all that kind of stuff. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=423.0s)]
*  So did you, like how does one go from being a chef to being a TV chef? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=426.0s)]
*  Like what was it, did you just get an audition? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=433.0s)]
*  Like did they contact a bunch of chefs? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=436.0s)]
*  Like who's got the wackiest hair? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=438.0s)]
*  And who looks like they would be good on TV? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=440.0s)]
*  Like how do they figure something like that out? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=442.0s)]
*  This is about the most wack story in the world. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=445.0s)]
*  So, alright, so never graduated high school. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=448.0s)]
*  Dropped out of high school when I was 16, went to France, was an exchange student. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=451.0s)]
*  I'm going to give you a little bit more of the back story than you probably want. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=455.0s)]
*  But I'll kind of give you the quick version. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=458.0s)]
*  So when I came back from France, I was supposed to go to my senior year in high school, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=461.0s)]
*  and I wasn't really super interested in going back to high school. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=464.0s)]
*  I just lived in France in a boarding house and went to high school and I didn't even speak French. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=467.0s)]
*  But my parents were really open minded and I had saved my money. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=471.0s)]
*  And they said, if you can pass a year of French at the junior college at 16, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=474.0s)]
*  and you can pass the class and you can figure it out, I guess. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=478.0s)]
*  So I went and lived in a boarding house and went to high school. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=481.0s)]
*  Came back, my senior year I just was not interested in going back to high school. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=483.0s)]
*  So I went to junior college, finished junior college, went to UNLV, got my degree, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=486.0s)]
*  graduated a little bit early and went and ran restaurants for other people. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=490.0s)]
*  And then, and I was 26, moved back to the wine country up to Northern California where I'm from, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=494.0s)]
*  opened my first restaurant. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=500.0s)]
*  Had a bunch of restaurants with a buddy, things were great, did exactly what I wanted to do. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=501.0s)]
*  I wanted to be, you know, have a great wife, I wanted to be a great dad, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=505.0s)]
*  I wanted to have my own restaurant. That's all I wanted. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=508.0s)]
*  Not that I was short-sighted and stuff, like big community person, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=510.0s)]
*  wanted to do a lot of community service and so forth. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=514.0s)]
*  My parents were that way. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=516.0s)]
*  So that was it, man. I had like three restaurants, I owned a couple hot rods, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=517.0s)]
*  bought my own house, I was living it, you know. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=523.0s)]
*  And a bunch of friends came up to me, actually a kid across the street came to me and said, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=528.0s)]
*  have you watched Food Network? I said no. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=532.0s)]
*  He said, we have a show on there called The Food Network Star, you should go on that show. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=534.0s)]
*  I hadn't even seen Food Network. I saw Rachel Ray one time, I was at a bar, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=539.0s)]
*  I saw Rachel Ray on screen and I'm like, that girl's got energy. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=542.0s)]
*  I mean, listen to her, and she could talk food, she does no shit. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=545.0s)]
*  So that was whatever. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=548.0s)]
*  About six, eight months later, my wife's driving home from the city, she says, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=551.0s)]
*  hey, I was just listening to the radio station, they have that Food Network Star show going on [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=555.0s)]
*  because you'd be great in that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=559.0s)]
*  How do you know you haven't seen the show? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=560.0s)]
*  She says, no, they're just talking about it, like the culinary challenges and all the things, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=562.0s)]
*  and then if you do it, you win a show. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=565.0s)]
*  What do I want a show for? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=567.0s)]
*  You know, I'm doing what? I've not been on TV. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=569.0s)]
*  I made my own TV commercials for my restaurant. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=572.0s)]
*  That was the only thing I ever did that was TV. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=574.0s)]
*  So none of it was appealing when they contacted you and they asked you... [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=576.0s)]
*  I wouldn't say it wasn't appealing, it just wasn't in my scope. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=580.0s)]
*  Right. It wasn't in your plans. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=584.0s)]
*  It wasn't like something I was seeking. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=586.0s)]
*  We had talked about it. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=588.0s)]
*  There had been many people that had come to me before and said, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=589.0s)]
*  like my buddy that was the marketing manager for Flowmaster, remember Flowmaster's? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=591.0s)]
*  The mufflers? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=599.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, okay. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=600.0s)]
*  Hot Rod mufflers? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=601.0s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=602.0s)]
*  So he came to me and said, you should do a Hot Rod show. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=603.0s)]
*  You love Hot Rods, let's do a Hot Rod show. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=604.0s)]
*  I mean, I know enough to be dangerous about Hot Rods. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=606.0s)]
*  I mean, I know just enough to get into the conversation where I bury myself. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=610.0s)]
*  And so that was that. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=613.0s)]
*  So anyhow, the show, they say make a three-minute pitch. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=616.0s)]
*  So all my buddies were like, you know, you got to make the pitch. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=620.0s)]
*  You got to do the thing, you got to do the thing, you got to do the thing. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=623.0s)]
*  And I avoided it any way I could. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=625.0s)]
*  And to the point where it had expired, like the entry time had expired. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=627.0s)]
*  So my buddy named Mustard, we were on a barbecue team together. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=632.0s)]
*  We did competition barbecue and all kinds of crazy shit. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=638.0s)]
*  And he says, do you ever send that demo tape into the Food Network? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=641.0s)]
*  And I said, no, I just missed that window. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=645.0s)]
*  And he goes, good, I thought you were going to say that. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=647.0s)]
*  He says, because they opened it back up, there's another week. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=649.0s)]
*  He says, let's go make that. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=651.0s)]
*  I'm like, I don't want to do this. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=653.0s)]
*  He's like, don't be, you know, you always push every, you know, this is the truth. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=655.0s)]
*  Because I push all my friends in, like open your own business, go on that vacation, have kids. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=658.0s)]
*  You know, I'm always the one that's kind of, you know, go live your best life. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=662.0s)]
*  And so I kind of had to walk my talk. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=666.0s)]
*  Last thing I wanted to do, Joe, honestly, is go on TV. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=668.0s)]
*  And because I never went to culinary school, you know, I just been cooking through my, you know, that was my career. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=671.0s)]
*  And it's what I did as passion and living in France. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=678.0s)]
*  You opened up a restaurant without ever going to culinary school. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=681.0s)]
*  No. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=683.0s)]
*  Is that unusual? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=684.0s)]
*  I think it's probably 60, 40. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=685.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=688.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=689.0s)]
*  60, 40 that go to school or? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=690.0s)]
*  60 go to school. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=691.0s)]
*  That's a lot that don't though. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=692.0s)]
*  I could really be off on that. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=693.0s)]
*  When I do diners, drive-ins and dives, 70, 60 percent don't go. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=694.0s)]
*  A lot of the mom and pops. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=702.0s)]
*  And that doesn't mean that they don't learn. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=704.0s)]
*  I mean, some of the best chefs I know haven't been to culinary school and just are super smart at learning and dig in. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=706.0s)]
*  A lot of education, a lot of research, a lot of trial and error, a lot of putting yourself out there. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=712.0s)]
*  You got to be willing to fail. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=716.0s)]
*  Like, I don't really think you'd be a good cook if you're not willing to fail. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=717.0s)]
*  I mean, if you're just, if you stay in your lane so much, I just think that you get better chances to, well, let's think about fighting. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=721.0s)]
*  You know, think about things you've learned. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=729.0s)]
*  All the education in martial arts and boxing and all these different perspectives that people take to be in it. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=731.0s)]
*  It's usually the one that has a pretty good, you know, narrow focus on something they really, really love, but then having that outside perspective. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=737.0s)]
*  So for me as a chef, having the ability to understand Indian food, you know, there's such a depth there that I'll never hit the bottom. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=745.0s)]
*  You'll never touch all the opportunities that there are. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=753.0s)]
*  But yeah, so back to that, I made the demo tape and I made it so ridiculous that there's no way. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=756.0s)]
*  There's just no way they were going to pick me. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=764.0s)]
*  What did you do in the demo tape? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=766.0s)]
*  Do you have it? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=768.0s)]
*  You guys, I think you can find it online. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=769.0s)]
*  You can find it? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=770.0s)]
*  Put the headphones on. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=771.0s)]
*  I can't believe I just told you to put the headphones on. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=772.0s)]
*  Oh, you guys already have them. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=774.0s)]
*  God damn it, you set me up. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=775.0s)]
*  I didn't set you up. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=776.0s)]
*  Did you really get it that fast? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=777.0s)]
*  No, Jimmy just pulled it up. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=778.0s)]
*  Jamie, did you pull it up that fast? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=779.0s)]
*  Listen, Jimmy just sucked. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=780.0s)]
*  Welcome to Sonoma County, California, home of true wine country cuisine. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=781.0s)]
*  Today I'm going to prepare a dish for you, not in, not in fusion, but in confusion. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=784.0s)]
*  I'm going to do a gorgonzola tofu sausage terrine that we served over a mildly poached ostrich egg. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=788.0s)]
*  Now, since we're in the wine country, I'll be serving that on, on grape nuts and done with a delicious pickled herring mousse right on top. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=795.0s)]
*  And, oh, I know, delicious. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=802.0s)]
*  It's, it shivers up my spine. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=803.0s)]
*  No, seriously, folks, real food for real people. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=809.0s)]
*  That's the idea. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=812.0s)]
*  See, it's all getting messed up. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=813.0s)]
*  People are trying to take everything off the shelf and jam it onto a plate. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=814.0s)]
*  And that's not what it has to be. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=817.0s)]
*  I learned how to cook out of survival. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=819.0s)]
*  My parents are going through this macrobiotic cooking in the late seventies, and I had enough bulgur and steamed fish to kill a kid. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=820.0s)]
*  So the idea in our family was whoever made the dinner got to decide what it was going to be. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=826.0s)]
*  And being of Italian descent, pasta was always one of the keys. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=831.0s)]
*  I went and studied in France and then came back and got my degree at University of Nevada, Las Vegas and restaurant administration. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=834.0s)]
*  But a district manager in Los Angeles and moved up here to Northern California to open up three different concept restaurants. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=840.0s)]
*  What I'd like to talk to you about and what I think I could do as a Food Network host is teach people about real food, real people. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=846.0s)]
*  Get it to the basics. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=853.0s)]
*  Great product, great equipment, great ideas. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=854.0s)]
*  See, anybody can read a cookbook. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=856.0s)]
*  Anybody can come up with a simple idea. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=858.0s)]
*  But the idea is bringing it to the table. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=860.0s)]
*  I take people's imaginations and put them on the plate. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=862.0s)]
*  Let me show you one of my favorite. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=865.0s)]
*  I was on my way back from Houston where I was down there. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=866.0s)]
*  I can't believe you're making me go through this. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=869.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=871.0s)]
*  Seven style barbecue and mix it into Japanese cooking. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=873.0s)]
*  See, in Japanese sushi does not mean raw fish. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=876.0s)]
*  And that's what people think it does. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=879.0s)]
*  It means seasoned rice. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=880.0s)]
*  So I take a little bit of seasoned rice, a little bit of smoked pork butt. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=881.0s)]
*  And we put this together here in a dish with a little of our American favorite, french fries, and mix this together with a little bit of the California favorite, some avocado. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=886.0s)]
*  And I came up with this idea. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=896.0s)]
*  And as I was doing this, a buddy came around the corner and says, Guido, what are you doing? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=897.0s)]
*  He says, you can't put that into rice. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=901.0s)]
*  You can't make sushi out of barbecue. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=904.0s)]
*  What are you doing, you jackass? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=906.0s)]
*  And that's what this dish is called. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=907.0s)]
*  It's actually called the jackass roll. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=909.0s)]
*  So we mix it up. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=911.0s)]
*  We serve it over. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=912.0s)]
*  The idea about cooking is not just about great food. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=913.0s)]
*  It's about putting all the pieces. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=915.0s)]
*  Do you have a sharp knife? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=917.0s)]
*  Do you understand sanitation? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=918.0s)]
*  Do you know where to get it from? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=920.0s)]
*  And do you know how to tie all the components together? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=921.0s)]
*  You see, my idea about it is, is there so much more to teach. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=924.0s)]
*  As a restaurateur, people ask me all the time, how do you do it? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=927.0s)]
*  I can take the restaurant and bring it to the home. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=930.0s)]
*  And I think that would be something that would be sellable. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=933.0s)]
*  My name is Guy Fieri. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=935.0s)]
*  My friends call me Guido. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=936.0s)]
*  You can now consider me your friend. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=938.0s)]
*  Why did you think that would be ridiculous? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=940.0s)]
*  That seems pretty straightforward. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=942.0s)]
*  What's the matter, Jamie? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=943.0s)]
*  Oh, your switch is fucking up again? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=946.0s)]
*  You got to reboot again? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=948.0s)]
*  Go ahead, reboot. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=952.0s)]
*  No worries. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=953.0s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=954.0s)]
*  That seems pretty straightforward. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=957.0s)]
*  I don't know why you would think that that would somehow or another, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=960.0s)]
*  like, that I was going to pick you. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=963.0s)]
*  I was taking it seriously. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=965.0s)]
*  I wasn't taking it seriously. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=966.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=967.0s)]
*  The whole beginning line was so cool. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=968.0s)]
*  That's a TV personality. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=969.0s)]
*  That's like. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=970.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=971.0s)]
*  Listen, I didn't one take. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=972.0s)]
*  That was it. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=973.0s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=974.0s)]
*  You guys happy? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=975.0s)]
*  Shit's done. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=976.0s)]
*  I don't know why you would think that that would be something they would never pick you [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=977.0s)]
*  from. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=982.0s)]
*  Well, I didn't know back then what I know about TV now. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=983.0s)]
*  Oh, you thought you had to be like super professional. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=985.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=989.0s)]
*  I thought if I talked some shit and I kind of made it a joke and I told them what are [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=990.0s)]
*  they doing, I thought like, hey, I'll be so, you know. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=994.0s)]
*  I mean, that is pretty true to who I am anyway. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=997.0s)]
*  What year was that? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1000.0s)]
*  2005? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1002.0s)]
*  Yeah, 2005. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1003.0s)]
*  Yeah, 2005. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1004.0s)]
*  First showed in air to 2006. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1005.0s)]
*  But yeah, so I sent it to them and I sent it on a DVD because my buddy that filmed it [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1011.0s)]
*  worked at the TV station and he put it, he burned it from the camera and put on DVD. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1020.2s)]
*  Back in the old days. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1024.0s)]
*  So I sent it in. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1025.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1026.0s)]
*  I did my deal. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1027.0s)]
*  I said I would do it. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1028.0s)]
*  I did it. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1029.0s)]
*  So it gets in. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1030.0s)]
*  Three days later, late at night, 10 o'clock at night, Lori and I are sitting, my wife [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1031.0s)]
*  and I are sitting on the couch watching TV. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1037.0s)]
*  Home phone rings. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1039.0s)]
*  She goes, no, she's from Rhode Island, North Providence. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1040.0s)]
*  So she's a little bit tough on the phone at 10 a.m. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1044.0s)]
*  At 10 p.m. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1046.0s)]
*  You know, like who's calling at 10 p.m.? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1047.0s)]
*  No, I don't know where he is. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1048.0s)]
*  No, he's not here. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1050.0s)]
*  I'll take a message. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1051.0s)]
*  No. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1052.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1053.0s)]
*  No. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1054.0s)]
*  She finally covers the phone. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1055.0s)]
*  She goes, it's the Food Network. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1056.0s)]
*  Bullshit. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1058.0s)]
*  Food Network. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1059.0s)]
*  It's one of my buddies being a jerk off. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1060.0s)]
*  So I pick up the phone. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1062.0s)]
*  I go, hello, Food Network. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1063.0s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1064.0s)]
*  And they said, is this guy Ferrari? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1065.0s)]
*  And I'm like, okay. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1068.0s)]
*  Because I know it's not because it was one of my buddies. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1070.0s)]
*  They would have said, you know, Fieri. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1072.0s)]
*  So she goes, yeah, we got your DVD and we'd like to talk to you about it. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1074.0s)]
*  We want you to be on the show. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1078.0s)]
*  I said, okay, what does that entail? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1079.0s)]
*  Well, there's a contract that'll be on your door tomorrow morning. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1081.0s)]
*  We FedEx it to you. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1083.0s)]
*  So I get the FedEx and I look at it and I give it to one of my attorney buddies. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1084.0s)]
*  Like, man, they own your ass. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1089.0s)]
*  If you sign this, I can own you. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1091.0s)]
*  So he redlined a bunch and I sent it back to him. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1093.0s)]
*  They call me back and they said, you can't redline the contract that we're sending you. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1095.0s)]
*  This is like you want on the show or you don't want on the show. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1099.0s)]
*  What is like when you say they own you? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1102.0s)]
*  Like, what do you mean? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1103.0s)]
*  Oh, he says, you know how a contract goes when you get into TV. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1104.0s)]
*  I mean, there's like, you know, we've got you for 36 months. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1107.0s)]
*  You can't do any other production. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1110.0s)]
*  You know, whatever. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1111.0s)]
*  36 months. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1112.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1113.0s)]
*  Don't quote me on any of it. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1114.0s)]
*  All I know is I had never signed an entertainment contract at that point. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1115.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1119.0s)]
*  So a lot of them are pretty predatory. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1120.0s)]
*  They take advantage of the person that doesn't have any exposure. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1122.0s)]
*  If you're going to become a star, they want to profit massively off it. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1125.0s)]
*  And so that's where it kind of my guy said to me, he goes, you have your own restaurants. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1128.0s)]
*  You're doing your own thing. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1132.0s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1133.0s)]
*  What are you going to go on TV? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1134.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1135.0s)]
*  And so long story short, I went, Lori and I were pregnant eight and a half months. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1136.0s)]
*  You were pregnant too? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1141.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1142.0s)]
*  Well, that's what I call it. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1143.0s)]
*  I held the baby weight. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1144.0s)]
*  But we were, you know, we're pregnant. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1145.0s)]
*  We got the kid coming. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1147.0s)]
*  We, Hunter was four. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1148.0s)]
*  No, Hunter was. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1149.0s)]
*  Did you name after Hunter Thompson? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1150.0s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1152.0s)]
*  Did you know that or you just saying that? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1153.0s)]
*  No, I didn't know that. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1155.0s)]
*  Oh, that's a hundred percent. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1156.0s)]
*  I was, I, cause I saw all the Hunter Thompson in the hallway and I saw the Bill Murray interview. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1157.0s)]
*  I read Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1162.0s)]
*  I don't read a lot, but I read that book probably five times. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1164.0s)]
*  That's a great book. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1169.0s)]
*  That's a great book. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1170.0s)]
*  Such a great book. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1171.0s)]
*  And when I got out of college, I lived in a town I didn't know anybody. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1172.0s)]
*  I lived in Long Beach. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1175.0s)]
*  I didn't know anybody. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1176.0s)]
*  I just worked at this restaurant and I'm not a big TV person. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1177.0s)]
*  So I just read the book and I read it in college and I read it again and I read it again. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1182.0s)]
*  And it's funny when you read something again, I got that from the Dale Carnegie book. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1186.0s)]
*  I read Dale Carnegie and you know, you have to read it a hundred times or how many times. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1189.0s)]
*  I just like, man, this guy owns it. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1194.0s)]
*  This guy lives it. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1197.0s)]
*  This guy just, you know, what a character. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1198.0s)]
*  And then the more I read about him and the more you kind of learn about him. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1200.0s)]
*  And so I told my wife, so we have Hunter and Rider. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1203.0s)]
*  Rider's a freshman in San Diego State. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1206.0s)]
*  Hunter just graduated with his MBA at University of Miami. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1209.0s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1212.0s)]
*  So that's where Hunter came from. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1213.0s)]
*  That's great. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1214.0s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1215.0s)]
*  And my nephew Jules, who's in the middle of the two, we raised Jules. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1216.0s)]
*  My sister died when Jules was really young. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1218.0s)]
*  And so Jules just is graduating this Sunday with his degree from Loyola in law. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1221.0s)]
*  He's in EDM music. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1226.0s)]
*  He's an agent. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1229.0s)]
*  Oh, cool. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1230.0s)]
*  So anyhow, I got on the show. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1231.0s)]
*  I got there. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1233.0s)]
*  Everybody standing there buttoned up in their chef coats. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1234.0s)]
*  I walk in and I'm in New York and I've been to New York. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1237.0s)]
*  I'm in flip flops and shorts and a yellow leather jacket. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1240.0s)]
*  And I walk in and everybody's like, you know, all puckered. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1244.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, this is not going to go well. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1248.0s)]
*  This is going to be a shit show. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1251.0s)]
*  And I just said, you know what? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1253.0s)]
*  You got to give it a shot. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1254.0s)]
*  So I just went in. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1255.0s)]
*  I was just me. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1256.0s)]
*  Did what I do. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1257.0s)]
*  I won. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1258.0s)]
*  So I won the show. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1260.0s)]
*  And what this show, what you win is a six episode cooking show, which they ran at 7 a.m. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1261.0s)]
*  on Saturdays. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1267.0s)]
*  I mean, it was the worst time slot in the world. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1268.0s)]
*  But they gave me the show and I did good. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1270.0s)]
*  And they gave me another show. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1273.0s)]
*  And I did the show and I hated it. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1275.0s)]
*  I did the pilot and I hated it. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1278.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I can't do this. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1280.0s)]
*  What was that show? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1281.0s)]
*  It's called Gotta Get It. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1282.0s)]
*  I don't think you're going to find him. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1283.0s)]
*  You're not going to find this. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1285.0s)]
*  He'll find it. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1286.0s)]
*  No, Jesus, please. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1287.0s)]
*  I don't think it was never aired. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1288.0s)]
*  So what it was, it was a show. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1289.0s)]
*  It was a show about it was a show about kitchen gadgets. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1290.0s)]
*  And I'm not a kitchen gadget chef. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1296.0s)]
*  Oh, so it's like you got to get one of these Cuisinart's. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1299.0s)]
*  It wasn't even that good. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1304.0s)]
*  I mean, it was like avocado slicer. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1305.0s)]
*  You can't slice avocado. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1307.0s)]
*  Don't eat it. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1308.0s)]
*  I mean, you got a problem. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1309.0s)]
*  But there was a cool one. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1310.0s)]
*  There was an oven that talked Bluetooth to your phone. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1311.0s)]
*  And that was way before Bluetooth stuff was really going on. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1314.0s)]
*  There was a two-stroke Weed Eater mower with a blender on it. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1318.0s)]
*  And that was the coolest one. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1323.0s)]
*  I made margaritas in that. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1325.0s)]
*  So anyhow, but the one they gave me that sucked the worst, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1327.0s)]
*  or the one that I wasn't excited, was they gave me a ball, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1330.0s)]
*  like a hamster ball. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1333.0s)]
*  Remember the hamster ball? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1334.0s)]
*  You put the hamster ball around the house. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1335.0s)]
*  You'd put a cream and vanilla and sugar and all this in a ball [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1337.0s)]
*  and then throw ice cubes in it. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1341.0s)]
*  And then you would roll the ball around, kick it around. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1342.0s)]
*  And it would roll and it would make ice cream. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1345.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1347.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1348.0s)]
*  Kind of fun. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1349.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1350.0s)]
*  So I forgot it has a sushi barbecue restaurant. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1351.0s)]
*  Yeah, how long does it take to make ice cream by kicking a ball around? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1354.0s)]
*  I don't know, too long. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1357.0s)]
*  I was thinking, that's fun. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1359.0s)]
*  But then I thought, no. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1361.0s)]
*  How much time? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1362.0s)]
*  Go kick it when you're in flip flops. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1363.0s)]
*  So I did the whole thing, and they called me a couple weeks later [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1365.0s)]
*  and they said, congratulations. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1368.0s)]
*  The show got picked up for 13 episodes, primetime. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1369.0s)]
*  I'm like, I got to be honest with you. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1372.0s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to do that show. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1376.0s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1378.0s)]
*  Like, no, it's not. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1379.0s)]
*  So it went through a series of people, like executive, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1381.0s)]
*  executive from a production company, the owner of the production company, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1384.0s)]
*  yelling at me, telling me he wasted all his time and his money. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1388.0s)]
*  I said, hey, nobody told me that if this got picked up, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1391.0s)]
*  I had to go do the show. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1394.0s)]
*  I thought it was a discovery for you, a discovery for me. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1395.0s)]
*  I don't know shit from Steak Sauce about how this all works, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1398.0s)]
*  which I quickly turned that. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1402.0s)]
*  I was not going to be inside of the TV business and not be really aware of what goes on. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1403.0s)]
*  So finally, the president of the network called me and she said, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1408.0s)]
*  you're burning a huge opportunity, Brooke Johnson. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1411.0s)]
*  You're burning a huge opportunity. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1414.0s)]
*  I said, Brooke, it's all about, to me, about authenticity. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1415.0s)]
*  I said, I don't need the paycheck. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1419.0s)]
*  I said, I don't need the paycheck and I don't need, I said, I'm happy with my life. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1421.0s)]
*  I love what I do. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1424.0s)]
*  I like my cooking show called Guy's Big Bite. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1425.0s)]
*  You know, cook food the way I want, call it what I want to call it, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1428.0s)]
*  make it the way I want to make it. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1430.0s)]
*  And I said, I just don't, me and gadgets for cooking is just not a thing. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1432.0s)]
*  She said, well, you might not ever get a shot like this again. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1436.0s)]
*  I said, I really appreciate the opportunity and I'm not trying to be a jerk, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1438.0s)]
*  but I just don't want to do it. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1442.0s)]
*  And she said, OK. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1443.0s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1446.0s)]
*  But fortunately, six months later, she called me back and said, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1447.0s)]
*  we're going to give you one more shot. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1450.0s)]
*  You're going to be a food critic. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1452.0s)]
*  I said, no, thank you. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1453.0s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1455.0s)]
*  Hold on. Why not? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1456.0s)]
*  I said, I'm not a food critic. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1458.0s)]
*  I'm a cook. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1460.0s)]
*  Last thing I'm going to do is go in and tell people they're doing it right and wrong. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1461.0s)]
*  That's like someone going and telling somebody they don't like their arts wrong. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1464.0s)]
*  Bullshit. That's not my style. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1468.0s)]
*  So they said, well, OK, it's not that. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1470.0s)]
*  It's not that you go around. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1471.0s)]
*  This was the key word. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1474.0s)]
*  You go around to mom and pop joints and you just eat the food and talk to the people. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1475.0s)]
*  My God, I can do. That's my style. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1482.0s)]
*  So what's it called? Diners, drivers, dive ins and dines. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1485.0s)]
*  I said, what? They couldn't get the name right. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1489.0s)]
*  No one ever gets diners, drivers and dives. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1492.0s)]
*  That's why we call it Triple D all the time. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1494.0s)]
*  I said, I could do that. I could do that. That sounds like dives. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1496.0s)]
*  I love dives. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1499.0s)]
*  I don't know a lot about diners because we don't have many of them on the West Coast. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1500.0s)]
*  And drive ins. I love that was always special to me to go to the A&W drive in when I was a kid. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1503.0s)]
*  We didn't eat fast food when I was a kid. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1507.0s)]
*  So when you went there, that was like big, big deal. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1509.0s)]
*  And that's how I got going. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1512.0s)]
*  Wow. Interesting. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1515.0s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like it's hard to find because once they started making personalities out of chefs, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1517.0s)]
*  then you have to find authentic personalities who are good on TV that are actually cooks. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1524.0s)]
*  So it's kind of a little bit of a dilemma because chefs aren't necessarily the kind of people that you want to have in front of the camera for the most part. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1530.0s)]
*  I deal with a lot of them. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1539.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1541.0s)]
*  But you know what? I think that everybody, when you get people comfortable as you know, you get people comfortable, you get them talking about themselves, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1542.0s)]
*  you get them in a zone where they feel good and they relax. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1549.0s)]
*  It's very similar. It's what you do here. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1555.0s)]
*  I mean, I watch it's people have a gift of storytelling or have history. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1557.0s)]
*  And what can people talk best about themselves or their history or their passion? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1563.0s)]
*  And that's what I did with Triple D is I just went in. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1567.0s)]
*  I remember the first one we ever shot. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1570.0s)]
*  I'm standing there talking to the guy about the thing and I'm pouring coffee behind my back. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1572.0s)]
*  People are bitching at the counter because we're in right in the middle of an active service in the diner. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1575.0s)]
*  I'm pouring coffee and pancakes burning. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1579.0s)]
*  And I flipped the guy's pancake. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1581.0s)]
*  And I'm like, so how long have you been making? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1582.0s)]
*  Yeah, hang on a second. He needs an order back. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1585.0s)]
*  And I asked all my questions I was supposed to ask. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1588.0s)]
*  And the producer at the end goes, cut, cut, cut, cut. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1591.0s)]
*  What the hell was that? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1595.0s)]
*  I said, slow your roll, bro. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1598.0s)]
*  I said, I asked every question you asked me to ask. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1602.0s)]
*  I said, I didn't stand there and do it like PM magazine. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1604.0s)]
*  I was in the mix with the dude, but I asked all the goddamn questions. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1607.0s)]
*  And he's like, can you do that again? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1611.0s)]
*  I said, I just stand on my head. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1613.0s)]
*  This is what we do in the restaurant business. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1615.0s)]
*  I said, we work and we talk and we joke and we laugh and we bust balls and we do. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1616.0s)]
*  You know, that's what we do. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1620.0s)]
*  He throws his clipboard on the ground. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1621.0s)]
*  We've got to hit. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1623.0s)]
*  And then we went around the country for the next three weeks and shot more locations and put that together into the pitch. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1624.0s)]
*  So I understand. Was he pretending to be upset or was he upset until you explained it to him? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1629.0s)]
*  I think he was upset. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1633.0s)]
*  He was the kind of upset guy. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1634.0s)]
*  Oh, fun. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1636.0s)]
*  But it worked out. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1637.0s)]
*  That's the problem with TV, dealing with upset people. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1638.0s)]
*  Well, and the thing is, is especially people that don't understand TV. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1641.0s)]
*  So when I started Triple D, I just treated my fellow chefs, restaurant owners like we were in the kitchen. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1644.0s)]
*  Have fun. I tell them all the time. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1652.0s)]
*  I want you to say whatever you want to say. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1654.0s)]
*  You want to drop 50 f bombs. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1656.0s)]
*  If you cut yourself, you drop thing on the floor, if you shit, God damn it, it's not right. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1658.0s)]
*  Don't worry. We'll stop. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1662.0s)]
*  We'll fix it. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1664.0s)]
*  We'll go forward. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1665.0s)]
*  But I'm never going to make you look bad. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1666.0s)]
*  I promise you that I'll never make you look bad. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1668.0s)]
*  You look great. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1669.0s)]
*  Sometimes we stop and go, hold up. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1670.0s)]
*  Let's hold up. Let's hold up. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1672.0s)]
*  What do you drink? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1673.0s)]
*  Jack. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1675.0s)]
*  We get him a shot of Jack, please. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1676.0s)]
*  You know, sit there and shoot the shit about his favorite team or talk about it. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1678.0s)]
*  I always start talking about people's family right off the bat. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1681.0s)]
*  Talk about the family. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1683.0s)]
*  Kind of puts people on the same playing field. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1685.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1688.0s)]
*  Not a game. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1690.0s)]
*  It's reality. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1691.0s)]
*  No, I understand. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1692.0s)]
*  I get it. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1693.0s)]
*  Well, that sounds like a fun thing to just drive around and go to people's restaurants and see how they do things and see the history behind it. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1696.0s)]
*  And what was their dream? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1704.0s)]
*  How satisfying is it to have this place and you just meet the people that are just. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1706.0s)]
*  I mean, bring tears to your eyes. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1713.0s)]
*  There's so many stories, so many. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1715.0s)]
*  We've done like almost 1600 locations and. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1717.0s)]
*  It's just. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1722.0s)]
*  Mind blowing to be in the restaurant business and to watch these people, what they put into it and how many. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1725.0s)]
*  Sacrifices they've made and then how many success stories we hear. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1733.0s)]
*  And it's just it is probably one of the most fulfilling things I've ever done in my life. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1737.0s)]
*  You know, it's really I would have been done by now had it not. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1741.0s)]
*  I mean, a matter of fact, when we first started the show, I thought, oh, this would be fun to do for a couple of years. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1744.0s)]
*  I'll probably run out of places. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1747.0s)]
*  As this show could live on forever. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1750.0s)]
*  How many years you've been doing it now? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1752.0s)]
*  Sixteen, sixteen years. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1754.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1756.0s)]
*  That's crazy, but it does some great things for them. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1761.0s)]
*  I'm sure it's great for their businesses, right? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1764.0s)]
*  You know, it must be a huge boom. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1766.0s)]
*  We're shooting right now. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1768.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1769.0s)]
*  Right now in Austin. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1770.0s)]
*  Yeah, we just shot this morning. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1771.0s)]
*  Where'd you shoot? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1772.0s)]
*  Shot a place called the Bolden Creek Cafe. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1773.0s)]
*  Vegan joint. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1778.0s)]
*  And I shouldn't even say it like that. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1779.0s)]
*  I should just say Bolden Creek Cafe, an awesome restaurant. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1781.0s)]
*  No, you should say vegan. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1783.0s)]
*  You should let everybody know. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1785.0s)]
*  Well, I say but here's the thing. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1786.0s)]
*  I think when I say vegan, people like, oh, so you kind of got to give them their shot. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1787.0s)]
*  No, I wasn't thinking that. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1793.0s)]
*  I was just thinking, you know, I have some vegan friends. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1795.0s)]
*  If they only want to eat a vegan restaurant, I would take them there. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1798.0s)]
*  It's so good. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1801.0s)]
*  I just go eat there as it is. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1802.0s)]
*  And that's what I want. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1804.0s)]
*  I mean, when I interview people at vegan restaurants or vegetarian restaurants, I'll say, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1805.0s)]
*  do your non-vegan vegetarian friends come here? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1808.0s)]
*  Or I'll ask people. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1811.0s)]
*  Usually 50% of them that I'm talking to aren't vegan. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1812.0s)]
*  They just go there because the food's great. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1815.0s)]
*  There was a vegetarian place that I used to love to go to in Woodland Hills that was a Indian joint, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1817.0s)]
*  like super authentic Indian. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1823.0s)]
*  It was in this little strip mall. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1826.0s)]
*  And I would go in there and all the menus in Hindi, everybody was speaking. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1828.0s)]
*  It was you didn't you kind of look at the photos that they had of the dishes and just like that one. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1834.0s)]
*  Give me that one. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1841.0s)]
*  Spicy, not spicy. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1842.0s)]
*  All vegetarian, but like super authentic. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1844.0s)]
*  And, you know, that's not even necessarily what I'm interested in. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1848.0s)]
*  But I would go there all the time. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1851.0s)]
*  I want to eat great food. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1853.0s)]
*  I want to eat food that's prepared correctly. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1854.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1856.0s)]
*  So it's kind of like saying I didn't mean to throw the vegan thing on it because really what it is, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1857.0s)]
*  it's about great restaurants with really great people that own it or people that have a good story. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1862.0s)]
*  And then people that want to talk about what the food they talk about what they do. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1869.0s)]
*  Did you ask them why they decided to make a vegan restaurant? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1872.0s)]
*  She's vegan. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1876.0s)]
*  And she had a coffee shop, started with a coffee shop and then was doing a little bit of food on the side and then just continued to grow and make it bigger and bigger. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1877.0s)]
*  So funny I drive up and they got a big neon that says caffeine dealer. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1887.0s)]
*  And I'm like, that's my kind of energy. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1892.0s)]
*  That's my kind of smart ass. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1895.0s)]
*  You got to have fun with yourself. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1896.0s)]
*  You got to laugh about this shit. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1898.0s)]
*  And just great character. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1899.0s)]
*  I'm actually probably get my ass kicked from the network right now going through telling about this ahead of time. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1901.0s)]
*  But no, there's great. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1905.0s)]
*  You know, I haven't been to Austin in a few years shooting Triple D, but I'll come back to a city and new places have popped up or we start to find out more about them. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1907.0s)]
*  Have you been to Travis Barker's place? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1915.0s)]
*  No, I've heard that place is phenomenal. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1917.0s)]
*  And that's a fully vegan place in L.A. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1919.0s)]
*  It's what is it called? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1922.0s)]
*  Crossroads Cafe. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1923.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard from many of my friends like Dana White went there. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1925.0s)]
*  He's like, dude, it's phenomenal. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1929.0s)]
*  You can't believe it's vegan. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1930.0s)]
*  That's the thing about it is people have this stereotype about vegan food for a good reason. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1932.0s)]
*  You and I like listen, you and I like wild game. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1938.0s)]
*  You and I like meat and so forth. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1941.0s)]
*  But if you really look about it, you're well, there's just enough vegan people that are really annoying that I won't disagree. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1943.0s)]
*  There's enough that are wonderful people. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1950.0s)]
*  No, I'm wrong. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1952.0s)]
*  But there's a there's a percentage of people that are like hugely annoying. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1953.0s)]
*  Well, and especially when they start. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1957.0s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1958.0s)]
*  Don't proselytizing. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1959.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1960.0s)]
*  Don't don't push yourself into somebody else's lane. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1961.0s)]
*  Do what you want to do and do what you love. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1964.0s)]
*  Don't go and don't. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1966.0s)]
*  I'm not into preaching. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1967.0s)]
*  I'm not into trying to change. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1968.0s)]
*  Have your opinion. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1970.0s)]
*  Have your attitude. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1971.0s)]
*  That's the problem with the whole vegan thing is that the people they represent themselves as morally superior. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1972.0s)]
*  And it's not all of them. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1978.0s)]
*  Some of them do it just because they're kind people. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1980.0s)]
*  And that's what they want to eat. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1982.0s)]
*  That's wonderful. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1983.0s)]
*  I think that happens in a lot of different, of course, sections. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1984.0s)]
*  I mean, there's people about heavy metal. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1987.0s)]
*  You don't like heavy metal. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1989.0s)]
*  You're an idiot. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1991.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1992.0s)]
*  I mean, everybody with yoga, they just start doing yoga. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1993.0s)]
*  They want everybody to yoga. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1996.0s)]
*  Yeah, I get it. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1997.0s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you a funny story. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=1998.0s)]
*  I was running restaurants down in Long Beach and then I was in Redondo Beach and running a little restaurant down there called Louisa's tiny little pasta joint pizza and pasta. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2001.0s)]
*  And there was a bunch of them in L.A. at the time. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2011.0s)]
*  And then I eventually became the district manager for him. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2013.0s)]
*  But and I was young. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2016.0s)]
*  I was very young in my career. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2017.0s)]
*  But always Gracie used to come in. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2019.0s)]
*  The Gracie family was right down the street in Redondo Beach. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2021.0s)]
*  And I remember somehow through a manager, through one of the guys, we got a UFC videotape VHS. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2025.0s)]
*  Someone had I don't know what it was. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2036.0s)]
*  I'd never seen it. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2038.0s)]
*  I hadn't even heard of it. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2039.0s)]
*  And that was the first time that we ever came aware to this. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2040.0s)]
*  And then who was it? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2047.0s)]
*  Tank Abbott was down in Huntington Beach. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2048.0s)]
*  And we used to go down. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2050.0s)]
*  I used to live by Huntington. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2051.0s)]
*  So we used to go down there and the Tank Abbott thing and the T door thing, this whole thing. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2052.0s)]
*  But you know, I mean, you're so ingrained in it. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2056.0s)]
*  You're such a massive part of it that anybody wants to start getting on a high horse about stuff. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2058.0s)]
*  I'm like, as soon as you know enough about it and soon as you have a platform that you really can say something, then speak your piece. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2062.0s)]
*  But don't shove it down people's throat. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2069.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm just you can do about anything. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2071.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2073.0s)]
*  You know, no, that's a big one. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2074.0s)]
*  Would people start doing jujitsu? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2075.0s)]
*  They don't want to tell everybody about jujitsu. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2077.0s)]
*  The vegan thing, though, is like I really do get it from their perspective, like as an ethical perspective. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2080.0s)]
*  It's just one of those things where if there's a thing that you're trying to do, we're trying to be kind. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2087.0s)]
*  You're going to get a certain percentage of people that start doing that that get annoying. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2093.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just choose not to listen to annoying people. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2098.0s)]
*  I just tune it out. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2102.0s)]
*  I don't have fucking time. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2103.0s)]
*  I really don't have time for it. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2104.0s)]
*  I mean, life, there's so much else going on in my life and so much else going on in this world. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2105.0s)]
*  I think why don't we start focusing all the good shit we can do? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2109.0s)]
*  We can do so much great shit. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2112.0s)]
*  If everybody would pivot themselves 10 percent and just go and look at it, say, take everything you love and then go do that more and be worried less about what somebody saying about you or what's going on social media or whatever this other shit may be. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2114.0s)]
*  Just go do something positive. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2127.0s)]
*  It's a social media contagion. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2129.0s)]
*  It's a problem. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2131.0s)]
*  It's a real problem. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2132.0s)]
*  When will it break is the question. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2133.0s)]
*  When will it stop being the center of shit? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2135.0s)]
*  When people just start looking and go, OK, we're done. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2138.0s)]
*  We've had enough of it. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2141.0s)]
*  It's run its course. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2142.0s)]
*  It's been poisonous enough. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2143.0s)]
*  I mean, there's positive things to it. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2145.0s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2146.0s)]
*  I think there's some really good information that you can get from it. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2147.0s)]
*  But the negative side of it, just because you have a plot, you have a key. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2150.0s)]
*  I always say to these young chefs that are on my shows, somebody wrote about me and I'm like, A, quit reading about yourself. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2153.0s)]
*  B, look at the source. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2161.0s)]
*  Now, I come up to you and I tell you that your food sucks. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2163.0s)]
*  I tell you that you're doing something that's wrong. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2165.0s)]
*  You know, we're friends. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2168.0s)]
*  You can maybe take my opinion with some, you know, some credit. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2169.0s)]
*  But the fuck, you know, the jerk off that's writing about you in his mom's basement eating Cheetos in his underwear, you know, clucking away, telling you how much you suck. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2172.0s)]
*  So you really care what that guy thinks. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2180.0s)]
*  The problem is people see it written down and they think it's almost like like a valid source and then they have to combat it. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2182.0s)]
*  But you're going to combat 35 million people, or however many million people are tweeting about things. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2189.0s)]
*  And how many extra accounts they have. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2196.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of that. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2198.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of people that aren't even real. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2199.0s)]
*  But it's also just that the the nature of it highlights negativity because the nature of this platform, what gets traction is things that make people upset. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2201.0s)]
*  That's what media used. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2214.0s)]
*  I mean, it still is. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2215.0s)]
*  You don't hear the front page of the paper talking about all the good that somebody does and all the money they raise or all the benefit they've given or all the experiences they've offered. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2216.0s)]
*  What you hear about is the negative, the death. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2226.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a problem because it's monetized. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2230.0s)]
*  Right. It's a problem because that's how people make money and they don't think of it in terms of the impact that it's having on the culture. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2232.0s)]
*  But if you're. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2240.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's that's how they're making money. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2242.0s)]
*  They make money by getting people or used to be, but getting people to buy newspapers and tune into the news. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2245.0s)]
*  And because of that, what's going to get people's eyes glued? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2251.0s)]
*  Not positive stories and inspirational stories, but rather whatever the chaos is anywhere in the world and exaggerated to make it the most salacious and the most ridiculous. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2254.0s)]
*  And how much can we spit regardless if it's true or not? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2264.0s)]
*  I mean, that's what's been killing me is all of the truth, not truth. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2267.0s)]
*  Where is the like, where's the medium? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2270.0s)]
*  Like, who's the governing body? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2272.0s)]
*  Like, is anybody going to hold anybody's feet to the fire on this? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2274.0s)]
*  And could there not? I wish there could be a punishment like you lied. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2277.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it's up to us. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2280.0s)]
*  It's up to us to ignore them once you know that they're full of shit. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2282.0s)]
*  And once you know that they lie, take away their power. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2285.0s)]
*  The way you take away their power is just not pay attention to them. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2288.0s)]
*  And they do it to themselves. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2291.0s)]
*  I mean, in general, mainstream media is kind of over the last, you know, eight, nine years has exposed themselves as being wholly corrupt, very corrupt and full of lies and propaganda and ignoring positive aspects of people because they don't fit with your political agenda. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2293.0s)]
*  It's just and it has a negative effect downstream of the entire civilization because it's just like everybody's at everybody's throats and they're it's they're being fed all this negativity first through mainstream media and then it's all accentuated by Twitter and Facebook and Instagram. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2313.0s)]
*  And it's no, it's poisonous and it poisons the culture. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2332.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, there's it's we're moving away from it, but there still are we? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2336.0s)]
*  Well, I think there's a mass group that is still, you know, buying into it and being the sheep and going along with it. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2341.0s)]
*  You're not following it. I'm not following it. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2347.0s)]
*  Yeah, but we're public people. It's like it's wise for your health to not follow it. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2350.0s)]
*  You know, true. But I hope and again, I don't have any prescription to it. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2354.0s)]
*  I follow the same mantra you're saying. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2358.0s)]
*  Quit tuning in. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2360.0s)]
*  Quit paying attention. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2362.0s)]
*  Quit passing it along. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2363.0s)]
*  You know, quit reading the bullshit. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2365.0s)]
*  You don't know if it's true or not. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2366.0s)]
*  Just do just talk about what you know and talk about what you believe and be who you are and quit trying to just keep it. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2367.0s)]
*  Quit negative shit. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2374.0s)]
*  You know, keep it out of your mouth. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2376.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just it's it's a problem because it's so addictive. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2378.0s)]
*  You know, it's people are constantly checking it. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2381.0s)]
*  And when you're bored, you immediately grab your phone and then what do you do? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2384.0s)]
*  You open up social media like what's everybody yelling at? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2388.0s)]
*  What are they? What are they upset about? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2390.0s)]
*  And you get your social media. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2392.0s)]
*  Mostly Twitter because it's the only one that's free in terms of like free speech, like legitimate free speech. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2394.0s)]
*  Call it X, whatever. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2400.0s)]
*  I'm still going to call it Twitter. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2402.0s)]
*  I hate when they say Twitter, X for you know, is Twitter. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2404.0s)]
*  Okay, it's been two years, three years. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2408.0s)]
*  I know. But nobody calls it X. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2410.0s)]
*  Very few people call it X. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2412.0s)]
*  Everybody calls it Twitter. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2413.0s)]
*  Why do you change it anyway? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2414.0s)]
*  Because he's crazy. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2415.0s)]
*  Same reason why I bought it. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2416.0s)]
*  I saw the picture of you shooting the bow at the desk. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2418.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2420.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2421.0s)]
*  I heard the fire. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2422.0s)]
*  The tip came right off and came right back at you. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2423.0s)]
*  Yeah, it blew apart. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2425.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's thick steel. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2426.0s)]
*  Do you think it was going to go through? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2427.0s)]
*  I think if I had a reinforced arrow. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2429.0s)]
*  So like, you know, there's companies that may look super durable, like much heavier grain arrows and maybe an iron will broadhead like a single bevel to blade. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2433.0s)]
*  I had a three blade. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2445.0s)]
*  Too much of a big cutting surface and a smaller surface. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2446.0s)]
*  I thought about it for a lot afterwards. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2449.0s)]
*  And I may try it again with goggles on in behind. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2451.0s)]
*  No, I wasn't worried about it hitting me. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2454.0s)]
*  But it's it's pretty impressive. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2457.0s)]
*  I mean, you can actually shoot a I think you could shoot a 40. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2460.0s)]
*  What did what what what what like round will that I don't want to lie. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2463.0s)]
*  I know you're going to shoot a 40. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2470.0s)]
*  What what like round will that I don't want to lie. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2472.0s)]
*  I know nine millimeter bounce right off of it. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2475.0s)]
*  But what round is that? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2478.0s)]
*  Will a nine millimeter bounce off bounce right off? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2479.0s)]
*  No. Yep. Yep. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2481.0s)]
*  But not the windows. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2482.0s)]
*  No, not the windows. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2484.0s)]
*  No. But it would cost the windows done. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2485.0s)]
*  You can get the windows done. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2487.0s)]
*  Easy. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2488.0s)]
*  I've driven one. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2489.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2490.0s)]
*  I heard they're amazing. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2491.0s)]
*  My buddy has one. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2492.0s)]
*  He says drove my Tesla here today. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2493.0s)]
*  Oh, you have one. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2495.0s)]
*  I don't have a cyber truck. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2496.0s)]
*  I have a push the button in the car. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2497.0s)]
*  I'll come get you. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2499.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2500.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2501.0s)]
*  The body was in nine millimeter handgun. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2502.0s)]
*  Twenty two caliber rifle has not bulletproof against all calibers. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2505.0s)]
*  So when you get higher like an AR 15, a fit, well, 50 caliber, of course, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2509.0s)]
*  is going to penetrate everything. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2513.0s)]
*  Trucks metal. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2516.0s)]
*  Also, crack of shots are fired close together. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2517.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2521.0s)]
*  But either way, why would you do that? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2522.0s)]
*  Why are you making a car like that? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2525.0s)]
*  You fucking psycho. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2527.0s)]
*  Like, it's really kind of crazy. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2528.0s)]
*  And I think you can't sell them in some countries because they're it's like [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2529.0s)]
*  they're so durable that it's like a danger to other cars on the road. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2534.0s)]
*  Because like you would hope that like if a Celica hits a Prius, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2539.0s)]
*  they're both going to kind of crush equally. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2546.0s)]
*  What do you think of Celica? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2548.0s)]
*  That dates us. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2550.0s)]
*  People still have those. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2551.0s)]
*  Celicas were awesome. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2552.0s)]
*  I heard they were remaking that. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2554.0s)]
*  That's why. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2556.0s)]
*  I heard that they're going to bring back a Celica. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2557.0s)]
*  Celicas are awesome. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2559.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, man. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2560.0s)]
*  What was your favorite of all time? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2561.0s)]
*  American muscle car. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2563.0s)]
*  Oh, that's hard. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2564.0s)]
*  That's hard. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2566.0s)]
*  I love them. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2567.0s)]
*  I got a lot of them. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2568.0s)]
*  I love the other bring it back to tell you. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2569.0s)]
*  I might be an AR thing. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2572.0s)]
*  I heard something about it. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2576.0s)]
*  I don't have a favorite, but it's all I like between early. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2578.0s)]
*  You can get as low as sixty five for a couple of them. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2582.0s)]
*  Like I have a sixty five Corvette that I love. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2586.0s)]
*  And then I think you get as old as seventy one if you get into like the [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2588.0s)]
*  Barracudas and the challengers, some of the Mopars. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2592.0s)]
*  But by seventy one, most of the Fords and the Chevy's had fallen apart for [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2595.0s)]
*  whatever reason, I think because they stopped doing drugs. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2601.0s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2604.0s)]
*  I have a theory. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2605.0s)]
*  I have my psychedelic theory. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2606.0s)]
*  Because it's if you look at those. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2608.0s)]
*  I've heard a lot of reasons they've stopped. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2610.0s)]
*  More EPA issues. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2612.0s)]
*  More EPA issues. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2613.0s)]
*  Well, EPA issues as well. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2614.0s)]
*  But why make them ugly? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2615.0s)]
*  You can make them feel efficient without making them so ugly. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2616.0s)]
*  Like something happened. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2619.0s)]
*  They lost their design language and everything started being flat and boring. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2621.0s)]
*  You know, except Corvette. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2625.0s)]
*  Corvette is another one like Corvette. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2627.0s)]
*  Like they made good looking Corvettes deep into the 70s because they still have [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2629.0s)]
*  that curvy body. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2633.0s)]
*  But if I had like, I don't know. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2634.0s)]
*  Well, both time Mopar or Ford. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2638.0s)]
*  I love them all. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2641.0s)]
*  I'm not picking one. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2642.0s)]

*  I love that. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2649.0s)]
*  I just I just love that era of automobile. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2650.0s)]
*  And it's just like it's also that era of culture. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2654.0s)]
*  I love the music and the fact that life was chaotic and you know, there were so [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2659.0s)]
*  many changes in the culture. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2665.0s)]
*  There were so quick changes in society. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2667.0s)]
*  Each year. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2669.0s)]
*  I mean, they went from Buddy Holly to Jimi Hendrix in a decade. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2670.0s)]
*  And everything was like, what is what? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2674.0s)]
*  What's what's the baseline now? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2677.0s)]
*  My favorite movie is that Buddy Holly movie. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2679.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2681.0s)]
*  Gary Busey. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2682.0s)]
*  Remember that Buddy Holly and the Crickets and Gary Busey. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2683.0s)]
*  Oh, it's great. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2685.0s)]
*  That was a great flick. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2686.0s)]
*  Now, I brought the Triple D Camaro. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2688.0s)]
*  That's I brought it. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2690.0s)]
*  I drove it over. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2692.0s)]
*  What is the Triple D Camaro? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2693.0s)]
*  Sixty eight. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2694.0s)]
*  It's a 68 Camaro on an LT4. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2696.0s)]
*  It's basically a 2022 Corvette with a 68 body on it. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2698.0s)]
*  I made two of them. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2704.0s)]
*  I've had a few different cars inside. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2705.0s)]
*  Did you take like the the new Camaro and cut the body panels off and put the new ones on? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2707.0s)]
*  No, I took an old 68. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2712.0s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2713.0s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2714.0s)]
*  That's me driving it out, too. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2715.0s)]
*  So we just made that car. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2716.0s)]
*  I made two of them. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2718.0s)]
*  No, that's not that's not the picture of that. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2720.0s)]
*  But it is that car. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2722.0s)]
*  So we made two of them. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2723.0s)]
*  I had that one for the longest time. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2724.0s)]
*  So you put a different chassis in it and everything? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2726.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2728.0s)]
*  Detroit Racing's. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2729.0s)]
*  OK, great, great. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2730.0s)]
*  But it's I mean, it's just a monster. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2731.0s)]
*  LT4 Tremac five speed. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2733.0s)]
*  It's just but my boys were sitting there. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2735.0s)]
*  That's what I like. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2737.0s)]
*  Resto mods. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2738.0s)]
*  I don't want to drive something with drum brakes. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2739.0s)]
*  It doesn't stop. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2741.0s)]
*  Those are stupid. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2742.0s)]
*  What's so funny to think? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2743.0s)]
*  I have a band. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2744.0s)]
*  I have a Trans Am and you know, bandit car and it's great and I love it. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2745.0s)]
*  It's great car. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2750.0s)]
*  But you drive it and it's so nostalgic to drive it. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2751.0s)]
*  It feels so good and it doesn't rattle and all that. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2754.0s)]
*  But boy, you know, my assistance, Kamri, can you know, you could probably take it from the line. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2756.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2763.0s)]
*  Model three, Olivia in the dust. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2764.0s)]
*  The Tesla. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2766.0s)]
*  Those just as a pass, you yet. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2767.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's I mean, as far as pure performance, there's nothing like those things. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2769.0s)]
*  Everything else is stupid. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2774.0s)]
*  But I was this what it is. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2776.0s)]
*  Is this real? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2778.0s)]
*  Nothing official has been announced about the Celica horsepower. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2779.0s)]
*  Six, six speed manual. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2784.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2787.0s)]
*  Oh, that's Forbes, dude. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2788.0s)]
*  Click on four. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2790.0s)]
*  It's not showing up as I've tried to click on a million times. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2791.0s)]
*  I'm only getting I have to get the ads out of it and then there's no pictures that show. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2793.0s)]
*  Well, the one below it looks like that one that says 20, 25. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2797.0s)]
*  That looks like a dark horse Mustang. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2800.0s)]
*  That doesn't even look like a Toyota. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2802.0s)]
*  Most of these are all like, I think, generated pictures. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2804.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of that. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2807.0s)]
*  There's a lot of those. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2809.0s)]
*  Yeah, go on and you can. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2810.0s)]
*  I felt for the Scarface to movie. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2812.0s)]
*  Oh, did you? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2815.0s)]
*  Yeah, there was something going on. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2816.0s)]
*  Maybe I had a couple of shots of Santos drinking a little bit. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2817.0s)]
*  But I was like Scarface to and they did this whole A.I. thing. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2820.0s)]
*  And I'm like, what I've been loving is a little people, little three Theo Vaughn as baby. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2824.0s)]
*  What's that? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2829.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2831.0s)]
*  Theo Vaughn is a baby. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2832.0s)]
*  The babies are my absolute favorite. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2833.0s)]
*  The A.I. babies that take like podcast clips and have babies. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2835.0s)]
*  The things just happened to security discussion the other day about, you know, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2841.0s)]
*  having so many words of mine on the Internet or on TV or whatever, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2846.0s)]
*  and then someone could put together a whole sentence. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2850.0s)]
*  And the security person said, you know, what would you do if they sent a message to your wife [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2852.0s)]
*  and made it sound like you travel a lot? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2857.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, so and so. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2860.0s)]
*  You know, I need such I'm in I'm in Mexico and I need one hundred thousand bucks. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2861.0s)]
*  I'm locked up. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2865.0s)]
*  What would you guys do? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2866.0s)]
*  You know, and I'm like, that's a real thing. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2868.0s)]
*  Like, no, it is a real thing. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2871.0s)]
*  They're starting to extort money from people. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2872.0s)]
*  And, you know, granted, they're usually doing it to older people and so forth. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2874.0s)]
*  But it's a real this A.I. threats. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2876.0s)]
*  Real thing. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2878.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's one of the real things. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2879.0s)]
*  Yeah, we were going to encounter a lot of unprecedented challenges to reality over the next few years. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2881.0s)]
*  And there's nothing you could do about it. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2889.0s)]
*  I mean, they're going to try to figure out ways to stop it while it's happening. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2891.0s)]
*  But, you know, I think they're farther ahead of us. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2895.0s)]
*  Yeah, the technology is just it's reality bending technology. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2898.0s)]
*  You could essentially right now, just from the podcast that you and I have had so far, us talking, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2903.0s)]
*  you could have us say anything forever. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2909.0s)]
*  They could do podcasts where you and I discuss fucking computer chips, the construction of them, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2912.0s)]
*  and have conversations about nuanced details of the technology that we don't understand. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2920.0s)]
*  It could be anything, a big foreign policy. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2927.0s)]
*  You could talk about anything and it would all be A.I. generated and no one would be able to tell you. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2930.0s)]
*  There's a whole podcast out there of me talking to Steve Jobs. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2936.0s)]
*  I never met Steve Jobs. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2940.0s)]
*  No shit. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2942.0s)]
*  No, the whole podcast. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2943.0s)]
*  Not no shit. You didn't meet Steve Jobs. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2944.0s)]
*  No shit on both of them. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2946.0s)]
*  It's like a 45 minute podcast of me and Steve Jobs having a conversation. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2947.0s)]
*  I never met him. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2951.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2952.0s)]
*  They could do anything with your voice, man. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2953.0s)]
*  And it's like a little weird. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2954.0s)]
*  Like you can kind of tell it's fake. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2956.0s)]
*  But this is like, imagine if you go back just a few years ago, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2958.0s)]
*  the A.I. generated deep fakes of celebrities were super obvious. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2964.0s)]
*  And now they're not obvious at all. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2967.0s)]
*  Remember the Tom Cruise one? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2969.0s)]
*  That was the one that was interesting. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2970.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was the first one I ever saw. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2972.0s)]
*  No, it's and we're just on the cusp of it. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2974.0s)]
*  I think it's even deeper and more convoluted, more screwed up than we know. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2976.0s)]
*  But it's going to become something we're going to have to face because they're just they're so far ahead of our legislation that's even interested in trying to control. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2981.0s)]
*  I don't think they even know what to control. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2989.0s)]
*  It's scary shit. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2991.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2992.0s)]
*  But it's also like what is reality going to be? [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2993.0s)]
*  Because what you're seeing right now is just a visual representation of what A.I. can do. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=2996.0s)]
*  But what about once it starts being able to recreate experiences? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3001.0s)]
*  Because that's coming. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3006.0s)]
*  I mean, whether it's 20 years or 50 years, there's going to come a time if you stay alive long enough where you're not going to have to experience things, you're going to be able to sit down and, you know, just like the Matrix, it's just going to plug you in and you're going to experience something. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3007.0s)]
*  OK. OK. We're a little bit of the same age. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3022.0s)]
*  Do you not trip out the Dick Tracy had a square watch that looked like an Apple watch? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3026.0s)]
*  It's kind of crazy. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3031.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3032.0s)]
*  They would talk to it and everybody's like, that's nuts. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3033.0s)]
*  He's talking to his watch. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3035.0s)]
*  OK. So did we? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3036.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3037.0s)]
*  This is like we should be drinking or something should be going on. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3038.0s)]
*  What happened? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3041.0s)]
*  Did Apple just did we influence enough Apple people that they just decided to make it a square watch and make it look like Dick Tracy's watch? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3042.0s)]
*  Or did the Dick Tracy thing? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3048.0s)]
*  Did we already make the watch and did somebody go back back? [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3049.0s)]
*  And I mean, do you ever sit there and trip on shit like that? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3051.0s)]
*  I definitely don't. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3053.0s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3054.0s)]
*  Not about that. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3055.0s)]
*  I think square is just a normal size. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3056.0s)]
*  It's a normal shape for a frame. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3059.0s)]
*  Not a watch you talk into, though. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3061.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it's just a screen. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3063.0s)]
*  Star Trek. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3065.0s)]
*  It's just a tiny screen. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3066.0s)]
*  Yeah, but the Star Trek thing was a fucking walkie talkie. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3067.0s)]
*  Kirk out and they'd hang up. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3069.0s)]
*  But then we made the Star Trek. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3071.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3072.0s)]
*  But that was also, you know, life imitating art. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3074.0s)]
*  It's not art. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3077.0s)]
*  But I so OK, well, we'll go back to Matrix then because I think of the Matrix things all the time. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3079.0s)]
*  Like how the how real how possible is that? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3085.0s)]
*  We used to watch that cartoon. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3089.0s)]
*  There was a movie my kid watched when he was little about the people that all went and lived. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3091.0s)]
*  It wasn't too long. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3095.0s)]
*  It was maybe 10, 15 years ago about the people all lived in a spaceship and the little robot and the plant grew and everybody was sitting on the floor. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3096.0s)]
*  And everybody was heavy set. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3102.0s)]
*  Nobody walked. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3103.0s)]
*  They were all in space. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3104.0s)]
*  What is it called? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3106.0s)]
*  Was it Wally at the little robot? [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3107.0s)]
*  Oh, the movie. Yeah. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3110.0s)]
*  Yeah. The Pixar movie. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3111.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3113.0s)]
*  And you sit there and look at that stuff and you're like, wow. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3114.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3115.0s)]
*  That's what's really happening. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3116.0s)]
*  OK, so you didn't buy my Dick Tracy idea, but I think that the the other stuff is well, when you think about where this is all headed, there's only a few different directions that one could go to. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3120.0s)]
*  And simulated reality is a big one. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3131.0s)]
*  I think that's inevitable, because I think you're going to get more sedentary people, more people that are very uncomfortable with their own lives and want to live a different life. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3134.0s)]
*  And then you're going to be able to have experiences just like when kids play Call of Duty all day long. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3144.0s)]
*  Like, what are they doing? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3150.0s)]
*  They're playing war with zero consequences where they're able to kill people with zero consequences, get killed, respawn. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3151.0s)]
*  And they're doing it all day long just for the experience. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3160.0s)]
*  Well, what what happens when that experience is far more vivid? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3163.0s)]
*  You're feeling things. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3168.0s)]
*  You feel gravity. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3169.0s)]
*  You feel your feet feel the concrete underneath you and the gravel you're stepping on. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3171.0s)]
*  They're going to be able to recreate all that stuff, whether they do it with an implant or where they do with a helmet. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3175.0s)]
*  That you wear that sort of interacts with your brain, sends signals into your visual cortex and recreates experiences. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3180.0s)]
*  It's coming. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3187.0s)]
*  You're taking this way past my Dick Tracy watch. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3188.0s)]
*  Yeah, look at this robot. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3191.0s)]
*  Oh, I saw this yesterday. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3192.0s)]
*  Yeah, look at this dancing robot. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3194.0s)]
*  That looks so weird. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3195.0s)]
*  It's so weird because they're moving like a human moves. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3197.0s)]
*  And then eventually they're going to realize this human design kind of sucks. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3202.0s)]
*  Let's let's make something that's better than a human shoe. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3205.0s)]
*  One where the robot whacked out. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3208.0s)]
*  The AI robot went crazy. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3210.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3212.0s)]
*  China. Yeah. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3213.0s)]
*  Like Flint. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3214.0s)]
*  So flailing on everybody. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3215.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3216.0s)]
*  Well, it's going to be powered by AI and AI is not going to probably have the best opinion of us because a lot of us are annoying. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3217.0s)]
*  Deep shit. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3225.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3228.0s)]
*  We're talking about food and cars and. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3229.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's deep. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3232.0s)]
*  It's a weird time. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3234.0s)]
*  It's a weird time for change because we're like riding this technological wave and we don't know when it's going to break and where it's going to break. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3235.0s)]
*  What's going to happen? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3242.0s)]
*  Are we cart and horse? [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3243.0s)]
*  Are we horse and buggy and automobile? [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3244.0s)]
*  I mean, is that the is that the energy or that the space that we're in? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3247.0s)]
*  Think about all those people that were in that era. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3250.0s)]
*  Yeah, but those buggies are shit. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3252.0s)]
*  They went 45 miles an hour. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3254.0s)]
*  Pretty amazing for somebody that did. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3256.0s)]
*  There's no horse at the end of it and it's driving you down the road. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3258.0s)]
*  It's what's that noise? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3261.0s)]
*  What's that pop? [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3262.0s)]
*  What I'm getting at is I think that the change is going to be way more radical than just going from a horse to a to a model T. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3263.0s)]
*  I think it's going to be we're not you know, there's a lot of people that believe we're already in a simulation and not a lot of people like kooks and people with schizophrenia, but like actual real scientists, including Elon. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3270.0s)]
*  He said that the odds of us not being in a simulation are in the billions. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3284.0s)]
*  Because the idea is that if technology increases one day, there will be a simulation that will be so good you will not be able to distinguish whether or not it's real. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3290.0s)]
*  And so then the question is when will you know whether that's taken place and has that already taken place? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3301.0s)]
*  The Matrix. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3310.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3312.0s)]
*  Essentially what the Matrix was. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3313.0s)]
*  But that's that same thing I was saying about Dick Tracy watch. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3314.0s)]
*  When where did that come from? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3317.0s)]
*  I mean, I did chase you watch seems kind of obvious. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3320.0s)]
*  It's a square. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3323.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm just still saying that your TV is a square. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3324.0s)]
*  Most watches were round and all of a sudden it became a square. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3327.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3330.0s)]
*  Anyhow, not to get stuck because it's crazy sci fi. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3331.0s)]
*  Look, it's a square like look at the Jetsons. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3333.0s)]
*  But I go back to the thing with somebody. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3336.0s)]
*  I mean, you were talking about people doing drugs and designing cars who sat around and said, OK, let's make up this movie where you take the pill and you're going to be able to do it. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3339.0s)]
*  So you take the pill and you're in the system, you're out of the system or plugging in the back of the head. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3346.0s)]
*  You grow energy. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3350.0s)]
*  You you are the energy source. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3351.0s)]
*  Now, like we use cows for, you know, grinding grain. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3353.0s)]
*  Are we going to become that and so forth? [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3356.0s)]
*  Do you think about when was that Matrix 20 years ago, 25 years ago? [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3358.0s)]
*  At least it's pretty advanced. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3361.0s)]
*  The Matrix is in the 90s, right? [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3363.0s)]
*  What year was that, Jamie? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3366.0s)]
*  Ninety five. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3368.0s)]
*  Ninety nine. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3370.0s)]
*  But still. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3372.0s)]
*  What we know about AI we can look at and go make sense. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3373.0s)]
*  I'm sure they wrote it even earlier than that. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3376.0s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3379.0s)]
*  And back then no one had any. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3380.0s)]
*  So if you're dealing with 99, that's the infancy of the Internet itself. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3382.0s)]
*  You know, with the Internet thinking. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3387.0s)]
*  I stumbled across this when we were talking about something the other day. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3389.0s)]
*  This guy wrote a book in 1960 called The Man Computer Symbiosis, which is a very early idea of what the Matrix is. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3392.0s)]
*  A concept of a human computer collaboration. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3400.0s)]
*  This is 1960 where computers would augment human capabilities and decision making and complex tasks. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3403.0s)]
*  This vision involved computers facilitating both the solution of formulated problems and the formulation of problems themselves, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3410.0s)]
*  essentially creating a partnership where humans and computers could work together more efficient or more effectively than either could alone. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3418.0s)]
*  Well, that's happening right now. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3427.0s)]
*  That's already 1960. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3429.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's really what was the guy's name? [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3431.0s)]
*  Lick Lick lighter. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3433.0s)]
*  JCR Lick lighter. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3435.0s)]
*  Strange name, Mr. Lick lighter. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3437.0s)]
*  Yeah, man, computer symbiosis. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3440.0s)]
*  Look at that guy. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3442.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3443.0s)]
*  He looks like the type of guy would think up shit like that. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3444.0s)]
*  Lick lighter. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3448.0s)]
*  Looks like you'd be trolling for prostitutes, too. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3450.0s)]
*  Just saying. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3454.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe he did. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3455.0s)]
*  Sure he didn't. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3456.0s)]
*  It looks like we're those guys. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3460.0s)]
*  It's just a it's a very tumultuous time because the change is coming so fast and no one knows what to do with it. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3462.0s)]
*  You know, and they there's not enough laws to really stop it. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3470.0s)]
*  And even if you did have the laws, China's not going to stop. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3474.0s)]
*  Russia's not going to stop. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3477.0s)]
*  And who do you go to for an answer? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3479.0s)]
*  I mean, it's like there's so many people that are so susceptible to it and it's just free will. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3481.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's out there and people don't even know how to harness it or even understand what you're getting duped into or whatever the case may be. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3487.0s)]
*  It's like the things that people are putting on the Internet and it lives in perpetuity. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3495.0s)]
*  I mean, it's not going anywhere. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3498.0s)]
*  Well, this is all surface level stuff. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3500.0s)]
*  The really crazy stuff is control the power grid, alternative technology, alternative power sources. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3502.0s)]
*  It's going to get very, very, very strange inside of our lifetime. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3508.0s)]
*  But people are always going to need food, bro. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3514.0s)]
*  You know, A.I. is not going to make you a yummy sandwich. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3518.0s)]
*  Give him time. You think? [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3521.0s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3523.0s)]
*  You know, there's something about handmade things that people are always going to enjoy. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3524.0s)]
*  Human beings know that someone looks like when you go to a nice restaurant, you have a nice meal. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3529.0s)]
*  One of the things you know is that a person did this. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3534.0s)]
*  It's part of it like, damn, they nailed it. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3537.0s)]
*  You know, when you're eating a perfectly cooked steak or this guy nailed this, you know, it's listening to it depends on your kind of music, but listening to music when somebody's up there riffing a guitar versus somebody making a guitar sound. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3540.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure. Yeah. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3551.0s)]
*  You're experiencing the person performing like you're watching someone up there jamming. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3552.0s)]
*  I think the big thing in food, like one of my positions on it, and I always tell people, you know, you're the guy that does that show about deep fried cheeseburgers and pizza. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3558.0s)]
*  You don't watch the show enough if that's what you think, because I'm super opinionated about, not opinionated, but I have a real responsibility, I think, to show the profile of food in the world or in the United States. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3567.0s)]
*  And we've got to get our shit straight about what we're eating. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3579.0s)]
*  We're just we can't eat this processed food. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3584.0s)]
*  I mean, processed food is you're not eating it. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3586.0s)]
*  I mean, we got to eat the basics and eat great food and eat great food made correctly. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3588.0s)]
*  But something that was made a long time ago, don't get me wrong, there's a place for everything. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3594.0s)]
*  There's a place for fast food. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3598.0s)]
*  There's a place for, you know, things that are pre-made and so forth. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3599.0s)]
*  But it can't be all of one thing. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3602.0s)]
*  But people need to eat better. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3603.0s)]
*  And, you know, you being a hunter and myself, I talk to people all about it all the time. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3606.0s)]
*  You know, this is a reality that if you eat things that are modified, I'm not saying genetically modified doesn't have a place, but it can't be all the same stuff. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3610.0s)]
*  And if we don't watch it, we're going to get ourselves in some deep shit. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3620.0s)]
*  And we're already in deep shit. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3622.0s)]
*  Cancer is, you know, where's the heart attack? [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3623.0s)]
*  Where's the where's the stuff that was plaguing us for so many generations? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3626.0s)]
*  And now this cancer, they lost my sister to cancer, lost my dad to cancer, has my run into more people on a daily basis that are, you know, stricken with cancer. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3629.0s)]
*  And I think food as a, you know, the type of food and what's put on the food as a big, big play. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3638.0s)]
*  So it's definitely a factor. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3643.0s)]
*  There's a lot of factors. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3645.0s)]
*  There's environmental factors, toxins, herbicides, pesticides. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3646.0s)]
*  There's a lot of different factors. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3651.0s)]
*  I was just reading this thing about golf courses that if or watching a video rather on golf courses that if you live within a certain radius of a golf course, you're you have a much higher possibility of getting Parkinson's disease. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3652.0s)]
*  Oh, shit. Yeah. Oh, here it is. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3667.0s)]
*  Parkinson's risk higher for those living close to a golf course. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3670.0s)]
*  What does it say? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3673.0s)]
*  One hundred twenty six percent. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3675.0s)]
*  Wow. So found people living within one mile of a golf course have one hundred twenty six percent higher risk of developing developing. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3676.0s)]
*  What happened? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3685.0s)]
*  What happened? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3686.0s)]
*  One hundred twenty six percent higher risk of developing Parkinson's disease compared to living more than six miles away, said core co-author Dr. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3690.0s)]
*  Ray Dorsey, a neurologist and the director of the Center for the Brain and the Environment at Atria Health and Research Institute in New York. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3698.0s)]
*  This isn't the first study that links Parkinson's disease with pesticides. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3706.0s)]
*  This just adds additional evidence. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3709.0s)]
*  This isn't just happening among farmers. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3711.0s)]
*  This is happening to people living in suburban areas that have an increased risk of getting Parkinson's disease simply because of where they live. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3714.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3722.0s)]
*  But not the ones to bring the pesticides. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3724.0s)]
*  It's like secondhand smoke. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3727.0s)]
*  They're just basically breathing it in or consuming it in the water that they're drinking. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3728.0s)]
*  I met a guy once that he had bone cancer and he had one of his bones in his legs replaced with a rod. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3734.0s)]
*  And he said that there's an enormous percentage of people in his neighborhood that had bone cancer and all kinds of different cancers. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3741.0s)]
*  And it was all linked to this golf course. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3749.0s)]
*  The runoff from the golf course had gotten into the water table in the water supply of all these people. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3751.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's dangerous. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3758.0s)]
*  And that shit's not even legal in a lot of countries. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3760.0s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3762.0s)]
*  That's glyphosate. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3763.0s)]
*  And that is not that I think they're linking this golf course thing to glyphosate as well, aren't they? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3765.0s)]
*  It's just pesticides in general. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3770.0s)]
*  I'm even looking at now since this is a contentious new study, which obviously it would be, but I'm trying to see what the contention is or why. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3773.0s)]
*  You know what's spooky, man? [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3780.0s)]
*  There's a lot of rich folks who live on golf courses and they think, hey, what a great life. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3781.0s)]
*  I wonder how many more of those fuckers are getting Parkinson's disease because of that. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3786.0s)]
*  Scary shit, man. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3792.0s)]
*  You think about the other countries. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3795.0s)]
*  We don't talk about a lot in our country, but what they ban in other countries of our products and just how they're holding the line. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3797.0s)]
*  I remember when I lived in France, I lived right outside of Paris in a town called Chantilly. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3805.0s)]
*  We'd call it Chantilly, which is the term Chantilly Lay Chantilly Cream that comes from. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3809.0s)]
*  But I remember I was there. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3813.0s)]
*  I was 16. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3814.0s)]
*  And I wrote my parents and I'm like, food just tastes different here. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3816.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't care if it's a steak and a potato. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3821.0s)]
*  It just tastes different. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3823.0s)]
*  I mean, like it's because it's grass fed steak. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3824.0s)]
*  It was they don't have grain fed steak over there. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3827.0s)]
*  I noticed that the first time I went to Australia, I had a steak. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3830.0s)]
*  I'm like, this tastes like game. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3833.0s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3835.0s)]
*  It was good. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3836.0s)]
*  And we didn't have this thing because we go to school. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3837.0s)]
*  The lunch that we had at school was the guy lived in this kind of this boarding house. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3839.0s)]
*  I rented a room from this family and they were terrible cooks. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3843.0s)]
*  You'd think you'd go to France. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3847.0s)]
*  Everybody cooked good. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3848.0s)]
*  But anyhow, I went to high school. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3849.0s)]
*  I looked forward to lunch at school. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3851.0s)]
*  It was the best school lunch in the world. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3852.0s)]
*  You'd sit at a table like this. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3854.0s)]
*  There were eight kids and they would come by with a cart and they'd put down a hotel pan full of, you know, the whatever vegetable, whatever starts, whatever meat, which sits in. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3855.0s)]
*  We had all the French bread we could eat. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3863.0s)]
*  And it was just like I looked forward to it so much. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3864.0s)]
*  It was such great food. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3867.0s)]
*  And I just never got it. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3868.0s)]
*  Well, and then I got older and started cooking and I kind of went, oh, really? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3871.0s)]
*  So that funny thing was I went back to France 25, 30 years later, took my oldest son, Hunter, with me. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3875.0s)]
*  We did a whole tour through Europe when he graduated high school. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3881.0s)]
*  I took him to seven countries and 14 cities in 30 days. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3884.0s)]
*  And we did this whole tour of where food came from. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3889.0s)]
*  But I took him back to Chantilly and I went to the grocery store because my best friend from school still lived there. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3892.0s)]
*  And I walked into the grocery store and what had been a grocery store full of huge aisles of fresh produce and breads and everything you could imagine was now just freezer, freezer, freezer, freezer, freezer, freezer. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3897.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3910.0s)]
*  And I said to Vince, I go, his name is Vincent. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3911.0s)]
*  I said, Vincent, what? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3914.0s)]
*  Qu'est-ce que c'est, what? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3916.0s)]
*  And he's like, going to be more like Americans. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3917.0s)]
*  That was his kind of joking. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3920.0s)]
*  But it had changed so dramatically. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3922.0s)]
*  I was like, this is like not it was shattering. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3924.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think fresh food is really the only thing that people are supposed to be actually eating all the time. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3927.0s)]
*  Real food. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3933.0s)]
*  It's I mean, the more that you can get to a farmer's market, the more that you can have relationships with ranchers and people that actually provide your food, the healthier you're going to be. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3935.0s)]
*  And the further you get away from the source, the more you're going to have preservatives, the more you're going to have processed food, stay away from the inside of the supermarket, all that stuff on the inside. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3944.0s)]
*  I mean, there's condiments and stuff, but most of it's bullshit. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3955.0s)]
*  The outside. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3958.0s)]
*  I agree. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3960.0s)]
*  Meat, meat, eggs, all that stuff that's on the outside, all that refrigerated area on the outside. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3961.0s)]
*  That's all you're supposed to be actually eating all that stuff that's in the middle is just fucking your life up for the most part. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3967.0s)]
*  Obviously, it's a generalization, plenty good stuff in the middle. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3973.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3976.0s)]
*  And I think that there is, but circumstances, not everybody has the same budget and so forth. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3977.0s)]
*  But I do believe that the reality of it is, is education is a big thing. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3982.0s)]
*  Education for people about what to do with real food and how to handle it and so forth. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3987.0s)]
*  And I remember Home Ec was a great class when I was a sophomore in high school. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3992.0s)]
*  Home Ec, I took Home Ec. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3996.0s)]
*  It was almost all girls. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3998.0s)]
*  But I was in it because I wanted to see what the, I didn't want to sew, but I did want to learn how to make a blackberry pie. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=3999.0s)]
*  And I just think those simple fundamentals should still be something that are taught in schools, like just how to make a roasted chicken. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4007.0s)]
*  Give him six months of roasting chicken. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4015.0s)]
*  How do you cook a potato? [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4017.0s)]
*  Just the basics, because there's a lot of people that, my son included, my son Ryder, we did a crash course. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4019.0s)]
*  I always made him cook with me in the kitchen, but it was usually begrudgingly, he'd make things that he'd like to make pizza. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4027.0s)]
*  Let's make pizza, tacos. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4032.0s)]
*  But even that little thing like how to sear a steak, what's done, what's not done, what's overseen, those things, we're missing that. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4034.0s)]
*  So you said go to AI food? [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4042.0s)]
*  I mean, scary shit. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4044.0s)]
*  Yeah, we've been bamboozled. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4046.0s)]
*  And corporations, the same corporations that used to, well still do, own tobacco companies, bought out all these big processed food corporations. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4050.0s)]
*  And then they started, I mean this is something that RFK Junior's talked in depth about. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4060.0s)]
*  And then they started using the same tactics to get people hooked on these processed foods. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4064.0s)]
*  And these processed foods are essentially designed to make them incredibly addictive. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4070.0s)]
*  And they're cheap, and people just consume them en masse, and it becomes a large percentage of the calories you take in. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4074.0s)]
*  It's going to take a long time for people to adjust and switch away from that, because it's easy to destroy something. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4081.0s)]
*  It's very hard to rebuild, and they've kind of destroyed our health. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4089.0s)]
*  But it goes hand in hand, because when you start thinking about this cancer thing and how devastating it is, I'm like, can't really solve this? [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4093.0s)]
*  And then you listen to some other sides that will say, big business. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4102.0s)]
*  You don't make money curing people. It's one and done. It's over. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4107.0s)]
*  I don't know. It weirds me out. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4112.0s)]
*  But I think that we have, you know, you've just got such a massive platform. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4115.0s)]
*  And I talk, you heard my little pitch there at the beginning of Food Network, real food for real people. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4121.0s)]
*  I'm not saying these restaurants I shoot on Triple D, you should go eat every single day, because not every one of them is always the healthiest situation. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4125.0s)]
*  I think you need to have a good balance between things. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4133.0s)]
*  But it's okay to have indulgence. It's okay to have your pizza experience. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4137.0s)]
*  But we just need to get back to some balance of it, because we're imbalanced, is my feeling. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4143.0s)]
*  But then again, you're always going to have bad examples that are good for people to realize, I don't want to live like that guy's living. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4149.0s)]
*  You want to see someone who's like morbidly obese, terrible diet, no enthusiasm for life, because they're poisoned. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4157.0s)]
*  And then you see a guy who's like super healthy and exercising all the time, he's got tons of energy. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4167.0s)]
*  That's what I like. You need to see bad examples, too. It's part of the human experience. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4172.0s)]
*  Moderation is my favorite thing that I talk about. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4176.0s)]
*  I got into, I don't know, about three or four years ago, got into cold plunge. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4179.0s)]
*  And thank you, by the way. You're a great advocate and you were a great inspiration on it. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4184.0s)]
*  I started doing it and then everybody would tell me that you're doing it. So I listened to some of the things. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4189.0s)]
*  I do it in the morning. It's great. You said it is a life changer. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4194.0s)]
*  It is. Some mornings it sucks. I mean, I really have to force myself. It sucks every day. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4198.0s)]
*  I'm going into this. This is bullshit. You know, OK, I'll just get through five minutes and I'm good. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4202.0s)]
*  You know, I'll just listen to Paul Harvey. I listen to Paul Harvey in the morning. That's my favorite. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4207.0s)]
*  Really? Paul Harvey? Why Paul Harvey? The rest of the story. Why Paul Harvey? [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4210.0s)]
*  Because I love history and I love to learn the little nuances of how things came about. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4215.0s)]
*  And it was something reminds me of my childhood. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4223.0s)]
*  You know, we'd listen to it in shop class when I was in high school. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4226.0s)]
*  And it was always that quick little in-between break. You know, they syndicated. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4230.0s)]
*  Pretty interesting guy. There's a whole bunch out there. Oh, he was great. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4235.0s)]
*  I listen to music too. I have my set of music that I listen to that I know this is I'm going to do a 10 minute plunge or 12 minute plunge, depending on the song. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4240.0s)]
*  And if I can keep myself out of it, because as soon as I start worrying about it, thinking I'm cold, but I don't do it your temperature. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4247.0s)]
*  You do a crazy temperature. I do like 38, 39. I heard you're like in the... I do whatever. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4254.0s)]
*  No, I heard you're in the 33s. Yeah. That's nuts. It's no different. It's just cold. It's just cold. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4259.0s)]
*  I have friends. I was still in your buddies earlier. So I have friends that will come and do it. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4266.0s)]
*  I started with my cold punch. I started with a watering trough and put ice in it. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4270.0s)]
*  So that was the way I started. You know, you get that little thermal barrier around you. It's awesome. Yeah. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4274.0s)]
*  Okay. And then you have to, you know, you got to move or something. Okay. You move. Now you're cold. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4278.0s)]
*  Then I went to a freezer and built one out of a freezer. Oh, like one of them big game freezers? [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4282.0s)]
*  Yeah. Big Westinghouse or whatever it was. Freezer, little filter in it, had a little thermostat. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4288.0s)]
*  And you plug the freezer into the thermostat and then the thermostat into the wall. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4294.0s)]
*  And then you put a little temperature in there and it would regulate itself so it didn't turn into a block of ice. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4297.0s)]
*  But every time I got in, I had to unplug it because they're not UL rated for humans to be in them, you know, with full flow water. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4303.0s)]
*  So then a buddy of mine, this guy Jamie Weeks, sent me one from Sweathouse, his company. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4309.0s)]
*  And then I got in real cold punch. Well, that water circulates. That's a game. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4316.0s)]
*  The difference is like a blue cube. Like blue cube is one we have out here. That one you can turn into a raging river. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4321.0s)]
*  It's got different selections. So you can have like a little, if you get in it normal, it's just a slow, steady circulation. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4328.0s)]
*  Not, not, not nothing crazy, but you can click that bitch one or two and at two, it's that motherfucker is a raging river. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4338.0s)]
*  It's just rolling on you? And it's hard to do a minute in that bitch. It's hard to do a minute. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4345.0s)]
*  You do get that little thermal barrier. There's no barrier in the blue. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4349.0s)]
*  No, this one is called plunge. They're out of Sacramento. These guys. Great, great job. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4353.0s)]
*  The thing about it is like, I don't know what the benefit is other than it's sucking more. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4358.0s)]
*  I think your body temperature stays the same because it's like just by I guess you don't feel as bad because your body like in a regular cold plunge because your body develops that thermal barrier. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4363.0s)]
*  But you're still cold as shit and you get all the benefits. I don't think you have to suffer through that raging river thing. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4376.0s)]
*  But if you want the mental benefits, the benefits of overcoming adversity and the ability to just force yourself to do something that's intolerable, then I would recommend doing that. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4382.0s)]
*  If you're one of those people that really enjoys torturing themselves, I push people on this. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4392.0s)]
*  And so they'll get it. I was telling you guys. So I buddy come over and I'm not doing I'm just do one minute. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4399.0s)]
*  If you do one minute, I'll get off it. I will quit busting your balls about it about you being, you know, okay, get in there. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4405.0s)]
*  So I'll start talking to my okay, I got time. We're going and they'll go. Okay, well, you know, talk about this and I'll freeze my ass. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4411.0s)]
*  Okay, give me your favorite song. Which favorite song? Then I'll look the song up. Take my time. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4416.0s)]
*  Hank Williams, Country Boy Can't Survive. Okay. Okay. Ready? I'll play it for you. You're doing good. You got you just few more. You got like 30 more seconds. It's already been two minutes. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4420.0s)]
*  Play Country Boy Can't Survive. Okay. How many of the words do you know to this song? Oh, all right. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4428.0s)]
*  Besides the hook. What do you know of the song? Okay. You know, I'll sit there just mess with them. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4433.0s)]
*  They'll go four minutes and I'll say, okay, and stop. They go. That was a minute. Bullshit. That song's over. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4437.0s)]
*  That's fine. I'm like, I was like five and a half minutes. You see, you know, what's the mental? It is mental. Yeah, it's mental. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4445.0s)]
*  If you can distract yourself, it's. That's why Paul Harvey. Yeah. Well, that's why watching a movie while you're on a treadmill is a total cheat code. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4452.0s)]
*  Because if you can get like an iPad and put earplugs on and watch a movie, you'll get absorbed in the movie. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4460.0s)]
*  You won't even think about the fact that you're running. You know what I watch? What? Ridiculousness. Oh, that's a good thing to watch. I fucking love it. Yeah. I love ridiculousness. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4467.0s)]
*  I went on there. I to me, Deardix comments are the funniest deal. All those guys, they've cracked me up. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4477.0s)]
*  And, you know, except for having to fight through a commercial here and there, because that'll remind you that you're still on the elliptical. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4483.0s)]
*  You're a guy or elliptical guy. I don't do either of those. Generally. I mean, sometimes I'll do a treadmill with like a weighted pack on. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4489.0s)]
*  I'll do like who to use for what I use outdoorsmen's. It's a it's a pack that has a post on the back of it so I can actually put like big plates on it. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4498.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's fun. Yeah. What kind of way are you talking? Mostly when I go for long walks, I just put 45 on. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4510.0s)]
*  So the pack is probably five pounds and then the 45 pound plate. Then I take the dog out. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4519.0s)]
*  But if I'm doing hardcore workouts, I put 90 on it. So I'll put two plates and then there's a great machine called see if you can find it. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4524.0s)]
*  Jamie's called the I think it's called the hit sled. And you it's like you do a farmer's carry. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4534.0s)]
*  So it has plate posts on either side and you lift it up and it's at an angle. So as you're walking, you're carrying your wallet. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4541.0s)]
*  You step inside of no, no, no, no, you just it's just a treadmill. It's like a treadmill that's at an angle. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4549.0s)]
*  That's it. Was it called Jamie hit? Yeah. The hit mail X that unit itself. That motherfuckers the shit that thing is the shit. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4555.0s)]
*  And it says is that the tensioner in the front? Well, so you've got this you got the ability to just incline. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4565.0s)]
*  I think is that a just incline or is it static? Either way, whatever that incline is. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4572.0s)]
*  And then you have those weight posts on the side. So you're lifting weight up and you're carrying weight. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4578.0s)]
*  So that guy's got 45 on each side. So he's carrying 90 pounds while you're walking uphill. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4584.0s)]
*  And whoo, that'll get you in some shape. Whoa, baby. That'll get you in some shape. Ass kicker. Yeah. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4590.0s)]
*  What do you cook? Mostly meat. Mostly what I eat is meat. That's like 90 percent of my diet. Meat and eggs. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4598.0s)]
*  What's the what's your cheat? What's your like indulgent? My daughter is a really good chef. Not a good chef, a good baker. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4606.0s)]
*  She's great at cookies. She makes fucking every time she's cooking, I'm like, God damn it. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4615.0s)]
*  She's making me some cookies. She's really good, though. They're really legit. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4621.0s)]
*  Like she made these cookies like these peanut butter chocolate chip cookies with Nutella. Whoa. They're good. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4626.0s)]
*  Can you do just one or two or do you house the plate? Well, I work out a lot. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4633.0s)]
*  So I allow myself to eat like a pig every now and then. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4637.0s)]
*  But like for me, cheat food is always either Italian or Mexican. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4642.0s)]
*  I love I love good Mexican food. I love good Italian food. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4647.0s)]
*  I just love if I'm going to pig out and I'm going to eat something that I know is just for mouth pleasure, it's probably going to be Mexican or Italian. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4651.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. So addictive. Yeah. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4660.0s)]
*  I find the more I stay away from them, the less addicted I am. Oh, for sure. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4663.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then as soon as I have them, I find myself right back in there and back into, you know, I look forward to going to New York just for Italian food, [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4668.0s)]
*  because like Austin is great for barbecue and steaks and Tex-Mex. Mexican food's great here. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4677.0s)]
*  There's a lot of great food in Austin, but there's not a lot of legitimate Italian spots like there was in L.A. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4684.0s)]
*  L.A. had some legit Italian spots. Chicago. Chicago's got great Italian food. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4690.0s)]
*  My favorite New York, though, is my favorite food cities in Chicago. East Coast Italian food to me. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4695.0s)]
*  There's nothing like it. It's like that. That's it. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4700.0s)]
*  That's the epicenter for me. Like old school East Coast Italian sandwiches and pasta and pizza. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4703.0s)]
*  There's something about walking into a deli in Rhode Island and New York, whatever. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4713.0s)]
*  It just smells different. The floor creaks. They're fresh cutting the slices. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4719.0s)]
*  People are fired up. They're so excited to get that fucking sandwich. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4724.0s)]
*  The meatballs taste different. Yeah. No, the whole thing. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4728.0s)]
*  So Federal Hill in Rhode Island is a real famous Italian. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4731.0s)]
*  But I've shot shows up there a couple of times, but it's not too far from where my wife's family live. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4735.0s)]
*  And I just remember going up there and going to the delis and getting those cherry pepper stuff with prosciutto and provolone. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4739.0s)]
*  And just, you know, I'll take six of them and I'll take 18 to go. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4745.0s)]
*  I would always bring them all back to California. Just can't find anything like it. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4749.0s)]
*  You know what else I miss on the East Coast that you don't really get out here is a legit Jewish deli, like a cat's deli. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4753.0s)]
*  Like someone needs to figure out a way to do something like that here where you can get like a legit pastrami ruben, like a real one. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4761.0s)]
*  You know, but the question I have about that, that's what people ask me all the time. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4771.0s)]
*  When I first started Triple D, you could only get true Tex-Mex or great Mexican food really in this Texas, Arizona, Nevada, California, down in this pocket. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4775.0s)]
*  But I will say that now I'm starting to find, because typically it's the people migrating to these different areas. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4787.0s)]
*  I went to a Mexican joint on Triple D in Minneapolis, and it's a Mexican market, Canasidea. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4793.0s)]
*  It's the whole thing. And it was better than 85% of joints that I've tried in these regions I was just talking about. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4799.0s)]
*  So I'm starting to find this better cross-pollination of foods in different regions. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4806.0s)]
*  Where people move. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4812.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4813.0s)]
*  But you've got to have the market. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4814.0s)]
*  The market is the key, because who are they going to sell it to if people don't get it? [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4815.0s)]
*  Because a fatty brisket from Katz Deli is just a different, you've got to have the mindset. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4819.0s)]
*  I've taken people there so many times and like, it's this much meat and there's little pieces of bread and I'm eating meat the whole time. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4826.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, it's part of the idea. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4832.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4834.0s)]
*  I got a good one for you too. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4835.0s)]
*  You ruined it for me. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4837.0s)]
*  First time I went to Katz Deli. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4838.0s)]
*  So I'm in there filming Food Network Star when I had a day off. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4839.0s)]
*  My buddy lived in New York. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4842.0s)]
*  The guy that was on the show with me. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4843.0s)]
*  So I'm going to take you to Katz Deli. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4844.0s)]
*  Katz's Instagram so I can see some visuals of what's going on. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4846.0s)]
*  I'm addicted to their Instagram page. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4849.0s)]
*  Do you have any fucking sandwiches? [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4851.0s)]
*  No, I wish you did. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4852.0s)]
*  So I thought I was going to bring you food today when I went and did the thing and I'm like, yeah, I'm not taking Joe the vegan food. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4853.0s)]
*  I'm not going to take this. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4858.0s)]
*  Yeah, please don't do that. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4859.0s)]
*  I'm not going to take the beating. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4860.0s)]
*  Don't give me that. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4861.0s)]
*  I had elk sausage for breakfast. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4862.0s)]
*  Oh, I love elk. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4863.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4865.0s)]
*  Oh, come on, baby. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4866.0s)]
*  Look at Katz's Deli. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4867.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4868.0s)]
*  Look at that pastrami. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4869.0s)]
*  It says keto. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4870.0s)]
*  Keto pastrami. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4871.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4872.0s)]
*  I'm eating healthy. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4873.0s)]
*  How is it keto? [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4874.0s)]
*  Oh, no bread. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4875.0s)]
*  Oh, they're just giving you the oh, yeah. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4876.0s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4877.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4878.0s)]
*  Oh, look how good that looks. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4879.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4880.0s)]
*  Is your mouth. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4881.0s)]
*  Oh, I love Katz's Deli. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4882.0s)]
*  I do too. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4883.0s)]
*  I try to go every time I'm in New York. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4884.0s)]
*  Those guys, I see the same fucking dudes that I've been going since I was a kid. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4885.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4886.0s)]

*  I don't know. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4926.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4927.0s)]
*  You had to pay in cash. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4928.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4929.0s)]
*  So they give you the ticket. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4930.0s)]
*  They don't take credit cards. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4931.0s)]
*  You'd better have cash. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4932.0s)]
*  So you pass the ticket over the counter. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4933.0s)]
*  They mark off what they gave you. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4934.0s)]
*  So then you take a ticket and you sit down. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4935.0s)]
*  You eat your food. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4936.76s)]
*  And then when you leave, you go out and you check out with your ticket. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4937.76s)]
*  So my buddy and I go, and I order up. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4940.8s)]
*  We order up all the stuff. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4945.86s)]
*  I'm paying. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4946.86s)]
*  So we put it all on my ticket. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4947.86s)]
*  So we had a bunch of sandwiches. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4949.18s)]
*  Bunch of beers. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4950.64s)]
*  We had some soup. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4951.64s)]
*  So we're leaving, and I turn my ticket in, and I pay my bill. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4953.16s)]
*  And they look at my buddy and they say, where's your ticket? [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4957.38s)]
*  And he goes, I didn't get anything. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4959.22s)]
*  I put it on his ticket. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4960.5s)]
*  I said, no, no, no. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4961.5s)]
*  You got to turn your ticket in. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4962.5s)]
*  And it says right there, lost ticket, 300 bucks, [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4964.02s)]
*  or whatever the ticket would be worth if it was all checked off. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4966.5s)]
*  And I'm like, but he didn't have anything. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4970.18s)]
*  You can see it. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4972.26s)]
*  And they're like, you got to have your ticket [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4972.74s)]
*  or you pay the thing. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4974.7s)]
*  I'm like, what the? [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4975.58s)]
*  I mean, I've never been to a place like this. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4976.82s)]
*  So we go back over to the table where it'd been sitting. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4978.26s)]
*  Well, they'd already turned the table, [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4980.54s)]
*  and it's all gone and done. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4981.82s)]
*  And now there's four big construction dudes [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4983.1s)]
*  sitting there, huge, in the yellow vest, hard hats on, [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4985.9s)]
*  total New Yorkers. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4990.339999999999s)]
*  My buddy wasn't from New York. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4991.379999999999s)]
*  And he goes, excuse me, fine sirs. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4992.98s)]
*  And I don't have the, again, still in the same yellow jacket, [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=4997.98s)]
*  bleached hair. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5001.54s)]

*  But now that I have this program going where we can do things [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5305.66s)]
*  to raise money and it's not just raise money, raise the money [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5309.9s)]
*  and then do things with it. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5312.78s)]
*  Like when the fires happened in L.A., we went down with our team. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5313.78s)]
*  We have a big rescue trailer that's 50 feet long. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5316.82s)]
*  We can feed about five thousand a day out of it. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5319.78s)]
*  And I have a bunch of chef buddies. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5321.98s)]
*  And so they all come and help. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5323.78s)]
*  And we just pump out food for first responders. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5325.0199999999995s)]
*  But I was doing we had the fires in Maui [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5328.78s)]
*  and devastation. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5331.7s)]
*  And I know the fire feeling because I was up there in [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5333.26s)]
*  Northern California in Sonoma County when we had our bad fires. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5335.78s)]
*  And so we raised money. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5340.1s)]
*  So I got 40 chefs together. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5342.06s)]
*  We were all in town doing I do a show called Tournament of Champions. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5344.46s)]
*  They were in town for the tournament. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5347.22s)]
*  And we put on a dinner for one hundred and fifty people. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5349.14s)]
*  So I called Taylor and said, hey, I'm doing this event. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5352.1s)]
*  You want to come up? [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5354.1s)]
*  And he says, only if I get to cook. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5354.9400000000005s)]
*  You know, we're going to cook together. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5356.14s)]
*  So we brought up all these four sixes, [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5357.02s)]
*  ripped these tomahawk chops the size of a manhole cover. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5359.299999999999s)]
*  And we cooked. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5363.74s)]
*  And so we sat there, we raised money and we did all these different things. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5364.62s)]
*  I can go to four sixes ranch. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5367.099999999999s)]
*  You can go be here. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5368.46s)]
*  You can go have a culinary experience with guy. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5369.299999999999s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5371.219999999999s)]
*  And in one night. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5372.139999999999s)]
*  We raised one point seven million with one hundred and fifty people in the room. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5374.98s)]
*  That's incredible. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5379.38s)]
*  And a big part of that was Taylor. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5380.139999999999s)]
*  I think three of the biggest packages sold were for over [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5382.099999999999s)]
*  one hundred thousand bucks to go down to his ranch or to go. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5385.179999999999s)]
*  No, actually, it was to go up to Montana to Yellowstone [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5388.3s)]
*  to see the filming. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5392.42s)]
*  Oh, he's just that kind of dude, man. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5393.66s)]
*  He that dude, everybody. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5395.54s)]
*  He gives everybody the time. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5398.74s)]
*  He's just at the Derby walking around together. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5399.9400000000005s)]
*  Just class act. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5401.74s)]
*  We just love that guy. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5402.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he's a legit. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5404.02s)]
*  And the what the fuck the shows he's making. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5405.3s)]
*  I know. I don't know how he can do it. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5408.18s)]
*  Landman. Well, I don't know how he does so many shows. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5410.02s)]
*  I keep finding shows like this show looks interesting. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5413.46s)]
*  Terrell, Sheridan show. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5415.900000000001s)]
*  Lioness. Yeah, he's got landmantel. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5417.54s)]
*  Ten shows. Have you watched Landman? [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5419.98s)]
*  Yeah, I love it. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5421.94s)]
*  I'm a huge Billy Bob fan. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5423.179999999999s)]
*  Oh, and he's the coolest. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5424.58s)]
*  He's the best. I said to him, I go, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5425.94s)]
*  did you write that for him? [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5429.299999999999s)]
*  I mean, it couldn't write Billy Bob any goddamn better. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5431.0599999999995s)]
*  The one liners are the best goddamn thing. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5435.5s)]
*  It's I can't get enough of it. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5437.5s)]
*  But I love I love Kings of Kings of Mayor Kingstown. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5439.219999999999s)]
*  That was great. That was another one. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5443.74s)]
*  Remember the starting the first episode? [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5445.42s)]
*  You didn't see that shit coming. Right. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5447.9800000000005s)]
*  Right at the beginning, the guy that you thought was going to be the lead. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5449.9s)]
*  You didn't think it's going to be a spoiler. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5452.3s)]
*  No, I said that is if you haven't watched it by now, you're missing it. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5454.74s)]
*  Tough shit. Sorry. I blew it for you. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5457.34s)]
*  It's another Taylor show. He's got so many shows. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5458.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like I just don't understand how he can put together. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5461.54s)]
*  So 1923, 1883, Yellowstone like, God damn, I think they're doing another one. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5464.78s)]
*  I think they're doing like a 1943. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5470.22s)]
*  I just watched the end of 1923 and cried like a baby. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5473.1s)]
*  I was bummed that Yellowstone ended the way it did, though. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5477.58s)]
*  Yeah. Circumstances were fucked up outside of the outside of the show. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5479.900000000001s)]
*  Circumstances. Yeah, I don't know what happened. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5484.46s)]
*  Why would Kevin Costner want to leave that show? [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5486.740000000001s)]
*  I just don't understand what happened. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5488.860000000001s)]
*  I was what I read or what I thought I learned was that he had his own project [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5490.620000000001s)]
*  and his I'm sure he did. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5494.620000000001s)]
*  I mean, Kevin Costner has been around for so long. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5496.3s)]
*  It's probably hard for him to do somebody else's thing for so long. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5498.5s)]
*  So good. Yeah, I know. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5501.66s)]
*  He was perfect in that role, too. So iconic. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5504.0199999999995s)]
*  The ending, I mean, even if you're going to leave, my bummer for it was [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5507.5s)]
*  my bummer about it was even if you're going to leave. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5510.94s)]
*  Just I mean, well, I would go out better than in this situation was. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5514.22s)]
*  I mean, they did it the way they did. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5517.82s)]
*  I'm not I'm not discrediting the show by any means, [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5518.74s)]
*  but I'm just saying I just wanted it to be like [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5521.3s)]
*  the way it was from the beginning. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5524.62s)]
*  It's kind of sad how they did it. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5525.86s)]
*  But it was almost kind of like a fuck you. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5527.66s)]
*  It seemed like to me from which side. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5529.82s)]
*  Exactly. I'm not coming back. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5531.9s)]
*  Well, wait till you see how you go. Yeah, exactly. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5533.94s)]
*  And Taylor is a little bit. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5537.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, I wouldn't cross him. Yeah, he's got a little bit of that in him. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5538.7s)]
*  It's funny. I was telling him about this ranch that I hunt out in California. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5542.38s)]
*  He's like, oh, he's the cowboy at that place. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5545.66s)]
*  Like, he's a legit guy. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5547.5s)]
*  It's a bad ass. Yeah, he's a good dude, too. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5550.179999999999s)]
*  Solid human being, you know, you're talking to him. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5552.86s)]
*  He's right there. You know, it's not. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5556.58s)]
*  He told me come. He says, listen, I know what you're doing up there in [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5558.38s)]
*  Northern California. You've done your fundraiser there a bunch of years. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5561.22s)]
*  He says, come down and do it. My ranch. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5563.3s)]
*  He says, I will bring you the people with the money that believe in [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5564.74s)]
*  what you're doing with these first responders and these. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5567.82s)]
*  Because when we don't have disasters, we just go do positive energy. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5569.9400000000005s)]
*  Thank you to different municipalities. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5574.82s)]
*  We just did one in in Florida, southern South Florida. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5577.42s)]
*  We just bring the trailer in, bring a bunch of chefs in, [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5580.66s)]
*  call up the local sheriff, call up the troopers, call up everybody. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5583.900000000001s)]
*  You know, bring your families if you want. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5586.78s)]
*  It's free lunch time for you to celebrate and be recognized. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5588.74s)]
*  You know, we got people walking around the streets [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5592.26s)]
*  that don't understand why our country is free. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5594.58s)]
*  They don't have any idea what it takes to be a free country. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5596.62s)]
*  And they understand the sacrifice, not just the sacrifices [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5599.74s)]
*  that the actual individual makes, but the sacrifice the family makes. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5602.26s)]
*  Now, we're not even talking about the loss of somebody. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5606.82s)]
*  We're talking about just being deployed for seven months [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5608.9s)]
*  and not seeing dad for seven months or seeing your husband or your wife or whatever. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5611.66s)]
*  And I remember I was on the USS Enterprise [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5615.5s)]
*  and I was doing a doing a philanthropy event. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5618.38s)]
*  And this years ago, I was cooking for the the sailors [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5621.5s)]
*  and a bunch of Marines on there, like 5200 people. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5625.54s)]
*  And I'm on the line serving this young sailor. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5628.9400000000005s)]
*  And she came through and we kind of talked for a second. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5633.02s)]
*  She says, I have four kids. I said. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5636.620000000001s)]
*  How she wasn't real, I said, how many? [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5639.3s)]
*  She was live, an eight month old baby. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5641.740000000001s)]
*  Babies on the ship. She was no baby. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5645.580000000001s)]
*  I said, how could you be away from your child at this age? [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5649.18s)]
*  And she's like, no, it's, you know, I'm deployed and. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5652.860000000001s)]
*  I'm like, what a commitment, you know, what a commitment to do. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5656.900000000001s)]
*  And the kids without. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5660.660000000001s)]
*  So I think, I mean, my mantra is we're talking about people pushing things [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5661.5s)]
*  on other people about their beliefs or their opinions or their attitudes. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5665.22s)]
*  And I said, you know, I kind of divert from all of it. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5669.38s)]
*  And, you know, if you don't want to like something, don't like it. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5671.18s)]
*  That's your thing. But I am hell bent. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5673.38s)]
*  On what goes on in this country about how we recognize our veterans [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5676.18s)]
*  and our first responders and our active military. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5680.22s)]
*  We have we're missing some pieces. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5682.66s)]
*  Yeah, we got some people that have made the ultimate commitment, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5684.9800000000005s)]
*  the ultimate sacrifice. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5687.82s)]
*  It's like the stolen valor shit. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5689.58s)]
*  Oh, I'll lose my mind on that because that's just crazy. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5691.66s)]
*  The commitment that it takes, of course. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5695.18s)]
*  And so we put so much into putting the soldiers and the sailors [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5698.06s)]
*  and all these military folks into these programs. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5701.5s)]
*  And then when they come back, I don't think that we put the same amount [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5704.86s)]
*  of commitment. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5709.02s)]
*  And I think that we've got a lot of people need a lot of help. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5710.3s)]
*  There's a lot of PTSD. There's a lot of shit going on. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5713.06s)]
*  Yeah. So my interest is I'm not going to solve that situation. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5715.74s)]
*  I'm not the one that's going to be able to. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5718.54s)]
*  But at least you could recognize and give them some. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5719.9s)]
*  Recognize talk about it. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5721.7s)]
*  We carry challenge coins and ran into one of your guys, the first responder. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5723.02s)]
*  Also didn't know that he served our country in the military. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5725.9s)]
*  Please, when you see somebody in uniform, [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5729.02s)]
*  if you see somebody with a Vietnam vet hat, you see somebody that's in, [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5731.46s)]
*  you know, take a moment, just say thank you. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5735.14s)]
*  Thank you goes so far. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5737.78s)]
*  And people think I don't know that I can do this. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5739.58s)]
*  No, it means a shit ton of people. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5741.1s)]
*  Yeah. So I had to mean to get on my rant. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5742.82s)]
*  But I know that's one of my hardcore issues. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5744.66s)]
*  That's good. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5747.42s)]
*  That's a beautiful perspective, because it's it's especially with [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5748.26s)]
*  first responders and law enforcement in this country. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5752.3s)]
*  They just don't get any love. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5754.82s)]
*  It's kind of crazy. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5756.86s)]
*  Like the cops are the bad guys in this country. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5757.66s)]
*  Like that's why the defund the police movement is driving me fucking crazy. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5759.54s)]
*  Like you are you guys are out of your mind. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5764.62s)]
*  But we're going to have a march. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5767.1s)]
*  And we'd like you to be there to keep people from throwing shit at us. Yeah. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5768.0199999999995s)]
*  So so here's the crazy is defund the police. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5771.62s)]
*  March, but we need the police. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5774.38s)]
*  We need you. So the people that are again. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5775.46s)]
*  So when we had the fires in Northern California, [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5777.74s)]
*  I was watching a lot of where they're feeding them. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5780.54s)]
*  It was up and actually we're up in paradise. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5782.9s)]
*  It was a devastating fire. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5784.66s)]
*  That was a crazy fire. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5786.34s)]
*  Joe, I drove through it. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5788.82s)]
*  I don't know what a I don't know what the surface of the moon looks like. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5789.7s)]
*  But I can tell you it was as close to because there was nothing standing. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5794.02s)]
*  There was nothing there. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5797.06s)]
*  The only thing that didn't burn down was the fire station. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5798.7s)]
*  I mean, and not because they defunded those people that got stuck on the road. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5801.18s)]
*  Stuck cars gone. Everything got bombs. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5804.62s)]
*  I mean, it was it was it was I don't know the term, but [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5806.58s)]
*  so I'm standing there and I'm feeding people. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5810.78s)]
*  And I know for a fact, because I had just been inside that I just went to the fire. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5812.46s)]
*  I went and fed people at the fire station that was the only building standing. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5816.9s)]
*  And I said, why why aren't you guys over here eating? [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5820.379999999999s)]
*  We're serving a bunch of food. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5823.0599999999995s)]
*  Now, it's just stay over here. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5824.5s)]
*  I said, you guys are fire victims. Your house is burnt down. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5827.54s)]
*  Yeah. But, you know, you had all kinds of restaurants feeding people and all this [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5830.179999999999s)]
*  stuff, and I'm watching these guys eat granola bars and eat M.R.E.s. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5833.58s)]
*  And I said, come over and get some food. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5837.5s)]
*  And then I said, OK, that's it. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5839.74s)]
*  Next day, picked up my trailer. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5842.379999999999s)]
*  We moved. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5844.58s)]
*  I said, we only feed first responders. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5845.9s)]
*  Not that I'm not about the fire victims. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5847.339999999999s)]
*  I think the fire victims is terrible. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5848.82s)]
*  But the reality of this, we have a lot of people that were focusing on the victims [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5850.099999999999s)]
*  and giving them what they need. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5853.299999999999s)]
*  But these guys were doing these men and women were going to bed. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5855.7s)]
*  These they were doing 72 hour shifts sleeping in the back of the patrol car. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5859.299999999999s)]
*  They drove their patrol car up from Riverside and they're up in northern California now. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5863.139999999999s)]
*  And so that's what that's what I changed. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5867.42s)]
*  I pivoted my whole foundation was when the disasters go down, [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5869.339999999999s)]
*  we're going to get there and we're going to focus on the first responders. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5873.820000000001s)]
*  We were down in L.A. for 10 days. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5877.42s)]
*  We fed 25000 meals. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5879.26s)]
*  Now, it's not going to feed everybody and it's not going to take care of everything. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5881.7s)]
*  But there is a point of them being recognized or knowing that we recognize them. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5884.9800000000005s)]
*  And I had so many chefs in L.A. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5890.66s)]
*  that showed up and jumped on the trailer and were cooking food. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5892.1s)]
*  And we were almost cooking, you know, 24 hours is just rolling over. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5895.06s)]
*  And people were so thankful. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5898.820000000001s)]
*  That's awesome. Yeah. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5900.34s)]
*  But we all can do these things. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5901.82s)]
*  You know, we can do these things we can make. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5903.259999999999s)]
*  OK, maybe you don't have the money. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5905.259999999999s)]
*  Donate the time. Maybe you don't have the time. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5906.7s)]
*  Do the positive reinforcement on the on social media. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5908.58s)]
*  You know, if you don't have the time, you don't have social media. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5911.74s)]
*  You don't have the money. You don't have time. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5913.54s)]
*  Just pat somebody on the back and say thanks. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5915.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's we really can do. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5917.62s)]
*  We can do way more. Yeah. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5919.139999999999s)]
*  We can make a bigger impact. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5920.62s)]
*  Well, just as a society, we need to recognize the importance of these people [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5921.98s)]
*  and appreciate them for what they do. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5927.0599999999995s)]
*  And I don't think that that's been accentuated. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5929.5s)]
*  That's not been people haven't focused on that. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5931.9400000000005s)]
*  And that's a top down thing that comes from the president. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5935.18s)]
*  That comes from the cabinet that comes from the way [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5938.22s)]
*  that the country perceives these people and the way they award these people. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5940.9800000000005s)]
*  And, you know, the way that our media treats them. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5945.06s)]
*  You know, the media had a field day after George Floyd [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5949.700000000001s)]
*  with this defund the police stuff and just [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5952.34s)]
*  that kind of devastation that does form morale. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5955.700000000001s)]
*  And for recruiting and, you know, just the overall feeling [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5959.34s)]
*  that these people have, like, why am I doing this job [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5965.02s)]
*  where not only am I not being thanked for it, [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5968.1s)]
*  but I am being thought of as the enemy. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5970.740000000001s)]
*  And then if I do something, if I do something, [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5973.14s)]
*  I'm not going to get supported. Right. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5975.740000000001s)]
*  You know, because I'm going to get persecuted. Right. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5977.860000000001s)]
*  And every day you show up, you pull people over, you're worried [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5981.34s)]
*  you're going to get shot every fucking day. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5983.5s)]
*  They all have PTSD, every one of them. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5985.9800000000005s)]
*  You go pull a buddy of mine's a fireman. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5988.78s)]
*  And I didn't really understand. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5991.42s)]
*  I didn't think about it until he brought it up to me one day. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5992.46s)]
*  And he said, his name is Jay LaVar and Jay said, you know, [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5994.54s)]
*  you go pull kids out of a car. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=5999.5s)]
*  You go to the U.F.A. site and then you go home to your kids. Right. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6002.26s)]
*  It's horrible. That'll just wreck you. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6006.26s)]
*  But I, you know, like I said, [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6008.1s)]
*  I'm so interested in what we can do. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6011.58s)]
*  And we have so much. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6015.22s)]
*  We're the greatest country in the world. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6016.58s)]
*  We're finally riding the ship. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6018.5s)]
*  We're getting into better space. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6019.86s)]
*  But, gosh, let's start focusing on it. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6021.86s)]
*  Let's start focusing on the fundamentals that made us the ass kicking, [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6023.5s)]
*  name taking center of, you know, that made us the best. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6026.62s)]
*  And we have to start ingrained. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6030.38s)]
*  We have to start teaching that. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6031.66s)]
*  I was just talking about [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6032.86s)]
*  I just did a podcast for the Dale Carnegie Institute. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6034.54s)]
*  And that was a book that changed my life when I was young, when I was [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6037.86s)]
*  come open. Thank you, bro. Rich. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6040.86s)]
*  No, what is it? How to win friends and influence people. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6042.54s)]
*  Yeah. And it talks really about just human [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6044.86s)]
*  about how you treat people and treat people the way you want to be treated [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6047.179999999999s)]
*  and think before you act and think before you speak [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6049.9s)]
*  or before you light somebody up on a text, you know, kind of. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6052.74s)]
*  And I was I was going through this and I said, you know, this is [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6055.7s)]
*  this is like a course that should be taught [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6059.38s)]
*  at freshman high school. Absolutely. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6062.98s)]
*  And we should teach civility and we should teach respect and responsibility. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6065.5s)]
*  Yeah. You know, back your back your mouth up. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6070.299999999999s)]
*  You know, don't go popping off on it and do these things the way we grew up. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6073.62s)]
*  I mean, I'm not saying that violence is the answer, but you [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6078.22s)]
*  you definitely didn't have people run in their mouth like they do now [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6081.26s)]
*  because there was hell to pay at three o'clock. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6084.34s)]
*  You know, you know, that kind of stuff. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6086.820000000001s)]
*  So I think that we need to get involved in teaching our young America [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6088.58s)]
*  that they have it. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6093.38s)]
*  They have a voice. They have an opinion. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6095.18s)]
*  They have they're they're very worthwhile. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6096.900000000001s)]
*  And let's just do it the right way. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6099.06s)]
*  But I think that Dale Carnegie Institute, that that how to win funds there. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6101.9s)]
*  They I didn't know how many things they do worldwide. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6105.5s)]
*  And I just think I was just telling my sons about it. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6107.78s)]
*  I said, you can all expect that you're going to be going to one of these programs [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6110.42s)]
*  or doing one of these courses. I made them all read the book. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6114.42s)]
*  That's great. You know, it's really people in school get taught how to. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6116.66s)]
*  I mean, you get taught a lot of information. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6120.94s)]
*  But I think one of the things that's missing is getting taught [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6122.86s)]
*  how to behave and think and how to critically think and how to view the world. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6126.38s)]
*  The number critical thinking to me is, [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6131.94s)]
*  I mean, even say the term to somebody critical thinking. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6136.0599999999995s)]
*  And they'll look at you and go. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6138.5s)]
*  But they don't know what it means. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6141.26s)]
*  Critical thinking is solving situations, is evaluating the environment [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6143.34s)]
*  and and coming up with with calculating. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6148.86s)]
*  It's not taking a risk, it's taking a calculated risk. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6152.139999999999s)]
*  There's just so many of those types of things. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6155.26s)]
*  My dad was a huge critical thing. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6157.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, he was so we had a rule when I was a kid, Joe, we'd be driving down the road. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6159.66s)]
*  And my dad would say, what are you thinking? [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6163.38s)]
*  You know, you're quiet over there. What are you thinking? [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6166.26s)]
*  One thing I was not allowed to say was nothing. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6168.78s)]
*  He'd say, God full of shit. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6172.94s)]
*  What do you think? I mean, kind of argument. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6175.38s)]
*  What do you think? And I'm saying, well. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6177.74s)]
*  All there's it's all grass, but under the telephone pole, there's no grass. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6182.18s)]
*  And then we would spend the next goddamn hour [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6187.820000000001s)]
*  talking about why there's no grass under the telephone pole. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6191.22s)]
*  And why is there no grass under the telephone pole fire? [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6195.42s)]
*  You know, the ability to get to the poles, they have to be able to drive to them. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6199.02s)]
*  So you look at it because like you go to the wine country, you know, [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6202.22s)]
*  you look at all these mountains that have all these telephone poles going. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6204.860000000001s)]
*  You find roads on top of mountains and so forth. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6210.1s)]
*  It's usually fire break or access to the mountains. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6212.7s)]
*  But we would do this critical thinking thing. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6216.82s)]
*  And it was so funny. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6219.34s)]
*  My my young my nephew, my sister was dying of cancer, [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6220.86s)]
*  and I took him away for the day and we're driving around in Corvette. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6224.38s)]
*  We're at the stoplight, manual Corvette, sitting there talking to Jules. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6228.18s)]
*  Jules is about nine. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6232.62s)]
*  And he says, you know, he says, I really like talking to you. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6234.26s)]
*  Says, you're fun to talk to. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6237.62s)]
*  He says, it's a little bit different than talking to Jams. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6238.62s)]
*  Jams was my dad. He says. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6241.099999999999s)]
*  I said, what do you mean? [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6243.139999999999s)]
*  He said, you know, I'm talking to Jams. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6244.22s)]
*  What do you mean, Jules? And he says, well, you know, [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6246.42s)]
*  you know, sometimes when I ask Jams, you know, like, what time is it? [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6249.22s)]
*  You know, I just want to know what time it is. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6253.74s)]
*  I don't want to know how the clock is made. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6255.58s)]
*  I slipped the clutch in a car burned down. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6258.78s)]
*  I'm like, Jesus Christ, I don't want to know the clock. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6261.1s)]
*  Because that was my dad, man. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6264.62s)]
*  You'd ask him a question. I go, what time is it? [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6265.82s)]
*  Would you understand the difference between the analog? [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6267.14s)]
*  You got a digitally. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6269.54s)]
*  My dad would go into this. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6271.14s)]
*  He was an old. He was a submariner during Vietnam. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6272.34s)]
*  He was a piece of work. Oh, really? [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6274.58s)]
*  Yeah, I lost him [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6276.1s)]
*  right around my birthday [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6278.9400000000005s)]
*  year and a half ago and a pink rat at cancer. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6279.9400000000005s)]
*  But he let he lived for six years with it. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6282.1s)]
*  It was pretty. You got a lot of cancer in your family. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6283.820000000001s)]
*  Sucks, man. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6285.660000000001s)]
*  And I think that like I didn't until you're in that club, [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6286.54s)]
*  the club sucks. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6290.9800000000005s)]
*  But when you meet somebody that is in the fight, the fight for their life, [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6292.5s)]
*  down and give them a hug, give them give them a smile, give them encouragement. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6297.9800000000005s)]
*  And if they have battled and they have one, [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6303.1s)]
*  recognize them as a as a warrior, as a survivor, [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6305.820000000001s)]
*  you know, especially breast cancer and all these horrible cancers [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6309.46s)]
*  that, you know, that people are stricken with. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6312.3s)]
*  It there's we need to have more happening, more understanding. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6314.700000000001s)]
*  And I'll tell you, one of the greatest groups of people in the whole world. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6317.38s)]
*  Hospice. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6320.820000000001s)]
*  You I don't know how much you know about them and what it is, [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6324.02s)]
*  but it is if you don't have if you don't understand what hospice does, they are [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6326.780000000001s)]
*  they're earth angels. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6331.1s)]
*  There are people that come in when you're battling this. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6332.9s)]
*  You're watching a loved one die and they come in and they're the people [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6335.38s)]
*  that help you with the meds and help you with the caregiving and help you. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6338.58s)]
*  And they're just these you don't even know them. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6342.18s)]
*  And they they come into your life and they leave your life once the cancers. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6344.14s)]
*  But they stay. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6347.74s)]
*  You'll meet them on the street again or you'll see something. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6348.74s)]
*  But hospice is one of the greatest programs we have in this country. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6351.18s)]
*  I don't know if it's worldwide, but it is. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6355.0199999999995s)]
*  Hopefully you don't ever need to know it. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6357.3s)]
*  It's just shocking how many people have cancer. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6359.34s)]
*  Fucked up. Yeah. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6361.54s)]
*  I've never been on a podcast where you can cuss. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6365.06s)]
*  Really? I've been on. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6367.14s)]
*  I haven't been on any podcast. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6368.22s)]
*  How many podcasts you've been on? [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6369.34s)]
*  I don't know. Not very much. Which ones can't you cuss on? [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6370.5s)]
*  I don't know. I don't. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6372.38s)]
*  You know, I've come from the Food Network. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6373.22s)]
*  We don't do a lot of cussing on Food Network. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6374.9400000000005s)]
*  Would you give me all fired? [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6377.26s)]
*  I got fired up on my own about this shit. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6378.34s)]
*  But don't you cuss a normal life? [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6380.66s)]
*  Oh, I could say. Right. Right. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6382.42s)]
*  Well, don't most people do. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6384.06s)]
*  So why why would they stop people from cussing? [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6385.54s)]
*  I've asked them forever. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6387.66s)]
*  Could we please bleep just the show once in a while? [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6388.7s)]
*  Because sometimes I'll buy I'll eat a dish. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6391.179999999999s)]
*  People say I watch your show. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6393.3s)]

*  I remember I was hanging out with my friends and I heard, [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6774.38s)]
*  I was like, what is that? [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6777.860000000001s)]
*  And someone goes, that's a ricochet. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6779.700000000001s)]
*  I was like, fuck this. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6780.9800000000005s)]
*  So like the entire time I was in camp, all I did was go fishing every day. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6782.860000000001s)]
*  They had all these activities. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6786.58s)]
*  I'm like, you guys can kiss my ass. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6787.66s)]
*  I'd grab a fishing rod and go down to the lake. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6790.02s)]
*  I'm like, I'm just going to go fishing the entire two weeks. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6792.18s)]
*  I'm here. Fuck this. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6794.7s)]
*  There was just too many. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6797.66s)]
*  But no one was getting fucked, at least it was just mostly kids [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6798.9400000000005s)]
*  being just unregulated. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6803.02s)]
*  What a great way to fuck up a great program. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6805.06s)]
*  You know, you get these people to get in there and do that stuff. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6808.18s)]
*  And kids are so I mean, you have kids. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6810.62s)]
*  There's always going to be people that are evil. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6813.22s)]
*  And a lot of those people, unfortunately, have had evil [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6816.46s)]
*  imposed on them, too, when they were young. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6820.26s)]
*  And that's the really sad part about it. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6822.34s)]
*  It's just like it's almost like getting bit by a vampire. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6824.1s)]
*  And then you you, you know, and then you wind up doing it to zombie. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6826.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's it's very evil. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6830.54s)]
*  And they they exist. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6833.18s)]
*  And then there's also like people that are elites. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6834.9400000000005s)]
*  And that's their thing. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6838.66s)]
*  Like their their thing is to do something that is horrible. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6839.900000000001s)]
*  And, you know, it's not available to other people. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6843.78s)]
*  So it's like, I think there's there's like a sickness [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6848.42s)]
*  that people have when they have power, like extreme power. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6852.34s)]
*  And then they will. What else can I do? [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6855.74s)]
*  What else can I do? What what else is what's what's what else is taboo? [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6857.3s)]
*  What else is forbidden? [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6861.46s)]
*  Like all this diddy shit that's coming out. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6862.86s)]
*  I was just going to say, doesn't that sound topical? [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6864.74s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6866.78s)]
*  The first day of the trial, did you pay attention to that? [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6868.46s)]
*  This I looked at it for like 10 minutes this morning. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6871.22s)]
*  I was like, I got to stop. I can't look at this. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6873.9s)]
*  Well, what I what freaks me out is the people sitting in the courtroom [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6876.58s)]
*  listening to it. Right. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6880.46s)]
*  And that's a there's a wide spectrum of people that are getting subjected to it. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6882.86s)]
*  And you just sit there and go. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6887.3s)]
*  Yeah. Well, not only that, how about the fact that this guy was running this [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6889.5s)]
*  for decades, he was doing this for decades to who knows how many fucking people? [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6892.78s)]
*  And everybody was scared to talk about it [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6898.3s)]
*  because he'd have him killed. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6900.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's really wild, man. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6902.42s)]
*  There's the evil is a real thing, you know, nobody wants to believe [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6905.06s)]
*  because if you believe in the devil, right, if you believe in Satan, [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6911.820000000001s)]
*  you you you believe in something that's silly. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6917.740000000001s)]
*  Like most people believe a lot of people believe in God. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6920.22s)]
*  If you ask people, do you believe in God? Yeah, well, I'm not religious, [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6923.540000000001s)]
*  but I believe God. OK, well, do you believe in the devil? [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6925.900000000001s)]
*  Most people say no. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6929.86s)]
*  But do you believe in evil acts? [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6932.06s)]
*  Well, yeah, well, people certainly do evil things. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6933.74s)]
*  Well, where do you think that comes from? [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6935.94s)]
*  If evil is real, what is it about us that makes us want to [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6938.18s)]
*  deny the possibility that there's some nefarious force [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6944.02s)]
*  that is in is in human beings that influences human beings? [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6947.82s)]
*  It's not as simple as like some people are bad. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6952.22s)]
*  Some people are good. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6955.46s)]
*  No, maybe evil is a real element that you have to fight in life [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6956.34s)]
*  and that maybe this is just something that's been documented [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6961.74s)]
*  all throughout history. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6964.820000000001s)]
*  But our arrogance and our secular society wants to keep us [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6965.820000000001s)]
*  from recognizing that as an actual factor. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6969.46s)]
*  And that's why it gets through. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6972.58s)]
*  You know, that's like that's a great that's a really great way to say it, [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6975.14s)]
*  because if you denounce, OK, so you say there's no devil. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6978.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6983.9800000000005s)]
*  So then you're somewhat saying that there is no evil, [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6984.98s)]
*  but you're not branding evil with some type of identifying factor. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6987.7s)]
*  Then you kind of glaze over it a little bit. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6993.9s)]
*  I think that's what I'm here you're saying. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6996.179999999999s)]
*  And I agree with it, because it gets it gets a little too. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=6998.0599999999995s)]
*  I think people want tangible. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7003.66s)]
*  I think people like to be able to understand [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7004.74s)]
*  things and see it for real and so forth. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7007.46s)]
*  But when you start just talking about root evil, when you start [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7009.78s)]
*  when you start looking at things like I went to the Oklahoma bombing memorial. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7012.82s)]
*  And when you look at shit like that, you think about the hate on this country [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7018.18s)]
*  and the in the 9 11 and you think or you just take it down [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7022.82s)]
*  to the Boy Scout troop leader that or you take it to the pre. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7027.34s)]
*  You take it whatever. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7031.9s)]
*  There is a common you there's a common denominator there. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7033.34s)]
*  And that is just what you call it evil. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7037.14s)]
*  So call it devil. Don't call devil, but call it evil. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7038.94s)]
*  The evilness. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7041.26s)]
*  Is just in not being aware of it or not. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7043.700000000001s)]
*  Allowing ourselves to believe it, I think, is part of the. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7047.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, it's the old quote, the greatest trick the devil ever pulled [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7051.42s)]
*  is making people believe he doesn't exist. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7054.580000000001s)]
*  Well said. But if you're if you want to be thought of as a serious person, [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7058.580000000001s)]
*  you never consider the devil like, oh, come on, there's no there's no Satan. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7063.38s)]
*  Down there burning out. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7068.5s)]
*  Outrageous. Get away. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7069.9s)]
*  You know. Yeah. So how do you so where do you so how do you [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7071.94s)]
*  boy, this goes in a lot of goddamn shirt. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7074.58s)]
*  This goes down some rabbit holes. Yeah. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7076.5s)]
*  Well, those rabbit holes in life, you know, life is a lot of rabbit holes. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7078.219999999999s)]
*  But see, to me, this is when we talked about critical thinking. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7082.98s)]
*  This is the stuff that when you really sit down and you have some conversations [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7085.339999999999s)]
*  besides arguing whose team is better, you know, [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7089.179999999999s)]
*  this is the type of stuff that you really have to get into some perspective. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7092.94s)]
*  You learn a lot. Yeah. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7096.98s)]
*  If you're willing to talk about things and you're willing to open up [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7098.38s)]
*  and you're willing to be wrong. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7101.62s)]
*  It's one of the things I'm always into is don't go into something [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7103.26s)]
*  with a predisposed opinion about it and be so hell bent on it your way, [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7105.900000000001s)]
*  because you might really get your mind changed or you might really [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7109.38s)]
*  learn something about it. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7112.46s)]
*  But as soon as you lock down on it's this way, you know, there's no devil. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7113.62s)]
*  Yeah. God's not real. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7119.42s)]
*  Well, I deal with it when you die. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7120.9400000000005s)]
*  You just die. How the fuck do you know, bitch? [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7123.06s)]
*  Have you been dead? Like, what are you talking about? [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7125.06s)]
*  Do you believe? Have you ever been to a medium? [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7127.62s)]
*  A medium, like a psychic medium? No, not a real one. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7129.900000000001s)]
*  OK, so I mean, I don't I don't think that I'm not like one of those people [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7133.06s)]
*  that says they don't exist. I think it's possible. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7136.860000000001s)]
*  I was a very anti, not anti preaching, but anti. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7139.38s)]
*  So my mom believes that mom did. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7144.18s)]
*  My wife does. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7146.38s)]
*  Was my cup of tea. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7148.5s)]
*  Not saying bad, just was my cup of tea. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7149.740000000001s)]
*  My sister died real close with my sister. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7153.66s)]
*  And I kept getting this. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7156.820000000001s)]
*  Weird feeling. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7161.1s)]
*  I mean, my wife's not telling me to go. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7162.3s)]
*  My mom's not telling me to go. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7164.18s)]
*  No one's saying a thing to me. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7165.34s)]
*  Then this hawk is a representation of my sister. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7171.18s)]
*  I'm driving my big RV cross country with my family. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7173.9800000000005s)]
*  Every year we do a big, huge road trip with the family. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7177.46s)]
*  This hawk flies outside of my window. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7180.34s)]
*  Five minutes. No shit. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7183.26s)]
*  It was a real five minutes flew along freeway with me as fast as I was gone. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7184.98s)]
*  Dirt road. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7189.66s)]
*  And I was like, so I asked my mom, who's lady to call. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7191.299999999999s)]
*  So I went and had this thing. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7195.139999999999s)]
*  Didn't know me very well, didn't know much about me. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7197.94s)]
*  I had the most mind blowing experience, like mind blowing. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7200.78s)]
*  And I had to really sit there. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7206.94s)]
*  I had to go back to my wife and my mom and say. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7208.459999999999s)]
*  OK, I there's something out there [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7211.7s)]
*  that's going on that's going that's bigger than us, then I can comprehend. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7214.34s)]
*  And the way I kind of to make sense of it for myself, [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7220.38s)]
*  because I have to make sense of it, is if you're a baby laying in a bassinet [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7222.82s)]
*  and you can smell and you can breathe and you can poop and you can eat [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7227.900000000001s)]
*  and you can sleep and giggle and. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7230.7s)]
*  But I can talk to you. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7233.06s)]
*  I can talk to you, but the baby can't understand me. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7234.7s)]
*  But there's some transmission of connection. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7237.14s)]
*  Right. I make it get. Yeah. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7239.42s)]
*  At this stage, am I the baby in the bassinet? [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7242.34s)]
*  And my sister's trying to talk to me and like, I'm just kind of getting it, [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7245.94s)]
*  but I'm not. But is that possible? [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7249.9s)]
*  The older I get, the more I start to buy into. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7253.38s)]
*  It's got to be something else. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7256.46s)]
*  There's no way it can be all this. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7257.78s)]
*  And not be something more. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7262.86s)]
*  We didn't just vaporize go away. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7265.099999999999s)]
*  So the other day, maybe six months ago, [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7268.099999999999s)]
*  sit in a hot tub. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7272.7s)]
*  I had to have my routine of hot sauna, cold plunge, hot tub, infrared. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7274.179999999999s)]
*  I do all that. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7278.58s)]
*  But I'm sitting there and I keep getting this thing. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7280.26s)]
*  I got to call this medium lady. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7282.5s)]
*  And I text her and I said, hey, can I come see you? [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7285.86s)]
*  And she goes, yeah, she was you. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7291.82s)]
*  Your dad's been your dad's been hitting me up quite a bit. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7296.9s)]
*  Your dad's on that. Dad wants to talk to you. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7300.0199999999995s)]
*  Your dad, dad, my dad, that. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7304.22s)]
*  Has been hitting her up to get in touch with me to make. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7308.26s)]
*  Does she know that your father's dead? [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7311.9s)]
*  She knows that. Yeah, she knew. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7313.54s)]
*  But the point was, and there was more intricacies about it, but. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7315.78s)]
*  She said, yeah, he's been talking about it. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7321.26s)]
*  He said, because were you just in Mexico? [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7323.86s)]
*  So, yeah, should do something about him in Mexico, something about an owl. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7327.9s)]
*  There's no way in a million years she would know this. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7332.94s)]
*  An owl. Yeah. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7337.0199999999995s)]
*  My dad comes back as an owl. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7338.419999999999s)]
*  So he said it was going to be as an owl. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7340.419999999999s)]
*  Is what he was saying to her to me, to you. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7345.74s)]
*  Yeah, this before he died, before he died, he said, I'm going to come back as an owl. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7348.139999999999s)]
*  He just owl was the thing. Wise guy. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7351.339999999999s)]
*  OK. And now how owls are dumb as shit. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7354.7s)]
*  I don't know. I'm raising. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7358.62s)]
*  I don't know that I've never seen it. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7360.099999999999s)]
*  Martin, he's scared the shit out of me. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7362.219999999999s)]
*  No, they're really dumb birds. That's great. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7364.0599999999995s)]
*  That's my dad. We're talking about things like. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7365.82s)]
*  No, I'm not saying your dad's dumb. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7367.54s)]
*  I'm just saying it's weird that we all have this idea of owls being wise. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7369.58s)]
*  I took this lady trains birds. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7372.86s)]
*  She says there's some dumbest birds. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7374.54s)]
*  It's like the only dumb than them is emus. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7376.9s)]
*  It's like emus are dumb as shit. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7379.219999999999s)]
*  So he was on a ranch yesterday. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7380.58s)]
*  She's but she's like we have this idea that owls are really smart. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7382.26s)]
*  Well, whatever, whatever the case is, I hung up of stained glass. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7385.58s)]
*  Owl. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7390.38s)]
*  Where my dad used to sit in our house in Mexico. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7392.780000000001s)]
*  No, you know that there's no way. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7396.26s)]
*  So I don't know. I'm not sure your pre-treatment something. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7400.02s)]
*  There's something bigger going on there. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7402.66s)]
*  Have you ever heard of the people are looking at me going, guys, guys, fucking crazy. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7404.14s)]
*  But it's it really is my there's got to be something else. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7407.1s)]
*  Have you ever heard of the telepathy tapes? [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7410.58s)]
*  No. The telepathy tapes are the this podcast, this woman put together [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7412.42s)]
*  from her work with nonverbal autistic kids and their families. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7417.9s)]
*  Nonverbal are autistic kids and their mothers in particular [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7421.82s)]
*  have an incredible, measurable psychic bond where the mother can be in another room. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7425.98s)]
*  The mother can look at images. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7432.14s)]
*  The kid will be able to write down what the mother sees. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7434.54s)]
*  The mother could be reading things and the child will write down what she's reading. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7437.339999999999s)]
*  And it turns out these kids have abilities that are unexplainable. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7443.299999999999s)]
*  She documentary, she documented a nonverbal autistic kid [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7449.94s)]
*  who had the ability to read hieroglyphs. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7453.82s)]
*  They have the ability to read languages that they've never studied. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7456.58s)]
*  It is very strange and that they all meet up on some place called the Hill. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7461.179999999999s)]
*  Psychically, they meet up together and they all describe it. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7466.82s)]
*  So someplace psychically where all these nonverbal autistic kids get together. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7471.22s)]
*  Yeah, like so this documentary, the telepathy tapes is like very well researched. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7478.78s)]
*  Like what they're doing, they made sure they covered up any reflective surfaces. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7485.46s)]
*  There was they checked everybody for wires. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7490.22s)]
*  They scanned the room for any device that could possibly transmit information. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7492.98s)]
*  There was nothing. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7497.259999999999s)]
*  And these children were able to do this like a hundred percent of the time. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7498.299999999999s)]
*  This is, it's a real documented phenomenon that a lot of people were reluctant to believe in. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7503.5s)]
*  You know, cause it's one of those things you believe in and all you believe in. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7509.7s)]
*  Fuckin' fairy's tales, superstition shit. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7512.339999999999s)]
*  You're a sucker, but now it's real. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7515.0599999999995s)]
*  There's, there's some sort of a bond that exists. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7517.66s)]
*  And the more people that I've talked to about this think that this is, it's not that this is an emerging phenomenon in human beings, but it's a neglected aspect of our senses. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7520.62s)]
*  Of awareness. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7533.82s)]
*  Because of language and because of media, we're being exposed to things all the time. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7534.46s)]
*  So we've kind of let that part of our brain atrophy, but that's intuition. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7539.3s)]
*  That's when you know things about someone, you meet someone, you know, they're full of shit. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7544.26s)]
*  You know, some people you meet them and like right away, like, get me the fuck away from this guy. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7547.86s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7552.0599999999995s)]
*  You feel their, their spirit. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7553.54s)]
*  They got it. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7555.74s)]
*  You feel some energy, right? [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7556.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7557.3s)]
*  But it's, there's something real to that. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7557.62s)]
*  And if you're in tune to it, you'll live a better life because you'll make better decisions because that you'll feel that energy and you'll go, I see where this is going. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7559.82s)]
*  I've had this, yeah, this thing has been going on. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7567.86s)]
*  So it was funny because when I said to the medium, I said, I'm here. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7570.14s)]
*  Where's my sister? [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7577.740000000001s)]
*  She said, oh, she just, she doesn't need to talk to you. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7580.06s)]
*  I said, what the fuck? [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7583.740000000001s)]
*  I said, I just made this whole thing to come here. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7584.900000000001s)]
*  She said, she talks to you every day. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7587.660000000001s)]
*  Talks to you all the time. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7589.46s)]
*  Cause I was raising her kid. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7590.9400000000005s)]
*  My parents, he lived with my mom and dad live right next door to us. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7592.1s)]
*  Lori and I have the two boys, Hunter and Ryder, but we're all big family and within the same acre. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7595.46s)]
*  And I'm like, wow, it is happening. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7601.1s)]
*  I do. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7605.780000000001s)]
*  I get all these things because I'm thinking about things I'm talking to Jules about and things I'm working with Jules about as a young boy and just all these things that, and a lot of it coming from things I think of my sister. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7606.34s)]
*  And I don't know. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7616.3s)]
*  I, I, this is way outside of the spectrum of anything I ever talk about. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7618.34s)]
*  I mean, I tell my close friends about it and probably people are watching us now saying, isn't that guy that does the show about the pizza? [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7621.860000000001s)]
*  Where's he coming off on this? [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7627.780000000001s)]
*  Talking to his dad, the owl, the non smart bird. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7630.58s)]
*  But I believe, well, you, we've seen the stories about somebody that's autistic and then they could just hear a song and play the piano. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7634.34s)]
*  Yes. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7640.740000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's not hocus pocus. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7641.34s)]
*  That's not fake stuff. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7642.660000000001s)]
*  This is really, our brains are so much more powerful than, you know, than we, it's like talking to people from, I have a buddy of mine that's from, from Germany. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7644.22s)]
*  He speaks four languages. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7653.780000000001s)]
*  He's a pretty smart guy, but he speaks four languages. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7656.620000000001s)]
*  They, they all get taught English in school while they get taught German, a young age from like first grade. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7658.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7665.62s)]
*  So they all, you know, most of them all know how to speak a second language. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7666.02s)]
*  But once you can learn a language and learn the, you know, how to adapt to languages, you have the opportunity to be more available to learn other languages. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7669.34s)]
*  I just, you sit there and look at it and go, man, do we, do we not utilize, how much do we use? [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7678.18s)]
*  Yeah, we distract ourselves a little on nonsense, but that's also like the difference between like an athlete and a sedentary person. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7682.5s)]
*  Like obviously your body can do a lot more than you're asking of it, you know, but there's something about autistic kids. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7688.14s)]
*  They tap into some aspect of the brain that's just unavailable to you and I. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7693.58s)]
*  Like there's this one kid who flew over Manhattan in a helicopter and then did a absolutely picture perfect detailed drawing of the skyline just from memory. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7697.9400000000005s)]
*  Photo, yeah. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7712.3s)]
*  And you watch him draw it. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7713.62s)]
*  You're like, this is insane. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7714.9400000000005s)]
*  And then you see the actual photo of the skyline. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7717.0599999999995s)]
*  You're like, how, how? [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7719.42s)]
*  Here it is. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7721.86s)]
*  This kid. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7722.54s)]
*  I mean, this is incredible, man. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7726.54s)]
*  So this kid's foot, look at that. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7728.86s)]
*  How insane is that? [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7730.7s)]
*  Flying over one time? [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7731.82s)]
*  From fucking memory. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7733.1s)]
*  Just from memory. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7734.98s)]
*  I mean, this is incredible, man. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7739.18s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7742.66s)]
*  It's so nuts, man. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7743.38s)]
*  Like he remembers everything he saw and then he's drawing it and he's. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7744.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm just joking. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7750.5s)]
*  He's not drawing a picture. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7751.18s)]
*  He's drawing a, he's doing a billboard. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7752.78s)]
*  Yeah, he's not, it's a huge thing and he's doing every fucking window, man. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7755.82s)]
*  This kid remembers everything. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7762.02s)]
*  It's nuts. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7764.1s)]
*  I work with a program called Best Buddies. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7766.5s)]
*  I've never heard of it. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7770.26s)]
*  Working with intellectually disabled adults and kids had a cousin with [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7770.98s)]
*  intellectual disabilities. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7774.379999999999s)]
*  I just thought everybody had a cousin that was a little different, little [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7775.66s)]
*  unique and super major part of our family, Doug. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7778.62s)]
*  And so I heard about, I learned about this program, Best Buddies, and it [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7782.82s)]
*  was started by Anthony Shriver, whose unique, Eunice Shriver's son. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7786.98s)]
*  Eunice Shriver started the Special Olympics and Sergeant Shriver was the [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7791.219999999999s)]
*  star of the SEC, you know, the Shriver family. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7796.299999999999s)]
*  That whole group, you know, so anyhow, I work with this program and I work [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7798.5s)]
*  with these intellectually disabled adults and kids called Best Buddies. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7803.54s)]
*  And when I got involved, it was Tom Brady hosting a celebrity football game [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7807.1s)]
*  at Harvard and everybody would come and get involved in the buddies that [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7812.22s)]
*  were athletic would participate. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7815.34s)]
*  And I was just there too, because I was invited to go. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7816.62s)]
*  So I had to do something. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7819.18s)]
*  So I cooked, I made appetizers for the event. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7820.1s)]
*  And it was so funny how these, these, these guys were all there. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7823.62s)]
*  And it was so funny how these buddies would gravitate towards me and they [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7827.0599999999995s)]
*  wanted to cook, you know, food's that common denominator of all people. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7831.3s)]
*  And so we really have developed the program into this Best Buddies program [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7835.26s)]
*  where we got all the buddies partnering with chefs and the buddies love to do [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7839.66s)]
*  the repetitive, love to things that are laid out, organized and put them [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7844.58s)]
*  together and so forth, but just an amazing group of people and huge hearts [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7848.82s)]
*  and huge energy and huge, never a bad day. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7854.3s)]
*  Always a smile, always happy. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7859.38s)]
*  I always want to give you a hug. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7861.46s)]
*  You know, there's just so many, but again, when we were talking about things [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7863.18s)]
*  that get glazed over things that get, you know, you had school, you had the [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7866.74s)]
*  special ed group and they went off to their space and we never, never really. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7870.06s)]
*  I think educated people how to work inside or work with, or understand, or [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7874.58s)]
*  have the compassion to understand, you know, people with disabilities. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7878.3s)]
*  And fortunately, I think we're getting better at it. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7882.34s)]
*  I think our country is, our world is starting to, but you know, when we can [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7884.06s)]
*  look at that and take that appreciation and see that and not see that as weird, [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7887.860000000001s)]
*  but take that and appreciate it and think it and say, wow, you know, here's [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7891.46s)]
*  somebody that's taking a difficulty or a major difficulty and doing something with [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7894.580000000001s)]
*  it. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7898.900000000001s)]
*  And I think that's, we need to be more, we need to open our minds up more to that [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7898.9800000000005s)]
*  stuff. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7903.860000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of- [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7904.14s)]
*  Well, we don't really understand all that the mind is capable of. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7904.620000000001s)]
*  When you see someone do something like that, you're like, why is that available [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7908.740000000001s)]
*  to an autistic kid and not available to everyone else? [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7912.26s)]
*  Like, what is it about that? [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7915.66s)]
*  Like, what is it about whatever he's missing in his ability to communicate? [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7917.38s)]
*  Or I don't know if he's nonverbal. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7923.14s)]
*  I don't know what that young man's issues are in particular, but clearly [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7925.1s)]
*  there's something that doesn't work well. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7931.5s)]
*  So something else works in an extraordinary way. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7934.18s)]
*  And this is a thing with like some of them that are just geniuses when it comes [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7938.46s)]
*  to music or mathematics or whatever it is. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7941.9s)]
*  Like, it's like the brain has this insane potential and all sorts of weird ways. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7944.5s)]
*  And which brings us back to like how much, how much of the problem is like what [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7950.74s)]
*  we're distracting our brains with every day and what kind of fuel are you [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7956.099999999999s)]
*  feeding your brain? [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7962.179999999999s)]
*  You're feeding your brain a bunch of bullshit and nonsense and gossip and, you [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7963.259999999999s)]
*  know, negativity. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7967.099999999999s)]
*  And how much are we not paying attention to? [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7968.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7969.66s)]
*  How much are we not paying attention to? [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7970.219999999999s)]
*  Because like I was just saying, when that now becomes, because we can chronicle it [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7971.58s)]
*  and we can see the video of it and it gets on social media, we can be aware of it. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7976.339999999999s)]
*  There's the positive side of social media, but there's so many of these buddies, [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7979.98s)]
*  like this young lady got up and sang the other day at this event. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7984.0599999999995s)]
*  And, you know, very non-communicative when you just see her on the, but once she [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7988.459999999999s)]
*  got on stage, she just blossomed into this, you know, this other person. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7992.379999999999s)]
*  So I think that we're hopefully starting to take some recognition to the fact that [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=7996.86s)]
*  there's more potential and it should be recognized. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8001.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's trippy. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8006.0199999999995s)]
*  It is trippy. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8008.219999999999s)]
*  It's trippy when you see these savants and you wonder like, what is it about them [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8009.179999999999s)]
*  that makes them so extraordinary? [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8015.5s)]
*  And is this like, is this going to be more people like that in the future? [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8016.82s)]
*  Like, obviously cavemen couldn't do that, but these people could do that. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8022.0599999999995s)]
*  Is there going to be more people like that in the future? [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8025.94s)]
*  Will there be more savants? [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8028.74s)]
*  You know, like where is the like the human species headed? [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8030.98s)]
*  But then do we have some of these people that we don't call them savants or so, [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8035.7s)]
*  but there's some people that have invented some shit and created some stuff [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8039.259999999999s)]
*  and took some recognition, some awareness to, you know, bacteria's become, [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8042.62s)]
*  you know, Louis Pasteur. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8047.9s)]
*  I mean, there's some people that have some some higher thinking power that you've [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8049.0199999999995s)]
*  taken us down some paths that, you know, it's like the computer and all of that. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8053.74s)]
*  That was, I mean, I can lose you can, you can lose yourself in it. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8057.5s)]
*  That somebody was able to I do it with architecture. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8061.9s)]
*  When I look at a building and you look at these gigantic skyscrapers [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8065.139999999999s)]
*  and I'm happy when I can build a woodshed, it's square, you know, [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8069.58s)]
*  that everything lines up correctly, but somebody is going to do this out of steel [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8074.26s)]
*  and cement and glass and all this thing. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8078.58s)]
*  And they just build that and it's perfect. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8080.66s)]
*  And you just look at that and go, wow, what goes on in their mind? [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8082.54s)]
*  Because I'll make you a really good pasta dish right now. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8086.62s)]
*  Well, there's a place for everybody in this world. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8089.66s)]
*  That's the thing. It's like whatever their personality is, the way their mind works. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8091.38s)]
*  It's suited to architecture. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8095.22s)]
*  Yours is suited to food. Some suited to music. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8096.54s)]
*  There's some people that are, you know, comedic geniuses. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8099.54s)]
*  There's some people that are artistic geniuses. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8102.14s)]
*  It's like that's the beautiful thing about life. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8104.3s)]
*  It's the most difficult thing for young people is to find the correct path. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8106.66s)]
*  And the worst thing is when you're on the wrong path [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8111.299999999999s)]
*  and you just live a life of suffering and you wish you were doing something else. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8114.099999999999s)]
*  That's the saddest thing to me. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8117.74s)]
*  There's someone who really wants to do something else. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8119.46s)]
*  I mean, that's the classic song, right? [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8122.179999999999s)]
*  That's sing a song. You're the piano man. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8124.46s)]
*  It's fostering. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8127.099999999999s)]
*  So what I try to do with when I speak to young kids or classrooms [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8128.54s)]
*  or schools or whatever I do. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8133.099999999999s)]
*  I say, quit chasing the dollar. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8135.46s)]
*  Quit quit looking at it, thinking I want to make the money. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8137.259999999999s)]
*  All right. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8140.62s)]
*  I just say the first thing I say to them, what makes you happy? Right. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8141.820000000001s)]
*  What do you enjoy? [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8144.66s)]
*  Because if you enjoy it, it's not a job. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8146.18s)]
*  If you enjoy it, you'll be able to put so much more time [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8148.780000000001s)]
*  and energy into it without being tired. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8151.740000000001s)]
*  You know, go be your best self and go find what you love in life. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8153.700000000001s)]
*  And if you do that, it's going to come. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8158.740000000001s)]
*  See the ability to survive, the ability to live and have a house. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8161.860000000001s)]
*  It will come to you. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8165.34s)]
*  Now, that's not to say just because you love art. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8166.900000000001s)]
*  Means that you're going to be Picasso tomorrow and you're going to do it. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8170.18s)]
*  You might have to actually go put in some hard work and take an art class. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8172.860000000001s)]
*  You have to do some shit. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8176.34s)]
*  But you got to. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8177.700000000001s)]
*  And that's the other thing we're missing. Hard work. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8178.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Let's remember that. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8180.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8182.740000000001s)]
*  Anybody says that there's no such thing as nine to five job. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8183.22s)]
*  I work every single day all the time. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8185.780000000001s)]
*  I mean, if I'm having fun, if I'm about, you know, ripping it up, [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8187.780000000001s)]
*  I'm at stage, I'm having fun. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8190.9400000000005s)]
*  But it's always going to be where it's always coming back to taking care of business. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8192.74s)]
*  But I just think that when people start getting lost with that, [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8196.820000000002s)]
*  one of the things I hope that the nucleus around these kids [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8199.86s)]
*  is that we foster imagination, foster critical thinking. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8204.42s)]
*  Back to what you're saying and foster them into achieving their goals. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8208.380000000001s)]
*  Help them write goals. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8212.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Help them have belief. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8214.18s)]
*  You know, we can't just set them away. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8215.94s)]
*  They're getting lost in their phone and believing that they're going to be a tick tock star. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8218.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's a problem. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8222.980000000001s)]
*  That's a problem. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8224.460000000001s)]
*  That's a problem. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8225.82s)]
*  When you ask kids, like, what do they want to do? [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8226.859999999999s)]
*  And a large percentage of them just want to be famous [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8229.22s)]
*  because they see these famous people and they see like, [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8232.5s)]
*  oh, that guy's got a Ferrari. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8235.019999999999s)]
*  Look at that guy's got a big house. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8236.859999999999s)]
*  Mind blowing, though. It's mind blowing. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8238.22s)]
*  It's and it's such a false reality. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8239.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah. But it's also a reality for some people. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8243.58s)]
*  So it's like what they're looking for. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8245.98s)]
*  And it's also the thing that they're getting on their phone all day long. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8248.019999999999s)]
*  They're getting people who are doing it. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8252.179999999998s)]
*  And you can do it. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8253.939999999999s)]
*  You know, it's a really crazy statistic. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8255.38s)]
*  10 percent of girls that are between 18 and I think like 25 are on OnlyFans. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8258.699999999999s)]
*  What? Yeah, one out of 10 girls are posing on OnlyFans. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8268.619999999999s)]
*  And here it gets even crazier. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8275.259999999998s)]
*  I think it's something like. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8278.3s)]
*  The number of like, what's the percentage of men that are subscribing to OnlyFans? [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8280.66s)]
*  I think it's 80 million. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8287.26s)]
*  Well, I think there's a hundred and sixty. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8290.46s)]
*  Can I call him for research, by the way? [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8293.18s)]
*  Sure. I think there's like 160 million men in this country, [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8295.26s)]
*  and 80 million of them are on OnlyFans or subscribing to OnlyFans. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8299.98s)]
*  Are subscribing to OnlyFans. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8306.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's like some of the stats. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8310.1s)]
*  I think it's literally like 50 percent of the men of a certain age [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8311.7s)]
*  are subscribing to OnlyFans and 10 percent of the girls are involved in being models. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8316.1s)]
*  So the number you said about 10 percent checks out, but it's like it's using stats. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8323.1s)]
*  So there's one point two million women aged 18 and 24 on OnlyFans. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8328.82s)]
*  And there are approximately 10 million women that age in America. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8333.82s)]
*  So, yeah, 10 percent. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8337.94s)]
*  And then 10 percent of the girls are showing their body [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8340.82s)]
*  and doing things on OnlyFans for money. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8344.66s)]
*  I got 82 million men are reported to subscribe to OnlyFans. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8346.66s)]
*  It might be overstated. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8351.7s)]
*  But this also weirdly says that the platform had one point two million American women, [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8355.02s)]
*  so that's almost all of them are 18 and 24. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8358.9s)]
*  There's 200. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8361.82s)]
*  And this also says there's three million registered creators. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8362.9s)]
*  I don't know who the other one point. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8365.14s)]
*  Probably over 24 or dudes or fakes. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8367.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. There's dudes that do it, too. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8371.42s)]
*  Yeah, there's that would be more dudes than women on there. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8373.74s)]
*  That's that's kind of crazy. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8376.62s)]
*  Can I take a piss? Yeah, well, it's just we go wrap this up. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8378.02s)]
*  We're doing it for this. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8380.380000000001s)]
*  We got to wrap it up soon. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8382.34s)]
*  We're doing it two hours and 40 minutes. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8383.42s)]
*  I don't want to go anywhere. This is fucking awesome. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8385.18s)]
*  If you would, by the way, I have to. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8387.18s)]
*  Congratulations on our drinking. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8389.58s)]
*  Thank you. I've listened and I applaud you. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8391.38s)]
*  I think that you read yourself, read your body, read your mind, tell you, [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8394.34s)]
*  I heard you talking about it. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8398.06s)]
*  I think that, you know, people need to listen to themselves. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8398.82s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, see how it makes them feel. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8401.94s)]
*  I talk about people, what they eat and how it makes them feel. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8403.82s)]
*  But no, it's a it's a big no. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8406.82s)]
*  I think this is weird. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8410.22s)]
*  It's like we didn't. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8411.5s)]
*  There's so many other things. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8412.62s)]
*  It's going to pick your brain about the dark web, [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8413.54s)]
*  because that's another thing that I just sit there and go. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8415.9s)]
*  What is back? [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8418.58s)]
*  I don't even want to know what's behind that door. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8419.82s)]
*  You don't want to know. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8421.06s)]
*  And I don't want to know what's behind that door. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8421.82s)]
*  And it's because I started talking to that that that tech security people. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8422.98s)]
*  But it's like this only fan stuff. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8428.619999999999s)]
*  I mean, I don't even want to know about it. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8430.179999999998s)]
*  I don't even want to. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8431.419999999998s)]
*  The darkness of the human soul. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8432.619999999999s)]
*  It exists always. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8435.019999999999s)]
*  And for a lot of these girls, [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8436.74s)]
*  like they just don't want to have a regular job. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8437.82s)]
*  And then they get caught up in this only fans thing. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8439.419999999998s)]
*  And then you talk about money living in perpetuity. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8441.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8444.939999999999s)]
*  You talk about that one. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8446.14s)]
*  But that one, right? [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8447.38s)]
*  Because people are screen grabbing that stuff and people are recording that stuff. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8448.22s)]
*  And yes. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8451.179999999998s)]
*  Good luck on that one. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8453.859999999999s)]
*  I know. And it's just like nobody's telling them that when they're young, [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8454.859999999999s)]
*  they're not getting raised properly, unfortunately, [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8457.5s)]
*  for the little bit of scratch you get now and then how that affects you in your life. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8459.699999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's yeah, we need it. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBNVGNY_FA&t=8463.42s)]
