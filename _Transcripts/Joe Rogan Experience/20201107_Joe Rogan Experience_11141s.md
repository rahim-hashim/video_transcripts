# Joe Rogan Experience #1560 - Mike Baker
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH4dl2coorM)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan Podcast by night, all day.
*  It's a walrus dick.
*  Fossilized walrus dick.
*  Somebody gave its thing.
*  It wasn't my idea.
*  I could have had that information before I picked it up.
*  Oh, sorry.
*  Check, check, check.
*  There we go.
*  There we go.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, Steve Rinella was here yesterday and I guess the technical term is bacula.
*  I didn't know it was called a bacula.
*  That's what it is though.
*  Dick bone.
*  I've got one at home.
*  I have a friend of mine who has been up in Alaska most of his life.
*  He sent this, it's not like this, it's like on this ornamental stand and it's polished
*  and it looks like a piece of ivory almost.
*  I was like, what the hell is this thing?
*  And you know, but it was great.
*  It was very nice.
*  It was a gift he sent.
*  I never thought to ask him what the hell it was.
*  A dick bone.
*  Yeah, until he came to visit one time.
*  Are we rolling?
*  Yeah, let's just keep it from here.
*  What type of animal was it?
*  Walrus bone.
*  A walrus.
*  Yeah, yeah, a walrus.
*  Same size as that?
*  No, no, this one was not as well endowed, but it's shinier, the one that I've got.
*  It's maybe it's older.
*  More polished.
*  So here we are, Mike Baker.
*  It is Friday.
*  The elections were Tuesday.
*  We still don't know who the new president is.
*  I guess I was having a conversation.
*  I forget who told this to me, but the Al Gore Bush election took 45 days to resolve.
*  I forgot that it was that long.
*  Remember, they didn't actually concede, I think, or whatever you want to call it, get
*  sort of the final count in until 12 or 13 December.
*  So Al Gore and his lawyers, the DNC, they carried that in 2000.
*  They carried that process out, and they were entitled to, just like in the current time,
*  if the current president of Trump wants to pursue remedies for what they perceive to
*  be irregularities, then that by law, you're entitled to do that.
*  Now, you don't want to get in the game of making spurious accusations and just throwing
*  shit at the wall and seeing what sticks, so it has to be based in something.
*  But this is not unprecedented, and so I think people need to keep that in mind.
*  I feel like there's part of me that feels like there's some fuckery afoot, for sure.
*  But there's also part of me that thinks that, and this is going to sound ridiculous, but
*  maybe for the psyche of the country, it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if Biden won.
*  Yeah, no, I see where you're going with it.
*  I don't, what's the word I'm looking for?
*  Don't disagree as long as that fuckery is properly investigated.
*  I think it's pretty sweet.
*  You got to be consistent.
*  With your fuckery?
*  With your fuckery.
*  If you've spent the past four years denying the results of the 2016 election, or chasing
*  the Russian collusion bullshit, or if you were in the media and you've been just throwing
*  that crap around about the Russian collusion and happily doing it, for the past four years
*  then you really don't have the moral high ground now to say that the other side can't
*  investigate, can't cry foul, can't say they've got concerns, and that we should just all,
*  as Nancy Pelosi says, we just have to unify now.
*  I mean, I love that.
*  Is that what she said?
*  Yeah, she came out today and it's just like, oh, the good thing is we just need to unify.
*  Under who?
*  Under you?
*  Under the president-elect, as she referred to him, or soon to be Joe Biden.
*  I see what you're saying.
*  I'm far more concerned because I like a divided government.
*  I wouldn't want to see one party, regardless of which party it is, have control of everything.
*  I always think that's when shit happens or things go wrong.
*  So I'd be fine.
*  The republic's going to survive just fine if, for instance, the senate remains in control
*  of the republicans.
*  The house, it's going to be tighter now.
*  Look, the House, Pelosi lost, conservatively, right now they're saying five seats, but there's
*  10 other seats leaning towards the republicans in a heavy way.
*  So she could have a 15 seat turnaround, 16 seat turnaround.
*  It's going to be a very thin majority that she's going to have, but that's fine.
*  So they've got the House, the GOP has the Senate, Biden, Harris, they win if they win.
*  Okay, we're going to be just fine.
*  My concern is the Senate.
*  If that tips over and the deciding vote is cast by Kamala Harris because it's 50-50,
*  then we got a problem.
*  I think the most fascinating thing about all of this, which is getting lost in the wash
*  because naturally we're all distracted with what's going on between Trump and Biden right
*  now, is those two Senate races in Georgia.
*  It's 48-48, likely we're getting Alaska and North Carolina wrapped up for the republican
*  side, they're going to end up at 50.
*  You got two seats left, and those are both in Georgia.
*  Those are both going to be runoffs basically in January sometime.
*  Because unless one of them hits the 50% threshold, if, what's his name, Purdue gets the 50% plus
*  one vote, okay, then now it's 51 to the republicans and they have control of the Senate still.
*  Otherwise, I think we got problems if the Dems end up with the White House, the Senate,
*  and Congress.
*  I'm just never comfortable with one party rule.
*  No, that sounds terrible.
*  Yeah.
*  By God, it does.
*  Well, it's just I've never paid attention to the Speaker of the House until it was Nancy
*  Pelosi.
*  And it seems like it's been Nancy Pelosi for 112 years.
*  Was it the Speaker of the House that was Dennis Hastert?
*  Is that the guy that we were talking about the other day that got arrested for molesting
*  kids?
*  Oh, Kid Tatcher, yeah.
*  Wasn't he the Speaker of the House?
*  Was he Speaker of the House?
*  I guess he was, yeah, for a period of time.
*  Was it?
*  Or minority leader.
*  That's crazy that that guy got to that position and wound up getting 15 months.
*  Here it is.
*  Is that only that?
*  From 1999 to 2007, so quite a while, eight fucking years.
*  The longest serving Republican Speaker of the House in history.
*  And he was a kid fucker.
*  And what was his sentence?
*  His sentence was only 15 months.
*  How does that work?
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  How does that work?
*  He knows where the bodies are buried.
*  That's how that works.
*  They're like, look, 15 months, it'll be gone before you know it.
*  Come on, Dennis.
*  It'll be gone before you know it.
*  Keep it secret, Dennis.
*  Oh, God.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Yeah.
*  But I think, look, my favorite, it's the irony, right?
*  It's a lack of self-awareness on both sides that I always find fascinating.
*  My favorite tweet so far since Tuesday, since the election day, was after, I think it came
*  out on Wednesday, some progressive tweeted, I think I'm almost getting it word for word,
*  Republicans are such sore fucking losers.
*  And I read it and I thought, well, this has got to be like a parody, right?
*  They got to be kidding around.
*  And so then you have to dig in there and investigate and read everything else they've been reading
*  or writing.
*  And you look and you realize, no, they're serious.
*  And then you read the thread after that and all the responses are like, oh, that's so
*  true that fuckers, they can't take a loss.
*  And you're thinking there is no fucking self-awareness on that side.
*  I have no respect for people that mass generalize entire political parties like that.
*  It's so stupid.
*  Republicans are such this.
*  Like, come on, just stop.
*  I know what you do.
*  You're just spitting out nonsense.
*  It's one thing if you want to say that.
*  I guess that is what you're saying on Twitter, though.
*  The problem is it's written down, right?
*  So you take it more seriously.
*  But if you're just having coffee with your friend and you're like, Republicans are such
*  fucking sore losers.
*  And like, yeah, right?
*  They would say they are, right?
*  But when you're saying it to the whole world, it's like you're allowing the whole world
*  to listen in on a conversation you have in Starbucks.
*  You got to be a little bit better at being self-aware and also recognizing that you spent
*  if you're a hardcore Democrat, you spent the last four years saying Russia got Trump into
*  power.
*  And even after the evidence comes out that that's not true, you're in denial of that
*  and never taking it back.
*  And you've got you've got different groups, right?
*  I mean, this is again, you're right.
*  This is this is on both sides.
*  This is right.
*  This is left.
*  This does it.
*  It's always, you know, they say, oh, that card, coffee went all over the place.
*  Yeah, but I caught it.
*  You did know.
*  It went over a little bit.
*  I caught it in mid spill.
*  Just leave some towels in here, buddy.
*  I always spill just some leave some towels and it's a lotion.
*  Yeah, we do a Zoom call.
*  How was that?
*  Not that crazy.
*  Wow.
*  Who thinks about doing that?
*  It's not just one person that's been busted doing that either.
*  It's quite a few.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what?
*  This shows you really how many men are addicted to pornography.
*  That's what it shows you.
*  How many men are addicted to masturbation and pornography?
*  So much so that while they're supposed to be working during the day, they can't help
*  themselves.
*  Yeah.
*  And you would think, though, yeah, I mean, it's that's that's a very good point.
*  It's just I'm just you're stunned by the idea that perhaps during a business Zoom call,
*  you could set that aside for the for that 30 minutes or so.
*  I mean, I wonder if they're still listening to the conversation and how does it not break
*  your concentration?
*  I don't know.
*  Some people find different things interesting.
*  So we're going to run through those second quarter numbers.
*  Oh, God.
*  I got to come to the second quarter numbers.
*  The logistical supply chain.
*  What is like the status right now?
*  It's like Pennsylvania.
*  So here we are.
*  First of all, it's Friday.
*  OK, the election was on Tuesday.
*  We're supposed to know who the president is.
*  How the fuck does an Alaska know?
*  I just read that Alaska only has 50 percent reported.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you know, it's a big space.
*  It's a big space.
*  It's a lot of distance for those sled dog teams to go with the ballots.
*  Is that what it is?
*  I well, no, I can't imagine that's what it is.
*  Right.
*  Someone up there is lazy.
*  I mean, it's but it is it is funny because, OK, look, if one side is winning two to one.
*  But there's 50 percent left.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't call it.
*  No, it's that is OK.
*  That's true.
*  But yeah.
*  So where we are is what the hell?
*  It's Friday and.
*  It looks like Pennsylvania is leaning towards Biden.
*  Yeah.
*  Georgia's leaning towards Biden.
*  It's basically over for Trump.
*  You would I mean, if you look at it, you don't see a lot of avenues for success on this one.
*  I mean, look, Pennsylvania, they're still saying rightly so.
*  It's too close to call.
*  They've got eight thousand some odd military absentee ballots still to count.
*  The assumption would be just like they just.
*  Those would be for Trump, just like they assume a lot of the mail in ballots in the Philadelphia
*  area or Allegheny or it will be for Biden.
*  But they have to go through that process.
*  Now that Pennsylvania is an interesting one.
*  I mean, again, there's a lot of people that are that are getting very pissy about Trump's
*  attitude towards this whole thing.
*  And could he be more eloquent?
*  Could he just shut the fuck up and let the system work?
*  Right.
*  Let his legal teams do what they're supposed to do and what they're entitled to do and
*  just say, you know, we just have to work through the process.
*  Well, yeah, he could. Of course he could.
*  But he's not going to.
*  But Pennsylvania is interesting because the the the problem up there.
*  And maybe there's no fucking fraud.
*  You have to it's like an investigation.
*  Right. When you do an investigation, you have to base it on right from the very beginning.
*  You have to base it on facts, on something concrete.
*  If you don't, you're building an entire investigation potentially on on very shaky ground.
*  The whole thing comes tumbling down and it's a house of shit.
*  So, you know, it's like it's like an operation, Intel operation.
*  Everybody remembers, maybe not the WMD fiasco from Iraq.
*  The idea that, oh, my God, we got to get in there because they got WMD.
*  Well, a lot of that was was based on one source reporting, right, which got into the reporting
*  chain and then got reinvented in another report and then got self corroborated.
*  Another reporting. And before you know it, you're confirming all the same information
*  from originally that one source.
*  Right. Very shaky.
*  So you're not building a an invasion of a country on on solid information.
*  So with Pennsylvania, if people are looking at that and going, oh, there's all sorts of
*  shit going on and it's fraud.
*  Well, you got to step back and get to say, OK, where are the problems?
*  Now there's a handful of issues that I think are legitimate in Pennsylvania, one of them
*  being this idea that the state Supreme Court circumvented what the legislative branch
*  in Pennsylvania said about ballots.
*  And when you can count the ballots up until what time the postmarking on the ballots.
*  And and so that's a legitimate issue that probably or could end up in a higher court
*  is did the state Supreme Court in Pennsylvania have that right, according to the Constitution,
*  to just because the state houses in each state set the laws about this very thing.
*  And you got a problem, though, in Pennsylvania because the state house is run by Republicans.
*  Now, this bullshit about how long it's taking to count the votes could have been sorted
*  out if a year ago or not even that, if six months ago when we knew this pandemic was
*  was a problem, when we knew we were going to get unprecedented levels of mail in votes,
*  if the Republican state house had said, OK, here's when we can start counting those mail
*  in votes soon as we start receiving them.
*  How about that?
*  So they could have been well ahead.
*  So it's both both sides have fucked this up.
*  It's not one side or the other.
*  Both sides.
*  Once again, both.
*  You know, it's you know, the the the truth is always you know, we talked about this before
*  is always somewhere in the center.
*  And that's that's true here.
*  But anyway, Pennsylvania close to call, you know, this idea that they're they're preventing
*  observers from coming in or standing close enough because they allowed them in.
*  But then, you know, were they able to stand close enough to observe anything of any value?
*  That should never be in question.
*  So they let them in.
*  Is this all been corroborated?
*  This is proven.
*  They let them in, but they wouldn't let them actually observe what they were doing.
*  There was delays in some districts, right?
*  Some because counties run these elections.
*  And so some counties do it by the book and others apparently have decided they can do
*  things a little bit differently.
*  So some they were not able to get in as far as access goes as you know, once the voting
*  started, some they weren't able to go in for the pre vote counting or the pre pre voting
*  day counting of these ballots.
*  And others, they were able to go in and they were kept maybe 25 feet back instead of what
*  apparently was like a six feet distance that had been I think I'm not don't quote me on
*  this, but maybe responsibly decided that you could be six feet away.
*  How could you read it 25 feet away?
*  That seems insane.
*  Exactly.
*  Some places had them watching on monitors, which again is useless.
*  But so in those, the problem there is that should never happen.
*  You should be able to always agree both sides that you need campaign observers in there
*  and they have that right to observe the counting of these things.
*  And it all comes down to the same issue, whether it's that or whether it's you know, counting
*  ballots because you know, or discarding ballots because the person's died previous to the
*  election.
*  It all comes down to the perception of fraud.
*  There may not be anything going on in this election in terms of fraud, fraudulent activity
*  when it when when all is said and done, all the investigations are done.
*  But the damage is already done because people perceive it as possible.
*  A lot of people perceive it as likely or as happening.
*  And if you don't have a transparent system set up, right, that is easy to see.
*  You've got to be able to look at it and not be told by politicians and not be told by
*  election officials or the media that it's a good credible system.
*  The voter has to be able to look at the process and say, yeah, that's fair and transparent.
*  It's like cover for action.
*  If I'm doing a if I'm doing surveillance on some target, right, and I'm out in the
*  middle of some, whether it's a shithole or whether it's, you know, an urban center in
*  a developed country, I have to have cover for action.
*  I have to have a reason that is plainly obvious by passerbys or by local authorities or police
*  that patrol the area.
*  Oh, I get it.
*  That's why he's there.
*  We did an op one time where it was overseas.
*  We were waiting for a target to to show up and it was it was a port, right.
*  And a lot busy, a lot of people coming and going tourists, workers, commercial workers,
*  everybody coming and going from this busy port.
*  And you know, what you didn't have is you didn't have a lot of people just hanging out,
*  right.
*  There weren't a lot of opportunities to hang out.
*  So you had to have a reason, right.
*  So what do you do?
*  You set somebody down there with a couple of pieces of luggage and a baby stroller and
*  a baby.
*  Don't ask me where I get the baby from.
*  And you just stole a baby.
*  You know, hey, it's for the good of the country.
*  And we requisitioned it.
*  We got it. We have a we have a baby requisition department down in the basement of the agency.
*  No, we don't. No, no.
*  It's my own baby.
*  Actually, it's my daughter when she was a little baby.
*  You used your own daughter during a covert operation.
*  Why is that wrong?
*  I don't think so. No, I mean, I'm just curious.
*  Yeah. And so it didn't work like a charm because
*  they could sit there for hours, right, waiting theoretically for a boat, but obviously pulling
*  surveillance from an observation post and people walking by were like, yeah, there's
*  a there's, you know, some lady with a baby, you know, suitcases to cover for action.
*  They did.
*  They they they whacked it.
*  An industrialist in Germany one time where the the hit team, it was very elaborate, but
*  they they did what they always do.
*  They surveil.
*  They figure out the guy's routes.
*  And as is usual, your your choke points, you know, that's what they're looking for.
*  Where does that work?
*  You know, you get in a vehicle and you drive, you're going to have choke points.
*  Usually it's at the place of work or it's at your home.
*  Right.
*  But it may be somewhere in between.
*  Maybe there's a there's an avenue that's always, you know, blocked up.
*  Maybe there's a turn that they have to come to a complete stop.
*  You're looking for that choke point where you can lay out the attack, where you control
*  the environment.
*  There was a place in the Philippines that still exists.
*  We used to call it Ambush Alley, right, because you'd start at one end, you go to the other
*  and it was it was a cut through.
*  There weren't that very many of them.
*  And sometimes it was the only one to get from one part of the city to another.
*  And once you got in there, you know, you just hit the gas because you were a host.
*  If you got caught up in there and there was an insurgency going on.
*  And so, you know, roadblocks and local hit teams, they call them sparrow units, were
*  always a concern.
*  And so that was that was a choke point.
*  Ambush Alley was a choke point.
*  Anyway, long story short, they whacked us industrialists, but the hit team,
*  after they'd done the surveillance and they decided where that point was for the attack,
*  they showed up one day in construction gear and construction uniforms and started digging
*  a trench as a construction team.
*  You can look that you drive by, you go out there building something or they're digging
*  a trench. Right. It's cover for action.
*  And so it's I don't know how I'm making this analogy, but it's the same with the election.
*  Voters got to be able to look at it and go, it's transparent.
*  I see why it's transparent.
*  I can move on. You're talking about fuckery.
*  Yeah. You're talking about them.
*  They did a bad job of hiding.
*  Corruption. That's what you're saying.
*  You say cover for action.
*  Yeah. Is your it's deceptive.
*  Like you're what you're describing is deceptive.
*  Well, what I'm saying is the system has to be clearly
*  transparent and honest, incredible by just from the voters perspective.
*  You can't do shit like adjust the rules about just because we say, oh, pandemic.
*  Now we've got to change the rules.
*  And these states are going to change them.
*  These states won't. And the state has.
*  How did you make the connection from that to cover for action?
*  You know, because I know.
*  Because you think like an operative.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Cover for action is because because I know this is this is, yeah.
*  Try being in my house and try being part of my family and following me at the dinner table.
*  It's because with cover of action, just like with looking at the voting and saying,
*  OK, I see why it's transparent. I see cover action.
*  You got to look and go, OK, I get it.
*  That's what they're there for. And you move on.
*  You don't you don't you don't think about it. You don't have to be told.
*  You know, you don't have to stop and go, excuse me, what are you doing here?
*  Right. It's just evident on the face of it.
*  How are there not universal voting rules for each state that are federal?
*  How is how is it that different states are allowed to come up with their own rules?
*  Like like I was reading something about in Georgia,
*  they were allowing people who had made mistakes on their ballots to redo their ballots.
*  And they they called them curing the ballots.
*  Yeah. Yeah. You've got that.
*  You've also got is that you've got the ability to change your vote, too, in some places.
*  What? Yeah. You can change your vote up until you know,
*  up until the deadline of the election day.
*  There are some places where you can you can go in, you have to request it
*  and then you have to and then you can change your vote,
*  which, if you think about it, is not bad, because if on election day
*  you wake up and you find out that the candidate you voted for is committed murder,
*  then you think, OK, I'd like to change my vote.
*  Well, I think a lot of people did want to actually change their vote
*  after the second Biden debate.
*  That was a big Google search.
*  There was a thing that they were talking about, the Google searches for how to change your vote.
*  Went up some astounding number.
*  Yeah. Because he just had a really terrible debate.
*  No one has done worse on the campaign trail and won.
*  That's I agree with it. And more people vote.
*  Yeah. In this election than have ever voted.
*  Yeah. So it's like the 1900 early 1900s or something.
*  Kamala Harris, I don't think maybe I'm wrong on this, but I think, you know,
*  we should fact check this.
*  But I don't think she held a press conference during the entire campaign.
*  I don't think she had one single press conference.
*  She had appearances.
*  But I don't think she actually held a press conference during the entire campaign.
*  That's astounding. Right.
*  But yeah, I agree.
*  This. But.
*  We're we're in this position that we're in right now in a variety of ways
*  and because of the pandemic, for sure.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  So and also because the people that hate Trump really hate him.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Like, I don't remember.
*  I remember people not liking George Bush and maybe even hating him.
*  W and even HW.
*  But not like this.
*  This is a different level of hate.
*  But also it's a different level of love.
*  They love him in a way that I don't ever remember seeing.
*  I don't remember seeing like, yeah, these fucking lines of cars
*  that are miles long honking with signs for any other candidate other than Trump.
*  No. Well, people used to go crazy over Millard Fillmore.
*  I remember that. That was.
*  Who knows that?
*  They love Fillmore.
*  No, I don't.
*  You're joking. I am joking.
*  That's a terrible joke.
*  I just went with it.
*  Maybe Ross Perot. People were really into Perot.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  But but those are the same people that are now into QAnon.
*  It's like, yeah, somebody sent me a video.
*  I went down to a QAnon rabbit hole last night of how Trump is set up
*  all the Dems and this is a sting operation and that there's
*  gotta forget what they were saying, that this is all all of the ballots
*  that are being sent out.
*  This is all all of the ballots have been blockchained and.
*  Yeah. You heard this, Jamie? Yeah.
*  I had to dig this up last night.
*  It's been going on for two years, apparently.
*  I'm like, pop back up this week.
*  But the conversation that these two guys were having about it was like
*  people that are really into comic books talking about their favorite characters.
*  It's it's it's so weird because it's it's clearly and this is not to disparage
*  people that think there's something illegitimate about this election.
*  This is not what I'm talking about.
*  What I'm talking about people that are in the certain conspiracy
*  theories and QAnon is one of them where they it it becomes a thing they're into,
*  whether it's real or not, it's a thing they're into.
*  It's like you're in a club. Yes.
*  Yes. And they're all in on this thing.
*  And they're constantly tuning into this thing to find out what the latest is.
*  It's almost like a serial show that you're reading about on message boards.
*  You know, it's like it's like he's making these little drops of information
*  of what's going to happen.
*  And then some people are experts on these drops.
*  It's like a Ponzi scheme.
*  You bring your friends in and then you're you're a little bit higher up the chain
*  and QAnon, and so you know a little bit more and you've got more friends within it.
*  But it is it is it's it's strange.
*  It is it is strange.
*  And I mean, look, it's it's it's this has surfaced a lot of weird
*  behavior and groups over the the past four years.
*  And look at the I mean, you've got all these various elements.
*  You've got the their resistance.
*  You've got the never Trumpers.
*  You got this this group, the the Lincoln Project.
*  Right. And those guys, if anyone scored big out of this whole,
*  you know, four year run and, you know, particularly this past year,
*  it's got to be those guys.
*  Right. I'd love to see the Lincoln Project.
*  Well, there are some guys that they claim to be, you know,
*  Republicans, conservatives and oh, my God, we're horrified
*  at the state of the Republican Party.
*  And so, you know, we've we've set our line in the sand and the never Trumpers,
*  basically. And so we're going to we're going to raise a lot of money
*  and we're going to fight this thing and we're going to make sure that we fight
*  for all the the the Democratic candidates.
*  And we're going to get we're going to get Trump out of there.
*  And and yeah, of course, we're conservatives and Republicans.
*  And we're going to do this
*  because, hey, look, they didn't get jobs in the administration.
*  Right. And so I have a feeling that part of this started
*  when they didn't get enough hugs.
*  Right. And they didn't get what they wanted out of this.
*  Part of it, maybe, is they're actually legitimately, you know,
*  upset with with the administration over certain things.
*  But I can't help but think I can't help but think that they just raised a lot of money.
*  I'd love to see, you know, how you do with charities.
*  You look and see what their what their spend is, how much of it
*  goes to administration for the project and how much of it actually goes
*  and be used for things like actual ads.
*  I'd love to see how much money got ended up in their pockets,
*  because I guarantee you, once this is over, if Biden wins,
*  they'll somehow morph into something that now makes money
*  by fighting some of the policies that the Biden White House wants to push out there.
*  It just seems it seems so.
*  But there's a lot of groups like that that have come out.
*  A lot of people, you know, spouting their self-righteousness over
*  over, you know, the the idea that Trump's a terrible person.
*  I don't think he's a great person. Right.
*  But we've talked about this before.
*  You know, I don't think you need to actually like your president.
*  You know, you need to like your policies and the operations that, you know,
*  that we're doing overseas and the things that we do.
*  Would I prefer a kinder, gentler, more eloquent?
*  Good. Yeah. I don't know.
*  It's all touchy feely, but I like the policies.
*  Did I dislike Trump enough, right, to vote for the potential policies
*  that are coming down the pike with a Biden White House
*  and a Senate possibly controlled by the Democrats?
*  No. But, you know, then again, I voted for Kanye.
*  So what do I know?
*  That's why like figureheads are weird.
*  Right. Because a figurehead could be polarizing.
*  They could be they could be someone that people love no matter what they do.
*  And they could be someone that people hate no matter what they do.
*  And that's where it gets strange where policies and the direction of a government
*  is attached to an individual personality.
*  Yeah. And we've definitely seen this more.
*  Like you said, it's it's got that, you know, it's a lot of people on the left
*  will say it's got that cultish feel.
*  And because they he does draw this
*  this the animosity from the left, obviously.
*  But yeah, it's just it's just bizarre devotion.
*  Oh, yeah. That you get.
*  And and I think it's it's it's not necessarily a lot of the folks
*  aren't necessarily, you know, devoted to Trump.
*  It's not like it's not that it's not a Jim Jones thing as much as they're devoted
*  to the idea of of waving the flag of standing up for America,
*  which is all good shit. Right.
*  But you got to you got to keep it in.
*  You got to keep it in perspective.
*  And I just think we're we've we've lost perspective on a lot in a lot of things.
*  I mean, you know, you talk to somebody on the left and they'll say,
*  oh, my God, it's the death of the republic we've been facing for the past four years.
*  It's the toughest time we've ever seen.
*  And you think, oh, I settle down.
*  Yeah. And then you just go to the right.
*  And they're like, oh, my God, if they if Biden wins, you know, we're fucked.
*  And settle down. Yeah, exactly.
*  Except settle, settle down. Everybody, everybody.
*  So the lockdown. Right.
*  Settle down. Get into the center.
*  I definitely don't.
*  I like a good left, right, left, right.
*  I like that. I like I like when the country goes left and the country goes right.
*  I just think gives everybody a chance.
*  Settles everybody down.
*  And it also gives everybody a much clearer understanding of the reality
*  of what it means to have someone as a president.
*  How much does it actually affect your day to day life?
*  And what really affects your day to day life is what we were talking about earlier,
*  the actual policies, whether Trump's an asshole or not.
*  The real problem with having an asshole for a president is it encourages other
*  assholes to be assholes.
*  And this is the first time there's ever been a president that actually encouraged
*  assholishness.
*  But I mean, he came out yet last night, this press conference, which, you know,
*  a lot of people were horrified by and then, you know, a lot of people
*  get on the right kind of cheered.
*  And I think his first sentence out of the gate
*  in the midst of all this sort of concern and chaos and the angst from everybody
*  is was, look, if you just count the legal votes, I have won easily.
*  OK, all right.
*  You know what?
*  Yeah, it's not necessary.
*  You don't have to do that.
*  You can say, you know, this is still being contested.
*  Yeah.
*  We're doing, you know, that doesn't.
*  Yeah, that doesn't help anybody.
*  We're concerned about some potential irregularities, but don't just start
*  throwing shit at the wall because it demeans the whole process.
*  And that's so anyway.
*  And that's where it all falls apart.
*  People start losing that credibility or that belief in the system.
*  And then again, if you've spent four years
*  attacking the credibility of the system by saying it was the Russians
*  that put him in there, right?
*  And then talking about all this other shit about, oh, he may never leave.
*  And, you know, he's and they were accusing him over the past couple of years.
*  I'll bet he's going to try to steal the election. Right.
*  And so now when the other side's like, ah, we were kind of concerned
*  about some of the things we're seeing, they're like, oh, for fuck's sake.
*  Don't be. Can't we just all get along?
*  Is anybody accusing the Republicans of voter fraud in the states that Trump won?
*  Yeah, that's a good question.
*  I have not seen anything really.
*  I haven't seen that either. How come? Yeah.
*  You know, probably because those states don't matter.
*  I hate to say it that way, but I know.
*  But talking about Texas.
*  Well, you're in Texas. Texas mattered.
*  Are you kidding me? Right. But Texas matter. Trump won Texas.
*  Is there any talk of.
*  But the expectation was was that he would, even though there was this talk about it,
*  there's going to be this, you know, I. Right.
*  Like no one's talking about voter fraud in California for Biden.
*  Right. Right.
*  Or, you know, it's oh, my God, he's, you know, there's something
*  hinky is going on in Mississippi. Right.
*  So it's that doesn't happen.
*  But I think like the polls got it all wrong.
*  The only time the pundits were right, I think, is when they were citing that,
*  look, it's going to come down to a handful of important states.
*  And they usually would cite Pennsylvania and Georgia and Florida and Florida, Arizona.
*  So they got that right.
*  Everything else they got wrong again.
*  But I look, I.
*  Again, if whether there is or isn't, if you've got legitimate grievance,
*  if you've got potential evidence and you look at a place like Nevada
*  and if you've got Nevada, Nevada, Nevada, if you've got a few thousand ballots
*  that are in question because it appears that either they weren't residents
*  of the state or perhaps they died some time ago.
*  That's not true. Well, it's going on right now.
*  That's what they're claiming.
*  That's what they're claiming.
*  Who's they? The Republican Party.
*  And they filed a suit and they've submitted documentation,
*  supposedly to the DOJ about these ballots.
*  But I guess my point is whether it is or isn't, if that's that's
*  potentially a legitimate concern, it's not going to turn things.
*  It's not going to change anything.
*  It's not going to it's the vote counts not going to be big enough
*  to change Nevada's decision likely.
*  So the numbers of if there is fraud, the numbers are not enough
*  to be relevant to the overall count. Right.
*  Which is the which is the issue in most of these places.
*  Look, you're not really going to overturn a hundred thousand votes now.
*  And it's not going to happen in Philadelphia if you say, OK, we're going to
*  you know, we're going to we're going to toss out these seven hundred ballots
*  or whatever.
*  What but I think it is important, again, going back to this idea
*  that you've got to maintain faith in the system by showing people that it's credible.
*  Right. So if there are irregularities, just like the Dems did in 2000
*  and just like in other elections, it's not uncommon at all
*  to have a contested election result in this country.
*  The law accounts for it.
*  And so go after that, explain what you're doing, be transparent
*  what you're doing, and then for fuck's sake, learn from it for the next one around.
*  Right. Make these changes.
*  And maybe this was an anomaly because of the pandemic.
*  And we're never, ever going to see this many mail in ballots again.
*  I just find it hilarious whenever I say that people should be able to vote online
*  because you could bank online like, no, there's too much room for fraud
*  as opposed to what stacks of paper that people can count.
*  The fuck are you talking about?
*  It seems like you can get a code that is unique to you, like a QR code
*  or some biometric code that's based on your face time or your fingerprint.
*  If you have an Android phone and it will 100 percent prove that it's you.
*  Yeah. And you can fucking vote off your phone.
*  Yeah. Like that seems pretty easy to me. I don't get it.
*  We should be able to come up with a better system.
*  And and you're right.
*  You know, the problem with this was, again, it wasn't explained well enough.
*  Right. And so you have the perception, whether it's existing,
*  whether it's happening or not, you have this perception of fraud.
*  Look, I mean, you've got and social media just just just pumps the shit out of this
*  and causes this problem in a major way.
*  You've got these videos now that are floating around
*  Twitter and elsewhere of of ballot workers
*  working at polling stations, filling out, right, filling out ballots.
*  And so they'll they'll just like lock in.
*  They'll take 10 seconds of somebody taking an empty ballot,
*  stamping it, filling it out, and then putting it in the box
*  and taking another one, stamping it, filling it out.
*  And and people will go, oh, my God, they're falsifying ballots.
*  They're just creating ballots out of whole cloth.
*  And then that'll blast around.
*  And before you know it, you got like, you know, 100000 people retweeting
*  this bullshit without investigating it.
*  Going back to what I said before, you you can't just you can't build
*  your argument on on shit.
*  You know, now, if that's a problem, fine, investigate it.
*  But you also have to look at what are the other scenarios.
*  Well, maybe these are all ballots that wouldn't fit through the scanner
*  or that, you know, got kicked out.
*  And so now what do they got to do?
*  They got to put them onto a new ballot, run it through or whatever.
*  I mean, that happens. Right.
*  That's that's a thing. I don't understand what you're saying.
*  If someone is right, is the person in front of them
*  who filled out the ballot with them? No.
*  OK, so someone fills out a ballot and there's an issue with that ballot.
*  Then you allow a worker to to make a copy of that ballot
*  with under observation, under observation by who?
*  Campaign, which I'm not polling.
*  That's the thing, though, like, is it a republic?
*  If it's if he's filling it out for Republicans, a Democrat over his shoulder
*  to make making sure that's to have one of each one of each.
*  You're supposed to have both parties have the ability to drive in Ferraris
*  afterwards. Yeah.
*  No, I said so I guess my point is whether it's that or this,
*  you can't just you can't just assume that the shit that you see
*  we should how do we not know this right by now?
*  The shit that you see on social media, you should probably question it
*  and at least do your own research and find out whether it's true
*  before you then kick it back out or talk about it like it's gospel.
*  Here's what I'm ready to talk about, like it's gospel.
*  You know, have no evidence whatsoever because people keep saying it to me
*  over and over again in Wisconsin of one hundred thousand votes
*  came in for Biden overnight and they were one hundred percent for Biden.
*  They were for no one else.
*  Is that true?
*  You know what I'm talking about? No, I've heard that.
*  I've heard that. I don't know whether it's true or not.
*  Sounds like a QAnon video. Yeah, it does. It does.
*  I mean, they've got the block chain.
*  Don't worry.
*  Statistically, it would seem surprising.
*  I mean, you got 89 percent or 90 percent voter turnout in particular areas.
*  You think that's pretty damn high.
*  But and again, those are the things that find
*  let the let the system work, let the let the legal teams do it
*  because they're citing it. They're right.
*  But they think it's too late.
*  The issue is, you know, like I was talking to someone
*  who understands these things very well, and they were describing it to me that
*  when the 2000 election came along with Bush and Gore, that Bush had
*  fantastic lawyers like the cream of the crop
*  and that that is not the case right now with this
*  this scenario where they're dealing with legal fraud or the potential for fraud.
*  I don't know. I would I would say no.
*  Joe Biden did not get 100 percent.
*  Who made this?
*  Jamie Snopes, no Milwaukee more communist bullshit.
*  Is this from Vox? Yes.
*  Yeah, it's Milwaukee News.
*  They're probably communists.
*  I'm sure this is fucking local Milwaukee.
*  Get out of here.
*  No, Joe Biden did not.
*  I read that.
*  Percent of all Milwaukee absentee ballots.
*  Yeah, but that's not what I'm saying.
*  That's not what the the claim was.
*  The claim was a bunch came overnight and that they were 100 percent for Biden.
*  So that could still be true.
*  And they could still say that he did not get 100 percent of all absentee ballots.
*  Because that's not what the claim was.
*  So that that that communist newspaper that you just read from
*  don't hate America.
*  Don't move it yet. Look over there.
*  The federalists. Yes.
*  This is the headline. Yes.
*  Democrats are trying to steal the election in Michigan and Wisconsin.
*  OK, read the federalists, because those are good Americans. Yeah.
*  This is today's video.
*  Well, that's what was supposed to be happening.
*  As of this writing, it appears that the Democratic Party
*  machines in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, trying to steal the election
*  as reporters and commentators went to bed early Tuesday morning.
*  All three states were too close to call.
*  But President Trump led former Vice President Joe Biden by comfortable margins
*  far beyond what had been predicted in the polls.
*  None of the networks called these states because enough mail in ballots
*  remained uncounted that it could swing either way.
*  But Trump's position looked good.
*  But here's what's wrong with that.
*  And this is what Kyle Kalinsky explained to us that mail in ballots
*  were overwhelmingly Democrat because Democrats tend to be pussies
*  who are scared to go there in person because they don't want to get coughs.
*  Is that correct?
*  So he said there's also something I was hearing that I made that a Republican
*  like no one even cares.
*  They all wanted to push for one day.
*  They wanted to do it all in one day.
*  They didn't want to vote early.
*  It's like a sense of pride type thing.
*  Well, Trump did, you know, make a big deal about telling his supporters
*  show up on the day. Right.
*  I'm a voting person kind of guy.
*  I have my old school. I like that I show up.
*  You do that. Someone that did.
*  It feels good.
*  Someone announces, yeah, Mike Baker has voted, you know, and you get your sticker.
*  I was going to put my sticker and take a picture, but I'm like, no.
*  Once Chelsea Handler put them on her tits, I'm like, we're done here.
*  Yeah, nobody wanted that.
*  Nobody sees she.
*  She put them as pasties.
*  It's creative move.
*  It gets people to pay attention.
*  So this what? Yeah.
*  I'm sorry. I was joking around about the federalists.
*  But this so with with where this guy go back to that article,
*  because what this guy is getting wrong is that yes,
*  Trump had a lead, but they were counting the in-person votes first
*  and then they count the mail in votes.
*  The mail in votes were already overwhelmingly slanted towards Democrats
*  because some of these states and again, some of them with Republican
*  state houses, you know, that that was the regulation or the law
*  that they put in place was that you can't count those votes early.
*  The mail ins, I mean, you can't vote them early.
*  So so yeah, people would part of the problem was people went to bed
*  on Tuesday night thinking, well, look at this. Trump's going to.
*  Right. And it's like going to bed because you think the game's all locked up.
*  Exactly. You wake up in the morning.
*  You know, you got you got screwed like that.
*  Super Bowl a few years ago when they won it in the last.
*  Yes. So when I left, I left the Super Bowl party.
*  I was like, let's get the fuck out of here.
*  Games over.
*  They won. Yeah, they won it over time.
*  The the thing about all this stuff is that people want the narrative
*  to fit with how they feel it should have gone.
*  So they feel it should have gone to Trump.
*  So someone's trying to steal the election. Right.
*  Instead of no, they're counting mail in ballots later.
*  There is a weird thing with like the Democrats wanting mail in ballots.
*  It's almost like wanting to mail them in
*  is also sort of a political statement
*  in regards to the handling of the pandemic by the Republican president.
*  This is the same people that have like their fucking Twitter profile picture
*  with a mask on. Hey, stop.
*  Yeah, it's just stop.
*  It's my mask of righteousness.
*  You're you got a selfie with a mask on.
*  Fuck you. You know what you're doing.
*  That's a weird political statement. Yeah.
*  I guess weird. I don't mean it's like you.
*  I say I'm getting aggressive.
*  I didn't mean it. I'm just being silly.
*  People think I'm serious sometimes. I have to be careful.
*  No, but it's.
*  But he said, fuck people wear masks.
*  He's an anti-masker.
*  Anti-maskers, a new thing, I think.
*  Yeah, I got to tell you, I look, I think it's it's a simple thing.
*  Put on a mask. But you're right.
*  There are people who wear it proudly, like the early days of adopting
*  and driving a Prius. Right.
*  They're doing it.
*  I've seen people do podcasts with a mask on.
*  Fuck you.
*  And he doesn't mean that. He just.
*  I do mean that for podcasters.
*  I do mean that, especially when they're doing it by themselves.
*  There's no one in the room. You got a mask on.
*  I've seen that.
*  Or there's someone in other rooms nowhere near you and you're wearing a mask.
*  It's a political statement.
*  It's a thing. You're showing that you are a responsible person.
*  It's a way of flying your flag of virtue.
*  I am wearing a mask.
*  I'm not one of those.
*  Like if you see those people that get in fights at Wal-Mart,
*  they don't want to wear your infringement on my freedoms.
*  It's always the worst fucking human beings.
*  The the people that represent not wearing a mask are never
*  exemplary, like scholarly, brilliant people who are like, well,
*  the reality is about virus particles and the size of these particles.
*  It's preposterous.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  Also, I've been tested and it's my.
*  You have a very strict testing regime here.
*  You probably you guys probably tested more, frankly, than anybody else.
*  Dude, I was tested last night and then I got tested again this morning.
*  So I was tested last night at the governor's mansion.
*  Oh, I met the governor.
*  I got with the governor.
*  That's good news.
*  Governor Abbott's a cool guy.
*  He's like a legitimately nice guy.
*  I really enjoyed his company.
*  I like him a lot.
*  And then I got tested again this morning.
*  I get tested all the time, constantly.
*  But that's why we wear no masks and we could talk shit.
*  Yeah. And when young Jamie fucked off because he decided to go party,
*  he was he was at a disco.
*  What? He was at a disco screaming, screaming.
*  He was raving. I think he was at a rave and a roller derby.
*  We should actually clarify this, because if it was a disco,
*  we need to talk about that more.
*  No, we went to a bar and he was on a patio and he got the vid.
*  And so he but he was, you know, you were barely sick or sick for a day.
*  When you came in, he was really convinced that it was some sort of allergy.
*  When did you? So how long did you have before you got tested?
*  Well, we tested him.
*  I was off. But no, we were off that week.
*  Oh, yeah. So it was quite a while.
*  So there was a week where I was elk hunting.
*  So we were we were gone.
*  And Jamie probably got it the weekend
*  I left and didn't feel bad until three or four days later.
*  And then by the time we came in, it was a good seven days.
*  Right. Something like that.
*  Yeah. I didn't even feel sick when that day I was like, yeah.
*  He tested positive.
*  I don't think so. I mean, it's hard to tell.
*  It's hot as shit here.
*  I was worried, though, that we were going to have to shut.
*  That was true. It is hot as shit.
*  I was worried that we're going to have to shut the show down.
*  But the doctor informed me that since I never was really close to him,
*  he we made him sit in the corner like a dunce.
*  And after we found out that he had the cooties and we tested him again,
*  he failed the second test.
*  But did you think about firing him at that point?
*  No, fuck.
*  That's it. You're done.
*  No way. I could have caught it, too.
*  Listen, I was just in I was in D.C.
*  We're filming for a discovery series called What on Earth? Right.
*  And these guys, the film crew for this series is usually from England.
*  And they quarantine people. Oh, my God.
*  Oh, yeah. Go through the protocols. Right.
*  Yeah. I mean, listen, I believe I understand how they would do that
*  for a film or production, but for a podcast like it goes on all year.
*  There's no way I can tell people what to do with their life,
*  especially when I go to restaurants and stuff and I wear a mask.
*  I joke around about mask.
*  People like, you're over. He's an anti-masker.
*  I wear a mask every fucking day. I wear it all the time.
*  But I think I do think there's something silly about it.
*  Yeah. Well, again, it makes look, it's like a lot of things in life, right?
*  It makes you feel like you're doing something. It makes you feel good.
*  It makes other people feel comfortable. That's why I wear it.
*  Exactly. I'm the same way.
*  I think like it's a it's a little thing.
*  If other people have do I think it's necessarily going to stop?
*  And I know, but I'm happy to do it because it makes other people,
*  you know, comfortable.
*  I think some of the virus must like we're virologists. I know.
*  Some of the virus is stopped by that mask. It has to be.
*  There's a filter. It's not.
*  I mean, some of it can get out.
*  And so if someone gets a smaller dose of the virus,
*  it's probably less detrimental to their health.
*  That's probably the argument for it.
*  You know, someone told me that being on a plane is actually very safe
*  because the way they filter the air.
*  It's true. I felt ever since I've been flying for a while.
*  I've been back and forth to London and traveling around out to Los Angeles.
*  You go to London right now. Yeah.
*  When did they open that up?
*  Well, not right now.
*  Now they shut it down until the second of December again. Right.
*  This is their second hardcore lockdown.
*  Some parts of England were under what they call a tier three up, like North
*  and Manchester, that area.
*  But so now, you know, now it's a it's problematic.
*  And I know Greece was allowing American travelers for a while.
*  Get this China. China has banned visitors from England.
*  China. Yeah. Chinese. Oh, my God.
*  No, you guys are. What about America? Too infectious.
*  No, no, no, that might be a bridge too far for G.
*  But he's OK with banning the UK residents.
*  But anyway, but I did to your point, I felt,
*  you know, for quite a while now, the safest place to be is on a plane.
*  I got I got on a plane coming from Heathrow to New York City
*  a handful of weeks ago.
*  And there were, I don't know, six or seven other people on this plane.
*  It's a big plane. Right.
*  And there was almost nobody on the thing.
*  Do they allow people to take their mask off while they eat?
*  They do. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And you have to take it off like Governor Newsom style.
*  Take it off in between bites and put it back on.
*  That's what I want you to do. I saw that.
*  That's fantastic. I use. Yeah. He's a gem. Yeah.
*  Yeah. He's he's he's doing wonders out there in California.
*  He's a gem of preposterousness. Yeah.
*  But no, no, you can you can actually remove your mask.
*  You can wear it as a one ear earring hanging dangling from your ear.
*  It's a new fashion statement. It is.
*  It is a fact. I saw a lot of people wear them in between the between meals.
*  They put it on their wrist
*  like while they're while they're eating, they'll put it on their wrist
*  and they put it back on their face. That's a new thing.
*  It is amazing how we've we've it's become normal.
*  I was thinking about that yesterday, walking around the airport, looking around.
*  And yeah, quick. And people.
*  And it used to be right that if you saw this is going to sound wrong.
*  But if you saw someone wearing a mask, it was probably somebody from from Japan
*  or Korea or so. Yeah. Right.
*  I mean, it was like that because it's a little more common over there.
*  Or someone trying to rob somebody. Well, there's that. Yeah. Yeah.
*  What was the last time you walked into a bank wearing a mask?
*  You know, what's weird is how many people can recognize you with a mask on.
*  Isn't that weird? Yeah.
*  So you I mean, people have actually done that with you.
*  They said, dude, mask on hat sunglasses.
*  You are you're ready to jack a car in that situation. Yeah.
*  Hey, but there'll be some but there'll be some fan.
*  Yeah, the police won't have any clue who it was, but there'll be some fan.
*  They go, that's Joe. Yeah.
*  Yeah, I don't.
*  Again, I I'm confused over.
*  I will say there's a class of mask wearers I'm confused over.
*  Those are the ones who are you'll see are in their car
*  by themselves driving with a mask on.
*  And I'll look over. You shouldn't be allowed to vote.
*  Yeah, you should be. I mean, if you're driving in your car,
*  you have no say over anything.
*  If you're in your fucking car with rubber gloves on and a mask, you stop.
*  Or if you're out running or biking.
*  Well, I think some people do that for courteous sake because I have
*  Bridget Phetasy was telling me that she was walking down the street
*  on the other side of the street.
*  She was on one sidewalk. Someone's on the other side.
*  She was walking her dog and someone was screaming her to put a mask on.
*  Put a mask on the dog.
*  Yeah. No, I mean, I get that.
*  If you're if you're running, right, obviously, if you're running and you're
*  breathing heavy.
*  But I'm talking about people that are running in areas like around us.
*  We've got the foothills, right? Right.
*  Go up in the foothills. You can run and not see anybody.
*  Yeah. But I've seen people up there, you know, running.
*  And it's not like you're running downtown New York City
*  where you're passing people constantly and you're like you said,
*  you're breathing heavy. It's just and you know, or you're on an obvious
*  on a on a on a long, you know, 20 mile bike ride because you got your spandex
*  on you're going for a big pedal and you got your mask on.
*  I'm thinking it's probably a it's probably not necessary.
*  And it's probably not that healthy.
*  Well, you know, they have you know what a training mask is.
*  It's like a oxygen depletion mask.
*  Right. I wear very super controversial.
*  Some people say it's horseshit.
*  Doesn't do a goddamn thing for you.
*  Some people say it's very good for you.
*  And by being able to work hard with very little oxygen,
*  it expands your cardiovascular potential.
*  Hmm. I mean, I think it all comes down to what you were saying.
*  You know, it's a little thing in life to bend your spirit over, right?
*  To be like an anti-masker.
*  It does. They're all assholes.
*  Yeah. It just doesn't make sense.
*  On a plane who gets kicked off for not wearing a mask.
*  You just go, you know, those guys, you know, those guys, they they exist.
*  Yeah. They're they're fucking annoying.
*  It's not that hard, man. Put a mask on.
*  Yeah. Nobody's taking away your freedom.
*  Just just put your mask on.
*  I agree. But there is always that element of of
*  I'm standing up to to the man,
*  you know, the man or odious government control or, you know, it's ridiculous.
*  But on the other hand, the people that make a big deal
*  of the fact of wearing a mask are equally annoying.
*  Yeah. Well, that's not equal.
*  Well, less slightly less annoying than the anti-mask people.
*  Look, one thing this whole process has taught me is that I find
*  the most annoying people I think exist out there are
*  really, really self-righteous, progressive white people.
*  Oh, my God. Yeah. That demographic.
*  Right. I mean, the one the one thing I can say is I can't stand that that group.
*  Right. And now, again, you could say the same thing about the hard,
*  you know, side on the on the right.
*  I mean, there's there's just both those those those people.
*  And they probably have more in common than we think.
*  For sure. It's an ideology. Yes. Yeah.
*  Yeah. It's you.
*  You want people to know where you stand on something.
*  And you believe that where you stand makes you more virtuous.
*  Yes. Yeah, that's that's that's a very eloquent way of putting it.
*  And you want to kick them in the balls.
*  All of them just want to run up to a shot.
*  You're fucking dirty, stinky mouth.
*  You're annoying. You ruin all these good causes.
*  That's the problem with all these great causes.
*  There's just some amazing causes that I support.
*  But they're also supported by twats.
*  Yeah. And these guys that are just just the most annoying liberals.
*  Well, that's like that's like the BLM movement, right?
*  I mean, there's are there legitimate things you could be doing to to to push forward
*  with police reform that makes sense?
*  The training and the you know, the but you got to fund them, right?
*  You actually got to get a better less than lethal weaponry.
*  The hiring and the vetting.
*  But the movement gets hijacked in part by, you know, this group that,
*  you know, just wants to feel good about themselves.
*  Do you see the girl in Brooklyn the other day that spit in the cops?
*  Yes. She's yelling at him.
*  You fucking fascist. And she spit in his face. Yeah.
*  And then he's like, thank you. That's assault. Yeah, exactly.
*  Ressert. She's like, what are you doing?
*  You can't just spit in someone's face.
*  Not only that, he wasn't even saying anything to you.
*  No, he's just standing there.
*  He's standing there and she's and she's losing her shit.
*  Young kids like that who've never been held up at gunpoint,
*  who've never been I don't know if she's ever been robbed.
*  Maybe she has. Maybe she's just really hardcore.
*  She's she's been robbed.
*  And she's like, I prefer the fucking thieves to the police.
*  But it's just this thing where you're supposed to hate the cops
*  because of George Floyd and or because of a number of other incidents
*  that have nothing to do with that guy.
*  It's like you can't you can't hate any group of people
*  because of someone that is not just because they do the same job,
*  but they're not the same individual.
*  They're not the same human.
*  They didn't they didn't do that horrendous crime
*  that everybody saw that makes you angry.
*  This guy in Milwaukee has no fucking relation to this guy in Florida.
*  They don't know each other.
*  They just happen to both be police officers.
*  It's the same thing with like a firefighter that starts fires because he's crazy.
*  You don't go spit in another firefighter's face
*  because my fucking dog burnt to death in a fire.
*  You piece of shit. Hey, I fight fire.
*  Exactly. Jesus Christ.
*  But we don't we don't.
*  I can't. It's this idea that somehow we're.
*  But it's like all groups.
*  Look, how many how many how many doctors have put people under sedation
*  and molested them a fucking lot, man, a lot.
*  There's a lot of cases.
*  I didn't know there was an epidemic of that.
*  It's not an epidemic, but there's enough so that if you Google it,
*  you'll find many, many, many cases where people lost their license to practice,
*  got sued, went to jail.
*  But you don't look at every doctor and go, you piece of shit.
*  I got molested by a doctor.
*  You you fucking asshole.
*  And no one's under more pressure
*  for fear of their life in a civilian society than a cop.
*  No one. Well, that's the thing.
*  We don't understand.
*  Other than maybe a black guy who gets pulled over by a cop.
*  You can make that argument.
*  You just said, yeah, you're OK.
*  So they got a lot in common is what you're saying.
*  Yeah, exactly. They're both both scared.
*  Now, nobody ever puts I mean, if you're a state trooper
*  and you pull somebody over on the highway and you're walking up that
*  you have no idea what the fuck's about to happen, especially if he's got no plates.
*  Right. Right. Jesus Christ.
*  So it's but but again, it's it's this idea that it's it's all or nothing.
*  Right. And and part of that is is is just the the lack of empathy.
*  Part of it is is the way that we're processing information
*  and that fucking social media.
*  That's a big part of it. That's a big part of it.
*  A big part of it is also this what we're talking about with people being self-righteous.
*  They're self-righteous all day long on Twitter,
*  and they're arguing with people about it, and they're finding people
*  that agree with them and everybody's competing for likes.
*  Social media has ruined discourse, but it's also enhanced it.
*  It's done both.
*  No, it is. I'm not I'm not an allude. I'm not saying it's terrible.
*  I'm just saying that there is a downside that we we don't seem to be dealing
*  with very well. Look, I mean, right after this happened.
*  Right. So once it became clear that there was not going to be a blue wave
*  and that Biden wasn't going to ride in on it and that the House wasn't going to flip
*  a bunch of Republican seats and they weren't going to take the Senate right away.
*  If you if you kind of canvassed what was going on in social media,
*  people were like, well, this just just cements it.
*  That this is clear that it wasn't just an anomaly in 2016.
*  This just cements that half of America is a bunch of shitheads. Right.
*  I mean, that was the general tone.
*  Some folks out in social media just saying, well, clearly they're all just
*  they're either stupid or they're bad people or they're both
*  because they don't agree with me.
*  Yeah. Right. And I. Yeah.
*  When the fuck did that happen? Yeah, exactly.
*  There's a lot of things that people are voting for.
*  They're not just voting one guy bad, one guy good.
*  And that's not what's going on.
*  There's a lot of economic policies.
*  They're dealing with support for the military.
*  That's a giant factor with a lot of people.
*  Look, for a lot of my friends who are veterans,
*  who are either in the military or have been in the military,
*  that is the number one reason why they voted for Trump.
*  And, you know, Tim Kennedy, that's why he reenlisted.
*  He reenlisted because he knew that the military was getting more support
*  and that the funding for the military was going to increase substantially.
*  And they were going to get to take care of things that they that were stagnant
*  for a long time.
*  And he came on the podcast and talked about it, how they they basically squashed
*  ISIS in under a year.
*  And it was going on forever before that.
*  And they were spreading the Boko Haram and all throughout Africa.
*  And it was getting scary.
*  And funding increased substantially, support increased substantially.
*  They got what they needed and they got the job done.
*  That for a lot of guys, they're not they're not assholes.
*  They just support the military.
*  And they know that there was one candidate that was making a big push
*  to support the military and another one
*  that was a part of the whole Benghazi bullshit.
*  I mean, that was 2016.
*  They didn't trust her because of that.
*  They didn't they didn't trust her because she's a part of the machine.
*  They're the part of the whole machine that got them into Iraq
*  in the first place under false pretenses.
*  Yeah. And and what people voted for law and order.
*  Right. Yes.
*  And after the sort of the summer of what they were witnessing,
*  they're like, you know what?
*  I think probably looking at that and then saying I'm for defunding the police
*  or, you know, whatever the term they use, sometimes reimagining
*  policing as a community effort.
*  It doesn't mean you're racist.
*  And then on top of that, what does Biden really support?
*  Like, what is he standing for?
*  Like, what? Tell me what the policies are.
*  Does anybody know?
*  Is there anything like real clear and present
*  that's at the forefront where it makes sense?
*  Like, this is how he's going to clean this up.
*  This is how he's going to clean that up.
*  This is where this is where we're doing wrong.
*  And this is how he's going to fix it.
*  There wasn't a discussion of that.
*  It was just Trump is bad.
*  What is Trump doing? Trump is ruining everything.
*  I'm going to set up a commission.
*  That's what I mean.
*  His answer for a couple of things are like with the pandemic.
*  Well, what are you going to do?
*  Oh, I'm going to get a commission of, you know, the leading scientists.
*  And we're going to look at how do we deliver these things on time and how do I think?
*  Well, hold on a second, pal.
*  Look, I mean, I don't doubt that he's a good person.
*  I'm sure he is a good person.
*  But you can't tell me that suddenly you're magically going to,
*  you know, develop this this level of efficiency that, you know,
*  wasn't displayed in the previous eight years of the Obama administration
*  or prior to that, when you were, you know, as a senator for all this time,
*  admittedly, working within a system that sometimes is hard to move.
*  But I think, you know, his answer to that commission, his answer to court packing.
*  Are you in favor of court?
*  He wouldn't answer that question.
*  You know, so he said, I'm in a form of a commission to look at it,
*  because I think the Supreme Court's out of whack.
*  What the fuck does that mean?
*  Well, not only that, he said the people don't deserve to know.
*  Yeah. You hear that part?
*  He says some wacky shit.
*  And I'll tell you one thing as a comic.
*  God, I hope comedy clubs open up to full capacity soon
*  because there is so much gold in that man.
*  There's gold in Trump.
*  But the gold in Trump was almost hard to mine
*  because, like, so many people were so polarized by him.
*  It's like in the jokes already wrote themselves.
*  It's like people like Jesus Christ, stop talking about Trump like enough already.
*  Like, I really didn't have much Trump material.
*  I had Trump material on the way to the White House.
*  I got a whole bit about him in 2016.
*  But I may be completely wrong about this, but also he was such a parody
*  of himself, right? Yes.
*  That it's almost hard to go anywhere with it.
*  He's so ridiculous.
*  It's hard to write stuff that's more ridiculous,
*  because that's one of the things you do with comedy is you make things
*  more ridiculous than they actually are, but with a grain of truth to it.
*  Yeah. When you when you're mocking a person.
*  Well, I'm curious as to where Corn Pop's going to end up.
*  Oh, he's going to be great.
*  Corn Pop is coming back.
*  Corn Pop's going to say, I'm here to tell you that story is true.
*  Joe Biden put me in my place and I was ready to fight him.
*  And he does have hairy legs.
*  He does. The hairy legs that confused me to you.
*  What confused me was who allowed him to talk in front of all those children
*  that are not paying attention at all.
*  Like that is, you know, some people are just real bad at telling stories.
*  And kids will be the first to let you know that because they don't give a fuck.
*  Those kids were those kids were just having a good time.
*  Yeah, they were behind him just chatting away about all sorts of non related shit.
*  I don't know about your kids, but if I start telling the story
*  and my kids aren't into it or they'll walk off.
*  Check out. They just go on.
*  They won't even stick around.
*  Yeah, they won't even stick around.
*  Well, I encourage mockery in my house.
*  Yeah. Like if something's funny, like in my house, it takes the cake.
*  And sometimes I get yelled at for laughing at things that I think are funny,
*  but you're not supposed to think are funny.
*  You know, it's like especially my 12 year old would say some hilarious shit.
*  And I was just like, ah, like, stop.
*  That's not you're not supposed to.
*  That is not supposed to be funny.
*  I'm like, that's fucking funny.
*  Yeah. No, I mean, it's yeah.
*  My boys say shit that's inappropriate all the time.
*  And you have to stop and laugh about it because you think,
*  yeah, it's pretty sophisticated for a nine year old.
*  My youngest goes for the joke.
*  Yeah, she's the most active.
*  Like she'll like when I have friends over, she like turns it on.
*  She goes she'll start performing.
*  My friend, Tom Segura, was like, damn, she's got a lot of comic in her.
*  I'm like, well, she knows what works. Right.
*  She's like in my house. That's currency.
*  You got to do that.
*  I think it I think it it it helps in so many ways.
*  Right. Oh, yeah.
*  If you stifle their humor or you stifle or you don't let them understand
*  the complexity of humor, how it can be layered.
*  And part of that is sort of the you know, you know, it's like the nine year old
*  will sit in with his older brothers and they'll plow through a couple episodes
*  of South Park and you know, OK, I've got the nine year old watching Borat,
*  the second movie.
*  Oh, no. Yeah.
*  I think it like, all right, I'm sorry.
*  I didn't know I didn't authorize this.
*  That's all. You know, what are you going to do?
*  That's awesome.
*  And the one area that we have been trying to control is the language.
*  Right. And that's that's a problem for both my my fabulous wife and I.
*  We, you know, we'll tend to swear around the kids.
*  A little colorful. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And so like, I don't know.
*  Problem, you know, if one of them is acting like a douche, then I'll say, hey,
*  look, stop acting like an asshole.
*  Don't be a douchebag or whatever.
*  And and they pick that up. Right. Right.
*  I guess I should have known that.
*  And then they would take it to school with them.
*  I feel like it's better if they hear it in the house.
*  I really do.
*  It's like, what are you going to hear it outside and be confused by it?
*  Like it's language that adults use.
*  I tell my kids, just don't use that language when you go over people's houses.
*  Don't use that language around teachers.
*  Don't use that language around other adults.
*  It's it's a weird thing because they also know that I'm a comedian
*  and I swear for a living.
*  And sometimes my wife listens to my podcast and she'll have it on the car.
*  And so like you get in the car and Bluetooth is playing.
*  You start the car.
*  And I was like, what the fuck is that guy thinking?
*  Oh, my God, daddy has the worst potty mouth.
*  One thing I do encourage, I do encourage mockery of me.
*  I incur like if they make fun of me, that's their way to get back.
*  Yeah, like they can make fun of me and I'll start laughing.
*  And I think because like it's not fair that you live with these people
*  that are older than you, they get to tell you what to do.
*  You never get to tell them what to do. Right.
*  Kids get resentful of that.
*  So the one way they can get back at me is mocking me.
*  Yeah. And as and I feel exactly the same way, as long as they do it
*  in a in a clever way. Right. Yeah. It's got to be. Yeah.
*  It's got to be some humor to it.
*  And it's got to be smart. Right. About how they how they do it.
*  Well, I'll critique their jokes.
*  I'm like, that joke sucked. That's not good. Yeah.
*  But sometimes they get you with some good ones.
*  They get you with some zingers. Yeah.
*  I got my 13 year old, the boy Scooter is he started to challenge me.
*  Like, you know, like you start like, you know, we'll get into it.
*  Do a contest here.
*  We'll start we'll start, you know, he'll come up and he'll start punching me.
*  And, you know, I'll let it go.
*  But then I can kind of tell you see it in their eyes. Right.
*  They're like, yeah, I'm getting I'm getting one up here.
*  And it and then you have to take this.
*  Then you got to take him down. Right.
*  And you think, OK, but then I'm thinking I got maybe like,
*  I don't know, not that many years left before he's he's going to be.
*  Time to start lifting.
*  Well, you know, and and who doesn't put
*  he he's he will he will one day.
*  Yeah, he will one day.
*  But right now I can see that he's he's starting to do that.
*  He's starting to challenge a little bit. It's natural.
*  Yeah, it is natural.
*  Roy Jones Jr. talked about that on this podcast with his dad
*  that a lion has to leave the den. Yeah.
*  You know, a young lion is coming up.
*  The old lion's like, hey, son, time for you to get the fuck out of here.
*  Yeah. Or or the old one just wanders off right and dies.
*  Wides up with a broken jaw and can't feed himself.
*  I told my boys just wheel me out to the back.
*  And then go back up on the top deck and take turns shooting at me.
*  Yeah. Just just take me out at the point where I'm losing it.
*  Just just do that. Just just end it.
*  I think there's a more humane way to handle it.
*  It probably is. Yeah.
*  You could do that yourself, too.
*  You don't have to put in your kids.
*  So they have to think about that shit for the rest of their life.
*  So parenting, they didn't seem concerned about the idea, though.
*  They in fact, they almost seemed on board.
*  Well, you might have uncorrectable errors that you've already
*  you've already committed and child rearing.
*  There's that possibility.
*  Hey, what is the shit that I'm hearing that Jamie was bringing up today
*  that Trump might fire the head of the CIA and the NSA?
*  But he's thinking about doing that before he leaves.
*  Yeah, that would be a, you know.
*  But wouldn't Biden just rehire him?
*  I would like to think so.
*  It would be a complete dick move if he does, because he's not going to find
*  a better director than Gina Haspel over at the agency.
*  She's top notch.
*  And I hear nothing but good things.
*  She's outstanding.
*  And she's got.
*  And this is what I worry about here when we talk about like
*  the administration change over, right, because maybe she would stay on
*  during the Biden administration for a period of time.
*  I mean, we've seen that in the past and in other circumstances.
*  But usually they would end up looking and saying,
*  we're going to replace the directors, we're going to do these things.
*  And, you know, there's been a little bit of talk in Washington,
*  you know, about, you know, who may be in what position.
*  Gina Haspel, one of the things that makes her so good is that she grew
*  up in the in the outfit, right?
*  And so she's she's got that deep understanding of operations and what it takes.
*  Right. What's required and what, you know, is she like the girl from Homeland?
*  But less crazy, less crazy.
*  Yeah. No, no, she's not crazy at all.
*  But I mean, no, it's she she's just she, you know, she just top notch.
*  There's no and there's no there's no there's no chinks in the armor
*  or whatever you say.
*  So why would anyone are you allowed to say that anymore?
*  I just realized that I don't think so.
*  I think you can still say it, but people get real scared. OK.
*  They say it and they go, oh, Jesus.
*  Yeah, I just like I just did.
*  But but so Gina, it would be great if they replace her,
*  if they were to replace her with someone who is from outside. Right.
*  And we've had some good outside directors.
*  Leon Panetta was a good example. Right.
*  That guy, you know, explain to people and help me along the lines as well.
*  If someone were to become an outside director of the CIA, say,
*  say you're a person who works in, you know, whatever.
*  What what industry would they draw from?
*  Oh, God. Sometimes, you know, sometimes the names get floated or like,
*  you know, their biggest thing is they've they've existed in national security
*  circles like they they were in a think tank for a long time.
*  They were writing policy papers and maybe they were on a national security
*  staff somewhere and they were
*  what the agency thrives under as far as leadership goes.
*  Usually is somebody who really understands because they've done it
*  because they've been inside, they've been inside and they understand
*  what it's all about. They know it's just there's a lot of moving parts in there.
*  But so you wouldn't take from business.
*  You wouldn't get someone who runs businesses.
*  It would have to be someone with some sort of national security background.
*  Yeah. I mean, you would you would hope.
*  But even still, like they don't really cross-pollinate.
*  Someone from the FBI wouldn't become the head of the CIA.
*  Well, fantastic.
*  Yeah, one of the greatest people I've ever known, William Webster,
*  was both the director of the FBI and the director of the agency during his career.
*  And he was not inside the agency, but he was an outstanding director.
*  He's I think you could argue is an anomaly.
*  You know, there are a couple of others.
*  But I guess my point being is it would be a dick move to to to let
*  let her go because she's outstanding.
*  And but do they usually do that or they when someone gets in,
*  they clean house and then they put their own people in positions?
*  You know, I don't know.
*  Statistically, I don't know what the percentage is, but sometimes not.
*  I mean, Gates is a good example of that.
*  Bob Gates kind of transcended because I always look at agencies.
*  Obviously, I'm on the outside deeply.
*  But if I look at agencies as being like something that's completely separate
*  from what the president is and that they advise the president and give the
*  filling the president in on all the shit that's going on in the world
*  that you don't know about if you're a civilian. Right.
*  But you don't directly.
*  It's not you're a part of you're not a part of this administration.
*  No, I mean, right.
*  The director sometimes can be.
*  And that's why I say it changes sometimes you get you get people like that
*  that may come in and have more of a political bent, which I think is always wrong.
*  Ideally, the agency and I say other members of the Intel community
*  should always be ideally apolitical.
*  Not everybody's human, right?
*  They've got their own beliefs, etc.
*  Obviously. But I think it works best when these and we've seen
*  from other countries overseas that you see this shit, right?
*  You see when you get a change in government and they just wholesale,
*  you know, clean out the the intelligence organization or the police organization.
*  And they just they bring in all their people.
*  And it's a nightmare. We never want that.
*  Yeah, you never want that shit here.
*  So then there's all these growing pains and you got to figure out what the job is.
*  And you have a bunch of people that aren't accustomed to the way
*  you normally do business and.
*  Well, then you've got people beholden to that power structure for their job.
*  And you want that arm's length.
*  You want them to be able to give objective opinions, right?
*  That's what's critical here.
*  So you have to be able to say, here's the reporting.
*  Here's an objective analysis assessment of what this means.
*  Here are your options.
*  And you have to have confidence that they're doing that in an apolitical
*  or as much as possible, you know, being realistic, an apolitical manner.
*  And I mean, that's what's the whole kerfuffle.
*  Can we say, you know, yeah, kerfuffle is fine. Kerfuffle is fine.
*  And so we that the whole kerfuffle over the politicization of the of the FBI,
*  for instance, with Colby and others.
*  That makes people deeply uncomfortable. Right.
*  So but, you know, these positions that that very top position
*  typically is is politically appointed.
*  Did you see where Ted Cruz was grilling Colby
*  about evidence that had been changed?
*  Yeah. Yeah. What did you think of that?
*  I sometimes have a hard time watching Ted Cruz, although I give him credit.
*  He's a very, very smart guy.
*  I think he knows his shit.
*  I like his beard. Yeah.
*  Beard is top notch.
*  It looks a lot better with the beard.
*  It came out of the pandemic with that. Right.
*  I trusted more now for some strange reason.
*  Seems like more of a man. He looks tougher.
*  I was about to say he looks a little tougher.
*  But, you know, I call me.
*  I think Comey has the same problem in the sense that,
*  you know, like over on the CIA side that John Brennan had,
*  I think they just they got too deep into the game in terms of politics
*  and the association.
*  And and and at that point, one side or the other,
*  depending on where you are on the fence, is going to find it
*  that offensive or questionable or maybe lacking in credibility.
*  So when you say too deep in politics, meaning they did things
*  that weren't necessarily the correct things to do,
*  but they were very good for them politically.
*  Yeah, I think so. Or like the game or just developed a too close a tie.
*  I mean, if I if if if I were, you know, one of the
*  if I were the president, I would not want to be a buddy
*  with the head of the agency or a buddy with the head of NSA or the bureau.
*  But wasn't that the thing that Trump demanded from Comey?
*  He was like, you know, I need you to be loyal.
*  Yeah. And Comey was like, excuse me. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Well, I think politically, I think he was he's on the opposite side.
*  That's there.
*  I mean, I think if somebody who was more politically aligned
*  with Comey had said that he would have got him, of course I am.
*  You know, I mean, not not loyal, but to say, sir, you can always count on my loyalty.
*  I would have been an issue. It wouldn't have leaked out.
*  It wouldn't have been a story. But yeah, coming back around, I think if
*  the smartest thing they could do if, you know, assuming that
*  Vice President Biden becomes president elect Biden,
*  if the numbers continue to go the way they are with the agency,
*  you know, he should definitely keep Gina Aspill on that job.
*  That would be a a smart move on his part.
*  What's the argument against it? Like, what is he saying?
*  Do you know what he's saying, Jamie? Is there something like?
*  No, it's just it's like a rumor he's going to get rid of everyone, even if.
*  Why would you do that?
*  That's what it was. Oh, even upon reelection.
*  Yeah, I just found it was being talked about like the 26th of October
*  as the first hit.
*  I mean, people generally at that level, don't quote me,
*  but generally they submit their resignations, you know.
*  So if Trump were to have won or were to win,
*  then they would still submit their resignations and he would have the opportunity
*  to either offer them that position again or find someone new.
*  When there's a change in administration, that's what you do.
*  You hand in your your resignation.
*  I mean, my daughter works in D.C.
*  and she's in a political position.
*  So she's been out there, you know, quietly looking in the event
*  that the administration changes because her assumption is she will not have a job
*  after January, you know, middle of January.
*  So it's a standard procedure out there.
*  But when you find a real quality person
*  who can provide you with extremely good advice and insight,
*  you should probably hold on to that person.
*  You know, obviously you're a little biased.
*  I'm biased. Yeah.
*  But, you know, I think it's it goes with that regardless of who that person is.
*  Right. Or like I said, with Leon Panetta, you know, he was used, you know,
*  on Clinton's chief of staff. Right.
*  I mean, Bill Clinton's.
*  So we're not necessarily politically aligned.
*  But he was a terrific director.
*  So I would say the same thing about anybody who exhibits excellent leadership.
*  Do you think any politicians are going to do this thing again?
*  The hand, this, whatever that is.
*  I'm not sure what that does. Yeah.
*  How about this? This week?
*  We're just jerking off.
*  Have you seen that online? I saw that online.
*  That was fantastic.
*  Trump is jerking off ghosts. Yeah.
*  Oh, God. Yeah.
*  Trump's out here jerking off.
*  But the dance. Yeah.
*  Dance at dancing.
*  I just don't know what that.
*  Moving. Not at all.
*  The hands like dicks.
*  Yeah. He's got a dick in each hand.
*  I'm going to miss that.
*  Here it comes. Look at this.
*  I mean, when you really stop and think about it, that is one of the worst ways
*  you could ever mean he's literally doing the dick in each hand move.
*  That's a dick in each hand move.
*  Look, dick in each hand, dick in each hand.
*  Struck him, struck him. Hey, well, thank you.
*  And I'll take you. I'll jerk you off.
*  Look at that.
*  That's we're not going to get that.
*  We're not going to get this again.
*  No, no, no.
*  I mean, he's like I said, he's almost too much for that in the mouth.
*  Look at that.
*  He's almost too much for comedy.
*  Yeah. You know what I'm saying?
*  Like, he's almost too ridiculous.
*  Everything about the hair, the fucking.
*  But the fact that he beat Covid in four days,
*  it really killed that goddamn narrative that this is something that's going to kill us all.
*  Yeah. That's an interesting point about this.
*  What the narrative is going to be.
*  The science isn't going to change come January 21st or whatever.
*  When we inaugurate the new president.
*  Right. If it happens to be Biden, the science won't change between now and then.
*  They'll still be working on vaccines to get those out for delivery.
*  But I guarantee you that tone is going to change.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  The tone of coverage. Yes.
*  Tone of coverage is going to be different.
*  Businesses are going to open up.
*  Yeah. The economy is going to shift.
*  Yeah. And it's not going to happen until after January.
*  They're going to wait until Biden actually gets an office.
*  They're not going to do it when he's the president elect.
*  They're going to wait, wait, wait, wait, open it back up.
*  And they're going to hope they did enough time where all these people are still going to vote Democrat.
*  And unfortunately, I think a lot of them are going to forget
*  like how ridiculous some of these governors have been.
*  They've they've killed people's businesses.
*  They've they've stopped people from working.
*  They've taken away people's ability to make their own choices about what to do.
*  And that mean they're fighting that in California.
*  And Newsom just lost a case where, you know, he that's right.
*  They said that he overextended his powers and and they're forbidding him to do that from now.
*  And then they're going to review it.
*  And he's you know, he's basically changing legislation.
*  Well, and I think that's what what people should watch also is look,
*  this these two can emphasize this enough, these unless Purdue gets that 50 percent
*  plus one vote and outright wins that Senate seat in Georgia.
*  You've got these two Senate seats.
*  Right. And this is the this is the balance of the U.S. Senate.
*  This is why this is important.
*  This is actually more important now than us.
*  The focus that the world's got on Biden, Trump. Right.
*  Now, I think that trains left the station probably.
*  But regardless, that that Senate control is critically important
*  in terms of, again, a sort of a balance of power arrangement, keeping government in check.
*  And so, you know, the Democrats are, you know,
*  they are going to pump a shit ton of cash.
*  Into those races, if two of them, even if they're just one.
*  Well, no, if there's one, then forget about it, because, you know,
*  they've they've lost the majority possibility.
*  But if both of those go to runoff in January,
*  you know, I think that may.
*  And Biden is the president-elect and it's decided
*  and they have the concession speech from Trump.
*  And so we go through this period of mid-December through January.
*  Then I think you will see some change.
*  I don't think they'll wait until after Biden is officially president
*  in terms of the coverage, because they're going to want to impact those elections in Georgia.
*  Right. You're going to want to show, oh, my God, look, we're really doing this.
*  And it's it's things are turning around now.
*  You know, it's and the media will be completely complicit in that.
*  Obviously. Well, most of the media is left wing.
*  It's weird. And then you got that.
*  I think what's going to happen is Trump's going to form his own media organization.
*  That's what I think. I think he's going to have something either online
*  or he's going to have something on a network.
*  But like, what is that? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah.
*  Yeah, yeah. That's sort of the what is it?
*  So what do we got? We got away and we got Newsmax.
*  They make Fox look like CNBC. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Or MSNBC.
*  You see how a lot of conservatives have turned on Fox like a fucking heartbeat.
*  I know. Crazy, right? Yeah.
*  They turn on Fox when they called Arizona. Yeah. Yeah.
*  But they've been doing it.
*  They've been, you know, there's there's there's been some dissatisfaction,
*  I think, within the right over Fox's direction.
*  What's wrong with the direction?
*  Well, I think they felt like it was getting too liberal.
*  Right. I know.
*  That was that was the thing.
*  Well, Chris Wallace. Yeah.
*  Chris Wallace.
*  He's he's been questioning Trump. How dare he?
*  Yeah. But they got what do they got?
*  They got that they got that they got that triumphant of of Carlson, Ingram
*  and Hannity.
*  So they're happy with those, I think, still.
*  But I think they question everything else they hear.
*  And certainly after they called Arizona now, there's a lot of pissed off people
*  who will go to OAN or whatever the newsmax
*  as a refuge.
*  But a media company for Trump that might make more sense.
*  I assumed that if he's out after this term,
*  that he would just get some huge offer from a network for another show.
*  He will get that.
*  He will. I think he will probably start his own thing.
*  And I think he will also start running for reelection.
*  And he's going to try to run again in 2024.
*  No way. No, no.
*  That's what he's going to do.
*  I will I will place a bet on that one.
*  How many want to bet that Trump will not run for reelection?
*  He's going to run. He's going to win in 2024.
*  I'll bet you right now. Give me some 1000 bucks.
*  All right. What kind of odds I get.
*  I was going to give you even odds.
*  That's 2020. I bet you 1000 bucks.
*  Does he have to win or does he have to run?
*  Well, he's made it say run and win.
*  I did, but I got crazy. Yeah.
*  I want to run. OK, I'll go for win for win.
*  OK. Odds.
*  You get the odds for win.
*  Yeah, I'll go even for for running.
*  OK, even for running. You got a bet.
*  1000 bucks, 1000 bucks.
*  And then odds for for winning. OK.
*  I need like five.
*  He's the current favorite for the 2024 nominee.
*  Yeah, there you go, bro.
*  What did I tell you? Yeah, I'm not talking shit.
*  John Kasich has a good chance. Mark Cuban.
*  Oh, they're all. Wait a minute.
*  I thought Mark Cuban is is he a Republican?
*  Because he was as much as President Trump is, I suppose.
*  But I thought he was supporting Biden.
*  He's been supporting Biden.
*  He's been saying that Biden is good for business.
*  I think he's been staking out sort of that independent kind of position.
*  He'll probably swing a little right as if he's serious about running.
*  Now that if Biden wins, I think he'll want to kind of veer
*  him his way back towards the right.
*  We're so broken in terms of this two party nonsense.
*  So broken. But the libertarians, that's no place to land.
*  I mean, I agree with a lot of the sort of the concepts, but it's not going to.
*  It's never going to be a successful third party that challenges.
*  It could if someone like Trump became a libertarian.
*  Right. This is what he said back in 2017.
*  What he said, says he runs for president.
*  He probably runs a Republican.
*  Probably said, probably.
*  I don't like that word. Hmm.
*  Probably. What does that mean, bro?
*  Who knows? Maybe he'll become more compassionate if he licks his finger
*  and feels the wind blowing in that direction. Yeah. Yeah. You know.
*  OK, well, we got that out of the way. So that's good.
*  So did we?
*  Twenty twenty four. Let me let me get this right.
*  That's four years from now. Yeah.
*  Thousand bucks for if I if he runs, I win a thousand bucks.
*  And if he wins, I win five thousand.
*  So if he runs, I already have a thousand that I'll stake against you for winning.
*  OK. And then I just get a free shot at winning five grand.
*  I like it. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I like it. I'm pretty strong on this one.
*  I don't I just don't see that happening.
*  I'm pretty strong on it, too, bro.
*  Yeah. Different odds for the overall winner of the next election.
*  As Kamala Harris is the leader with.
*  Well, we get Mike Pence, though. Mike Pence is eight to one.
*  Yeah. Trump isn't even on the list.
*  Hold on. Biden is 12 to one.
*  Wow. AOC is 25 to one.
*  Scroll down. You have better odds than Trump.
*  Damn, that's amazing.
*  Cuomo, 25 to one.
*  That's not Elizabeth Warren. 28 to one.
*  This is horseshit.
*  I mean, it's very early. This is Trump is 33 to one.
*  Oh, my God. But the problem I got with this is, look,
*  we got 330 some odd million people and we keep rehashing the same.
*  Yeah, we need. You know why?
*  When you go to the movies.
*  OK, I want to see Daniel Day-Lewis.
*  OK, I want to see Matt Damon.
*  I want to see people I know.
*  I see some fucking nobody playing Thor.
*  Yeah. OK, I want the Thor guy.
*  You want somebody to recognize.
*  I get it. That's what it is.
*  I mean, they're playing a role.
*  The role is the leader of the country.
*  Yeah. You know, we like.
*  Oh, I know who that Pence guy is.
*  He was the VP.
*  He's actually a very good speaker, even though he seems a bit loony.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  I would like to get him alone.
*  I'd like to get him alone and spend some time with him.
*  Yeah. He's like, get him drunk.
*  He probably doesn't drink at all.
*  I that's a good question.
*  Trump does not famously.
*  But, you know, I don't know.
*  I think it would be nice to see.
*  I've always thought it'd be great to see somebody like a condoleezza rice,
*  you know, come come out of retirement from politics and
*  does she have any desire to do that?
*  I think none. I think none.
*  God, she was inside.
*  She's probably like, I'm done.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I just think she's she's having too much fun out in the commercial world.
*  And I'm sure, you know, so I who knows, she'll end up as
*  commissioner of the NFL or something.
*  But I think that's the job she wants.
*  But does she really?
*  Big. I thought before. Yeah.
*  No kidding. That's interesting.
*  So but I think it would just be nice to see other well qualified.
*  People kind of rise to the challenge.
*  You know, it's interesting.
*  Andrew Yang apparently wants to do something with MMA.
*  He wants to create new legislation for MMA and have people.
*  I talked about it with Luke Thomas the other day.
*  He wants people in MMA to be to fall into the Ali Act.
*  The Ali Act is that a promoter can't also be the belt distributor.
*  OK, so the people that are the sanctioning bodies like the WBC
*  and boxing can also be a promoter.
*  Right. The UFC is obviously a promoter.
*  And they also are the sanctioning body.
*  They're the same thing.
*  And the Ali Act forbids that for boxing.
*  And he wants the Ali Act to apply to MMA, which is interesting.
*  It's a strange thing for him to pick up and run with.
*  I think he's a big fan. OK.
*  I think he doesn't like it.
*  I think he's become he's become very popular inside MMA circles.
*  He has some really good suggestions about cops, too.
*  He said he think and this is I really wholeheartedly agree with this.
*  He said he thinks every cop should be at least a purple belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
*  And I wholeheartedly agree with that.
*  I think he's he's very wise.
*  Andrew Yang is wise.
*  He says smart things.
*  I like I liked talking to him, but I like hearing him talk.
*  And I would wholeheartedly support him as president, too.
*  I think he's a he's a wise person.
*  I know a lot of people don't like his idea of universal basic income, but
*  I think this pandemic showed that there's a real need to have
*  at least a backup plan if people can't work in terms of a crisis.
*  Yeah. And in times of crisis.
*  Yeah. Yeah. In times of a pandemic.
*  And this is our last pandemic.
*  No, you know, hopefully we learn some lessons from it.
*  And I think we we have.
*  Let me ask you this. Yeah.
*  Gun to your head. Yeah.
*  Did this come from a wet market or did it come from a level four
*  virus lab?
*  I think the answer is a little more complicated.
*  I think it probably popped up in a wet market.
*  I think they were probably looking at it inside the lab.
*  And I think their containment procedures and their their protocols were lacking.
*  And I think it got away from them.
*  And I think that's that's what the the the Chinese regime is
*  busy still to this day trying to hide.
*  Yeah. So I think that, you know, and look, there was there was
*  this documentation of concern about this particular lab
*  and the level of security around it and, you know, concern over the
*  the money that was still being given to that lab to keep it going.
*  And despite the fact that the protocols were lacking.
*  So and what they cited for safety violations as recently as 2018.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I mean, going back a decade or so, there were there were there were issues.
*  Here's what I found fascinating about this situation.
*  When the the virus got out and when the pandemic started,
*  one thing that everyone was certain of was where the virus originated
*  and that if you said that it came from the lab,
*  you were some wacky conspiracy theorist.
*  There's a fucking level four biological hazard lab or whatever it is.
*  With a history of problems right there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I know. And that's it.
*  But if you suggest there are so many mysteries about this virus. Right. Right.
*  But if you suggested that it came perhaps from this lab,
*  you are some sort of a conspiracy. You're xenophobic, too.
*  Yes. Xenophobic.
*  And by the way, I've been accused of that because of that.
*  And having a fucking biologist on the show explain why.
*  Bret Weinstein explain why he believed it came from the lab.
*  Explain why.
*  Because if you examine the virus,
*  there's so many things that point to the fact that this virus has been manipulated,
*  that this virus is far too contagious, that it spreads far too quickly.
*  It's gone through this whole evolutionary process
*  that seems to have happened way too quickly for it not to have been manipulated.
*  He explained this in scientific terms without saying ever
*  that he believes it absolutely came from the lab. Yeah.
*  He's like all indications point to the possibility that this had come from the lab.
*  And I've read all these things where like Joe Rogan shows
*  spreading dangerous conspiracy theories about the virus.
*  Like what? Because we should we should believe everything that the regime says.
*  How do we how why is there so many questions about so many things?
*  But you can't question that.
*  Yeah, we're not talking about a place that doesn't have a level four lab.
*  We're talking a place that does.
*  Well, it's not like they study coronaviruses.
*  Oh, yes, they do.
*  Well, what can't we come from there?
*  Can't impossible. Yeah.
*  How is it impossible?
*  By the way, this cough, I've been tested.
*  Are you covid?
*  No, no, I just been tested.
*  You know, that 30 minutes ago, I was negative.
*  Everybody gets scared if you sneeze.
*  I know.
*  People look at you like something wrong.
*  I read something where it says
*  sneezing in your mask is the new shit in your pants.
*  Look, I think the I think
*  look, there's there's
*  there's every likelihood that this was picked up
*  or identified in the wet market or through sort of, OK,
*  this is a naturally occurring.
*  We know that this has happened before.
*  So that's not that's not hard to imagine.
*  But the likelihood that that then made its way into the lab
*  as they were looking at it, manipulating it.
*  I do believe there was fuckery going on in terms of just trying to understand
*  what it was or trying to see where it was going to go.
*  They study coronaviruses from bats in that lab. Exactly.
*  And so then and then again, you've got a history of problems
*  and protocols with this this particular lab.
*  Yeah. Where's the fucking mystery?
*  In terms of at least assuming that this is a possibility.
*  I think the real wacky conspiracy theory is that they did it on purpose
*  and I don't subscribe to that. Right.
*  I think that seems highly illogical that they would subject their own people
*  to that and that they would shut down essentially most of the world.
*  That doesn't benefit anybody.
*  It doesn't seem like that.
*  I don't see a logical reason why anybody would release that on purpose.
*  But I just don't.
*  It's the same kind of people that wear their fucking masks
*  and their Twitter profile pictures are the ones that hate anybody
*  discussing the possibility that that virus escaped from a lab.
*  I just don't understand the argument.
*  Well, it was the same again.
*  And you had all the sayings over
*  over the temporary halt on on
*  travel between China and the US.
*  Right. And and and again, that's you know, if you
*  you had this thing, crisis management planning. Right.
*  So every every company, every corporation will have
*  a set of protocols and they go through this and say, OK,
*  we got to look at all the potential threats and risks facing our company.
*  And then we have to create a crisis management plan in case of this happens,
*  that happens, whatever.
*  Like you said, have a backup plan or have a scenario that you can go to.
*  And then you exercise that. Right.
*  And so it's not hard to imagine that if you have a pandemic playbook that says,
*  OK, these are the various scenarios we've identified now that this virus
*  has come from over here, that we're going to temporarily halt travel
*  from that location where we've identified this is the origination of that of that virus.
*  What the hell? How is that tough?
*  But yet in this in this environment, because it's immediately politically charged.
*  Well, it is immediately immediately politically charged.
*  But then the ball shifts.
*  The goalpost shift.
*  Everything shifts because at first it was a xenophobic move.
*  It was horrific and racist for him to shut down travel to China.
*  Then it became he should have shut down travel earlier.
*  Yeah, he knew about it all the way back in January.
*  Why do they take so long to respond?
*  Like, yeah, no one knew what it was.
*  Like the conspiracy theories that they knew about it.
*  And it's not it's not fair when they take advantage of something
*  that clearly no one was prepared for and blame it all on him.
*  Now, if you want to criticize him for saying it's like the flu, it's going to go away.
*  It's going to be magic. It's going to disappear.
*  It's going to go away.
*  Yeah, I think you're you're allowed to criticize him on that.
*  That's a preposterous way of discussing it.
*  It's stupid. And to say it's going to be like magic.
*  No, it's not.
*  And then when he got it himself, I think that was a real wake up call.
*  I think you're right about that.
*  I think you could see a change in tone.
*  And I think he became a little more
*  if that's possible for him, empathetic.
*  But look, the Dems for a couple of days, a couple of days.
*  Yeah, I don't want to make more.
*  And then he became like a fucking Superman.
*  Yeah, maybe I'm immune. I don't know.
*  I'm completely immune.
*  My blood is going to be used to solve the problem.
*  Jamie's got some.
*  Not a random question that maybe insight from him would be in.
*  And I have seen a lot of stuff online about a Melania body double
*  that like one version of her doesn't even like to hold his hand.
*  But this other version will hug and kiss him.
*  She was super affectionate with him. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Could you imagine? Listen to do that, bro.
*  They can make that fucking guy look like a goblin.
*  And that one that Post Malone told us about.
*  Remember that guy? Necro Gobble.
*  Necro Gobble. Yeah.
*  I mean, that guy has a podcast where he wears his goblin outfit
*  and he interviews people.
*  You're telling me they can't make someone look like Melania Trump?
*  Like people say that's Melania. You're being an idiot.
*  Are you sure she's wearing sunglasses?
*  She's she's obviously a lady with a lovely figure who's wearing sunglasses.
*  Her face seems similar to Melania's, but not exact.
*  So what are you saying? You're in the camp of the body double.
*  All in on the body double.
*  This is what I think. Yes.
*  Rick Baker, who has been on the podcast before, created the American
*  Werewolf in London. You're talking about in the 80s.
*  He got a guy to look like he was turning into a fucking werewolf.
*  You're telling me you can't recreate Melania's facial structure in a doll.
*  Of course they can.
*  Not a doll. I mean, you know, a mask doll with with with Matt.
*  There's a revenue stream there, especially with a big revenue stream,
*  especially with the the glasses, the goggles.
*  They're huge. Those glasses are more than glasses.
*  They're basically welding goggles.
*  She's got fashion welding goggles on and, you know, smart glass.
*  But she's behaving in a way that you never see Melania behaving.
*  They're like newlyweds.
*  She's kissing him.
*  She's all lovey dovey and everybody's cheering.
*  Like, I will say this, my my my.
*  It's so funny that it's such a fucking conspiracy.
*  Go to the video of the Melania body double being affectionate with Trump,
*  because that's the weirdest to me.
*  I'm all in on the body double, by the way.
*  All in. My wife.
*  My wife has worked with Melania in the past on some overseas
*  concerns and trips, and she's got nothing but excellent things to say
*  about Melania in terms of she says she's a very private person.
*  Right. She's she doesn't really like
*  sort of the the press concerns of the job of First Lady.
*  Her staff says absolutely adores her, loves her because she is a,
*  you know, a kind individual, a decent person.
*  So I've heard nothing but good things about her.
*  I will admit, I've never heard this body double story before.
*  I don't know where to go with that.
*  Tom Tom Tom. I know it's it's just another it's another.
*  One more thing I got to investigate.
*  Oh, here we go. Here it is.
*  Look at this body double.
*  What do you think? Hmm.
*  Look at she's kissing him. She's all huggy, huggy.
*  I like it why they did that.
*  Doesn't look like her. I'm sorry. It doesn't look like her.
*  Also, I don't like how they did it in front of the fucking teleprompter.
*  What kind of shit camera work is this?
*  I think they took a beautiful lady with a lovely figure
*  and they put a Melania mask on her.
*  That's what I think. Look at that. Look at this.
*  It's like the Zapruder film.
*  Holy shit. Now we've got people investigating this.
*  This is how different she looks there.
*  Like it is a different person.
*  Oh, it's a different nose.
*  Everything. The other one looks like a rubber nose.
*  Go back up to the top again.
*  That's a fake nose.
*  It looks like one of them grouchy marks.
*  You say it could be Mike Pence underneath that mask.
*  I don't think that's what I'm saying.
*  OK, that's not what I'm saying.
*  All right. Just ask him. Yeah.
*  Yeah. See, that's what I'm saying.
*  Rick Baker. Come on.
*  You tell me Rick Baker.
*  He did with the werewolf.
*  You tell me who couldn't turn Melania Trump into that.
*  Come on. Of course, we had Hollywood.
*  Hollywood's worked with the agency, with the CIA in the past on
*  working with our disguise unit.
*  I'm sure you have.
*  And it's and it I will say it's incredible.
*  Incredible. Yeah.
*  Because you think about it, sometimes, you know, a guy like me
*  may not blend everywhere in the world.
*  And so the ability to operate on the streets or out in the open.
*  Yeah. So we get we get we've got a shit hot disguise unit.
*  Well, don't you remember Team America, World Police?
*  Fuck yeah. Well, they they they gave him the ultimate disguise
*  when he was out there talking to the terrorists.
*  It was.
*  Can we get that?
*  But yeah, by the way, I'm not serious about the Melania double.
*  I don't really think it's Melania.
*  We have a fucking bad.
*  It was he's got the Trump thing with the tan around the eyes, though.
*  Look, he's got the Trump thing with the tan around the eyes. Yeah.
*  Oh, my God. That movie was fantastic.
*  Oh, my God. With with Kim Il Jong song.
*  Yes. Hans Briggs.
*  Hans Hans, you're busting my balls here.
*  It's one of the greatest movies of all time.
*  You know, another great movie that people forgot about the South Park movie.
*  Yes. Where Satan and Saddam Hussein are gay lovers.
*  That was so Jesus Christ.
*  And they had dicks.
*  They could show dicks because it was a cartoon dicks.
*  You could have the dick flopping around.
*  Yeah. The voice work on that was was amazing.
*  Amazing. Fantastic.
*  Satan is gay and he fucks Saddam Hussein.
*  Yeah. Come on, man.
*  Dude, South.
*  I'm just Saddam's voice was was brilliant.
*  Yeah. And Saddam's head moves like a Canadian's.
*  Yeah. Where it pops off.
*  Terrence and Philip.
*  Hey, Terrence.
*  It's a great show.
*  I recommend that show to everybody.
*  I know because it's I honestly think it's it's the best piece of television work ever.
*  Ever done. Yeah. They're the greatest of all time.
*  They're the greatest comedy producers of all time.
*  But the movie that movie South Park, the South Park movie is so underrated
*  because it's almost like their body of work is so extensive.
*  Yeah. They have so many good episodes and so much good stuff
*  that people forgot about a lot of it.
*  Whoa.
*  Dude, when I first moved to California, OK,
*  it was maybe a year after I was here.
*  It's not like when the show started.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no.
*  No, the show. This is what I was about to say.
*  When I first moved to California in 94,
*  I was living in North Hollywood for about a year.
*  And then I moved to Encino.
*  So when I was in Encino, somewhere around ninety five ish
*  and someone gave me a VHS copy of their first production.
*  And it wasn't even South Park then.
*  It was like, I think maybe it was South Park, but it was all the characters.
*  And it was all about what would Brian Boytano do.
*  Brian Boytano, the skater. Great song.
*  I think it was about Christmas.
*  Yeah, it's called the Spirit of Christmas.
*  That's right. Came out ninety five. Yeah.
*  Thank you. So I got a VHS copy of that.
*  And I remember that's how they pitched it.
*  Dying laughing.
*  It was the funniest fucking shit I've ever heard.
*  So that was 25 years ago.
*  So of course, the show is 21 years old.
*  I just went to the movie. Yeah, the movie to me.
*  I was like I was in my friend.
*  It was 99, wasn't it? Yeah.
*  But that put me in like my sophomore year.
*  I was like a year after the show came out is when the movie came out.
*  I didn't realize it was that fast. Was it really?
*  That's what I mean. So the show was out in 98.
*  Ninety seven. Oh, yeah.
*  Fall of 97, I think is when it started.
*  But one of my favorite characters, Butters.
*  I love how they've never.
*  Well, they kind of upgraded since then, since the Spirit of Christmas,
*  what the animation looks like. Not much. Slightly. Not much.
*  Do you see the documentary on how they make it? Yeah.
*  That's brilliant. What's it called? Seven days.
*  Yeah. Six days. Six days.
*  It's fucking great. And they get to that point and they got like nothing.
*  Right. They got like two, two and a half minutes.
*  They got to fill and then they come up with something brilliant.
*  Yeah. Like smacking it in San Diego or some other song.
*  Sometimes that kind of pressure creates diamonds.
*  It really does. News radio, the sitcom that I was on,
*  the writers would employ a similar tactic.
*  They would not write until like two o'clock in the morning.
*  And then they had a table reading the next day and then they would write.
*  And then but then they also they were loopy because they were tired and silly.
*  And so then they would come up with this brilliant, like preposterous shit.
*  And sometimes I think that some like one of the strategies
*  they employed is getting delirious from from fatigue.
*  Right. When you're overtired, sometimes your brain works in this weird way.
*  Now, I could have suggested to them marijuana.
*  And I think that would have done the same thing.
*  And you could have done it in the middle of the day and you would have been fine.
*  And you got a good night's sleep.
*  But are you more likely to ask you this question in all seriousness,
*  from your perspective, do you think you're more creative
*  when you're smoking weed or less?
*  No, I don't think it's less.
*  It's definitely a different kind of creative.
*  I think it opens up.
*  It opens up my brain to ideas that I don't necessarily think
*  I would entertain if I was sober.
*  OK. What happened?
*  The lights flashed. Oh, my God.
*  Government. It's the government.
*  It's coming in.
*  And it's not because of the talk.
*  It's because of the Melania talk.
*  Make sure we're recording here.
*  They shut off. No, nothing.
*  We're good. Jesus.
*  Oh, that's strange.
*  It's it's just different.
*  Did you see there's some study today that came out?
*  I put it on my Instagram page that it's that psilocybin
*  four times more effective for antidepressants than medication.
*  Yeah. And SSRIs.
*  Anything they can do for that issue.
*  Yeah. I mean, you think about the number of people on antidepressives,
*  especially right now.
*  Oh, fuck. Yeah.
*  Too many people during this pandemic have just lost everything
*  and they're freaking out and suicides through the roof,
*  through the roof. Yeah.
*  And we you know, again, this idea that I may be fine.
*  We'll give them some cash to be fine.
*  It's no, it's that that ship has sailed.
*  People have already lost their businesses and they gave one
*  twelve hundred dollar check out months ago.
*  Like, how did they handle that so poorly?
*  Well, and then you look at this and you think, OK,
*  Pelosi, during her speech today, she came out and gave a little presser.
*  I don't know if she took any questions, but it was like part of it
*  was also this implication that now we're going to get to work on the
*  on the next stimulus bill.
*  And I'm thinking, what the fuck you've been doing?
*  Yeah, obviously, clearly we're waiting for this election to go
*  so that nobody gets credit except for for.
*  Exactly. Exactly.
*  That's exactly what it is.
*  They didn't care about people's businesses and jobs
*  to put politics ahead of everything.
*  And they they banked everything on this reelection.
*  And I accuse these liberal governors of doing the same thing.
*  I think that was part of the reason why they kept things shut down.
*  I really do.
*  No, I don't doubt that for a minute.
*  I'm not again, you know, I'm not I'm not a conspiracy guy,
*  but I have no doubt that this they weaponized this whole pandemic
*  issue for political purposes, and they played it very, very well.
*  But this was this was like this is going to sound wrong.
*  But, you know, it's it's a horrific thing.
*  It's terrible. You never wish it on anybody.
*  But there's no doubt that this played into the into the DNCs
*  or the Democratic Party's hands.
*  And they took advantage in certain cases of it.
*  And because they'd been throwing shit at Trump for four years.
*  Yeah. And, you know, most of it didn't stick, you know, no matter what they tried.
*  And this was the thing that that worked for them.
*  And they saw it pretty early on. Right.
*  And they saw that what what what the economy was doing.
*  And that was his big ticket. Right.
*  You know, running on the economy was his thing. Yep.
*  And they there was just the one thing that could take him down.
*  And it just shows you how dirty politics are.
*  They're willing to let untold thousands and maybe even millions of people
*  lose their livelihoods just so that they could maintain political power.
*  It just shows you how dirty they are.
*  Yeah. And it goes across the board.
*  I was going to say that. Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's not just one side.
*  No. The Republicans would have done the same goddamn thing.
*  Oh, sure. Yeah. Just like just like the Dems right now.
*  If if if it was flipped, they would be crying foul, as we've seen in the past.
*  And they'll be saying we're going to investigate and we're not
*  we're not giving a concession speech. We're going to take this to court.
*  Fine. It's the way. Yeah, it's the way it's played.
*  It's so fucking dysfunctional sometimes. It's weird.
*  It's just such a weird divided time in this country.
*  And it makes me sad.
*  That's why we need mushrooms.
*  It's yeah, everybody's got to realize like we're not that far apart in our ideas.
*  You know, we're not talking about evil people that want to eat babies
*  versus people that want to save babies.
*  Like the things that separate the right and the left, they're
*  they're much smaller than we think. They really are.
*  And the idea that America is somehow another inherently evil and racist
*  and terrible and that's not true.
*  Like what we are is we're the most innovative and creative country
*  the world's ever known in terms of like the impact we've had on culture.
*  There's there's so much to be proud of for being American, even though you know,
*  it's not like you asked to be American.
*  Right. We're all born here. We got lucky.
*  Got a lot moved here because you you got it and you caught it.
*  Right. Caught it early on.
*  And you you realize once you got here, like you could do a lot of shit here.
*  You can't do other places.
*  And it's pretty bad ass.
*  But it's not perfect.
*  And we could work together to make it better.
*  You don't have to demonize everyone that loves America.
*  Or you just have to accept the fact that not everybody thinks the same. Right.
*  And going back to what we or what I mentioned earlier,
*  where it was like after the election, after, you know, it was clear
*  it was going to be very, very close.
*  And some folks on the left came out and started talking about, well,
*  you just can't save these 48 or 49 percent of meaning people
*  that don't think like they or didn't vote for Biden.
*  You can't save them because they're just they're hopeless.
*  They're useless. They're stupid or bad.
*  That's a that's a hell of a way to think. Right.
*  And then I saw that guy that
*  the guy that turned out to be anonymous. Right.
*  Sort of that mid-level.
*  Yeah. Functionary. Right.
*  Mid-levels being kind.
*  Yeah. I'm trying to be kind to him.
*  But he came out and he wrote this bullshit article or op ed
*  that basically said, well, you know, I thought the you know,
*  it's not Washington that's broken.
*  It's the American people.
*  Again, referencing anybody who didn't vote for Biden.
*  Yeah. American.
*  What are you talking about? Fuck with the American people.
*  I'm broken.
*  But that's that's the mindset that people have. Exactly. Exactly.
*  So and I meant that jokingly.
*  I don't really mean that.
*  Of course, I do mean it. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Well, he lied about it when he's talking to Anderson Cooper.
*  He lied about being anonymous.
*  Anderson Cooper, first of all, is Anderson Cooper CIA?
*  He is, right?
*  You can tell that's no one's listening.
*  No. OK. He used to be, right?
*  Just between you and me. No, he's not.
*  OK. Yeah. But he was, right? No.
*  Didn't he work for the CIA at one point in time?
*  If he did a lot of it and a lot of ums.
*  I don't like it.
*  I had never heard of that. But seriously.
*  What do you know? I'm not.
*  I'm not. I do.
*  And we actually we actually still have a Rolodex.
*  We don't use a database.
*  We still have a big Rolodex and you just kind of chunk your way through.
*  Vanderbilt, oligarch, air, Anderson Cooper worked at CIA college.
*  OK, he was he was he was a summer intern.
*  Listen, bro, why would you be an intern unless you want to be a part of the agency?
*  Now, because a lot of guys get a job at like a landscaping company.
*  They don't work for the fucking CIA.
*  It's a great way to meet women.
*  You want to make money, drive for Uber, deliver pizzas.
*  You don't have to work for the goddamn CIA.
*  Yeah, I don't see CIA operative.
*  Work at CNN is a summer intern.
*  He's a little too smug and confident.
*  You think so? Yeah, he's got some backing.
*  He looks to he's too well groomed to to stay in the agency for any period of time.
*  You know, it's fascinating to me.
*  Beyond that, beyond that, that is it is fascinating.
*  And I think we've confirmed he is CIA.
*  Someone called Q.
*  All right, cats out of the bag.
*  He's still working.
*  He seems to know he knew that guy was anonymous because he gets the fucking the emails.
*  Yeah. Anyway, I didn't make call anonymous a fuckwit.
*  I did. Yeah, I take it back.
*  No, I mean, I take back the fact that I didn't.
*  I didn't mean to call him that.
*  Oh, you did. Yeah.
*  It's it's just silly.
*  He seems more silly than he is anything.
*  He was but he was remember he was referred to as the senior a senior.
*  Yeah, that's what silly I mean.
*  I mean, it's just like, come on, he's not a senior official.
*  But we don't trust we don't.
*  But that would make it more exciting if he was.
*  Sure, it would be. Of course, it would be.
*  And that's why that's why they referred to him as such, because it pumps up the story.
*  Of course. And people don't tell everybody what they said.
*  He I mean, it's a disparaging book about the Trump administration.
*  I don't even want to give it any any time because I don't think it's it's deserving.
*  But not that not that there's things you couldn't talk about, but I just
*  I have this thing about people who walk out of an administration,
*  regardless of which one, or walk out of an agency or wherever and write a fucking book.
*  Yeah, I just I just I have a problem with it.
*  Just shut your yap. Right.
*  And that's part of the gig. Right. Yeah.
*  And and and don't you know, if you didn't get enough hugs and you come out
*  and you want to, you know, beat your own drum, well, then, you know, just don't.
*  I don't know. We've we've we've gotten way too past the old point
*  where people would just finish a job and you never ever knew, you know, that,
*  you know, that they had.
*  There's too many opportunities for opportunists.
*  I sound like Wilford Brunley.
*  You sound good. I like what you're saying. Yeah.
*  There's too many opportunities for opportunists these days.
*  And I understand if you're a guy who works at, you know, fucking NBC or something,
*  you want to write a tell all book about whatever. Right.
*  But this is not what we're talking about.
*  You're talking about someone who works at the highest levels of government.
*  You're supposed to have.
*  Don't they sign NDAs? Yeah.
*  And you're supposed to. And, you know, like as an example,
*  the agency has a what they call a publications review board.
*  So if you're going to if you're going to finish up with the outfit and you get out
*  and you think, oh, my God, I want to write a book.
*  And I know, you know, you know, a handful of folks who did and they were very good
*  book, but they don't talk about, you know, it's not a tell all.
*  It's not a, you know, and they're not disclosing sources and methods.
*  But the point being is they've got the PRB.
*  And so you have to submit your transcript and they go through it.
*  And sometimes they'll edit things out and sometimes they won't.
*  But but you're supposed to, you know, the idea that you come out
*  and you had a unsatisfactory experience and you want to complain about shit.
*  A little distasteful. It's distasteful.
*  Yeah. There's two things that I want to talk to you about before we got in here
*  besides the election in no particular order.
*  Aliens and George Soros.
*  Hey, how do you know they're not connected?
*  They might be connected.
*  Might be connected. But both of those things, I find
*  particularly fascinating. I never knew that about you.
*  The George Soros thing just keeps coming up over and over and over again,
*  where people that I know that are very intelligent
*  and some that are very connected say that he's funding a lot of these
*  Antifa rallies and protests and and chaos
*  and that they're funding the political campaigns of people
*  that are opposed to putting people in jail and that are promoting
*  air quotes, social justice and all of these reforms
*  and all of these political movements that seem to be deteriorating
*  the trust in law enforcement and that there's some sort of organized campaign
*  by him to do something to destroy the fabric of our democracy.
*  Yeah, sort of the one world government run by George Soros.
*  That's the Batman villain storyline.
*  Yeah, I think the truth is less exciting or interesting.
*  I think he's he's he puts a lot of money
*  into a handful of organizations and that money gets
*  funneled out for various purposes, campaigns supporting
*  organizations, there's no doubt. I think that that
*  he his worldview is is somewhat different than mine.
*  But I don't think that Soros is, you know, running some campaign
*  to take down America. I think that's why.
*  Why do you think people are so attracted to that idea?
*  Because of Batman movies?
*  Yeah, you know, everybody loves a big villain.
*  He's an evil looking guy.
*  I mean, I can't. Hey, I don't mean that wrong, but you know,
*  you can't help his parents. No offense.
*  They look like you could be in Star Wars.
*  Yeah, he's got that look about him.
*  You can see him in a black robe.
*  Yeah, you know, your direct.
*  Helmet off and you know, hey, let's look at that.
*  He could do something about those bags under his eyes, frankly.
*  He doesn't want to. He's got billions of dollars.
*  Yeah, I know. What gets a person's rocks off when they have that much money
*  and they're, you know, they're still trying to make more money and they're
*  basically.
*  I mean, how old is he?
*  80. How old is George Soros?
*  He's got to be in his 80s, right?
*  He's he's in the home stretch.
*  Ninety, ninety, nine zero.
*  He's in the home stretch, kids.
*  Does it say how much money he's given away of his worth?
*  Eight point six billion. I don't know about giving away.
*  He's not giving it.
*  Having donated more than 32 billion to the Open Society Foundation, according
*  to Wikipedia. Wow. He's worth eight.
*  He's donated 32. That's a man committed.
*  Yeah. And see, that's part of it.
*  That's crazy. The connection to open society, I think, is probably what helps
*  to fuel it. But I mean, you got a guy that what does that mean?
*  He's an easy, what do you call it?
*  He's an easy, easy foil, an easy target to be in.
*  I mean, it's like the Koch brothers.
*  There's no difference, right?
*  It's just one side blames the Koch brothers for right, you know,
*  trying to take over America and one side blames Soros.
*  So what is that organization, Jamie?
*  Open society.
*  Oh, open to the Open Society Foundation
*  support individuals and organizations across the globe fighting for freedom
*  of expression, accountable government and societies that promote justice and equality.
*  Well, that sounds good. It does sound good, doesn't it?
*  It's confusing. Yeah.
*  So all these people that think he's evil.
*  Truth and justice.
*  I mean, but if I was going to be evil, I would hide behind something like that.
*  And it sounds like a perfect.
*  And you can imagine some of that money
*  getting eventually funneled, making its way to organizations.
*  I'm not saying it's happening, but an organization like Antifa or whatever.
*  You know, the theory being, oh, no, we're trying to promote.
*  If you if you wrap yourself in the cloak of promoting equality and justice,
*  most people aren't going to push back because they don't want to look like a dick.
*  Right. Right. You get away with a lot of shit.
*  Yeah. So you don't you don't.
*  But anybody who's got this like this is
*  one of my things, if you're going to give money to an organization,
*  you know, do a little investigating first, find out how much of it goes
*  into people's pockets and actually where the money goes and what it's used for.
*  Sometimes it's easier than not.
*  And if it's difficult to find that information out, give you money somewhere
*  else, right, because it's not there should be transparency around any
*  operation that's asking you for a donation or for your money.
*  But Soros, when he funnels that money and makes its way through,
*  it's like a pachinko machine, right?
*  It's kind of just kicking all over the place.
*  Right. So it's it's no surprise.
*  But so do you think it's just that it's an easy target for someone who's looking
*  for like one person who's the puppet master who's pulling all the strings?
*  Right. Everybody loves it's a simplistic way of looking at things.
*  Yeah. And I'm not saying that Soros isn't funding groups that wouldn't piss people
*  off, I guess, but, you know,
*  there's more to it. There's more to it than that.
*  But it's like, you know, it's like that Kennedy assassination.
*  Nobody wanted to believe that Lee Harvey Oswald could do something as an
*  individual that was so horrific.
*  Now you're going to lose me.
*  If you really think he did that by himself, this fucking conversation is over.
*  No, I'm not saying that he did it by himself.
*  What I'm saying is that people don't want to think that, right?
*  Because it's not true.
*  Right. But you close out the possibility that it could be true.
*  Are you saying it's true?
*  I'm saying that there's a possibility.
*  There's not a fucking way in hell.
*  I'm saying there's a possibility.
*  What about the bullet?
*  You can't take that off.
*  You can't take it off the table.
*  The magic bullet.
*  You can't take that right off the table because it was on a table.
*  It was actually on the gurney that Connolly was rolled in on.
*  Oh, look, we found the bullet case closed.
*  Cleaned it up all nice.
*  I guess my point, though, before we descend into into into the madness
*  is that you don't want to you don't want to remove options when you're looking.
*  And if you can't say I mean, maybe you can say if you can say 100 percent,
*  there's no doubt I tell you, I'm not I'm not closing the door on the percentage
*  chance that Lee Harvey Oswald did that on his own for his own reasons and his own
*  resources and ability to do it.
*  I will say the MLK Martin Luther King
*  assassination is one where if I have to say, look, there's definitely shit here.
*  We talked about that before.
*  And it does seem like there's shit there.
*  What it seems to me is that the CIA definitely killed Kennedy.
*  And that's why you are making it seem like it's most likely that Oswald.
*  What else do you think I'm going to do?
*  I'm kidding when I say that that fucking magic bullet theory.
*  Only a child who's never shot a gun understands or would look at that theory
*  and think it makes sense if you shot a gun before.
*  If you if you know what happens when bullets hit bone, there's no fucking way.
*  Look at that thing. Come the fuck on.
*  That shot through two people shattered bone in the wrist of Connolly.
*  Looks pretty clean.
*  Yeah. Get the fuck out of here and wound up
*  magically in the gurney.
*  And oh, by the way, there's more bullet fragments in Connolly's body than we're
*  missing from that bullet. So fuck you.
*  Well, I'm just saying, I'm just saying until until until they close that case
*  completely and nobody ever has completely that.
*  But I guess I get going back to the bigger point.
*  If I had that bullet again, that bullet up one more time.
*  Oh, here it goes. Here comes that drawing.
*  This is the official government drawing.
*  See, like this is the thing that's wrong with that, though.
*  Sorry, no one else here.
*  The thing that's wrong with that picture.
*  Yes, I did. The photo show that picture again.
*  Yeah. Hand drawing.
*  Here's some people don't understand why this is not as ridiculous as the bullet,
*  because bullets do weird shit when they hit things.
*  And I know a guy who
*  how I put this shot a person in war in the face and the bullet literally
*  came out the same way it went in, went in the guy's head, ricocheted around
*  the skull and came out the front. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I've seen forensics on that same crazy shit happens when bullets hit.
*  But they don't. It's not that crazy.
*  They don't come out looking like that.
*  That's not a bullet that shattered bone. It's just not.
*  It's but people who all the bullets way more distorted than that.
*  That particular image is a deceptive angle.
*  Fuck you.
*  Just fuck you.
*  Not a lot of deception.
*  Look at that. See, they got a slightly.
*  You got a little dent there.
*  They shot that fucking thing into a swimming pool, kids.
*  There's not a chance in hell that went through a couple of people.
*  Oh, look, see, see, see, see the tip.
*  You can see some of the lead.
*  But my point, my overall point, should I have one, is that with Soros,
*  I mean, people like,
*  you know, they that's why conspiracy theories and other things exist, right,
*  and continue to exist is because it's a fascinating concept.
*  It's a fascinating story.
*  You can look at Soros and go, yes,
*  you're running from a secret lair somewhere under a volcano,
*  an effort to take down America.
*  Right.
*  OK, that's, you know, that's one.
*  That's one theory.
*  Anyway, we're all we're all programmed by movies, right?
*  These these narratives that there is one secret evil person that wants everything
*  to go down and those those narratives, they they're very compelling.
*  And we've we've had them in our lives for so long.
*  So many people have these sort of simplistic portraits of the world
*  that they they've adopted because of movies.
*  Yeah. And we want we like a beginning, a middle, an end.
*  People like things to to be all wrapped up.
*  Right. Let me see that picture of the bullet with the goat.
*  That was a little disturbing that the bullet went that.
*  A similar bullet went through a goat
*  that one on the bottom.
*  I had no idea they had a bullet fired through a goat most closely duplicating
*  Connolly's chest wounds, not just his chest wounds, you fucks his wrist too.
*  Went to and then just the fact they found it on his gurney.
*  Oh, whoops, we found it under no circumstance.
*  Do I feel that this bullet could have hit a wrist and still not be deformed?
*  We proved that by experiments.
*  Chief consultant and wound ballistic for the US Army who supervised tests for the
*  War and Commission. Exactly.
*  That other that other photo, if it did go through a goat, let me tell you something,
*  kids, that fucking thing got a pass through.
*  It probably went right in between the ribs.
*  And even then I don't buy it because it probably hit the ground somewhere.
*  To be that goat.
*  One day you're out there eating grass and ivy.
*  How about how about they did it through a hundred goats until you got a bullet?
*  Exactly.
*  This is what we're looking for.
*  Even then, I think it's horseshit.
*  I've shot animals before.
*  When you shoot an animal with a bullet, man, those bullets come out super deformed.
*  Of course, they mushroom.
*  They come out looking great because bullets aren't supposed.
*  Here's the thing for people to understand.
*  Bullets are designed to change shape when they hit things because it does more damage.
*  So when you see a bullet that's mushroomed out,
*  the impact of that bullet hitting an animal forces it to mushroom out.
*  It creates a lot of trauma and shock.
*  And that's what kills the animal.
*  A bullet that goes through something like that would create like a pencil hole.
*  It wouldn't do nearly as much damage.
*  It would be far less effective.
*  And they would re-engineer the bullet to have more of a deformity when it hits
*  things because there's a value in bullets deforming when they hit things.
*  That value is it creates a deeper, more fucked up.
*  Internal damage.
*  Yeah. Bullets don't act like that with the only exception.
*  And this is a recent exception.
*  They use solid copper bullets in some cases.
*  And even those solid copper bullets, they get to mushroom out.
*  Because I shot an elk in California with a rifle and we use copper bullets
*  because California has laws against lead.
*  Oh, of course. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And those, I have the bullet at home.
*  It came out all fucked up like that.
*  There's the other bullets they have.
*  Oh, they did the same thing with?
*  Yeah. I guess these were found evidence.
*  At the scene?
*  Fragment of bullet that fatally wounded the president would be this one.
*  Yeah, that makes more sense.
*  Look at that.
*  Yeah. It's a fucking chunk that looks like it exploded.
*  The other one looks perfect.
*  But the other thing that drives me crazy is people say, well,
*  and to lean the other way, they say, well, the scope on the rifle
*  didn't even wasn't even lined up right.
*  Well, how the fuck do you know it wasn't lined up?
*  All you have to do is drop a rifle and the scope is off.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's exactly right.
*  And also it was a very easy shot.
*  I mean, I will say that wasn't that hard.
*  It wasn't. It wasn't.
*  Everybody says no one could have made that shot.
*  Like, I could have made that shot.
*  You got to get in good.
*  You got a slow moving vehicle moving away from you in line.
*  Exactly. Exactly.
*  No wind. And you have a rest.
*  You're off. You're leaning off the window.
*  Yeah. That 100 percent could have been made by a person.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And not just one shot.
*  I think they could have got off all three.
*  I think that's provable, too.
*  I think especially you're all jacked up with adrenaline.
*  You've been practicing racking those bullets in there.
*  You could have got it off.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's that part of it is
*  I think that is
*  easy to understand.
*  Again, I'm not to
*  disappear down that rabbit hole.
*  I do find it always interesting because I'm still fascinated
*  by the Martin Luther King thing because it's a rare day
*  when I look at something and go, yeah, that really is
*  horse shit there.
*  But you were talking about how James Earl Ray,
*  the guy who shot Martin Luther King, was
*  funded. Like, clearly he was a loser,
*  had nothing going on in his life.
*  We talked about this before. Right.
*  Yeah. He's just a petty criminal and not a good one.
*  Right. Always caught. Always, always caught.
*  And then suddenly
*  he manages to reinvent himself, goes on the road,
*  disappears, lays low, comes out,
*  looks like a professor when he ends up in
*  Europe after the shooting.
*  You know, buys a Mustang,
*  you know, for cash, you know, more cash than the kid probably
*  or the guy I probably ever saw.
*  It's just there's too many things here that just make
*  it look like that.
*  It's just and so
*  I'm not a, again, I'm not a conspiracy
*  guy, but I look at that one and I go that, you know, over
*  all these years and we weren't able
*  to kind of get to the bottom of it, you know, speaks to
*  sort of the
*  I don't know, just a sinister
*  nature of it, I think.
*  I would never say
*  I'm not a conspiracy guy because I love conspiracies.
*  I think they're awesome. There's so much fun.
*  But I don't buy all of them.
*  I think there's a lot of them that are bullshit, but a lot of them are real.
*  That's the problem with the term conspiracy theorist.
*  People don't ever want to be called a conspiracy theorist because it makes you look like a fool.
*  Fortunately for me, everyone knows I'm
*  a fool. So I can say that I enjoy
*  I can enjoy conspiracies, but I
*  also could say if I'm being honest, I
*  know that for sure people have
*  conspired to do things.
*  In particular, when you're talking about in the 1960s,
*  it's there's evidence, there's a tremendous amount of evidence
*  that people conspired to do a lot of different things.
*  I mean, there's there's so
*  much evidence that, you know,
*  there's there's like, first of all, the Gulf of Tonkin incident
*  that got us into the Vietnam War.
*  That's a conspiracy.
*  That's a proven conspiracy.
*  They lied about attacks on America
*  so that they can get us into the Vietnam War.
*  Yeah, that's a conspiracy.
*  How about Operation Northwoods?
*  That's a conspiracy signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
*  They were going to fake attacks
*  on American civilians.
*  They were going to blow up a drone jetliner.
*  Blame it on Cuba.
*  They were going to arm Cuban friendlies and attack
*  Guantanamo Bay signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
*  vetoed by Kennedy.
*  That is a conspiracy.
*  This is all during that same time period.
*  Yeah, I don't even know if a conspiracy is the right word for it.
*  It's a plan.
*  It's a plan.
*  That's an operational plan.
*  Right. And they conspired to do it.
*  Yeah, that's OK. Fine.
*  All right.
*  Isn't that what a conspiracy is?
*  I guess that is a conspiracy.
*  The problem is the term.
*  Yeah.
*  The term makes you seem like a fucking idiot.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Like you're putting on a hat.
*  So serious people, which fortunately for me,
*  I'm not one of those serious people that want to be taken seriously.
*  They tend to shy away from conspiracies.
*  Yeah.
*  Conspire. But I smoke a lot of marijuana.
*  And so I like those conspiracies.
*  I find them attractive.
*  I go, huh?
*  No, no.
*  Hey, what about that?
*  Hence, hence the UFO thing.
*  Yeah. Ah, the aliens.
*  So last time I saw you, I don't think the Pentagon had come out
*  because it was actually during the pandemic where the Pentagon came out.
*  I don't think we talked about this last time, did we?
*  I don't think so.
*  Where they said they've recovered alien crafts.
*  They said we have recovered crafts that are not from this world.
*  Is that exactly what they said?
*  Pull it up, young Jay.
*  Pull that up, that exact quote from the Pentagon.
*  It's actually,
*  that was the guy from Vegas, the guy from Nevada.
*  What is his name?
*  The, is he a senator from Nevada?
*  Harry Reid?
*  Harry Reid? Yeah.
*  Someone that was a former senator?
*  Pentagon former contractor was the one that said it.
*  Oh, you're thinking of, yeah, you're thinking of,
*  he's got an aerospace business out there that was funded in part by taxpayer money.
*  It was sort of a pet project of Harry Reid's in a sense.
*  I'm struggling to remember the guy's name.
*  I should remember it because we've talked about it.
*  Lear?
*  No, no.
*  Aerospace buddy of Harry Reid's.
*  Can we Google that?
*  Is that the Skinwalker Ranch guy?
*  No, no.
*  This is,
*  this guy is, they've actually still got a business.
*  He's still developing it right now.
*  I think what he's trying to do is develop
*  portable living.
*  Yeah, that is the Skinwalker Ranch guy.
*  That is, right?
*  Yeah.
*  OK, sure.
*  That is the guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, yeah. I know who you're talking about.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  The name's on the tip of my tongue.
*  I know.
*  But if he's the one who said it, then, yeah, it doesn't come from the government.
*  You know, the A-Tip, which is that advanced aeronautical threat
*  identification program, I mean, I think the most interesting thing
*  that the government has come out and said is that, yes, we did have a,
*  we did have an operation within the Pentagon, an office within the Pentagon,
*  you know, that was there to identify unidentified threats.
*  Right. So we get something up in the air and we can't identify it.
*  It's like the Tic-Tac sightings by David Fravor.
*  Yeah. And those guys.
*  David Fravor, for anybody who wants to, who's interested in this,
*  please listen to him on the Lex Friedman podcast, because I had him on,
*  but I had him on with Jeremy Corbell,
*  who's the the documentarian behind that Rob Lazar, Bob Lazar movie.
*  And by himself, Fravor and Lex, they get deep into the technical
*  specifications of their aircraft and why he believes that no known aircraft
*  could have ever operated the way it is.
*  And also how it was blocking their tracking devices, which is technically
*  it's an act of war, but also it showed that it was it was aware of them.
*  Yeah, he's very credible.
*  He's extremely credible.
*  And he's a good guy.
*  I've talked to him a handful of times,
*  sat and reviewed the gun camera footage with him as he's walked through it.
*  Very credible. Right.
*  So that was kind of that was a perfect example of why they had set up ATIP,
*  right within the Pentagon, apparently not funded anymore as an operating
*  office, because they probably got some new shit that they can't tell you about
*  because that one got out there to close it down.
*  That's in the New York Times.
*  I do. That is what they do.
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, hey, or you reallocate the, you know, it's all on the budgets,
*  which is again kind of why we do this this show for Science General called Black
*  Falls, because we're chasing the budget.
*  Finally got to that. I know. Right.
*  Jesus Christ. I know.
*  We're two hours in.
*  I got like two other promos to do.
*  I haven't even touched yet.
*  So I can help people to think, wow, he's really slow this time.
*  But yeah, if you follow the money, it's like an investigation, right?
*  If you have not so much follow my but if you if you start pulling on those threads
*  around budgets or it's like with an investigation and asset tracing, you know,
*  getting getting bank records is absolutely key if you can legally get them
*  during the course of an investigation.
*  But
*  with with military operations, oftentimes those, you know,
*  those budgets for the most interesting
*  projects and operational elements get buried into something else.
*  That's just the way it works.
*  Right. And so that's where you maintain secrecy, to maintain secrecy.
*  But that's that's it.
*  So it's it's an exercise.
*  And and we don't we know, obviously, with Black Falls, we don't identify anything
*  that's currently classified because we'd all end up in the who's gal.
*  But we we're looking at some pretty interesting things.
*  And it's and it speaks to
*  where programs are going currently.
*  Right. You look at some things in the recent past and you say, OK,
*  this is where this new development is heading.
*  And isn't it it's there.
*  It's an interesting conversation, too, because for people that don't like
*  secrecy and they don't think we should have secrecy for national security and for
*  the development of things, you know, like the stealth bomb or like a lot of other
*  things that show that we have military superiority over our our enemies.
*  It's important to have secrecy.
*  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
*  You can't function as a secure and safe and lasting republic without it.
*  Right. There's just no way.
*  Now, you know, people will say, oh, we should have transparency around everything.
*  No, no, you got to draw the line.
*  You you got to you want to not overdo it.
*  Right. So you want to that's where I was going to get to.
*  Right. But I mean, we do it part.
*  But you've got it. You've got to have the ability to protect sources and methods.
*  You've got to have a sort of a need to know policy around certain things.
*  Right. Within national security concerns and the intelligence community.
*  But, yeah, again, it's it it can be used as a weapon.
*  You know, you can over again, overdo it.
*  And but if you don't have security, you don't have the Manhattan Project.
*  Right. No, absolutely.
*  Yeah, we don't. I mean, you don't have many things.
*  Yeah. You think about the safe.
*  You think about.
*  China, look at this.
*  Now I'm deep into the show and I'm just now bashing China for their theft of economic
*  intelligence, but you look at the effort that they make in terms of stealing our
*  intellectual property and research and development.
*  I mean,
*  the idea that you don't protect your most critical information, whether it's
*  operationally important or whether it's just, again, R&D for development of
*  materials and that speaks to the strength of your economy.
*  And, you know, so, yes, certain things have to be kept secret.
*  But again, you can overclassify things, which tends to happen.
*  You tend to just because you're trying to protect everything.
*  Right. So I'm just going to overclassify.
*  And and that also creates a problem.
*  So, you know, trying to strike a balance,
*  it's a human endeavor, so you never really get it right.
*  I don't think. But well, this is where people feel like the line when it when it
*  comes to alien spacecrafts and if the government knows and is aware of alien
*  spacecrafts and alien technology, this is where the line of secrecy and being sworn
*  to oath where it crosses over into a need to know for the general public.
*  Bob Lazar story, the story about him working for S4.
*  He was a physicist for Los Alamos Labs.
*  That's been proven. He was on the employee list there.
*  He also was listed in a newspaper article when he put a jet engine in a Honda
*  that he was a
*  physicist at Los Alamos Labs.
*  He was a propulsion expert, says he worked for area S4 and says he was hired
*  to back engineer UFOs and says they never could figure out how these things worked
*  and that they were never going to because they really couldn't because they were
*  trying to keep everything secret.
*  They couldn't share all this information with the general scientific community.
*  And he's like, science doesn't work in these containment bubbles.
*  You can't compartmentalize science and have only the these a few small propulsion
*  experts sit around and try to figure this thing out.
*  And then they fire and bring new guys in and no one ever gets it.
*  Which is what you can use against them.
*  And if I'm if I'm trying to pull information out of of of
*  another nation, right, if I'm targeting intelligence from
*  developing some new ballistic missile system or whatever it is, propulsion system,
*  then yes, I'm going to I'm going to play off of that desire on the part of engineers
*  and scientists to have a collaborative community.
*  And that's and the Chinese do that very well.
*  Right. And particularly when they target
*  Chinese Americans working here in the US and potentially sensitive positions.
*  You know, this idea that we're all working together, you know, and this is this is
*  just what we should be doing.
*  You know, we've done my my company has done
*  work trying to protect information for
*  companies, pharmaceutical companies, is a good example where the scientists,
*  the engineers, the doctors need that free flow in their mind.
*  They've got to have this free flow in this this this collaborating and the sharing
*  of information. And meanwhile, you've got the other side,
*  you know, where the the bean counters and security personnel and all that.
*  And they're going like, no, this is the lifeblood of our company.
*  We can't risk losing this information.
*  So we've got to lock it down to the degree we can.
*  Those two things don't necessarily coexist all that well together,
*  but you got to try to find some some medium.
*  So, yeah, I think, you know, there's the
*  the the the the fact that the government came out and talked about a tip.
*  I think that was a big step. Right.
*  That's a big deal for them. Right.
*  I mean, that that they would discuss that.
*  Do I think that they're hiding?
*  I, you know, again, I don't take anything.
*  I wouldn't take anything off the table,
*  right, frankly, because I don't know.
*  So it would be it would be
*  stupid of me to say, no, they definitely aren't holding on to some.
*  Propulsion system that isn't of this world or whatever.
*  I don't know it. I can't say absolutely not,
*  but wouldn't you want to know, though?
*  Oh, sure. Yeah. Yeah.
*  But how I mean, you know, what do you do?
*  I mean, grease a few palms.
*  Is that it? Yeah.
*  Get in there. Yeah.
*  I want to see it. Yeah.
*  I guess you could do that.
*  I'd let the government know right now.
*  Listen. Yeah.
*  I'll say a lot of shit that's not true.
*  Just get me to the UFOs.
*  Show me the UFOs and I'll lie.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  No, we're doing it. It is.
*  It's not true.
*  It's I'm lying. I'm telling you right now.
*  Don't tell me.
*  I'm lying.
*  Yeah. Because if you tell me, I'm telling everybody.
*  He's telling everybody. Yeah.
*  That's a lie. Look, they know that.
*  I'm sure they know. They know that.
*  They're writing it down right now.
*  Whatever happens, happens.
*  It's too bad.
*  I really want to know.
*  I tell everybody.
*  I agree with anybody.
*  It was interested.
*  Pay attention to look.
*  There's a handful of interviews with Fravor, Commander Fravor.
*  Yes.
*  But the Lex Friedman one is my favorite.
*  Because they go on for I think it's three and a half hours.
*  It's really good.
*  And they talk about all kinds of things about flying and pilots and
*  the fact that you always have the same two pilots working together,
*  pilot and co-pilot, and they, you know, in the military.
*  It's very different than civilian airliners that these guys work together.
*  They understand each other and they develop sort of the way Lex described it,
*  a sort of a mind meld between the two.
*  It's a really good interview.
*  And he goes into depth about also the criticisms by these debunkers that don't
*  understand the equipment.
*  They don't understand what they're saying when they're when they're trying to
*  debunk it, they're debunking it in a preposterous way.
*  They really don't understand what would happen.
*  That thing that they followed went from 60,000 feet down to one
*  feet above sea level in less than a second.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's not like it wasn't picked up on radar.
*  It's not like it's just one person or the guys in that particular
*  platform that saw it.
*  So,
*  yeah, it's a really compelling, fascinating example of this and still unexplained.
*  Right. Obviously, still unexplained.
*  Still unexplained.
*  And when Fravor talked about it, when he first saw it,
*  he was communicating with the other people that were on the other end of the radio.
*  And they were saying, we are in contact with these things all the time.
*  We see these things every few weeks.
*  Yeah.
*  They don't know what the fuck it is.
*  And he was going he described it in depth.
*  I'm doing a disservice by paraphrasing him.
*  But he was saying, OK, guys, what what the fuck is this?
*  And they were saying, yeah, exactly.
*  Right. And we've been seeing these every couple of weeks.
*  We'll see one.
*  We don't know what it is. We have no idea.
*  It was well aware that they were following it.
*  It blocked their tracking, turned and faced them.
*  And no sign of no visible sign of a propulsion system.
*  No signatures.
*  No nothing.
*  And then moved off in an insane rate of speed to the point where they couldn't
*  track with the human eye and it disappeared and then reappeared 30 miles away.
*  Like they were saying the way the thing moved, they can't explain it.
*  And they think there's something under the water as well.
*  I think it was it was hovering over the water and there was actually something
*  that was actually under the water.
*  Yeah.
*  Some dolphin.
*  Dolphin.
*  Look it up going like an octopus.
*  The boss, boss octopus is pulling the levers.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, again, it is it's fun.
*  It's fun, man.
*  It's fun.
*  And but do I think that there's
*  aliens that they come periodically visit and just observing go, oh, fuck.
*  And then leave.
*  You know, it does raise the question as to why we if they've actually visited
*  and they've been here, are they just for observation and then they get fed up
*  with the way we act and well, I think if you were observing another
*  advanced civilization, like say if we like, but here's a good example.
*  I will say that.
*  I mean, it's all relative, right?
*  Because if if we're looking at that, we say, OK, say the Tic Tac was was,
*  you know, from some other world,
*  then them looking at us, they're not going to go look at us and go,
*  it's an advanced civilization.
*  Of course they would.
*  Yeah.
*  I think they'd look at us and go like, OK, it's it's some rudimentary life.
*  But see, I don't buy that.
*  I don't think so.
*  No, because we study fucking butterflies.
*  How many assholes spend most of their life looking at bugs?
*  Maybe to whatever this is.
*  We're nothing more than a
*  a butterfly. Right.
*  And so why wouldn't they observe us the way we observe bugs?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, people spend their whole life tracking sloths.
*  No, they really do.
*  You know, there's a lot of people that that spend their whole life studying plants.
*  The idea that we if we found an advanced life form, say if we went to another
*  planet and we found some early Neanderthal types that were just
*  starting to use Flint tools, we would study them hard.
*  We would be fascinated.
*  We would even if they were like, oh my God,
*  they're like three hundred thousand years behind where we are right now.
*  We would still follow them up badly.
*  Yeah.
*  But we would follow media.
*  And I think one of the things we would do is we would probably try to do it
*  secretly the same way we do with indigenous tribes like North Sentinel Island.
*  That's the island off the Indian Ocean that has a small population of people.
*  I think it's down to like thirty nine people.
*  And you're it's like against international law to visit.
*  And that one guy went and visited a couple of years ago and they lit them up
*  with arrows. Remember that guy?
*  I remember that. Yeah.
*  He's going to show him Jesus came out with the Bible.
*  That that's a perfect example.
*  Like you're not supposed to go there.
*  Those are human beings just like you or me.
*  But they have the misfortune of developing on this very small island where their
*  ancestors left Africa sixty thousand years ago.
*  Some people might look at what we're going
*  through right now this past week and think it's not such a misfortune.
*  Yeah, it's looking pretty good.
*  Well, with them, I think there's a lot of inbreeding.
*  This is such a small genetic sample.
*  So it's a small genetic group to draw from.
*  But I think that if aliens came here from another planet, first of all,
*  they would know for sure that we already split the atom.
*  They would know that we have the power of nuclear weapons and that we have enough
*  nuclear weapons aimed at each other to decimate all life on Earth multiple times over.
*  I think they would think that's pretty fucking advanced.
*  They would know that we can send video through the sky.
*  They would know that we can capture time in the form of pictures and film.
*  I think they would be aware that we are on the cusp of some pretty wild shit.
*  We're sending Teslas into space that are currently zooming around Mars.
*  Where the fuck they are.
*  I just went through that.
*  I took my truck to the car wash the other day in Boise.
*  And there was a Tesla that was sitting over on the side and the lady was giving
*  the manager hell because she'd taken her Tesla through the car wash and it like
*  knocked off the side view mirror and it was clearly a new car for her.
*  And she couldn't even take it to the car wash without losing a piece or a part.
*  And I thought it wasn't a good ad for Tesla, frankly.
*  But what kind of car wash?
*  One of them automatic ones?
*  Yeah, it was what do they call it?
*  Touchless car wash.
*  Those things can be brutal.
*  But I have a Tesla.
*  They're well made, man.
*  Yeah, I think that car wash is a piece of shit.
*  So you've turned it around.
*  I see what you're saying.
*  He's going to tell us to step up.
*  Tell them, look at you guys.
*  There you go.
*  You'll be careful when you do that.
*  Yeah.
*  Bring those side view mirrors in.
*  I think that's actually in the manual.
*  If you turn if you go in the manual,
*  but it says before you go through a car wash, bring those mirrors.
*  I went to the car wash.
*  I didn't do shit.
*  I let them get slopped around.
*  I didn't do anything.
*  They're fine.
*  I almost I almost went to the car wash one time with one of my dogs in the back.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Because I completely forgot.
*  Running a couple of chores and there's Hendrix in the back of the truck.
*  And I said, I should go through and the guy waves me down and says, your dog.
*  He's dirty.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Kill two birds with one stone.
*  He'd be fine.
*  Water and soap.
*  The dog's going to be fine.
*  Big 120 pound retriever.
*  He knows how to handle it.
*  Yeah.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Relax, car wash guy.
*  I know. Oh, my God.
*  We got we got we got you got pets.
*  You got a retriever.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. And they're the best.
*  They are fantastic.
*  We've got now we've got we've got that one.
*  Yours is 120 pounds.
*  A big boy.
*  That's a huge retriever.
*  He's a big ass dog.
*  Would you feed him CIA steroids?
*  We do. Yeah.
*  Yeah, because I still I still get those.
*  I haven't been in for a while, but, you know, that's
*  why I think the world of the director, because they still send me that chat.
*  But so, yeah.
*  So then we got we got this big what they call them golden doodles.
*  Right.
*  OK.
*  And she's supposed to be small.
*  She's getting to be taller and bigger than he is.
*  So she's she's like six or seven months old and she's a monster already.
*  Really?
*  And then we got now we got another one of our cats die or our last cat died.
*  And so we thought, OK, that's it.
*  We're going to simplify life.
*  And then we were at the at the store and they had like a rescue cat thing going on.
*  So we ended up with a rescue cat.
*  And then we were out and a fox got in the barn, killed this mama cat and all the kittens.
*  And there was only one survivor.
*  This was a couple of weeks ago.
*  So now we got like this entourage again.
*  Right.
*  Because now we so we kept this kitten and I thought we can't keep this little tiny,
*  you know, it's like a two week old kitten.
*  We've been bottle feeding this thing now for the past two and a half weeks.
*  And it's cute.
*  It's a very cute and it's a tough son of a bitch.
*  Right.
*  It's going to be a great cat around the house.
*  But it's just like now I'm waiting to get like a farm duck and chickens and a goat.
*  And people have love, hate relationships with foxes because they're beautiful.
*  They're kind of cool.
*  They like to hang around people, but they will kill your fucking cat.
*  They'll kill your chickens.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a fucking circle of life.
*  There's cats.
*  You know how many birds those domestic cats kill?
*  Holy shit.
*  That's all they do.
*  Stunning.
*  Yeah.
*  So, you know, it's one of those things.
*  An animal killing another animal, unless it's like, you know, some abused,
*  you know, fighting dog that has been.
*  Yeah.
*  And while it's just the way it works.
*  It's just a circle of life.
*  Yeah.
*  I watched a really bizarre documentary on Vice the other day about cats in Australia.
*  And one of these guys, his whole house was filled with stuffed cats.
*  And he has stuffed cats like you take the head off and it's like a fucking mason jar.
*  And he has cats.
*  He takes the cats and he skins them and he makes coats and jackets and hats out of them.
*  So this guy's wearing like a cat hat and a cat jacket.
*  He's got dead cats all over his house.
*  But what he any he has a book with a meticulous detail of every cat he's ever killed.
*  Well, this is the thing.
*  You know, the situation with cats in Australia.
*  Well, the feral cats.
*  I used to work on a sheep station out in Australia.
*  In the middle of nowhere.
*  And so, yeah, you'd go be you'd be working the fence line or repairing the fences.
*  And you put your hand down all of a sudden.
*  You had to wear gloves.
*  Right. But you put the hand in all of a sudden.
*  It's like this little cat had come out of nowhere.
*  Right. Some burro.
*  Yeah. This is the guy.
*  So he's got these stuffed cats all over his house.
*  Like, look at this.
*  He's his whole fucking house is filled with cats and he's a cat killer.
*  I mean, this is and I know.
*  Look, I have cats.
*  It's a toilet roll holder.
*  That's got it's got a lot of different things.
*  He's cats for. Yeah, I'm not anti cat.
*  I just want everybody to know.
*  But this these are feral cats that were introduced to Australia.
*  I forget what they're introduced to kill off.
*  But the problem is they bred at a spectacular rate and they become a huge
*  problem for the native species.
*  So they've they've decimated and sent into extinction a bunch of ground nesting
*  birds and all sorts of different animals.
*  And so now there's a bounty on wild cats, feral cats in Australia.
*  And this gentleman is making a good living, skins them, which is really weird.
*  Like he doesn't just kill them.
*  And in the video, you see him shoot him and skin him.
*  So he traps them.
*  He I think there's other people in this video that run around hunting them.
*  And is there more with the one way to skin a cat?
*  And did he answer that question?
*  Yes.
*  Look, everybody was wondering.
*  Maybe that's where it came from.
*  I think that's where it came from.
*  So these are all the I think they were brought because of the rabbits.
*  I think they were trying to solve a rabbit problem.
*  I think you might be right.
*  Meanwhile, they killed all these lizards and bugs.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  No, they're they're they're all over the place.
*  And people say, oh, kitten.
*  And they just like they launched themselves at you.
*  And that's pretty fucking mean.
*  They're also kept as pets in Australia, which is really weird.
*  Yeah.
*  One of the major invasive species that causing detrimental effects to indigenous
*  wildlife due to predation for biosecurity reasons.
*  Any cats that are imported to Australia
*  must meet conditions set by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.
*  I wonder what those conditions are.
*  Yeah, you got to cut their teeth out.
*  Yeah, I was going to say, I got the teeth removed and the claws removed.
*  Yeah, Australia, it's full of it's like the Everglades.
*  Everything down there wants to wants to kill you.
*  It wants to bite you and kill you.
*  They're good.
*  God, they're wild people, man.
*  I tell you, Everglades is a fascinating place.
*  I don't know why I'm just now I'm talking about the Everglades.
*  People are going, what the fuck is he talking about?
*  The other, you know, they found Nile crocodiles there now.
*  Yeah, they found they found a panther inside an alligator down there.
*  Yeah, this is crazy.
*  Think about that.
*  I know there's all sorts of shit.
*  I mean, that's amazing what you can find when you start reading about.
*  But but that's that's a place where invasive species are a real problem.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  Pythons, yeah, pythons.
*  And that's a whole series of other things that they've got cooking down there.
*  But they caught a 20 footer the other day.
*  Good God. Yeah.
*  See if you can find that 20 foot python.
*  It's so thick.
*  Yeah, it's like like a quarterbacks leg.
*  They have these hunts down there, you know, a little competition.
*  Nobody's trying to order back.
*  Yeah. Quarterback is it's the biggest guys.
*  You know what I saw?
*  I saw the other day I saw Tom Brady in a Buccaneers uniform and it was kind of strange.
*  It's weird. It is weird.
*  It is weird.
*  I was 18 foot.
*  Look at the size of this fucker.
*  Look how fat that thing is.
*  Imagine seeing that.
*  Look at the size of it.
*  These guys.
*  Now, meanwhile, here's the thing.
*  Here's what's really ridiculous about California.
*  Let's get back to California being stupid.
*  They're an invasive species, pythons, and they're hunted and they have to be like
*  they're trying to track them down and kill them in fucking California.
*  You can't even buy Python skin things.
*  These are these are things that people are trying to kill.
*  They're trying to kill them.
*  So what happens if you kill them?
*  You can't even use the resource of their skin to make handbags or shoes or belts
*  or whatever. They won't allow you to import Python to California now.
*  You probably have to take it.
*  And if you kill one, you probably have to take it to the Fish and Game Department.
*  Right.
*  Otherwise, if you dispose of it improperly, then you can be in Florida.
*  I'm sure there's something that you want flinging out in the ocean because they're
*  in Florida that they're killing most of these things.
*  But also alligators.
*  Similar situation.
*  Alligators are they're not endangered species.
*  They're in abundance.
*  You can't buy alligator skin things in California anymore.
*  Crocodile skin can't buy them anymore.
*  Like what the fuck is wrong with people?
*  Well, but it's also it's the continuing.
*  Look, it's interesting if you think about what the fuck is wrong with people.
*  And then you see that the rate of movement of citizens out of California and to other
*  locations. Yeah, it's stunning.
*  It's stunning.
*  And then you think about, OK, like George is a good example in this election, right?
*  George is turning right.
*  So George is may well end up having become a blue state.
*  I mean, why?
*  Well, people coming from out of state, we get that happening in Idaho.
*  People coming in from out of state.
*  And you'd like to think again, going back to the very first thing we talked about,
*  self-awareness, you'd like to think they say, I'm leaving this place.
*  It's it's it's got some problems.
*  I'm going to go somewhere else.
*  You know what, though?
*  I'm not connecting the dots.
*  I'm going to I'm going to just say that it has nothing to do with the way that I
*  voted in the past.
*  I'm sure things will be fine here if I continue that.
*  Yeah. Well, that was the conversation that I had with the governor last night.
*  Oh, oh, it's long lines.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Texas is close to turning blue.
*  And he's like, don't make this state what you fled.
*  And he makes some very good points.
*  And a lot of other people do, too.
*  Economic freedom, the freedom to be an entrepreneur, the freedom to to start
*  businesses and not be overregulated, all of those are real problems in California.
*  They're giant problems.
*  They impede business.
*  California businesses succeed in spite of all the regulation, not because of all
*  the regulation. And you can't if you if you squash that that entrepreneurial spirit,
*  right, if you take away incentives, if you take away just the idea that, you know what,
*  maybe, you know, I got I got a great job, but I also got an idea.
*  You know, maybe I want to pursue that idea
*  right and see whether I can I can turn it into a business.
*  If you get rid of that by either by
*  regulations or just by disincentivizing, you know, people from starting a business
*  or from creating something from just it could be just a flash of an idea that
*  they've got, you know, I don't I'm going to sound like I've got rose colored
*  glasses on, but that was part of the thing that makes this country so special.
*  Right. And,
*  you know, I do look at I look at California and I look at the movement of people out
*  there and I and Idaho again being one of those places where a lot of folks end up.
*  And you could see you could see that happening.
*  You could see suddenly, you know, a business friendly state starting to turn.
*  And that's
*  so, yeah, it's if you don't like where you are and you're moving,
*  maybe maybe look in the mirror and think about maybe I want something different.
*  Maybe I should vote differently.
*  Well, one of the things that Governor Abbott was telling me is that,
*  fortunately, there are a lot of people that are coming from California that are
*  self aware and are voting differently than they voted in the past because they're
*  realizing what they fled and they're they're actually voting for
*  traditional Texas politics like the way it's always been here.
*  It was relatively close here.
*  Yeah. I mean, I think they were expecting they spent a ton of money down here,
*  right on the races.
*  And I think they were expecting that it was going to it was going to turn Texas
*  blue. Oh, my God. Yeah.
*  Yeah. You know what?
*  Just again, this idea that it had everywhere.
*  Well, you're in the blue dot.
*  This is the blue dot.
*  Well, it's like Boise Boise is a blue dot in a red state.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know about the hippies.
*  You guys have do we call them hippies anymore?
*  You guys have grizzlies.
*  You can take care of those hippies.
*  I don't know. I trick them into going to the woods.
*  You just you don't have to be the fastest one.
*  You just have to be faster than the hippie.
*  Just figure out a way to like, come on, you guys are the CIA.
*  You know how to infiltrate, just infiltrate those organizations to get them to go
*  camping. Yeah.
*  Guys, we're going to do we're going to have a love fest in the middle of this area.
*  Just put pork chops around their neck.
*  Yeah. We're just going to hang our meat up.
*  That doesn't sound right.
*  But
*  good. Yeah.
*  Hey, speaking of entrepreneurs,
*  this is where I bring in a second promo.
*  It only takes me a second buddy of mine did a great thing during the pandemic.
*  He
*  while he's locked down.
*  I think everybody in the lockdown thought I'm going to get myself in shape or I'm
*  going to read the Constitution finally, or I'm going to learn a new language or
*  whatever. Right. I'm going to get jacked.
*  Yeah. I want to get jacked.
*  Most people didn't do it, though, to be fair.
*  Right.
*  And we didn't do it because we were day
*  drinking because we had to homeschool the three knuckleheads.
*  But this is a great guy, a colleague of mine had an idea,
*  developed a small business and now has got it online.
*  He's trying to make it work.
*  It's called Bird Dog Investigations.
*  You know, it may it's not for everybody.
*  It's for a specific purpose in life, right, in terms of
*  a particular sector out there.
*  But it's it's to me, it was just that thing where you see, OK, someone's actually
*  taking that time and they've run with it. Right.
*  What does he try to do?
*  Well, Bird Dog Investigations, it's a it's a it's a platform that
*  it works in a couple of different ways.
*  But one way is that the world of private
*  investigators out there, right, because that's sort of the guy's business in a way.
*  But it it helps them in their operations.
*  If you're a private investigator out in the field, right, you're you're out there
*  and you're you're taking notes, you know, the typical picture of a guy drinking
*  coffee and trying to, you know, snap a couple of pictures of whatever it is,
*  insurance fraud or whatever it may be.
*  And he's compiling all this information.
*  Maybe he's writing some of it on a cocktail napkin in his car.
*  And then he's like, he's got all this shit.
*  He's got to put it together.
*  So the problem, the thing that's missing
*  is the ability to say to punch it into a into an app, right.
*  Punch it, compile all that.
*  It takes all the photos.
*  It formats it all into a preset format that the receiver, whether it's a law firm
*  or a company, if the guy's working for a company, it just sets it all in there.
*  Now look at that.
*  Oh, God.
*  And then it could. But it's also it's also useful for large companies.
*  Like you think about you think about a company out there, a transportation
*  business like FedEx or UPS or one of those.
*  And their drivers are constantly what's happening.
*  There's this fraud out there where they get sideswiped purposely.
*  Right. Or they set up fake accidents.
*  And then people are suing a company like UPS or FedEx or DHL or whomever.
*  And it costs a lot of money.
*  It costs them a lot of money to get out of these these acts and epidemic.
*  It's a it's a real problem because it
*  involves it involves the perpetrators, right.
*  Tend to be the same. It involves law firms and involves pain
*  specialists and doctors.
*  They're all kind of they're in on this thing.
*  Right. So certain jurisdictions around
*  the country have more of a problem than others.
*  Big urban centers, as you can imagine.
*  So anyway, if the idea was this guy came out and said, you know what,
*  if the if the drivers of these vehicles have something where they can, you know,
*  take photos of the situation, punch in all the details, it goes straight into a
*  report that looks good, it goes to the company.
*  Great. Now you're not it's there instantaneously.
*  They can assess the situation.
*  They can react quicker.
*  They can identify the frauds.
*  So anyway, my whole point was it's just good to see,
*  you know, someone doing something, somebody doing something with their time.
*  And again, that entrepreneurial spirit that I just banged on.
*  About.
*  So there, that's me.
*  I worked for a private investigator when I was coming up as a comedian.
*  There was one of my jobs.
*  Really? Yeah, I was an assistant to a private investigator.
*  I didn't know that. Yeah.
*  What were you doing? Surveillance?
*  Mostly I was driving him around.
*  He lost his license for a DUI and he put out dynamite dickless Dave Dolan.
*  That's what he used to call himself.
*  He's the best. I miss him.
*  He died a few years back, but it was I was friends with him to the end.
*  But yeah, when I was 21 and I was an open mic or when I was first starting out
*  doing comedy, I needed some other gigs, you know, just something to.
*  And I said, oh, private investigators assistant.
*  This should be great. Where did you see it?
*  Was it in the paper? Yeah, yeah, I was in the help wanted section.
*  You got to explain to people what that is.
*  And just randomly.
*  So I answered this ad and it turned out that he was
*  lost his license from a DUI fucking hilarious guy and then never drank again,
*  never went to AA or anything.
*  I just got himself off the wagon.
*  He's like, all right, I got to stop doing this.
*  He crashed his car trying to run away from the cops and it's like, fuck this.
*  But really, really funny guy, like hilarious.
*  And his cousin just this is random, right?
*  I'm just answering this ad.
*  His cousin was one of the owners of one of the comedy clubs in town.
*  So his cousin was this guy Bill Downs,
*  who is one of the owners along with Paul Barkley of the Comedy Connection,
*  which was one of the main comedy clubs in Boston.
*  And so like I get to hang out with this guy.
*  And I'm telling you, at all the people that I've ever met in my life,
*  he's in the top three funniest people of all time.
*  And he's not a comedian.
*  He was fucking hilarious, just naturally funny guy.
*  And most of what we did was insurance fraud.
*  OK, yeah.
*  Most of what we did was catch people.
*  This is before the Internet, right?
*  We're talking 1988.
*  I worked for him.
*  So this is people that were mostly like we
*  caught a lady who was using her maiden name.
*  She had some little fake injury and she was getting money on the side.
*  And there was a lot of that.
*  There was a lot of people that were
*  working cash jobs while they were also getting paid.
*  So we just take pictures of them like
*  climbing roofs with fucking bundled shingles on their shoulder.
*  Like this guy was laid up in bed.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of that.
*  And there still is.
*  And that's kind of where the world of private investigators.
*  My company is not.
*  We do larger multi-jurisdictional investigations and things.
*  But the world of the P.I. hasn't really changed that much.
*  Technology has made it easier and better to some degree.
*  But it's mostly fraud.
*  But it's mostly there's a lot of the fraud.
*  There's still a lot of sort of the cheating spouses.
*  And he caught one one guy wanted to keep taking pictures.
*  Even after he's got all these pictures,
*  this bodybuilder banging his wife and he's like, hey, man,
*  you're a fucking weirdo.
*  You got to do something about this now.
*  Like I gave you your information.
*  Like, get the fuck out of here.
*  I'm not going to keep following her.
*  Keep following.
*  I might need some more photograph.
*  Yeah, he wanted that.
*  He wanted him to keep taking pictures like, bro, you got all the pictures.
*  Oh, my God. Apparently, he didn't.
*  Yeah, it was like this feeble man with this huge athletic gentleman who is
*  bringing home the beef, slinging the meat.
*  Yeah, but that's the world of the that's the world of the P.I.
*  It's a tough world.
*  But he was a funny guy.
*  How long did you do that for?
*  Wasn't that long?
*  However long it took him to get his license back.
*  I think maybe
*  maybe seven, eight months, something like that.
*  I forget. But we stayed friends forever.
*  Do you ever do any surveillance for him or anything?
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  I also, you know, I was a cute little fella.
*  I was a very boy pretty.
*  So he would use me to talk to the ladies.
*  Oh, good. OK, I wasn't sure where you're going.
*  I would have to, you know, I'd have, you know, I was a 21 year old handsome little
*  boy, so I'd go and have a full head of hair.
*  Yeah, I was cute.
*  And so I would I'd be the one that would talk to ladies and ask them questions.
*  He had these little scams he would do, like one of them would be he would know
*  someone's license plate and then he would make a couple of license plates that were
*  similar to that license plate, you know, like if your your license plate was like
*  X, Y, Z, he would make X, Y, W, X, Y, O.
*  And he would say my girlfriend was in a car accident and there was a witness
*  to the accident and the the the cop spilt his coffee on the paper and they didn't
*  get the license number.
*  And I'm hoping that you were one of the witnesses.
*  And no, I'm sorry.
*  Like what happened?
*  It was like I have someone at the DMV and they gave me these addresses for all these
*  licenses. They know most of the numbers except for the last one.
*  But I was hoping it was you.
*  No, it wasn't. What was the injury?
*  Was she OK?
*  And he would say, well, you know, she had the L5 herniated.
*  I had that, too, because he knew that she had that.
*  Of course. And so then he would schmooze with them like this one lady.
*  She was so nice. She invited us over to the house.
*  She served us coffee.
*  And I'm like, oh, my God.
*  And he's like, so what happened?
*  Well, I fell down when I was on the job.
*  She was an airline stewardess.
*  I fell down and and he goes, so you're all right now?
*  She goes, oh, yeah, I'm fine.
*  He goes, but you're getting paid for the insurance, right?
*  She goes, oh, yes.
*  Not only am I getting paid, but I'm also working under my maiden name for another
*  airline. And he was like, oh, that's great.
*  Good, good, good.
*  And then after we left, I was like, she's so nice, man.
*  She let us in. She was fuck her.
*  She's a crook.
*  She goes fuck her.
*  I was like, how can you do that?
*  That lady was so nice.
*  She had us over. She gave us coffee.
*  He didn't give a fuck.
*  He was laughing. He was.
*  That's the job, kid.
*  I should have worked for the agency.
*  Fuck her.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  Yeah, it's elicitation, right?
*  You know, that's a big part of it.
*  Can you elicit information?
*  Well, he was really good at it.
*  He was well, he was funny and he was a smooth talker.
*  And and he seemed like a good guy, like a good blue collar guy.
*  And but he liked it.
*  He enjoyed the work. He loved it.
*  He loved catching people.
*  He'd take pictures of these guys climbing ladders with the fucking shingles
*  in their back. Look at this fucking prick.
*  You're done.
*  You are fucking done.
*  And he would, you know, he'd be laughing and then we'd go eat lunch.
*  Well, shit, I had no idea.
*  Look, if you ever get down on your luck, you know, you can work for my business.
*  I don't think I'd be very secretive anymore.
*  It's really hard. That's a good point.
*  I get busted with a mask on.
*  Yeah, no, you're right.
*  That is a problem.
*  You can't really blend it.
*  But with that CIA shit that they used to turn Melania Trump's double
*  to look like Melania might be in.
*  Yeah. Give me a full head of hair.
*  Cover up my tattoos.
*  Make me look fat.
*  Give me a nice belly suit.
*  Like they did with Thor.
*  Did you ever see the fat suit they gave Thor from the Avengers?
*  No. Pretty amazing.
*  There was one of the Avengers movies.
*  They made Thor fat.
*  They're like Thor.
*  Been just drinking and not not working out anymore.
*  And he had a big belly.
*  So they put him in a crazy fat suit.
*  And they showed there's a video of the CGI.
*  It's really amazing. There it is.
*  See, this is Chris Helmsworth, who looks like Val Kilmer,
*  goddamn specimen of a man.
*  They filled them up with this fat suit.
*  So they tucked him into this thing and gave him a big fat, jolly belly.
*  See, that's what he really looks like.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah. He's probably happy.
*  He's probably happier as a fat guy.
*  He doesn't have to watch what he eats.
*  What he's happy, he was happy as a fake fat guy.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  So he can just like slap on that rubber belly and.
*  Yeah.
*  What if he wore it home? Is he married?
*  Honey, I don't know if you can wear it home.
*  I think you have to take that thing off after you're filming.
*  It's probably disgusting.
*  You're sweating like a pig in that thing.
*  Plus, if you're married to Chris Helmsworth, you're probably not thinking,
*  geez, I wonder if you'd like to do him.
*  Maybe.
*  Maybe you're tired of this Adonis slinging dick every day.
*  Like, I want to get fucked by a fat guy.
*  It's not a regular person.
*  I'm tired of this perfect specimen on top of me every day.
*  It was perfect sweat.
*  Yeah. It doesn't even sweat.
*  Oh, God.
*  So I guess I fully answered your alien question, right?
*  Not really.
*  OK. No, you skirted around it like you skirted around everything else.
*  I know. Thank you.
*  I'm always accused of.
*  Do you if you had a bet, if you had money on the table.
*  And remember, we do.
*  We do. We have a little bit of money on the president.
*  Would you would you think that aliens have been here or no?
*  If I had money, you know what I would say?
*  Ah, in the realm of what's possible in this entire world and universe that we
*  don't know anything about, I'd say yes.
*  Yeah, yeah, I'd say, yeah, because it's just so much we don't know.
*  And so I think it would be.
*  You know, again, that's that's sort of the
*  that's kind of like the operational investigative pragmatic side,
*  which says you can't rule out anything that you don't know.
*  One hundred percent.
*  When you hear a story like David Fravor, who's a super credible guy and you've
*  spoken to him. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah. What was your take on after you walked away?
*  I think there's something there that we couldn't explain.
*  And and
*  do I know there's a difference there, right?
*  So there's difference.
*  It says there's something there that we can't explain that,
*  at least with the tools that we've got currently and the technology that we've
*  got currently.
*  That's not the same thing as saying the
*  government knows what it is and is hiding it.
*  Right. Right.
*  So, you know, I'm not not taking that jump yet.
*  And because in part because, look, I worked long enough
*  for the government to know that, you know, they, you know,
*  they can't, you know, can't keep a secret.
*  Right. I mean, over a period of time, it's just very, very tough.
*  I mean, and so do I think that they could
*  everybody involved and could keep their yap shut after all these years?
*  No.
*  So that's that's the one thing that rules out the idea in my mind to some degree,
*  again, not ruling it out entirely that, you know, that it didn't happen.
*  But I think that there's there's something there that we can't explain.
*  And that definitely bears further investigation.
*  Do I think we're investigating it? Yeah, sure.
*  I think there's some element out there
*  within the military that is investigating the tic tac, as an example.
*  What Fravor saw? Absolutely.
*  I mean, we'd be silly not to, right?
*  Because, you know, that's a national security issue at that point.
*  Well, I think what would be really
*  terrifying to the government is if it wasn't aliens.
*  Like if there was a craft that could go
*  from 60,000 feet above sea level to one feet above, and it was a human created
*  thing, that means that some, unless it's us.
*  Right. Some other civilization somewhere on this planet has some kind of technology
*  that's beyond the realm of our current imagination or understanding of physics.
*  Absolutely. Which is why, again,
*  that was really the reason for creating ATIP anyway within the Pentagon was
*  because that's again, it's a national security issue, right?
*  Is it is to the Chinese?
*  Have they developed some propulsion system?
*  We don't know about it. The Russians done that.
*  I mean, there's only so many options there in terms of the countries that have
*  the resources and the ability.
*  But, yeah, so we should be investigating these things.
*  We should be looking at this.
*  Do I think everything needs to be out on the table?
*  Again, going back to what you were talking about before, is there a need for secrets?
*  Well, sure. Yeah, there are some needs for a need for secrecy here.
*  You think there's a need for secrecy when it comes to aliens?
*  I would say that there's
*  yeah,
*  potentially because of.
*  Yeah, that's a tough one.
*  You know what? That is a tough one.
*  I could see where you could argue if we have anything that we know about alien
*  life or technology or around any of this issue that we should just come out,
*  put it on the table.
*  My concern would be from a national security perspective, if I obviously I
*  don't know much about national security, but if I did, I would say, I don't know
*  if people could handle it.
*  I don't know if that would be the best thing for these fucking dummies out here
*  that I don't even know if they should be voting.
*  Look, they're doing pretty well handling the election week.
*  Yeah, they're doing great.
*  There's so many knuckleheads, so many knuckleheads out there.
*  If those knuckleheads found out that they
*  were aliens, how bad would they freak out?
*  How bad?
*  And also, what if there are and what if they're very rarely come here?
*  But now that we have proven that they are here,
*  how badly would other people, nefarious
*  interests in the United States and elsewhere, manipulate that information
*  and fuck with people over it?
*  Yeah, that's another real concern.
*  Like if it is proven that there is alien
*  life and that we do occasionally visited by aliens.
*  Do you know how many fucking cult members would be created?
*  How many people would manipulate that information?
*  How many people pretend to have secret insight?
*  There would be a run on tinfoil, no doubt.
*  So I think, you know, I guess,
*  yeah, I mean, you could argue the other way and say, well, if it had
*  happened or if, and again, I'm not saying that's the case, but if the government was
*  aware of visits from other worlds,
*  you know, maybe it helps people put things in perspective.
*  Maybe they don't freak out as much.
*  Maybe they just think, OK, fine, we're all together.
*  We're all in this together.
*  Right. And so maybe it unites people sort of like Independence Day.
*  And that's like the famous Reagan speech.
*  Right. You know, that famous Reagan United Nations speech.
*  You never heard that speech?
*  He's speaking in front of the United Nations in the early 80s.
*  And he said, imagine if we were visited,
*  if we received a threat from another planet, how quickly we would put aside our
*  differences. That's a good point, then.
*  Yeah. He was a smart man.
*  And everybody immediately was like, oh, my God, there's aliens.
*  Reagan's telling us he's not coming right out and telling us.
*  Yes. But he's implying that he knows something.
*  If there was an Internet back then, boy,
*  would they want fucking bonkers for that one.
*  Well, wait, what do you think?
*  I think for sure there is life out there in the universe just by sheer numbers.
*  It doesn't make sense that we're the only ones.
*  It just the universe is too old.
*  It's too big. There's too many Goldilocks planets.
*  It's too likely if it exists here.
*  And they've also found evidence of life,
*  I believe, some of the trace elements of life on Mars now.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  Haven't they found? Yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  More water than they expected.
*  Yeah. At least it just it just seems much more likely than
*  not. Well, there's hundreds of billions of stars in this galaxy alone.
*  There are hundreds of billions of galaxies in the known universe.
*  Not only that, some physicists believe that inside every galaxy, there's a super
*  massive black hole and that inside that black hole may be another universe with
*  also hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars
*  and another black hole and inside that one inside of that.
*  I mean, it might the universe might be this fractal thing.
*  And even if it's not infinite, the sheer size of it is beyond our ability
*  to comprehend when you hear the numbers, oh, it's 14 billion years old.
*  What does that even mean?
*  Does that even register?
*  Yeah. That's so big it doesn't register.
*  And that's just as far as we can see back to the Big Bang.
*  And it's entirely possible that they think
*  it's possible that the Big Bang is it's part of a series of events and that
*  there's a big bang and then an expansion and then ultimately a contraction
*  and a compression leading to another big bang.
*  And it's this cycle that goes on and on and on and on.
*  And it's always existed.
*  I think I mean, I think the key there is, hey, we don't know what we don't know.
*  And just the sheer size scope and the idea that we'd have to be pretty fucking
*  cocksure to think that we're the only intelligent life in this entire setup
*  spinning around out here on our own.
*  So but I think, you know, not to take it back full circle, but yeah,
*  it's that idea that if you don't discount ideas, don't don't, you know,
*  don't rule things out unless you've got the evidence to do so.
*  Right. And, you know,
*  yeah, anyway, I mean, it would be majorly disruptive.
*  I also think that if there was
*  some alien force, some some species that's so far beyond our current
*  understanding of propulsion and technology, they can travel here
*  instantaneously from anywhere in the universe.
*  Why would they give a fuck who the government is?
*  Why would they give a fuck who our president is?
*  Why would they give a shit who our military is?
*  They wouldn't care. No, you know, we don't we don't visit an ant colony.
*  Go take me to the queen.
*  I will not speak to you peasants.
*  They don't give a shit.
*  You know, I think they'd be so far advanced that they would just be studying us
*  with no regard to letting us know about their presence.
*  And they'd be cataloging us with all the other, you know,
*  life that they've or life forms that they've found and saying, OK, this is
*  this is how these guys behave in a social environment.
*  They're pretty fucked up.
*  And there's also the possibility that there's many different steps along this
*  pathway, right, where there's insanely advanced and then there's marginally
*  advanced, like something that's only a few thousand years more advanced than us
*  that visits us, that's much more recognizable.
*  And then things that are so far beyond our
*  comprehension and so different from such a different environment and different
*  ecosystem that we don't even know we can't even understand what they are.
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that's I think that's
*  again, it's it's arrogance to think otherwise, that that there's other things
*  out there, there's other life forms.
*  It just to me, it just strikes me as odd that someone would be so definite and say,
*  no, that's it. Maybe we find a microbe out there somewhere.
*  But that's pretty much it.
*  I think it's also comforting to people to think that we are alone in some weird way.
*  It's comforting to people to think that it's bullshit.
*  Yeah. Oh, stop with your alien stuff.
*  Just get up in the morning, have a cup of coffee and go to work.
*  Yeah. And don't worry about this this election thing.
*  Just just all. Oh, the Republic will survive.
*  It will survive. It will survive.
*  If I had one one parting message for people would be that, look, you know,
*  just like we said, chill the fuck out.
*  But but if there's irregularities that are legitimate or should be investigated,
*  this process is going to work it out right between what is it, December 8th
*  and December 14th is when everything has to be kind of finalized.
*  And then, you know, it makes its way to Congress.
*  Congress counts out on like the 6th of January.
*  We have to wait that long until December.
*  Yeah. I mean, that's what's going to happen.
*  Yeah, it's likely.
*  I mean, unless, look, I mean, by the time we're talking right now, I don't know.
*  Maybe Nevada's been decided, in which case Joe Biden's got 270.
*  Well, Jamie's going to pull that up.
*  Yeah. We're going to find out.
*  But even if he has 270, even if he has 270,
*  it doesn't mean that they stop the the legal procedures in certain locations.
*  Right. And so I think that,
*  yes, it's likely to go on much like it did in 2000, likely go on till
*  December 12th or 13th. But there is an ending to it.
*  So all these people who think, oh, my God, he's never going to leave and he's
*  going to lock himself in. It's not the way this works.
*  He doesn't get to make that decision.
*  It's a it's a legal process.
*  It's a process that on the 20th of January, his term ends and we get
*  a new president.
*  Hopefully either he continues or we get a vice president or president like Biden.
*  Hopefully or civil war because he hires his own security firm and they lock
*  everything down and they won't let that criminal Biden in.
*  And then the QAnon people become his consultants.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Yes. Yeah, there is that never rule anything out.
*  But that shit's not happening.
*  And and we were going to be just fine.
*  Again, pay attention.
*  If you're paying attention to anything,
*  pay attention to to what's happening in Georgia with those Senate races.
*  Yeah, that's that's where the that's where the balance of power really sits.
*  And that's that's left and right.
*  So the very tiny little fraction one side or the other.
*  If if neither of those races hits 50 percent plus one vote, then they both go
*  to runoffs in January and that's where they're going to open up the spigot.
*  And hundreds of millions of dollars are
*  going to flow into Georgia for those races from both sides, I'm sure,
*  because they know what this means.
*  Right. If if both of those races go to the Dems, then you got a 50-50.
*  And guess who makes a deciding vote every time there's a tie in the Senate?
*  It's Kamala Harris.
*  So the Dems know the importance of this Pelosi is already she's a very smart
*  political operative, she's focused on this.
*  I guarantee it. Right.
*  She's trying to, you know, in a way, kind of trying to save her job as speaker
*  because they, you know, they didn't do what they expected they were going to do.
*  But they know how important that Georgia race is on both of those counts.
*  So anyway, that's that's where people should be focused.
*  In four years, I'm looking forward to collecting a thousand dollars from you.
*  And maybe more if it's President Trump again.
*  Less than four years, I'll collect my
*  thousand because he's going to announce he's running.
*  That's true. And about three.
*  Yeah. Maybe three hours.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Are you ever going to make your way up to Idaho and go fishing?
*  Yes. Yes, I would love to.
*  Yeah, you got to come up and you got to do a show again up there.
*  People are boys. You keep out every time I say I'm
*  we're getting together, they're saying, oh my God, when's he coming back?
*  I said, well, not right now because you got the pandemic.
*  Yeah. You guys need to loosen your laws like Florida.
*  You could do whatever the fuck you want.
*  It's been you know what? It's been pretty good up there.
*  We get a number spike a little bit, but you know, people are surviving now.
*  Yeah. It's not like the old days.
*  You know, people keep saying the cases are up, the cases they are,
*  but also survival's up. What's magical is the flu has been down so much.
*  I think the flu is down like 98 percent, which, you know, I think something crazy
*  like that. See what the numbers flu is down this year.
*  It's something crazy.
*  And I think they're attributing that to people wearing masks, which is really
*  interesting. Yeah, maybe we need to fucking have a we become a mask wearing society
*  from now on. I hope not.
*  Yeah. No, I like faces.
*  Yeah, I like faces too.
*  And it's just, yeah, we'll get back to we will get back to normal.
*  Pandemics end.
*  That's by definition, pandemics end and we will have another one.
*  And so then you hope that we're smart enough to have learned something from this.
*  Mike Baker, always a good time talking to you, sir.
*  Appreciate it.
*  Oh, your show. When's it?
*  Oh, hey, thank you for asking.
*  Yeah, we got that show.
*  Black Files to Classify.
*  We start filming the second season in January and we are going to have an
*  interesting episode on on not necessarily on aliens, but on the program
*  surrounding the government's investigation of unidentified objects and things.
*  So we're going to dive a lot deeper into it.
*  Hopefully I'll come back and I'll have answers, specific answers for your question.
*  All right. That would be a first.
*  That I got on the Georgia election.
*  Canes.
*  Because we were looking up Dick Canes the other day.
*  Oh, my God. That's hilarious.
*  All right. Thanks, Mike.
*  Appreciate you, buddy. Goodbye, everybody.
