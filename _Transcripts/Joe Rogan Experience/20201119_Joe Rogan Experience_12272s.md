# Joe Rogan Experience #1567 - Donnell Rawlings & Dave Chappelle
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 19, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7t_LxpzYTg)
*  Joe Rogan Podcast, check it out!
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Train by day, Joe Rogan Podcast by night, all day!
*  John L.
*  Good to see you my friend.
*  Take me to the river, I wanna go, I'll go.
*  Take me to your river, I wanna go.
*  I don't even know who sings that.
*  You don't know who sings that song?
*  No.
*  Leon Bridges.
*  Leon Bridges.
*  Yeah, he's like a folk country, Sega black dude.
*  I think he's Louisiana where he's from.
*  But about five years ago he had a very popular song.
*  That was like a song that really charted well.
*  It was called The River.
*  That was that.
*  That was that song.
*  And then what he does is he-
*  You were?
*  Jamie?
*  You know that dude?
*  I've seen him before, yeah.
*  I don't know that I know that song.
*  But this song is like, he's had other songs, but for some reason this song resonated with him.
*  This song resonated with a lot of people in the country, man.
*  It was like him reminiscing with going to a place that made him feel good, in the river.
*  I hope when we go over to Spotify we can play it.
*  I go, I could take me to your river.
*  I wanna go, I'll go.
*  That's pretty much it.
*  That's the one part everybody knows.
*  It's acceptable now for people to wear like neck scarves.
*  Are you being insulting?
*  Neckar chips.
*  No, not at all.
*  What do you say though?
*  It's normal.
*  If you'd wore that on any other time, I'd be like, what is on your neck?
*  And I would explain it to be a gator.
*  Right.
*  A gator.
*  I know what it is.
*  I know what a gator is.
*  This is what it is.
*  It's my gator.
*  Yeah, you wear them when you're sneaking up on animals.
*  Or people.
*  Well that color's not, you can't sneak up on anybody.
*  Cape pride.
*  Cape pride.
*  Well there's a lot of colors in that.
*  Yeah, I guess that's a rainbow.
*  Not a traditional rainbow.
*  This is a liberal gator.
*  Yup, it's accepted by anything.
*  Gay people, black people, Hispanic people, I'm sorry.
*  No worries.
*  My baby mother asking me about weed, Jesus fuck.
*  Don't you don't like me?
*  Don't you don't like me?
*  Why you keep blowing me up about weed?
*  You said you don't like me.
*  Likes your weed.
*  I mean they like something, man.
*  What happened to your thumb?
*  I got shot.
*  Who shot you?
*  That's a question that I haven't found an answer to.
*  Really?
*  It was, this shit happened so quick, Joe.
*  I didn't really get a good look at a person, the person that shot me.
*  Not too many people around that witnessed it.
*  But I have the wound to show that I got shot.
*  What was the situation?
*  I was, my dog, I got a new dog.
*  She's adorable.
*  Listen.
*  That's as adorable as a dog gets, ladies and gentlemen.
*  Look at that little cutie.
*  Can you see her on camera?
*  Yo, this is my emotional support dog.
*  That's Maggie.
*  Yeah, that's Maggie.
*  Come here, sweetie.
*  Come here, Maggie.
*  Come here, honey.
*  She doesn't know what coffee is.
*  She's like, me?
*  She know what weed is, but she don't know what coffee is.
*  But I was protecting her.
*  Some people were trying, Joe, you want to hear the story about how I got shot or what?
*  Yeah.
*  I was protecting her honor.
*  Right?
*  I was protecting her from a hell of bullets.
*  It was a gang.
*  It was a lot of people.
*  I don't remember all of that, but I got shot in my motherfucking thumb.
*  Where were you?
*  In the streets.
*  Oh, just regular?
*  Yeah, I was in the streets.
*  No, not just the streets.
*  I was just in the streets.
*  No town.
*  No, just the streets.
*  And that happens sometimes, Joe.
*  You put yourself, you're hanging in the streets.
*  You put yourself in some unforgiving situations.
*  And that's what happened to me.
*  And that's how I got my motherfucking thumb shot the fuck off.
*  And that's the story I'm talking, that's the story that I'm sticking to.
*  So you got caught in the crossfire.
*  A hell of bullets.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  45 shots rang out.
*  Really?
*  Legitimately?
*  Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
*  Wow.
*  And this is the only injury I sustained.
*  I'm very happy that that's the only injury you sustained.
*  You're not happy about it, Joe, because when I-
*  I love you.
*  Come on.
*  I know you love me, but when I told you I got shot, you continued to question me about-
*  Well, Don-El, that's because you're Don-El.
*  Right.
*  But you continued to-
*  I didn't question you like I didn't believe you.
*  You did.
*  100%.
*  You didn't believe me.
*  But you said it so casually.
*  I said, do you want a drink?
*  You said, I can't.
*  I'm on antibiotics.
*  I said, what happened?
*  You went, I got shot.
*  That's-
*  No, usually any of my other friends who've been shot, if I said, hey man, what happened?
*  And they said, I got shot.
*  It wouldn't just end right there.
*  They would say, it's the craziest story ever, man.
*  Yeah, but you don't-
*  I'm on my way to the car, and I had my little dog.
*  Right.
*  I was protecting her and shot her.
*  And that's the story that I told, but the thing that you didn't believe me, if someone
*  said you got shot-
*  I believe you.
*  You can't say I didn't believe you.
*  That's not true.
*  The look on your face is like-
*  Well, it's unusual the way you were describing it.
*  I got shot, and then you wouldn't say anything more.
*  Black people don't-
*  No.
*  What happened?
*  How'd you get shot?
*  Well, remember I had a disagreement with so-and-so?
*  Well, we finally had an opportunity.
*  Our paths crossed.
*  We found a situation where those energies came together.
*  We was like, how are we going to settle this?
*  Right?
*  It wasn't like that.
*  I understand.
*  It wasn't like that.
*  It was a-
*  Okay, so you don't want to get specific about details.
*  No, I don't want to get specific.
*  I just want you to respect the fact that I got shot.
*  I believe that you got shot.
*  I do respect it.
*  I'm sad that you got shot, but I'm glad you're okay.
*  I'm better.
*  I'm good.
*  So how is your thumb doing?
*  Is it going to be all right?
*  Yep.
*  It's going to be good.
*  We got all the bullet fragments out of it.
*  We avoided the surgery, so I'm going to be good.
*  Just got to get the range of motion back.
*  Oh, that's real good.
*  They didn't have to do any surgery in tendons or anything like that?
*  Nope.
*  I got lucky.
*  I have a friend who cut his finger on a window, man, and he never got his fingers back again.
*  His fingers are like this, curled.
*  I know everybody knows a motherfucker like that, and we've all made fun of that motherfucker.
*  We've made fun of the person that you know that don't have a thumb, but I'm telling you,
*  I've been doing this after me surviving this gunshot shit, just buttoning my pants become a task that I took advantage, I took for granted.
*  Right.
*  The point I'm making is that you're lucky to have all of your limbs, all of your shit on your body.
*  Yep.
*  And you don't appreciate it until one of them motherfuckers gone.
*  Well, I think that's the case with everything, right?
*  We didn't appreciate how good we had it before the lockdown, before COVID came around.
*  Nobody appreciated how good we really had it.
*  We was living in the moment.
*  We were also spoiled.
*  We were spoiled by how good everything was.
*  But we didn't think it was spoiled because that was what was going on until shit shifted.
*  And then same thing, like you lose your thumb.
*  You're like, oh shit.
*  You know, I really do appreciate doing those three spots that night.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I appreciate the fact that I could just walk with my family anywhere and I wouldn't be judged.
*  I wouldn't be discriminated against, whatever.
*  It just be like, there goes Joe and his family, not just like, do you have a mask or not?
*  Right.
*  You know?
*  But I do believe that it took a pandemic for people to really realize what the most important things in life are.
*  I think so for sure.
*  I think at the beginning people were nicer because they were scared and they were like, it was almost like post 9-11 feeling.
*  Like we're all in this together.
*  That didn't last very long.
*  It was unrealistic to think that everybody's going to be that way.
*  People don't get frustrated.
*  Also resources started getting low and people started realizing they're not going to be able to work for a long fucking time.
*  Did you see the governor got busted?
*  Did you see the photos?
*  Which governor?
*  Governor of California.
*  He got busted for what?
*  Got busted going to a restaurant with 12 people, no social distancing, no masks.
*  All the shit that he's been preaching for, he didn't do.
*  They were saying that he was in outdoors.
*  Like his people said it was outdoors.
*  But now they have photos of it, 100% indoors.
*  They're all indoors.
*  But the thing is, the unrealistic part about that, you know people got to push their place.
*  Push their platform.
*  This mask shit has been crazy.
*  But me, I know it shouldn't be like this.
*  And I know it's like, but what does it represent?
*  When I see motherfuckers like that in a situation that no masks, no social distancing.
*  I just assume that they've all been tested and they've all been in a bubble situation.
*  That's because you've been in a bunch of bubble situations.
*  Like when Dave did the shows down in Yellow Springs.
*  You bubbled me first.
*  I bubble you here.
*  You're the first person, you're the first person.
*  You didn't rape my nose, you raped my finger.
*  I didn't do it.
*  Yes you did.
*  You hired a nurse.
*  You made somebody do it.
*  You could call it whatever the fuck you want to do, but she worked for you.
*  That's true.
*  And you forced that, that she had to do it.
*  Well, I just suggested it would probably be a good idea for everybody.
*  Yeah, but it was good for everybody and you knew that.
*  So we know that's a bubble world.
*  But it's not surprising that you see the governor in a situation like that.
*  Because I'm pretty sure it doesn't send out the right message, but I'm pretty sure that the motherfuckers was tested.
*  Well, that's what he should have said.
*  They can't say that because they're a politician and everybody would go, wait a minute.
*  If I just test people, can I go to work?
*  Like what Dave's doing with all his shows.
*  Test people in the audience and you can have a full audience.
*  You know you have a bunch of people that are healthy.
*  You know, you're taking the measures to create that safety.
*  It's a bubble.
*  Here's the thing that a lot of people understand is that like you could literally create your own bubble.
*  Yes.
*  Like I know people that on certain states you have to meet a certain requirement to be tested.
*  You can't be a tester unless you start showing symptoms.
*  But you can create your bubble.
*  There's testing almost everywhere.
*  There's an opportunity for people to get tested.
*  It's a little harder than that for most people because the rapid testing.
*  But most people mean state for state?
*  Most people in terms of like just people's of just your access to it.
*  It's not that common where you can go to a place and get a quick test yet.
*  Okay.
*  So then what's the difference?
*  And I may be wrong.
*  This may be my ignorance.
*  Like California, like I know the situation like a Dodger Stadium.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like for the most part, anybody with I guess a California idea, whatever, they can get tested.
*  No, but hold on.
*  You know that takes hours.
*  You know those people have to wait in line for hours.
*  There was a line.
*  To get it done.
*  Yeah.
*  But what does that matter?
*  Near our students.
*  It takes fucking if you have a job, man.
*  If you have a job and you're supposed to be at work at 9 a.m.
*  And you get to the COVID thing at 730 and they tell you it's a two and a half hour line.
*  That's what it is.
*  That's the reality.
*  And most of those aren't giving you the results immediately.
*  Not immediately, but enough where you could if you got those results to say you get those results in 18 hours.
*  Say you were going to plan a family function or something.
*  You don't do shit for 18 hours.
*  What I'm saying is like when the bubble, the idea of the bubble first started, started with the NBA.
*  You kind of contributed to that.
*  And Dave did it.
*  Well, UFC did it first.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, we did it and UFC did it first.
*  But they always thought like, oh my God, you don't have to be a millionaire to create a safe bubble for you and your family, your friends.
*  No, you can do it now easier than ever before.
*  But the problem with the governor saying it is other people will let us make a bubble and go to work because that's what they should do.
*  What they could do is what we're doing here.
*  We're just lucky that podcasting is an essential business.
*  I think she's trying to jump down.
*  She's not trying to kill herself.
*  She's just looking over the edge.
*  No, she's my emotional dog.
*  I understand.
*  Listen, if anybody's going to jump, it's going to be me.
*  I'm in tune with her.
*  Okay.
*  She's the most adorable little dog I've ever seen.
*  I've never seen a little dog as a puppy.
*  Maggie Rivers, she's five months old.
*  She knows her biological dad and I'm her new dad.
*  It was important for me for her to know her biological dad because I didn't want her to come from a place with like mental issues and shit.
*  I understand.
*  She's a little cutie.
*  She's my little bitch right now.
*  What kind of dog is she?
*  A chihuahua pit bull.
*  No.
*  She's a spar pit bull?
*  That dog don't look like a spar pit bull.
*  What kind of pit bull fuck they chihuahua?
*  A toy pit bull.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah, she's a toy pit bull.
*  She's a toy chihuahua.
*  Toy pit bulls are cute little dogs.
*  Yeah, she's ferocious.
*  Don't let that fucking sad-ass fool you.
*  Have you ever seen a toy pit bull, Jamie?
*  I don't think so.
*  They're really tiny.
*  We know real pit bulls like the fighting pit bulls, they were like 30 pounds.
*  They weren't big dogs.
*  The ones that they bred for fighting.
*  The smaller ones are the little demons.
*  I don't even know if I can remember ever seeing a small pit bull.
*  Yeah.
*  Brian Callan used to have a small pit bull.
*  It was a tiny one and it was ferocious.
*  That's where he gets his personality from.
*  It's not him.
*  No, he bought it.
*  It's his animals.
*  We went to a guy who raised them for fighting.
*  Oh, shit.
*  Yeah.
*  We were like in our 20s.
*  Mostly puppies, but.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Look how tiny.
*  Damn, that little motherfucker look tough as shit.
*  The black one.
*  The Black Lives Matter one, sir.
*  Look at his face.
*  Oh, my God.
*  That's ridiculous.
*  That dog's ridiculous.
*  See, that's the thing that they do.
*  They take these dogs and they turn them into ...
*  But they break their legs and shit like that, right?
*  Well, no.
*  They just breed them.
*  They do what's called ... They select, right?
*  So like a dog with shorter legs, they'll breed with another dog with shorter legs and they'll
*  select for certain traits.
*  Right.
*  Like I used to have a dog that was from Hawaii and they used him for hog hunting.
*  That's what they use his family for.
*  So he had long ears.
*  It was a dog specific to Hawaii?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah?
*  Yeah.
*  They breed a lot of pit bulls in Hawaii for hog hunting.
*  And what are their jobs?
*  Because most dogs have ... Do they go get birds?
*  What the fuck does it do?
*  Hog hunting.
*  Okay.
*  See, what they do is in the real thick brush, you can't really get to the hogs.
*  Like it's hard to shoot them even with a gun.
*  Like you're shooting through hundreds of yards of brush.
*  But the dogs can go in there and get them and they'll hold them.
*  They'll hold the pig.
*  So there's a style of pig hunting.
*  That makes the hunting easy though, right?
*  It does, except for the dog.
*  It's not like the same kind of hunting because you're relying 100% on the dogs.
*  Usually there's two groups of dogs, depending on what animal you're ... Like if they hunt
*  mountain lions, they use a certain kind of dog that'll obey the dog, that'll obey the
*  mountain lion.
*  Because they hunt pigs, a lot of times they'll use an animal that lets you know where the
*  pig is and then they release other animals that hold the pig.
*  So those are the pit bulls.
*  And then you shoot them?
*  Well, they usually stab them.
*  Hand like up?
*  Yeah, it's kind of fucked.
*  So that experience is all about the dog?
*  It's the dog is the one who did it and you just finished the job.
*  Damn.
*  It's crazy too.
*  There's ... Excuse me.
*  There's videos of it, of the way they do it.
*  It's like, woof.
*  And I've been asked to go on one of those hunts.
*  I'm like, I am not interested in doing that.
*  I get it.
*  What happens when a dog gets old?
*  Do they like ...
*  They get new dogs.
*  But this is a thing that people are doing for two reasons.
*  One for food, right?
*  Because this is the best way that they can get food.
*  You can trap this animal and then that's how you're going to get the animal.
*  If you just rely on just hunting with a rifle or a bow and arrow and real thick shit with
*  wild pigs, you're probably going to go hungry.
*  So there's that.
*  The other thing is these are invasive animals.
*  They were brought over to Hawaii and they're wild and they have no predators.
*  So they have to kill them.
*  They have to control their population.
*  So did they bring them over to kill a species or something?
*  I know that ...
*  No, no.
*  They brought them over for food.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Captain Cook and those dudes used to do that shit.
*  They used to release goats on islands.
*  I don't know Captain Cook.
*  I only know Captain Crunch.
*  I know Captain Crunch as well.
*  Yeah, that's the ... I don't know Captain Crunch.
*  Delicious stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  Captain Hook was an old pirate, right?
*  What was his name?
*  Cook.
*  Cook.
*  He was a pirate too.
*  He was a Disney pirate.
*  Yeah.
*  That sounds good to hear.
*  Yeah.
*  Captain Cook, he used to go to islands and they would drop off animals so that the next
*  time they came around, they'd have something to eat.
*  That's smart.
*  Yeah, so they'd leave goats on an island.
*  I think that's how the goats got on Galapagos.
*  I think that's how they got on a lot of islands.
*  These pirates or sailors would drop these animals off.
*  But meanwhile, these animals would destroy ecosystems.
*  Yeah, but you had some fresh goat when you came back.
*  You had some fresh goat.
*  Yeah, fuck the rivers and shit.
*  They had a lot of turtles too.
*  They killed off a lot of sea turtles because they would take sea turtles and they would
*  flip them over and put them on their back and they'd be good for weeks.
*  And they would eat them?
*  Yep, they would eat them because they don't need anything.
*  They can survive just on their back for weeks and weeks and weeks and you don't have to
*  worry about refrigeration or them ...
*  Yeah, but you can't tell somebody you're hunting turtles.
*  You're not trying to do it for sport.
*  They slow as a motherfucker.
*  I fucking stalk this fucking ... I followed this turtle for three days.
*  I think they probably get them on the beach, but if you got them in the water, they'd be
*  quick.
*  Sea turtles?
*  When I was growing up, we'd catch a motherfucking turtle on the road.
*  And it was always one country motherfucker.
*  Like he used to be a mechanic in the neighborhood and he had oil up under his hand.
*  He always helped people's baby mothers with fucking changing their brake pads and shit.
*  It's one of those grimy, dirty motherfuckers that eat any type of roadkill.
*  And whenever we saw fucking a dead turtle or something, we knew that nigga was going
*  to be yelling out, turtle soup!
*  Yeah, people like turtle soup.
*  I'm not a big fan of it, but ...
*  I've never had it.
*  Yeah, it seems like it would probably be in the alligator, meaty type of family.
*  Alligator tastes good.
*  It is.
*  Everything tastes good when it tastes like chicken.
*  That's the reference for anything it tastes like chicken.
*  Yeah, I have frog legs recently.
*  They were good.
*  I've had frog legs before, but trying to convince a black person to eat frog legs is a tough
*  sell.
*  To order?
*  Yeah, to get a black person to order frog legs off of a menu is like getting them to
*  say, I want my steak rare.
*  It's always got to be well done.
*  You eat well done?
*  No, that's what I'm saying.
*  I don't.
*  Oh, but how do you eat your steak?
*  Medium.
*  Yep.
*  Not medium rare?
*  There's a lot of black people that watch this show.
*  They're going to be like, I'm going to tell you when he changed.
*  When they started talking about blood.
*  Medium rare.
*  Yeah, when they started talking about blood, that's when he lost the streets.
*  I could do medium, medium rare.
*  I can't do it.
*  I understand.
*  I've had it like that, but my preference would be medium.
*  The average circle that I grew up around.
*  My jujitsu instructor eats it well done, and when he orders it, I cringe like, John Jacque
*  Machado, well done.
*  I go, whoa.
*  Do you know what that feeling is?
*  Imagine a chef that gets to order and says, two well done steaks at table 49.
*  They're calling them every fucking racial thing today.
*  That's the quickest way to fucking make somebody order a fucking well done steak.
*  Chefs do not enjoy it.
*  Not at all.
*  They don't like cooking it like that.
*  That's a weird thing, like a preference thing.
*  If you ask people's preference, it's not like you just cook it.
*  If you order chicken, they just cook your chicken.
*  They don't ask you what temperature you'd like your chicken breast.
*  They just cook it.
*  Yeah, well, they just cook it.
*  Even pork chops, same thing.
*  They don't ask you, but with steak, they'll give you options.
*  Why the fuck are you giving me an option if I can't have well done?
*  You should just have it your way, but it's just insulting.
*  It is, but-
*  It's insulting.
*  They give the opportunity to insult because they do have that as an option.
*  Have you ever been a certain way, like judge somebody by the way they order their steak?
*  Yeah, I do, honestly.
*  But again, John Joc Machado, like I said, I have nothing but respect for him.
*  It makes me sad that he likes well done meat.
*  I know this is going to be bad.
*  People will be like, what type of brother am I?
*  But I took my sister out to eat once.
*  She ordered a steak and she ordered well done.
*  I said, I think you should order something else.
*  I said, I'm not paying for a leather belt.
*  Wow.
*  I didn't even have to eat the shit.
*  I wasn't going to do it.
*  I just felt fucked up.
*  Well, you felt judgy.
*  I didn't feel it.
*  I was judgy.
*  A little judgy.
*  Yep.
*  I was like, let that fucking hood shit go.
*  But isn't that the only food that we have that with?
*  Cheeseburgers, nobody gives a fuck.
*  If somebody says, how do you want your cheeseburger?
*  Well, in the black community, when you say cheeseburger, for the most part, that's going
*  to be well done.
*  Black people don't want to see the pink in it.
*  They'll tell you all the pink out.
*  Well, you really should with ground beef.
*  See, the thing with ground beef is you don't know what the surface area is.
*  When you're eating ground beef, right, they take a cow's whatever and they grind it up.
*  The stuff in the middle, like that could have been on the outside, right?
*  So you don't know, like when you get a steak, you sear the outside, you cook the outside.
*  There's no room for bacteria.
*  Anything that could have grown on the outside is dead and the inside you don't have to worry
*  about unless it's rotten.
*  That's why black people get their fucking hamburgers well done, Joe.
*  That's wise.
*  I'm saying for hamburgers.
*  We didn't know it, but that's just what it was for a hamburger.
*  You don't want to get food poisoning.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, hamburgers, unless you are right there when they grind it or you go to a top shelf
*  restaurant where they literally, they'll take a piece of chuck roast or even filet mignon.
*  Some of them do it with a lean cut.
*  If you get a burger that's ground out of filet mignon, you're in the right neighborhood.
*  You're in the right neighborhood.
*  They usually add fat to it, believe it or not.
*  To make it juicier.
*  Yeah, to make it juicier.
*  What is it with white people with blood, though?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, like, I know this is been said, but white people get a kick out of the rarest
*  they can order a steak.
*  The blood part of it.
*  No.
*  What?
*  Rare is weird.
*  When somebody orders rare, you know what blue is?
*  You proud of the blood, Joe.
*  No.
*  Every time you post the L picture, it's like you can't just show the meat.
*  You want motherfuckers to see the knife, and you do your picture, Joe.
*  It's like you waited for the blood to sweat at a certain temperature.
*  You know when it looks the bloodiest, and that's the shot you always get.
*  That's not what I'm trying to do.
*  What I'm trying to do is show that it's cooked perfectly, that it's medium rare with respect
*  for the meat.
*  When I do it, I use a thermometer.
*  I mean, I do it nice and slow, and I know you know how to cook.
*  Don't get crazy.
*  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
*  Don't get crazy.
*  Wait a minute, Joe.
*  Just trying to explain something.
*  Wait a minute, Joe.
*  What?
*  Yes.
*  Right?
*  And all that.
*  You well respect it, right?
*  Look at that, though.
*  Yeah, look at that, Joe.
*  Look at that.
*  It's perfect.
*  Look at that.
*  That's perfect.
*  It doesn't get better than that.
*  But you're proud of the color of it.
*  Because it's perfect.
*  It's perfectly cooked.
*  But it looks, it's like, what is it?
*  That's elk.
*  That's elk.
*  That's super athlete.
*  I argued with someone because I told them that you like elk, and I can make elk.
*  And they were like this.
*  I'm sure you can make it.
*  But they were like this.
*  Tom Papa makes it.
*  The last time I spoke to you about me cooking, you were very condescending.
*  That's not true.
*  Yes, you were.
*  You were making fun of me.
*  No, I said it the same way I said you got shot.
*  No, okay.
*  I said, you can cook?
*  Yeah, and you're right.
*  That's not condescending.
*  It is, but the way you looked at me, you looked me up and down.
*  You judged me, and then you said it.
*  That's the difference, Joe.
*  That's the difference.
*  When I said I could cook elk, you looked at me like, what the fuck?
*  Let me tell you what I've heard.
*  I heard you cook really well.
*  I heard you have amazing barbecue skills.
*  That could be borderline racist.
*  Quite a few people.
*  That could be borderline racist.
*  That could be borderline racist.
*  Isn't that your shit?
*  What is your shit?
*  Yeah, but you said barbecue.
*  Listen, barbecue is one of the most complex forms of cooking.
*  You got to be real careful.
*  You're doing it slow.
*  Too much, you fuck it up.
*  Too little, you don't do it right, and then it's hard to put it back on because it hasn't
*  been sitting at the same temperature the entire time.
*  That's the art of barbecue.
*  But when I hear barbecue, I think about the barbecue.
*  I understand.
*  Like the black barbecue.
*  With the Frankie Beverly and the whole thing.
*  It's a whole production, not just one piece of barbecue.
*  That's what I was saying.
*  Barbecue in Texas is mostly white people, I think.
*  And I will say this.
*  As far as my own personal experiences.
*  I will say this.
*  White people can fucking smoke some meat.
*  They know how to do it here, I'll tell you that.
*  When I first got it, I think it's a place called Blacks.
*  I don't know if you found a favorite.
*  Terry Blacks.
*  Phenomenal.
*  Didn't they break up?
*  Yes.
*  They broke up one person to two.
*  They used to be with the family, then the sons started on their own.
*  They started beefing with each other.
*  Literally.
*  That's the place I've been in.
*  They had some issues.
*  I don't want to air their dirty laundry on the podcast.
*  But the sons opened up a spot.
*  Something happened.
*  Something happened.
*  Somebody gave up the secret sauce.
*  Terry Blacks in town has only been open since 2014, I believe.
*  It feels like a place that's been around 100 years.
*  They got it dialed in.
*  That barbecue's off the hook.
*  It's so good.
*  Think about it.
*  If they came up generations and generations, they're just putting whatever recipe is, whatever
*  the love is.
*  They make their own smokers.
*  They use giant propane tanks and they make their own smokers.
*  Maybe that's what I enjoy.
*  Next level.
*  White people level up barbecue when they start doing the machines.
*  I should say they hire someone to make their smokers.
*  But they get this dude to make the smokers out of propane tanks.
*  They're not buying a big commercial smoker.
*  They're having this commercial smoker made.
*  They gave us a tour.
*  That's cheating the game, bro.
*  They did an amazing job.
*  They wanted it to their specifications.
*  Those propane tanks are thick as fuck.
*  It's heavy gauge steel.
*  Fuck that, man.
*  Where's the wood?
*  Well, you cook with wood.
*  The wood is on offset.
*  You know how those smokers work?
*  Right.
*  You have a firebox.
*  The firebox is over on the side.
*  They're constantly checking the temperature and opening the flues, make sure it's at a
*  perfect temperature.
*  Then you got the smoker, which is off to the side.
*  They're moving meat around because it's hotter where the air comes right out.
*  They're really well in.
*  Oh my God, they got it dialed in.
*  Their brisket is ridiculous.
*  It's so good.
*  That's what I'm talking about, bro.
*  That shit melts your mouth.
*  And their brisket don't come off bloody like that.
*  It's a different kind of animal.
*  That's elk.
*  You could have elk and you could do it that way.
*  They cook the neck meat that way.
*  My friend John Dudley, we're in-
*  Neck meat?
*  Yeah, neck meat.
*  Because the neck meat is very strong and dense.
*  Elk has giant antlers.
*  It's like it's doing weights with its neck.
*  But elk doesn't have no fatty.
*  It's no fatty cut.
*  No fat.
*  No fat.
*  There's a little bit of fat on the outside of them, but there's no fat in the meat at
*  all.
*  It's a totally different thing.
*  You got to cook it slow.
*  If it's anything other than that, medium rare like that, it's going to be dried out.
*  You want it just cooked slowly and seared on the outside.
*  I take a totally different approach if I'm cooking a ribeye from a cow versus an elk
*  completely different way of cooking.
*  I know that because you never post regular steak pictures.
*  It's like-
*  I eat regular steak.
*  No, you don't.
*  You don't never.
*  Once you did your first elk, your regular steak pictures was just dead, man.
*  Well, they're not as interesting to me.
*  Regular steak is great.
*  I'll cook it.
*  I'll eat it.
*  But the elk is like I have an intimate relationship with that.
*  Everyone knows that.
*  Of course they do.
*  I mean-
*  Even when I tell people I'm going to do your show, they're like take a bite of the elk
*  for me.
*  I'm serious, man.
*  It's like, yo, you done some cool shit.
*  They see you do a lot of cool shit, but they never seen you.
*  And you told me, do I really want elk?
*  And I was like, yeah, but I was in the hospital recovering from an injury so I couldn't get
*  here the way I wanted to.
*  That's a lucky injury in the sense, right?
*  All the things that could have gone wrong with your thumb, not even needs surgery, able
*  to get the bullet fragments out.
*  I mean, that's how I run my life, man.
*  I try to make it easy as possible.
*  Anybody else could have fucking made this injury and been fucked up.
*  If the pandemic can't stop me, neither can this fucking thumb, man.
*  How does it feel?
*  I know it's a crazy question.
*  You get it all the time.
*  From being from a place, like you were saying, what we took advantage of.
*  One of the things we never took advantage of at Stage Time, because we always did it,
*  but not having it accessible to you all the time.
*  How does it feel here with not being able to be like, you know what?
*  I'm going to go do like fucking three spots and hammer some shit out real quick.
*  Well, I haven't done that since March, you know, since the store closed down.
*  There was no comedy at all in LA.
*  So it was a whole life shift.
*  The only time I did it on the road was July.
*  And in July, I did four shows at the Houston Improv.
*  I had a great fucking time.
*  I just left there, man.
*  Great place.
*  It was, did you feel, I know this sounds crazy.
*  I know we're going to do some mask shit, mask shit story, whatever.
*  But it's a club that had a certain capacity.
*  Now they got to trim it down to meet whatever the mandate and the rules are.
*  But people were in there, temperature check, they were in there.
*  I know this sounds crazy.
*  Some people were masked.
*  Some people didn't have masks.
*  I'm thinking, if I'm not mistaken, they sell the tickets as a group.
*  Right?
*  I don't know if they're doing that now, but they're doing that in a lot of places.
*  And it's like, you feel good about it.
*  You know, but then it's like people take away from that feeling because it's always
*  somebody like, where's the mask?
*  Where's the mask?
*  Right.
*  There are people that are rightly upset at people taking risks because those people that
*  do take risks could then get sick.
*  And if they're irresponsible enough to take a risk and get sick, they might be irresponsible
*  enough to go out and mingle with people when they know they're sick.
*  Some people are like that.
*  Some people are selfish.
*  You know that, right?
*  I know that.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's where.
*  And then they could even give it out when they don't know they have it.
*  It could be asymptomatic.
*  But then at some point, don't you have to be selective about the people that you engage
*  with?
*  Don't you have to be selective on the chances?
*  This is my frustration.
*  I'm not a mask or a non-masker.
*  Like people make the argument, but what if I go to the grocery store and I have my mask
*  on and there's this old lady that doesn't have her mask on?
*  I don't think you should go places where it could be people that don't have their mask
*  on.
*  Shouldn't you order online or something?
*  Just don't get in that lady's face and you're going to be fine.
*  I don't think you should tell some old lady that she has to put a mask on.
*  I ran into an old lady at the grocery store.
*  She didn't have a mask on.
*  I was like, all right, what are you going to do?
*  She's old, man.
*  I mean, this lady, she probably feels terrible breathing through the mask.
*  She probably feels like she doesn't have much time.
*  She's about to have an asthma attack.
*  She had one on, but she was doing this shit.
*  I got into an argument.
*  That chin shit that people are doing?
*  I get yelled at.
*  I went to a grocery store.
*  I'm getting a couple of items and I had my motherfucking mask.
*  And Joe, when I tell you, the tip of my nose was showing.
*  The tip right here.
*  The people got mad.
*  And this lady was behind plexiglass.
*  She had sanitizers.
*  She was squirting the register down every minute.
*  She had a mask, everything.
*  And my shit went right to the tip of my nose.
*  She was like, sir, sir, sir, sir, you got to put your mask on.
*  You got to put your mask on.
*  I'm like, oh, I'm sorry.
*  Now I got to pay.
*  I do Apple pay.
*  But to get into my phone.
*  You got to open up the phone with my face.
*  Yeah. So I put it down.
*  Sir, I'm sorry.
*  I'm like, I'm trying to pay.
*  I got a log on my face.
*  She was like, well, you can't do that in here.
*  Right. You can't use Apple pay.
*  I can't show my face to open my phone.
*  You got to use Samsung pay.
*  They let you use your fingerprint.
*  Time to switch to Android.
*  I don't have an Android.
*  I don't have a. That's very evil for you to end.
*  I have another.
*  I know, but I want to talk about your fucking phone, Joe.
*  Why is it evil?
*  Because it was the wrong time.
*  It was the fucking wrong time.
*  And the thing I was making.
*  So I had to.
*  How'd you guys you're digging.
*  Sorry. This is what I had to do, Joe.
*  I had to actually stand, leave the register,
*  go to where I could do outside.
*  Yeah. Show my face, open my phone and I went to pay.
*  And then when that happened, I could have been pissed,
*  but I couldn't be like, you know what?
*  I'm just never going to go to that store again.
*  Well, it's just a lady working.
*  We just put the mask over your nose.
*  I'm not going to put myself in a situation
*  where I can get frustrated. I did it.
*  It was just for.
*  Is there any. Just for Apple pay.
*  But you were already arguing with her, right?
*  Is that part of the problem?
*  I'd never said I was arguing.
*  So she was already telling you put your mask over your nose.
*  So she was in a heightened state of awareness, frustration.
*  Yeah, but she was.
*  I don't know if it was me.
*  You know what? It was me.
*  I didn't see that energy around anybody else.
*  Perfect time to use the black card. I'm not going to do it.
*  It's the nose card.
*  She saw your nose and she's some people are just like real sticklers for shit.
*  You know, Bridget Phetasy, you know, who's that comic from L.A. writer.
*  She told me she was walking on one side of the street.
*  There was a guy across the street on the sidewalk on the other side.
*  Yelled at her. Put a mask on.
*  Let me tell you something. This argument, I know it's for safety and everything.
*  I know it's for safety and what the lies we share and all that.
*  But for some people, it's a perfect opportunity to be an asshole. Exactly.
*  It's like and that's the like the fine line is like,
*  do you really care about this mask or you get to either
*  this discrimination against mass people and no no mass people?
*  It's just people have an opportunity to tell people what to do.
*  They get mad. They do.
*  Yeah, they love it. You want to hear to it, then they get mad
*  because you're not listening to the rules. Fuck it. Right.
*  Well, that's why people are particularly upset at this Gavin Newsom shit
*  because he's been the one telling us you can't have large gatherings for Thanksgiving.
*  Stay home. Social distance.
*  Wear a mask in between bites of food. Right.
*  This guy's been saying all this shit.
*  And then he's doing now you go see him eating at a restaurant.
*  So does that mean do we believe everything's what you got?
*  So that's a perfect example of, you know, a lot of things are
*  motivated through politics and looks, you know, say everything that you see.
*  Not what is not really what you think it is.
*  So how much how much are you going to put into a person?
*  Like what their thoughts are? Yeah, not much.
*  What kind of person wants to do that? That's the problem.
*  What kind of person wants to be a governor?
*  They're not normal.
*  And you didn't care until the pandemic.
*  When the pandemic rolled around, you realize, oh, the mayor matters.
*  It really matters who you're.
*  You know what? I think a lot of them like
*  like have dreams of a certain amount of fame and want to be superstars.
*  Yeah, because even though you say you do it for the people,
*  you have to be likable or have some type of personality to connect with those people.
*  And you're cultivating your act. They have an act to 100 percent.
*  They have an act is different than our act.
*  Our act is to make people laugh.
*  Their act is to get people to think that they're the person who's got the solution.
*  There's our leader.
*  So that is to lie.
*  Yes. 100 percent.
*  You know what, Joe, we're going through all of this shit.
*  And even with this last election, whoever you decided you liked, appreciate, whatever.
*  It was just a weird thing going on.
*  It was a weird thing going on.
*  And I was watching one of David Goggins post.
*  And I have to say, David Goggins, I've never seen nobody have worse feet than my feet.
*  Oh, his feet are broken down.
*  But he just got done running 240 miles.
*  I know he's going to defend that.
*  I was going to say the same thing, Joe.
*  I know you're going to say, but what has he done with his feet?
*  And what have you done with?
*  So I know you were going to be like, you know how many mountains?
*  Those are fucking rock blisters. Yeah. Legitimate.
*  I knew he was going to say that.
*  And that's the point I was going to make it.
*  That's a point I was going to make.
*  He said everybody. Yeah.
*  Jesus Christ. Look at those big toes.
*  Yeah. Those look like crazy. Like they've been through it.
*  That is hilarious.
*  Those that thing on the left, he showed me that if you cut out like
*  the right foot's big toe, that right foot's big toe.
*  If you showed me a photo of that and didn't show me the rest of his foot,
*  I'd be like, that's like a snail or something.
*  People would say if you did that, people would say that was my foot.
*  That's a Mars Mars rock.
*  But like you said, like, just zoom in on just the toe.
*  Don't show me anything but his right toe.
*  That's a rock from Mars.
*  That's not real.
*  But that's fucking a lot of miles, Joe.
*  That's a brain of steel.
*  That man has a brain of steel.
*  That's the lie.
*  He knows how to force himself to do shit that hurts.
*  This is what he was saying.
*  He said and then whatever it is, he one thing about him,
*  he always has to remind you that he was a fat piece of shit.
*  Yep. It doesn't like that's got to be that must be the number one
*  motivating thing for you that toe. God damn.
*  So if you didn't see the rest of it, you'd be like, what is that?
*  Oh, that's a rock somewhere.
*  That's on another planet.
*  That's a satellite photo.
*  That's a satellite photo.
*  White people, you're gross as shit.
*  That's a satellite.
*  You want to see blood and pus come out of that motherfucker.
*  I know your thing.
*  Like, Jamie, go closer.
*  But the point he made, he said, he said, everybody.
*  I used to be a fat piece of shit.
*  Yeah, he was 300 pounds.
*  Yeah, I was 300 when I was a piece of shit.
*  Everybody's looking for.
*  I need to answer with this person.
*  I need to answer that person.
*  But fuck it. Why don't you be the answer for yourself?
*  Yeah, that's that's I know people like, well, that's easy to say.
*  But why not find the answers
*  you need in life through yourself? Right.
*  And through what you do, your hard work
*  in a type of person and type of human type of father you are.
*  That's why people like him are so important because he'll tell you
*  people like him are so important because he'll tell you
*  he used to have no discipline. Right.
*  So like, look at him now.
*  This is not something he was really going to interrupt.
*  It's a thing, he said, this is because I was having coffee with Dave today.
*  And then he said that about you, because I was talking about
*  I can't drink no shit with my antibiotics when I got shot and everything.
*  And in some kind of way, we talked about you.
*  And that's what he said.
*  He said, I fucking love and respect his discipline.
*  I do have some of that.
*  Yeah, but I'm lazy, too, man.
*  I force myself in all the stuff that I do.
*  Yeah, but you get challenged by something, though.
*  Something kicks you in the ass.
*  Yeah. Well, I don't I don't like falling.
*  I don't like.
*  Not doing what I'm supposed to do, so I force myself to do
*  what I'm supposed to do, but it's never easy.
*  It's not easy, you know, it's like I always would think of disciplined
*  people as being like there was no wavering.
*  They just got up and did it.
*  But you know, the other thing Goggins tells you, you know, sometimes I'll stare
*  at my shoes for 30 motherfucking minutes for put them bitches on.
*  Yeah, because you want to get rid of looking at them ugly ass feet.
*  It's a damn god damn.
*  That's not what he's talking about, though.
*  He's talking about discipline.
*  I know this is the worst time, Joe.
*  I did a pivot. I just I opened up my own store, right.
*  And after I just saw David Goggins feet, you got to help me get that.
*  Look at that.
*  So we sold candles. No, son.
*  You don't know about that.
*  I think hashiness.
*  Yo, son, that is Joe.
*  Put a little on your hand.
*  Please put a little on your hand.
*  It smells good.
*  That shit is vegan.
*  It's all natural. It's fire, son.
*  That's because you watch what I say, son.
*  Watch what I say. Nice.
*  Watch how long that shit last, Joe.
*  OK. It feels good.
*  I know it sounds weird.
*  Look at that shit.
*  Smells good.
*  It's just the shit, son.
*  Raw edge.
*  The ingredients are all on the back.
*  I know you don't got your glass.
*  You have to read it.
*  But it's like type of oils and coconuts I never heard of in my life.
*  It smells like coconut.
*  Coconut, a Google, all the black nuts and oils.
*  CBD, son.
*  Feel me? I don't know what this stuff is.
*  When I...
*  Mangongo oil?
*  What is that? Google it. Google it.
*  And mad rich plant butters.
*  Good mad.
*  Yo, you laughing, son?
*  You're laughing, but that shit is fire, son.
*  I'm just laughing at the very end.
*  Erika Badu put that shit on, right?
*  I love it.
*  Erika Badu put that shit on.
*  Nah, that's you, son.
*  Oh, thank you.
*  Listen, Erika Badu put that on, son.
*  And she started rubbing herself real, real slow.
*  She hadn't been out in the pandemic in a while.
*  And she was like, hmm.
*  She was like, is it edible?
*  Wow. How high is she?
*  Is she really high?
*  Are you disrespecting my product or you disrespecting her?
*  But if I was thinking about taking cream and eating it,
*  I'd probably have to be pretty high.
*  Certain people react to things differently, Joe.
*  It does smell like food, though.
*  It smells like a delicious pina colada.
*  But wait to it. But wait to it.
*  It's like food.
*  There it is.
*  It's like food for your body.
*  Your body is eating right now, Joe.
*  And 100 milligrams of CBD.
*  Yep. Look at that.
*  Mangongo oil. There it is right there.
*  CBD hemp seed oil.
*  Cocoa butter. We got all the nuts.
*  Look at this. When did you start this business?
*  How long ago?
*  I've been working on the formula for two years.
*  Scroll down. Look at that.
*  I know. That's my best pick.
*  Why does it say too classy?
*  Because that's the feeling.
*  Go from ashy to classy.
*  That's the feeling. That's the feeling you have.
*  Look at that. I like the sparkle.
*  The thing about it, Joe, I've been ashy my whole life.
*  You know that. Everybody know it.
*  And for years, people like, you should do lotion.
*  You should do lotion.
*  I'm like, man, it's kind of corny.
*  I mean, it could be a novelty.
*  It could be funny.
*  Yo, ashy Larry got his own lotion.
*  And I was like, fuck that shit.
*  Then I met with this young lady and she's like a chemist
*  when it comes to this lotion shit.
*  And we started working on it.
*  And then when I finally tried what was the end product,
*  I was like, this shit really work.
*  Like it really works and it's good.
*  It sounds like it's good for your muscles too,
*  if it's got CBD in it.
*  It's good for everything.
*  Your hands are going to thank me later, son.
*  I believe it.
*  What is the name of the website?
*  Down at Rawlins. That's where you can get it.
*  Oh, okay.
*  I opened up a store, son.
*  Oh, I like it. I like it.
*  Look at you, entrepreneurial.
*  I never, this is one thing that came out of this.
*  And not just for me, Joe, for a lot of people.
*  Think about this.
*  A person that makes their money on the road,
*  a real road comic.
*  This happened to me.
*  95% of the money that I make is on the road.
*  95% of the shows I had are done.
*  So only thing I have from what I usually make
*  is that 5% and I didn't enough for shit.
*  And even though you can have some money stacked up
*  or whatever, you still gotta ask yourself
*  what the fuck is going to be the pivot?
*  I don't think the pivot's going to come for a long time
*  either in terms of us being able to get back to work.
*  No, no, no. We're about to work next summer.
*  Next summer, you think?
*  Joe!
*  Don L.
*  Well, I'm not trying to say,
*  I don't believe in Corona right now,
*  but we are on the track of not just deadening shit,
*  but being able to have it under control.
*  We're about to get to the point
*  where people are going to have more sense of security.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Just think about the progress we've made in a year
*  from when this shit first happened,
*  you take a Corona test, you had to wait like seven days.
*  Think about it when it first hit.
*  We had to like, oh my God, it was so scary, it was so scary.
*  And then all these ventilators, ventilators, ventilators.
*  But if you know now since when the pandemic started,
*  yeah, we still losing people,
*  but you don't hear that ventilator talk too much no more.
*  Well, ventilators are actually a bad idea now they realize.
*  My point, you know what I'm saying?
*  They figured out a lot of things.
*  They're finding this way.
*  I did a whole podcast yesterday on COVID
*  with Nicholas Christakis from Yale.
*  He a COVID nigga?
*  He believes that COVID is a real problem.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  I believe it, but I think it's controllable.
*  It is controllable.
*  I think it's a multifaceted problem,
*  and I think we're only handling one aspect of it,
*  which is keep people from working, keep people home,
*  keep people away from people.
*  No, you can't do that.
*  You're treating people like they're children.
*  This is what you gotta do.
*  You gotta let them go outside.
*  This is what you gotta do.
*  We gonna have more creative ways to make money.
*  Think about the comedy scene when we thought
*  the only place to tell jokes was on the stage,
*  and I had some resentment toward some of those
*  outdoor events, the parking lot shit.
*  First time I saw one of those parking lot shows with horns,
*  I was like, never give a heckler
*  an instrument to fuck your show up.
*  I'm like, there's no way I'm gonna,
*  these motherfuckers don't like me.
*  There's no way I'm gonna be heckler.
*  Yeah, but people are happy to be out, man.
*  It's a different experience.
*  That's, and the point I was making is like,
*  you can suppress people, you can cold them down
*  for a certain period of time,
*  but after a while you're gonna have to figure something out.
*  My point I was gonna make is they're only looking
*  at one side of it.
*  They're not looking at telling people how to be healthy.
*  There's no talk about that.
*  Nigga!
*  Yes.
*  Nigga!
*  That's what's up, right?
*  Son, you a strong motherfucker.
*  All your niggas are strong.
*  Jamie might be the least strong out of everybody.
*  Stop with the dings.
*  Shut your phone's ding off, man.
*  Jamie, I'm not saying you not strong, son.
*  I'm not saying.
*  That's what you just said though.
*  Yeah, but you compared him to Tony Hinchcliffe.
*  I'm just saying.
*  Or Red Band.
*  Oh yeah, I didn't forget about, yeah, you.
*  Listen, he's got a deadly three pointer.
*  He's got a deadly three pointer and he runs.
*  Jamie's in shape.
*  That's black shape.
*  That's black people shape.
*  He does pull ups.
*  That's black people shape.
*  Run, play basketball, and pull ups and push ups.
*  You do like the jail workout, son.
*  Jamie's actually in good shape.
*  I know, I believe it.
*  I'm sorry, Jamie, I didn't mean to offend you.
*  I get it.
*  He's back there, he doesn't talk a lot.
*  God damn, I know, did what he told.
*  Did what he finally told.
*  It's like, yo, what he finally told.
*  Jamie, show him that video of you dunking,
*  shooting three pointers.
*  I never said he couldn't play basketball, son.
*  Dude, it's impressive.
*  Like Rain Man shit.
*  No, no.
*  No, you can't dunk.
*  We're working on that.
*  He's hitting three pointer after three pointer
*  like Rain Man.
*  There's something weird about him.
*  He might have a wire crossed in his brain.
*  I didn't know he was nice.
*  What I'm saying is, to go back to your point, Joe,
*  is everybody's talking about the end of Corona.
*  Like Don Lemon, man.
*  Don Lemon, man.
*  Don Lemon.
*  Son, four years, son.
*  For four years straight, he complained.
*  He was mad at Donald Trump for four fucking years.
*  Four years.
*  And I was like, man, if Donald Trump wins this election,
*  Don Lemon is gonna jump off the CNN building.
*  Do you remember all their faces when he won last time?
*  When he won in 2016?
*  They were all so depressed.
*  Jake Tapper and all those people on TV,
*  just like, mother fucker, I can't believe this.
*  But here's the thing, Joe, I'm like...
*  I don't think you're supposed to do that
*  if you're doing the news.
*  You're doing commentary, you can do that.
*  Like if you're doing the news,
*  you're supposed to say the news.
*  Let us figure it out.
*  Joe.
*  Don Al.
*  Joe, that's why I do subscribe to the notion
*  that fake news, like to be honest, it's all fake.
*  It's all of them are fake.
*  It's all fake.
*  And this is what I did, what I keep on telling people
*  is like, I know you're upset, but when you're like...
*  It's all personal, like everything hits you to the heart.
*  Well, that's where it gets weird.
*  Those two guys, Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon, both of them,
*  they do this editorializing and this like...
*  It's almost like they're doing a podcast.
*  And their opinion is all in it.
*  And their opinion's in it, but it's also scripted.
*  It's on the other side too.
*  But it's scripted.
*  And they're doing it on a news channel.
*  There's a lot going on there.
*  But that's why if you don't...
*  There is another thing about the media,
*  if you didn't understand whatever party you agree with,
*  whatever, if you don't understand
*  how easy it is to manipulate the media, Joe,
*  it is so, so simple.
*  To manipulate the media?
*  To manipulate the media and the people to listen to it.
*  That's what it's successful...
*  You can manipulate people?
*  What do you mean by manipulate the media?
*  Like, you can create stories.
*  You can create stories.
*  You can make things happen.
*  I got shot, niggas.
*  I see.
*  I got shot in my motherfucking thumb.
*  That's what I heard.
*  And a lot of people don't believe me.
*  Well, I believe you.
*  I don't believe that you believe me, Joe.
*  That's what I believe, motherfucker.
*  That's not convincing.
*  But the point I'm making is...
*  When I first got shot, Joe,
*  I posted on Instagram.
*  I didn't wanna post on Instagram
*  because I know that I didn't wanna get no war
*  in the streets going on.
*  People like going out looking for the person
*  that shot me in my thumb.
*  So I kept it to myself.
*  It didn't really bring into people's attention.
*  I posted one picture of me being in the hospital.
*  Everybody's like, you okay?
*  You okay?
*  They don't know what I got shot for,
*  but they instantly got connected to that story.
*  Did you ever think of not posting it?
*  I did.
*  I did.
*  What made you decide to post it?
*  The world needs to know?
*  The world needs to know.
*  A little bit?
*  Some of the gigs I had to post phone
*  when I was shot up, not locked up.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I wasn't ready to share it to the world.
*  I didn't know how my friends was gonna take it.
*  Then I wanted to be transparent and be honest
*  and let them know I got shot.
*  That's what I did.
*  I see.
*  You feel like, you still don't believe me.
*  I do believe you.
*  I think you're just looking for
*  a very specific reaction from me.
*  I gave that up a long time ago, bro.
*  I gave that up, I was like, whatever.
*  That's what made me nervous the first time I came up.
*  I'm like, what the fuck do I say?
*  Say what you say, nigga.
*  Don't try to, all right, I'm here.
*  You are here.
*  Are you thinking about bailing out of LA yet?
*  I think so.
*  Yeah, a lot of people are.
*  The reason that we started feeling
*  when we don't, well, you don't really need Hollywood
*  like that, you know.
*  I don't think anybody needs it anymore.
*  Some people thought they did, you're right.
*  Some people thought they did.
*  They thought it was like you had to be here every night.
*  I thought I needed to be there for a long time.
*  And then once what happened, this situation,
*  then you realize, oh, what can I do?
*  You're like, wait a minute.
*  I really can make my own community.
*  Yes.
*  I can make my own community.
*  Not only that, you get connected to all the other
*  communities, like all the other podcasts.
*  We all help each other.
*  We're all together.
*  I will say one thing white people do,
*  when it comes to podcasts, they support each other.
*  Yeah, we support each other.
*  But you know what, man, that's a new thing.
*  Because in radio, it was the opposite.
*  When they had radio, they'd attack each other.
*  Like I remember Opie and Anthony was always at war
*  with Howard Stern and Jay Leno was always at war
*  with all the other late night chalk show hosts.
*  But did you think that made people engage?
*  Do you think that made people engage
*  with their platforms more?
*  No, no, no.
*  They were just scared because they only had a,
*  back in the day when you were on television or the radio,
*  you had a very specific time slot.
*  You had 6 a.m.
*  Day parts.
*  To 10 a.m., right?
*  Day parts.
*  And other people are also on at 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.
*  And no one's recording anything.
*  So you have to listen to it live.
*  I was a part of that.
*  That's the same with television.
*  I was a part of that.
*  I don't know if you, I was a part of when Hot 97
*  was the biggest and Urban Radio in New York was the biggest.
*  And then I was doing radio when Power 105 came
*  and became a competitor.
*  They had no competition at first.
*  You know, it was just them.
*  Then they got challenged.
*  And that's what made for interesting,
*  interesting shit between both of them is like,
*  yeah, we talk shit about 97.5, then 105.
*  Then you start listening to both of them
*  to see what shit they're talking.
*  You could do that if you're them,
*  or you could listen and if you like it,
*  tell people it's good.
*  That's what podcasters do.
*  Like if I'm listening to your show, I'll tell people,
*  Donnie Rollins shows hilarious,
*  or listen to this guy or listen to her or listen to what,
*  I'll tell people, people I don't even fucking know, man.
*  I tell people about podcasts that I listen to from NPR
*  or fucking radio lab.
*  What I always tell people,
*  because I'm interested in cool shit.
*  I want to know about cool shit.
*  And if I find cool shit,
*  I want to tell other people about cool shit.
*  I'm not worried.
*  People don't think that's cool.
*  Well, they're worried about if they talk about something else
*  it's gonna take opinions.
*  It's gonna take attention away from them.
*  That's what's called famine thinking.
*  You can never think that.
*  Famine?
*  Famine.
*  Famine.
*  Feast or famine.
*  I'm a feast thinker.
*  I always think there's enough for everybody.
*  Everybody come aboard.
*  I want everybody to be happy.
*  I want everybody to make money.
*  I want everybody to be famous.
*  I want everybody to be happy.
*  I want them to be fulfilled.
*  I don't want to be the man.
*  That idea of being the man to me is ridiculous.
*  That's your idea, but on the outside,
*  when you do stuff like that,
*  for some people and their perception of you,
*  that's what makes you the man.
*  If you're able to inspire and motivate,
*  that's what makes you the man that you say you're not.
*  I'm happy if that's the case, that people think that way.
*  But I'm in a position to be generous.
*  They know it.
*  They even hold it against you, too.
*  It feels good to be generous.
*  They hold it against me.
*  Who holds it against me?
*  People that don't like me.
*  They hold it against you that I have you on?
*  No, people that don't like me, they'll say something.
*  They hold it against me because you.
*  Yeah, they'd like you to be.
*  Oh, because the RZA podcast?
*  Jamie?
*  Jamie, what are you talking about?
*  No.
*  What are you talking about?
*  They don't tell me.
*  People that don't like you don't know you.
*  Yeah, but some people, they told me
*  they wasn't gonna like you anymore because you liked me.
*  Good luck.
*  If that's how crazy you are.
*  They said they wasn't gonna like you because you didn't.
*  But that's ridiculous.
*  Anybody who thinks like that is out of their fucking mind.
*  They was like, they was saying shit like this,
*  and I don't read the comments, Joe.
*  They was saying shit like this.
*  They said shit like this.
*  They said shit like this.
*  They said shit like, well, Joe was right up to this point.
*  Yo, they like, you had a track record,
*  like yeah, I believed everything said
*  until he got a loud mouth up there.
*  Here's the thing, I don't think anybody
*  will ever understand the camaraderie that we all have,
*  comics have.
*  It's a different world.
*  But the podcast world is totally different.
*  Y'all motherfuckers, yo, y'all motherfuckers,
*  it's just like, but man, the podcast world
*  is so fucking dope, and the podcast world
*  was ready for the pandemic.
*  The podcast people was like this, what?
*  Pandemic, I get to spend more time with my kids.
*  I get to spend more time with my kids.
*  And you get to spend more time doing podcasts
*  because everybody's free.
*  Even if you have to do those stupid Zoom podcasts,
*  you're still spending more time doing podcasts.
*  Yeah, but it's like, you figured out,
*  they knew it was gonna happen before it fucking happened.
*  I came in right at the, well,
*  I think I came in right at the right time.
*  I don't think they knew it was gonna happen
*  before it happened, but I think they got lucky.
*  They got lucky that there were, look man,
*  back when I was just dependent upon Hollywood and gigs,
*  I'd be fucked right now.
*  I'd have no income coming in.
*  But you saw the future too, son.
*  You try, I said this to you before.
*  Like when you hear, like Joe Rogan,
*  you hear about this Spotify deal,
*  and you hear about all this type of shit,
*  blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  And then you, what, you don't understand,
*  like I said, Joe, everybody wants to be you right now,
*  but nobody wants to be you when people are saying no,
*  and equipment was breaking down,
*  and we didn't know if we was gonna do it.
*  See, the thing is I never, I didn't think about it that way.
*  I didn't think like I know this is gonna blow up.
*  I thought I like doing this, I'm gonna keep doing this.
*  So you just continued to have fun with it.
*  I just do what I like.
*  All the shit that I do, if you think about it,
*  I just do what I like, whether it's stand-up comedy,
*  or whether it's UFC commentary,
*  or whether it's doing a podcast, I do what I like.
*  I do what I like.
*  I don't think, oh, if I do this, it's gonna be huge.
*  I just do what I like.
*  That's the most empowering thing that is so hard.
*  That's the most empowering thing that is so hard
*  for people to feel comfortable enough to do it,
*  is what they're like, because to turn it into,
*  this motherfucker says fuck bitches all the time.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  They haven't figured out a way to get a W-9
*  or anything for it.
*  They get nervous about the future too.
*  You gotta have enough confidence in yourself
*  to take chances.
*  Do you think
*  that there are a lot of pussies out here?
*  There's a lot of pussies out here.
*  Is our country pussy?
*  Our country has a lot of pussy in it
*  because it's too easy to get by,
*  and it's human nature to become soft when things are easy.
*  And when you're in any sign of any kind of struggle
*  whatsoever, that's when the real pussies emerge,
*  because they can't handle any pressure.
*  Or they go, or they leave.
*  You see how bad they are,
*  because they fall apart.
*  Any adversity at all.
*  Anything but, this is beyond that now, because of this.
*  It's not beyond that now, Joe.
*  The reason why it's beyond that,
*  this is a thing that this is a personality trait,
*  or just as a side of,
*  not to say that I'm a fan of Donald Trump or anything,
*  but it was certain things that I could understand
*  where the thought comes from,
*  but how you articulate to people is all fucked up.
*  The way you articulate to people is terrible at it.
*  It's like certain people need filters.
*  Certain people need, like, Kanye West needs an interpreter.
*  You know what he needed?
*  He needed a coach,
*  because someone coached him for that second Biden debate.
*  If you watch that second Biden debate,
*  he was calm and cool,
*  let Biden work himself up and stammer and lie about shit.
*  And he had still attacked him,
*  but he attacked him in a different way.
*  The first time he did it, he was obnoxious.
*  He kept talking over him.
*  He didn't let him talk.
*  He was ridiculous.
*  Everybody wanted to shut his mic off.
*  But then someone must have coached him for this,
*  or he realized himself.
*  Man, I'm gonna tell you the difference.
*  I'm gonna tell you something different.
*  I'm gonna tell you something different.
*  Whatever numbers you say,
*  the loser of this election still won, breaking the record.
*  I know, isn't that crazy?
*  Second place still was, second place would be first place.
*  Any other time. Any other time.
*  In history, it would have shitted on everything.
*  That's nuts.
*  That shows everybody realized it's important to find,
*  when you realize that a guy like Donald Trump
*  can become president, you realize, oh my God,
*  it's actually important to vote.
*  Yo, bruh.
*  You know, it has to,
*  until you see those numbers, yo, it was like,
*  it was crazy.
*  It was like, in certain places,
*  separated by 5,000 votes.
*  I know.
*  10,000 votes.
*  Yeah, it was tight.
*  And you could say, you could make,
*  here's the thing, you could make an argument,
*  it could have went either way.
*  Here's the situation.
*  Man, Donald Trump,
*  let it be known that
*  he didn't give a fuck about anybody,
*  but his base.
*  Yeah, pretty much.
*  That's it.
*  And I'm not saying, if it's a numbers game,
*  understand that.
*  Like, there's a certain amount of people
*  that will help you get elected.
*  There's a certain amount of people,
*  that's why you have strategists and shit.
*  They'll be like, if we do this,
*  we get these robo-cars here and everything,
*  you know, it's the science to that.
*  There's certain people that can help you get there.
*  Well, if he,
*  But he never made no, like,
*  If he softened his approach up,
*  I think the base would not have appreciated it.
*  That's the numbers.
*  It's like, love him or hate him.
*  It's very polarizing.
*  To hate him works for a situation.
*  Whereas Biden, I don't think people love Biden.
*  Something has to be,
*  I don't think they dislike him either.
*  But they hate Trump.
*  The people that voted for Biden hate Trump.
*  Most of them.
*  Or just feel like we just can't do this anymore.
*  That's a lot of them.
*  The people that voted for Biden hate Trump.
*  But they're not excited about him
*  the way they're excited about Obama,
*  or excited about Clinton,
*  or excited about a million other presidents in the past.
*  Not a million.
*  Yeah, but for the most part,
*  every time it switches over is because somebody goes
*  totally opposite of what was going on.
*  Yeah, there's a little bit of that.
*  But it's usually bullshit.
*  It's bullshit, man, but I'm like, man.
*  These old stories.
*  These old stories that they're repeating over and over again.
*  Biden is filling up his cabinet
*  with all these billionaire hedge fund people's,
*  like, not hedge fund people,
*  but like, environment.
*  The guy that is involved in environmental,
*  he just hired some guy that people are upset about.
*  I don't know what color he is.
*  I was reading about the environmental advisor.
*  That's important to me.
*  Because he worked for a fuckin' oil company.
*  The black part is important to me.
*  An environmental advisor was taking money
*  from fossil fuel companies.
*  And they're like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
*  This guy has ties to fossil fuels,
*  and you're doing something with him
*  that involves the environment.
*  There could be a conflict of interest.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  If he's a black guy, okay.
*  Yeah, if he's a black guy, we'll really back to him.
*  We'll find out right now.
*  I bet they probably, listen, this is,
*  I think they're probably gonna hire a lot of Republicans.
*  I really do.
*  That's what they did.
*  They already started, black guy.
*  They're gonna hire a lot of people that want to,
*  listen, and in their defense,
*  they probably think some radical things need to be done
*  to kickstart the economy right now.
*  The economy's kinda fucked.
*  I agree, but I don't know how they're gonna be able
*  to work together.
*  I think they're all dirty, bro.
*  They all work together.
*  Here he goes.
*  Biden just appointed his climate movement liaison.
*  Black man, black man, yes, told you, son.
*  It's a fossil fuel industry ally.
*  Black. Yeah.
*  There he is.
*  Black, look, black as shit.
*  That's all I need, Joe.
*  There you go.
*  He raked in big money from fossil fuel industry
*  while waiting to help oil and gas companies,
*  or voting, rather, to help oil and gas companies.
*  Look at how he's greeting them is different.
*  Look, he's like, that's come.
*  He's giving them knuckles.
*  Hey, fella.
*  My motherfucker.
*  I saw a video of Lindsey Graham
*  and Kamala Harris fist bumping each other.
*  It's adorable.
*  Kamala Harris.
*  Reaching across the aisle.
*  That was a good move.
*  He's walking by, fist bumps.
*  Well, she's the only good move.
*  She's strong.
*  She was a district attorney.
*  She got some questionable arrests on her.
*  Of course.
*  There's some shit that she did,
*  imprisoning people and keeping them in prison
*  to use them to fight wildfires and shit.
*  In my community, I've heard people talk about her
*  and everything.
*  She's a chief of chief.
*  You have trust in her.
*  You believe in her.
*  What I did believe in was when she got elected
*  to be the first female vice president,
*  first black president, within a couple of days,
*  the commercials I've seen on different urban platforms
*  or just period, it's been, you see a little black girl
*  looking up to something.
*  We see that shadow with her standing there
*  and the little black girls in the shadow.
*  Black girls in the shadow.
*  But the little girls are just showing us like this.
*  You could be that person.
*  Yeah, they feel black girl joy.
*  They see something that's.
*  She also, she didn't just.
*  I know she put motherfuckers on her.
*  But she didn't do just bad things.
*  She did a lot of good things.
*  She prosecuted a lot of child sex predators,
*  a lot of pieces of shit, a lot of bad people.
*  She wasn't just the situations where people
*  should have been let out of jail and weren't.
*  But there's also, this is a thing that we have to realize
*  when it comes to district attorneys and just attorneys
*  and prosecutors and defense attorneys in general,
*  they're trying to win a game and it gets dirty.
*  When I tell you what my prosecuted experience.
*  When they're trying to prosecute people,
*  you haven't yet, but I'm sure you will.
*  Sorry, go ahead.
*  But when you're trying to prosecute people
*  or defend people, the people defend people
*  they know are fucking guilty.
*  And they'll keep shit from the prosecution
*  even though they know they're defending a guilty person.
*  They do it all the time.
*  And people prosecute people
*  that they're not sure are guilty.
*  And they'll pretend they're sure that that person's guilty
*  because they want to win.
*  And they'll withhold information
*  that could potentially exonerate that person
*  because they're playing a game.
*  When you let people play a game,
*  anytime you let people play a game
*  and someone's trying to win, they cheat.
*  They try to figure out a way to do better than you
*  with influence, by withholding things,
*  by holding things back.
*  They know this judge, they're tight with this lawyer.
*  They try to win a game, you've made it a game.
*  So you've got a prosecutor and you've got a defense attorney.
*  So you've got two competing forces.
*  You're always gonna have lies.
*  100%.
*  Because people play games.
*  So that was the business she's in.
*  Her saying, you know, us saying that she did this.
*  It's like that's her business.
*  That's her business.
*  And they are a business of words.
*  Like you're saying, there's no person who can actually-
*  Well she's in the business of laws.
*  She particularly.
*  Laws, but laws are the word.
*  How do I win with these words right here?
*  No matter what you think, how do I win with this?
*  Come on, Kamala, you know that's not right.
*  We're not talking about right.
*  We're talking about what we can prove.
*  And that's what law is all about, right?
*  If you are a defense attorney,
*  that's your job is to protect somebody
*  and try to get them off even if they might be guilty.
*  And if you're a prosecutor,
*  your job is to prosecute somebody.
*  Your job is not to go, hey, we might be wrong.
*  Your job is not to go, hey, let's hold.
*  But the shady shit is when you don't play by the rules
*  and you withhold information or withhold evidence.
*  And people have done that in the past.
*  And that's when things get real squirrely.
*  Because like, okay, now you're not playing the game.
*  You're using your unfair advantage
*  and being able to suppress it.
*  Nothing surprises you.
*  Nothing surprises you.
*  No, no, it doesn't surprise me.
*  But what I'm saying is it doesn't make a person all bad.
*  She's not all bad.
*  She's done a lot of very good things.
*  I read an article about all the different things she did,
*  including the different things that she did
*  that a lot of people thought were bad,
*  like threatening moms with they would go to jail
*  if their son was truant.
*  But it turns out no one ever went to jail.
*  It was a threat.
*  And obviously it's terrifying to be a single mom
*  and think you might get put in jail
*  because your son is just running around
*  and doesn't show up at school
*  because you work two jobs,
*  try to put food on the table.
*  But nobody ever actually did get arrested
*  and went to jail.
*  Yeah, because it's gonna be too hard to prove that shit, man.
*  And in some cases, some people are,
*  and I don't know if this was a case,
*  some people are too lazy in certain situations too.
*  Well, I'm saying it's not a good idea
*  to threaten a mother because she's a single mom
*  trying to get by and her son is not going to school.
*  It's not good to threaten her with jail time.
*  But sometimes people make decisions.
*  Yeah, sometimes people make decisions,
*  like drastic decisions like that.
*  And maybe at the time they had a perspective
*  that's different than the perspective that they have now.
*  It's called evolution.
*  I want everybody to have,
*  look, I want them to have a clean slate.
*  Biden and Harris are in there now.
*  I think clean slate, forget about,
*  let's see what they can do.
*  See who the people they put into office,
*  all the cabinet, let's give them a chance.
*  We want them to do well.
*  This is what was so fucked up about Trump being in office.
*  I don't think those people wanted him to be well.
*  Exactly, so many people hated him.
*  They really would rather the country do bad
*  under him because if the country was killing it under him,
*  he's like, look, it's killing it, I'm the best,
*  I told you, then everybody's like fuck.
*  At least maybe please, even Trump supporters,
*  go into this one with a different attitude.
*  Let's all together say we want the best for America.
*  What's done is done, the election's over.
*  Maybe you were a Tulsi Gabbard fan like myself.
*  Maybe you like Bernie Sanders like myself,
*  but maybe you like fucking Jeb Bush.
*  Yang Gang.
*  I love Yang Gang, I love Andrew Yang.
*  He's an awesome guy, I love a lot of his ideas.
*  But for now, we know where it is, with Biden and Harris.
*  Let's want them to be the best.
*  But them niggas mad, Joe, them motherfucking Trump Trumper,
*  you got different level Trumpers.
*  Well, there's a lot of people that think themselves.
*  They're so mad as a motherfucker
*  that don't wanna hear shit, son.
*  Part of the problem is he's telling them
*  that it's a rigged election.
*  He's telling them it's a rigged election.
*  That's what's so fucked up.
*  But part of the problem is all elections
*  have some corruption.
*  They just fucking do.
*  They've been around forever.
*  But that's enough for you to say,
*  nigga, when you leaving, nigga?
*  I don't think there's a-
*  Did he keep his secrets and shit, Joe?
*  Well, Mike Baker, who used to be in the CIA was on here.
*  Mike Baker or your Baker in history?
*  His name is Mike Baker.
*  Oh, I thought you said Mike Baker.
*  He was in the CIA and he came on the podcast recently.
*  He was telling me that even if they did overturn it,
*  even if they did rather find corruption,
*  the amount of votes you're talking about
*  in most of these states-
*  It's not enough.
*  Not nearly enough.
*  It would have to be crazy corruption.
*  Yeah, like these people talking about
*  five or six people, bruh.
*  And that's the petty shit.
*  No, no, it's not five or six people.
*  Man, every time they use-
*  I think they uncovered-
*  Hundreds, well, hundreds.
*  They uncovered two different things today
*  in, I wanna say it's Michigan,
*  where they found a memory card
*  that had more votes for Trump than Biden,
*  but it still was close.
*  It was like 1,000 for Biden and 1,000,
*  a few hundred for Trump, like four or 500 for Trump.
*  Where'd he get the memory card from, son?
*  I do not know.
*  Come on, John.
*  I think there's a lot of unorganization-
*  That nigga coulda showed up
*  and nigga coulda brought up any memory card.
*  So a motherfucker just gave you a memory card-
*  Well, someone who's counting votes
*  got the memory card from the machines-
*  Who told you that story?
*  This is in the news.
*  Which news outlet?
*  It was in three or four different ones that I saw.
*  And they all say the same thing.
*  Well, they all said that there was a memory card
*  that was discovered and they showed the counts
*  in the memory card, but they've also found
*  other ballots that didn't get counted yet.
*  There's just a lot of disarray.
*  You're dealing with human beings
*  that are counting millions of votes.
*  Millions in the percentage-
*  And they're counting a lot of them just paper.
*  They're getting mail and they're opening it up
*  and they have to find out-
*  This is what I didn't understand.
*  This is what I didn't understand, Joe.
*  This was so funny.
*  It kinda like backfired, right?
*  That the mail-in votes is what killed Trump.
*  That's what they're saying, for the most part.
*  And the funny thing about it,
*  Trump has the type of following that
*  he literally could tell him to do anything,
*  they're gonna do it.
*  He told motherfuckers not to mail in.
*  Yeah, well he wanted to make a point,
*  come in in person.
*  Well, this is the point, right?
*  But how do you make a joke?
*  Answer this question.
*  How do you make that point?
*  Understand making that point when you're not
*  in the middle of a fucking pandemic.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  That would have been a great argument in 16.
*  Especially for old folks, right?
*  For anybody that wants to participate,
*  but the only thing that would stop them
*  is if they're gonna go outside and risk their lives.
*  So you're not thinking to give that person
*  the opportunity to be a part of it.
*  And that's the part that kinda fucked it up.
*  Well I don't know if he definitely wanted people
*  to vote in person, but did he ever encourage people
*  to vote by mail as well?
*  Or was he always saying that mail was gonna get a fraud?
*  Son, this whole shit was crowds.
*  I'm like, niggas, somebody, Secret Service,
*  break the secret, tell this motherfucker that,
*  yo, somebody tell this motherfucker
*  that the corona is out here.
*  He caught it, he knows it was out there.
*  This nigga caught it, right?
*  And gave all the Secret Service it.
*  But they can't, Secret Service can't say nothing
*  because they're Secret Service.
*  They gotta keep it a secret.
*  I'm sure they're young and healthy too.
*  They probably shook it off pretty easy.
*  Decided people don't understand.
*  They probably got the same medicine he got, you know?
*  The medicine is probably, a lot of that medicine
*  is called your immune system being up to par.
*  As much as like everybody is talking about this shit
*  is the lazy route.
*  No one wants to say.
*  There's a little bit of that,
*  but they also gave him a bunch of experimental shit.
*  They gave him this antibody blood transfusion medication.
*  They gave him, what was it called, Regeneron?
*  Is that what it's called, Jamie?
*  I think so.
*  They gave him some other,
*  I don't know if it's experimental
*  or if it's like recently been released.
*  They gave him that medication.
*  They gave him a steroid.
*  They gave him a bunch of different things all at once.
*  So he got a cocktail shit that made him feel great.
*  I was gonna say, not only that son,
*  how much is that cocktail?
*  That's not no easy cocktail.
*  It's not cheap.
*  He wants that to be able to be given to everybody,
*  but I don't know if that's feasible at the moment.
*  They gotta make those doses.
*  Well, it's not just to make the money,
*  just to make the doses.
*  Say if they have all that medication
*  and all that blood antibody medication
*  and all this different stuff
*  they're gonna give him, the steroids,
*  to make that for 300 million people,
*  that's so many people.
*  So if everybody gets sick, you have a dose.
*  We have one dose for every human being in this country.
*  Even if you have one dose for half the people.
*  You can get it done with your money, it's all in.
*  You would need 300 million vials of this shit.
*  That's so much.
*  You're not gonna need all of those.
*  And probably more than that
*  because you need multiple vials per person.
*  They wouldn't even make that number
*  for everybody to get one.
*  They would make that number,
*  it's gotta be, that number's gonna be broken down by,
*  okay, what's the criteria to get this?
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Well, also it would be,
*  how many people do we really wanna get it to?
*  Because how many people are gonna be sick
*  at any one given time?
*  It's probably never gonna be more than 25%
*  of the population, even if it's high.
*  But even if it comes out, Joe, motherfuckers,
*  I'm telling you, certain motherfuckers
*  are not taking that vaccine for whatever reason.
*  Yeah, I think you're right.
*  Your black community is fucked.
*  Niggas ain't fucked with no vaccine, too.
*  It's like, iPhone, so you need the third one.
*  No black person's gonna take it.
*  I think there's a lot of people
*  that are not gonna take it,
*  but I think what they think is herd immunity.
*  Once we get to 50% of the people that took it,
*  the virus will probably die off.
*  I think it's gonna be in that neighborhood
*  of 50% of the people that had it.
*  If 50% of the people either have had COVID
*  or have the vaccine for COVID,
*  they think we're gonna hit herd immunity
*  and it'll mostly die off.
*  But it could always kick back in again.
*  That's what they're worried about,
*  that it's gonna be like the common cold
*  or the flu every year.
*  Would you take a vaccine?
*  Yeah, for sure, if it works, yeah.
*  If it's been proven that it works,
*  and I talk to doctors and they explain
*  what the science is and how it works,
*  and then I talk to people that have taken it
*  and they say what the side effects are,
*  because with the COVID vaccine,
*  I think the side effects are you feel like shit
*  for a couple of days.
*  Who can't deal with feeling like shit for a couple of days?
*  How happy are you when you can't lose two days?
*  Yeah, I would definitely do it if I thought it was safe.
*  I don't know enough about it right now
*  to say that I think,
*  I mean, that was one of the things
*  that Nicholas Christakis was talking about yesterday.
*  He was talking about the potential dangers to the vaccine,
*  and I appreciate that he brought that up
*  because it's such a sensitive area for people.
*  They think that if you think there's a danger
*  in any kind of vaccine, you're some sort of anti-vaxxer.
*  No, there's a potential for danger of any medication
*  when you're dealing with mass numbers of human beings.
*  If you have 300 million people and you give them aspirin,
*  one, I don't know what percentage,
*  but some people are gonna die from aspirin,
*  or they're gonna get really sick from aspirin.
*  This is the same with everything.
*  Substances you put in people's bodies,
*  everybody reacts differently.
*  People die from fucking Brazil nuts.
*  You know, there's some-
*  Yeah, but them motherfuckers wanna waste time
*  with these home remedies and shit, man.
*  Them home remedies, I mean, they're cool for some people,
*  but eventually, man, you're gonna have to talk to somebody.
*  Yeah, for sure, if you got a real disease.
*  The people that wanna cure cancer by not going to a doctor,
*  like, whoa, they can fix it now.
*  There's a lot of cancers, not all of them, of course,
*  but there's a lot of cancer.
*  You're way better off having cancer now
*  with modern medicine than you were having 15, 20 years ago.
*  That said, all that remedy shit,
*  like, the best remedy for all this,
*  besides the medicine if you actually get sick,
*  is to fucking take care of yourself.
*  That's what I'm hoping people get out of this.
*  More people take care of themselves.
*  Yeah, I don't understand.
*  It's convenient. During this time,
*  I don't understand how you could ignore that.
*  Because it's convenient.
*  As long as you're not sick,
*  you don't think you're gonna get sick.
*  You stay home.
*  If you don't have to go anywhere, you just stay home.
*  And a lot of people, they just stop exercising,
*  they stop eating well, they stop drinking water,
*  and they fuck their body up.
*  And then if something does,
*  you don't realize how much of a difference it makes
*  in being healthy and not being healthy
*  when something hits you, a virus hits you, a cold hits you.
*  You see, like when...
*  When I got shot, son.
*  There you go.
*  I had to get the IV, I had to get the fucking,
*  IV antibiotics, son.
*  Well, you guys get IVs all the time.
*  You're always doing vitamin IVs on tour.
*  Vitaflow, Vitaflow, this company.
*  That's such a good move.
*  It is, you did it too.
*  When we did that,
*  that was the first time I'd ever done that.
*  Well, really?
*  Vitamin IV, yeah.
*  I mean, maybe I'd done one once before then.
*  You was on it hard, son.
*  Oh, I'm on it hard now.
*  Yo, you had everything open.
*  You was like, give me one right here.
*  You had half your ass out, son.
*  I'm like, what you got?
*  She gave me a B12 shot in my ass.
*  And I saw your ass, I was sitting right there.
*  I'm like, I was like,
*  nigga, take that shit across the street.
*  He had his fucking stomach out and his ass out.
*  I was like...
*  I'm not scared.
*  I know you're not.
*  You're our friends.
*  It was like, wah, wah, wah.
*  The glutathione was amazing.
*  That stuff is great.
*  The vitamin drip was amazing.
*  We started getting them every week.
*  We've slacked off though, once we got here to Texas.
*  We haven't been doing it in Texas.
*  Man, that motherfucker.
*  I'm telling you about,
*  when I did Yellow Springs this summer,
*  that was probably one of the things
*  that made that experience so amazing
*  is that we were living in our own bubble
*  and playing by our own rules
*  and everybody was having a good time
*  and it was all productive.
*  Yeah, it worked.
*  It worked.
*  You guys put on a lot of shows.
*  Adult summer camps.
*  Yeah, it's beautiful.
*  The shows were one thing,
*  but the thing that was great for me was just
*  the whole sense of community.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  We would have potlucks and shit
*  and then I would have all the housewives of Yellow Springs.
*  Them motherfuckers out there,
*  them motherfucking Yellow Springs chicks, wives,
*  they won't get upset with anything
*  but a casserole dish, son.
*  They was looking for a Rachel Ray casserole dish I had
*  for a week.
*  They was stalking where I was living and everything,
*  but the sense of community, man,
*  is like in that area, it's one coffee shop,
*  Dino's, everybody go there.
*  It's one grocery store.
*  It's just one of everything.
*  That's nice.
*  And it was so simple.
*  Well, that's better really.
*  There's real good things about cities,
*  but the thing that's missing
*  is that camaraderie, that sense of community.
*  Nature.
*  City slickers.
*  They were calling me a city slicker.
*  I saw the videos of you and the river.
*  Yo, Joe, it was the whitest, greatest adventure
*  of the summer.
*  I became the river nigga, right?
*  That's the original name.
*  I'm telling you the truth, son, but.
*  Look at you.
*  You look so peaceful.
*  I am at peace, son.
*  Listen, Joe, I first.
*  What does it say on the quote there?
*  Forever mood.
*  River bitches love the river ninja.
*  They do, son.
*  Bitches love me out there, son.
*  All them earthy bitches that got quartz and rocks
*  and shit, son.
*  Yo, I'm talking about bitches, farmers,
*  market bitches out there like me.
*  I understand what you're saying.
*  They love me like women with rescue dogs.
*  That's a great picture, man.
*  Jamie, get that.
*  Look how peaceful I was, son.
*  I was a river nigga.
*  I had to change the name, Joe.
*  Get that picture framed.
*  I need that picture.
*  Let's get that picture printed on steel.
*  Who took the photograph?
*  Federico.
*  Federico, did I tag him?
*  Yeah.
*  Where is Federico?
*  There he is.
*  Get ahold of Federico.
*  We need that picture in the studio.
*  Yo, he's such a talented fucking producer
*  and everything, man.
*  Beautiful.
*  But that would be a great picture to frame in here.
*  Yo, I fell in love, Joe.
*  People think it's Joe.
*  The river.
*  It's nature.
*  Are you gonna let me describe me?
*  Yeah, I'll let you.
*  First name came up with Joe.
*  It was river nigga, right?
*  And I liked that for the streets, right?
*  But people was like,
*  I don't know if we can put that on T-shirts.
*  They're looking at it from a marketing brand
*  at any point, right?
*  And I was like, okay, Ninja.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But he's inspired by the river nigga.
*  But Ninjas for TV.
*  There's many layers to this story.
*  Many layers to it.
*  Do you fish?
*  I fish.
*  Did you go fishing at all when you guys were done?
*  I didn't get a good chance to go fishing there.
*  But this was me at a river in Georgia, son.
*  Changes your mind, right?
*  It's everything, son.
*  Changes your mind.
*  When you buy a waterfall, you're like, oh.
*  There's something about these natural things
*  like mountains or oceans. Nature, nigga.
*  Nature, nigga. Nature.
*  Nature free as shit, son.
*  Yep.
*  It's good for you.
*  Look at me, son.
*  Let me tell you.
*  I know exactly.
*  They said, when did I turn into a river, nigga?
*  They said, when did I turn?
*  When do I remember to change?
*  It was when...
*  Look at that waterfall, man.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yo, let me tell you the story, son.
*  So, when we were out there,
*  Chappelle's wife used to make these events.
*  Hey, it's family walk day.
*  I'm like, man, fuck that.
*  I'm from the streets.
*  I'm not doing all that stupid shit.
*  She had all these days, like,
*  every day had a goddamn adventure or a start.
*  What's today?
*  You gotta look at the little brochure and shit.
*  And then one day she did one and was kayaking, right?
*  And I went on this kayak.
*  It was me and my man, Patrick.
*  He's a Yellow Spring native, whatever.
*  And we were going down the river, Matt River.
*  I had a kayak, he had a kayak.
*  We were smoking a joint.
*  And we just hear nature.
*  It's like...
*  Just straight nature, right?
*  And then he said, man, you know what this reminds me of?
*  He said, this reminds me of when I was younger,
*  building ramps, jumping ramps on my bike,
*  and me fishing for crawdads with my dad.
*  I was like, nigga, this reminds me of looking for my dad.
*  His stories, the two stories were totally opposite.
*  It represented one thing for him.
*  Memories he had with his dad.
*  For me, it represented the memories I didn't have
*  with my dad and the memories I wanted to create
*  with my son, you know what I'm saying?
*  When I was out there, Joe, all I think was like,
*  I gotta bring this little motherfucker to the river.
*  He's gotta be out here.
*  He's got friends out there.
*  And my son came out there and the summer was beautiful.
*  But one thing was missing,
*  no matter how you're celebrating in life, right?
*  If you're not sharing it with your family, it feels weird.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  You know, it feels like, oh man,
*  I don't even know if it's fair for me to have this much fun.
*  And although how great the summer was going,
*  when he came out, he was hanging with me on the river
*  and shit, man, it was like the best shit ever.
*  Son, we was skipping, Jamie, you know how to skip rocks?
*  Of course.
*  Do you know how to skip?
*  Yeah.
*  It's in the wrist, right?
*  I was in the Boy Scouts.
*  Yo, don't say you're in the Boy Scouts today, son.
*  Why?
*  They might have played with your booty holes, son.
*  Yo, there's a lot of them, man.
*  Don't tell me, don't be proud of the Boy Scouts.
*  Pick another division, son, not the Boy Scouts.
*  Nothing ever happened to my booty hole.
*  I had a great time.
*  I hung out with a bunch of criminals.
*  That's what you do in the Boy Scouts.
*  We were skipping rocks.
*  Like, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't know it was that much precision.
*  It depends on the rock.
*  You really want a nice flat rock.
*  A nice flat rock.
*  If you get a flat rock, you could do some wild shit.
*  When we were going out every day, Tlaib Kweli, right?
*  He thinks he's a river nigga, right?
*  He told us one day, I could skip any rock.
*  You know what type of, he said,
*  he said, it don't matter how big it is,
*  I could skip any rock.
*  That doesn't seem likely.
*  That's the fucking Brooklyn cockiness he had, right?
*  Yeah.
*  The shit was like, thush, thush, thush.
*  It was like, thush, thush.
*  The next time we went,
*  he wants to challenge me in rock skipping again.
*  This time, this motherfucker was pulling rocks
*  out of his shorts.
*  He had rocks with him already?
*  He prepared?
*  Joe, he came-
*  Invasive rocks.
*  He came with all perfect flat river rocks.
*  Oh, that's crazy.
*  He didn't bend over.
*  Is there a world championship of rock skipping?
*  It seems like people would take it super seriously.
*  I think it would.
*  I think it's something to think,
*  I'm pretty sure it's done somewhere.
*  I never thought about it to this moment,
*  but I'm sure there's gotta be a competition.
*  A rock skipping competition.
*  And they got groovy bitches?
*  The girls who, it's off season for bowling,
*  so they go after rock skippers.
*  Yeah, we heard you had a tin skipper last week.
*  A tin skipper could get you a blow job, son.
*  That's what gets you so WAP.
*  If you're looking for WAP, do a tin skipper, son.
*  You know what WAP is, right?
*  I do, yeah.
*  Who educated you to it?
*  Because I don't think,
*  no disrespect to your hip hop or whatever,
*  someone introduced you to WAP.
*  I don't know, it might have been Jamie.
*  Was it you?
*  Could be.
*  Yeah, because of the Ben Shapiro video.
*  Oh, that's right, that's right, that's right, yeah.
*  Which was it?
*  Because Ben Shapiro,
*  Ben Shapiro was like, you know when people self-own,
*  they don't realize they're self-owning?
*  When the song's about wet ass pussies,
*  well that sounds like a gynecological condition.
*  I would tend to.
*  And people are like, what?
*  That's not the point, man.
*  I know the point is, but I understand it.
*  They're horny.
*  That's an, I understand this point.
*  That's an abnormal amount of moisture.
*  Yes.
*  To be able to come up with a whole song about it,
*  it's like, it's a level.
*  What do you think would happen
*  if you came out with a song called Hard Ass Dick?
*  I wanna do it.
*  I think it would not be received that well,
*  as minimal controversy as Wet Ass Pussy.
*  Certain songs gotta be answers.
*  Right.
*  Like answers to a song.
*  To Wet Ass Pussy's Hard Ass Dick.
*  K. Michelle had a song, You Can't Change a Man, right?
*  And I flipped it and did a song called,
*  You Can't Raise a Bitch.
*  You Can't Save a Bitch.
*  That was the name of the song, Can't Save a Bitch.
*  Do you remember when they used to have songs
*  and then they would have answer songs
*  and then like, there's been a bunch of those, right?
*  Where someone would have a song
*  and then someone like, someone would have a response song
*  to that song.
*  Like Scrubs.
*  Yes!
*  Scrubs was, then they had another one.
*  It was, I can't remember, but I know you said-
*  I Saw You Standing in the Rain,
*  wasn't there one of those?
*  Orange Juice Jones.
*  When they were an answer song to that?
*  I'm telling you, if I know any answer to that-
*  Orange Juice Jones.
*  If I know any answer to that,
*  I just immediately told how old I am.
*  To know Orange Juice Jones and how cool he was.
*  Orange Juice Jones was the shit.
*  That song was the best at the time.
*  That was an original kind of song.
*  There'd never been a song that told a whole story
*  of getting done wrong like that.
*  Especially, it didn't tell it in the rain.
*  Right.
*  Like, everybody knows that story,
*  but you followed this couple in the rain.
*  Yeah.
*  And then at the end, when he chopped up his credit cards-
*  He got back with his revenge.
*  Yeah.
*  That's like, he's like,
*  go on bitch, get outta here.
*  He had his credit cards and everything.
*  Yeah.
*  That was a song that made people happy.
*  Hey Joe, I came over here, I'm not selling shit,
*  but I just wanted to show it.
*  Joe, I'm sorry. You got more stuff?
*  Yeah, look, you remember this, right?
*  Remember my black ash, right?
*  Yes.
*  All right, here, that's for Riyadh.
*  Thank you.
*  Riyadh.
*  We kept the other one in California
*  because we weren't sure if we were gonna
*  be going back and forth.
*  Yeah, you got that one.
*  Look at this one right here.
*  There's some hoes in this house candle.
*  That's for a holiday, Joe.
*  It's a ho, ho, ho.
*  Hoes.
*  Not like H-O-E.
*  There's some hoes in this house candle.
*  That's a funny name for a candle.
*  Look at this one though, Joe.
*  Because I fell in love with Yellow Spring.
*  That's one of my top sellers, Joe.
*  Oh, Yellow Spring candle.
*  From the streets to the creeks.
*  From the hood to the woods, from hoes to oars,
*  from Adidas to Teeva, son.
*  I got a whole store, boom.
*  And this for the white chicks out there
*  because I got a lot of white bitches out there now.
*  Okay, Karen Candle.
*  Imagine if your name was Karen
*  and you were fine for like 30 years.
*  Joe, there's more.
*  Look at this, son.
*  That's a hit bag, son.
*  I feel like all of a sudden
*  we turn into the home shopping network.
*  That's what I wanted to avoid, Joe,
*  but at the same time,
*  at the same time, I opened up an online store, son,
*  and it's doing well.
*  Okay.
*  Do you have a website that we could just put up on the screen
*  instead of bringing all these objects out
*  one after another?
*  Joe.
*  Do you call it, no, listen.
*  Oh, you have a little thing.
*  You scan with the phone.
*  You call them objects.
*  I don't call it objects.
*  Products.
*  Man, give me my candle back, man.
*  What is it if it's not a product?
*  No, just if you don't want them, Joe, give them back.
*  I do.
*  You gonna use them?
*  I'll definitely use them.
*  All right.
*  I like candles.
*  Those are good, too.
*  And they're soy, too.
*  They're soy.
*  Yeah, they're hand-pointed in the USA.
*  You can have them back.
*  I'm not into soy.
*  I don't do anything with soy.
*  It's a candle, man.
*  Don't disrespect that people want that.
*  People get mad at soy.
*  Soy is like a political fruit or a vegetable.
*  Is it?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  People call you a soy boy.
*  If you're a Republican,
*  people call weak men soy boys.
*  That's like a, it's an insult.
*  I never knew that.
*  Soy is one of the rare foods
*  that's actually attached to being a bitch.
*  That's a pussy food?
*  Yeah, like if you're a guy who's really into soy,
*  and this is not my perspective.
*  This is just, I just think it's a fucking,
*  it's a plant.
*  It doesn't matter to me.
*  Right.
*  Isn't that edamame?
*  Isn't that soy?
*  Like when you have edamame at a Japanese restaurant,
*  isn't it soy?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Is that the case, Jamie?
*  The first time I ever tried edamame,
*  I was so ghetto.
*  You ate the whole thing?
*  Yeah, and I was like,
*  I was like, my throat was killing me, son.
*  The best part is the outside.
*  I didn't know anything about it, goddamn.
*  You put all the delicious salts
*  and everything on the outside?
*  The sea salt, yeah, some sea salt.
*  I never.
*  If you had a bowl of just edamame.
*  It takes away from it.
*  You wouldn't even want it.
*  It's the whole process.
*  It's the whole process of like ripping the sleeve.
*  Edamame beans are whole immature soybeans,
*  sometimes referred to as vegetable type soybeans.
*  They're green in different color from regular soybeans,
*  which are typically light brown, tan, or beige.
*  Yeah, so it's the soy.
*  I like edamame.
*  I don't mind soy, but a lot of people think of soy
*  as being like a bitch food.
*  I never knew that.
*  I thought it was a healthy,
*  I mean, I knew that it was not the most masculine food,
*  but I thought it was like, you stepped your game up.
*  When you entered the edamame lane, it's like,
*  oh shit, this motherfucker eat edamame then.
*  I think there's a reason.
*  I think soy lowers your testosterone.
*  I think there's like estrogen.
*  Yeah, soy isoflavones can produce
*  estrogen-like activity in the body,
*  mimicking the effects of natural estrogen.
*  But I think you have to-
*  You can grow titties off of soy?
*  Not quite, but it might feminize you.
*  It might feminize you.
*  Fuck soy, man.
*  Plants affect your hormone production.
*  Do you know they actually develop testosterone,
*  like synthetic testosterone, from wild yams.
*  Like plants, yeah.
*  From wild yams?
*  Wild yams, yeah.
*  That's how they develop some artificial testosterone,
*  or exogenous testosterone.
*  I would think that that would be part of the whole
*  Cytlus, Cialis, and Blue Peel era.
*  That's a different thing, though.
*  That's just blood flow.
*  That's nitrous oxide.
*  So why is nobody promoting wild yams?
*  Not nitrous oxide.
*  Nitrous, what is it?
*  Nitric oxide.
*  That's like NO explode, all those pump things you do
*  when you wanna get jacked, when you're lifting weights.
*  A lot of those supplements, they mimic the same sort
*  of effect, just not to the same degree as finasteride,
*  like Viagra and Cialis and shit like that.
*  But they don't make you have more testosterone.
*  With these, like soybeans, and I think really,
*  for it to affect your hormones, I think it's just like,
*  it can, it's a possibility, like chemically,
*  but in order to actually do it, I think you'd have to eat
*  some fucking preposterous number of soybeans.
*  I don't think it's like something people really have
*  to worry about.
*  It's not one sitting, right?
*  No, I don't think it's anything
*  anybody really has to worry about.
*  But I think it's just a stereotype.
*  I didn't even know that the thing, for me,
*  I didn't even know the stereotype.
*  Yeah, they call people soy boys.
*  I didn't know that, I thought it was like,
*  you're evolving as a foodie.
*  You know, like the first time I had it,
*  I was like, oh shit, y'all niggas don't know
*  about the edamames.
*  Because I was introducing somebody else to it,
*  but I didn't know that it symbolized being a pussy.
*  It doesn't, it's silly, people are silly.
*  Tastes good, edamame tastes good.
*  If they do it right, put a little chili powder
*  and salt on the outside.
*  I like it with just sea salt.
*  I like it sea salt, too.
*  I'm working at a stadium, Joe.
*  Are you really?
*  What are you doing?
*  RFK Stadium.
*  Where's that?
*  In Washington, D.C.
*  When are you doing that?
*  Thanksgiving weekend.
*  Oh shit.
*  It's not the stadium, it's the parking lot, right?
*  You're doing like an outdoor show.
*  I'm doing an outdoor show.
*  Just like the ones that Bert's been doing.
*  Yeah, but it's not at that level.
*  Yeah, I talked to Bert about that.
*  Shout out to Bert and shout out to the cab.
*  Bert is the guy who started it all off.
*  People aren't giving him enough credit.
*  He's the OG of drive-through shows.
*  Bert was the guy.
*  It fit right into his whole shit.
*  He never stopped touring.
*  Bert toured through the entire pandemic doing drive-throughs.
*  And I was saying to myself,
*  is this like a throwback Thursday or whatever?
*  He was like this.
*  And then the name of what was the summer,
*  what was the name of the tour?
*  The Hot Summer Tour.
*  I'm like this motherfucker,
*  but he created the bubble and he fucking did it.
*  Created a bubble, stayed drunk the entire summer,
*  and enjoyed it.
*  Had a good time.
*  I'm doing RFK Stadium.
*  It's the original stadium for the Washington Redskins.
*  The Washington Redskins used to do that.
*  Beautiful.
*  But for nine years, that was my traditional show
*  at the DC Improv.
*  I would do Thanksgiving weekend.
*  It was a good time for me
*  because I got to see my family.
*  I got to work.
*  That's a great club too.
*  It's a great club.
*  That DC Improv is one of the 10 greatest clubs
*  in the country.
*  And it's been probably the most consistent for 25 years.
*  So good.
*  It's just the perfect size, perfect.
*  Everything about it's perfect.
*  Every year it's solid.
*  I don't even know that a comic can do bad
*  in terms of ticket sales there.
*  Everybody seems to do well.
*  At least the lineup that they have.
*  They book good lineups.
*  When a club's got that much prestige,
*  they've been around that.
*  There's certain clubs like Comedy Works
*  where people just trust them.
*  There's a bunch.
*  Helium and Philly.
*  People just trust them.
*  It's gonna be a good show.
*  They're not gonna book any scrubs.
*  And that's how the DC Improv is felt.
*  They have developed a community.
*  For nine years I saw my son.
*  The first time I took him up,
*  it was just him in my arms.
*  And then the next time he was kind of crawling.
*  Then next time he was walking.
*  Then he walked to the stage.
*  I had four years of pictures of his growth there.
*  And then because of the pandemic,
*  I thought the weekend was gone.
*  I'm like, damn, that blows the tradition.
*  And then they made a pivot from the DC Improv
*  to partnering up with DC Pull Up or whatever it is.
*  And they're doing the fucking outside shit.
*  That's beautiful.
*  I like that people are adapting.
*  That's one of the things you were saying.
*  You started this business
*  and Burt started doing things outside
*  and Tom Segura's doing these pay-per-view shows.
*  Tom Segura and Burt Kreischer are doing these.
*  And sometimes Christina, they switch up back and forth.
*  They're doing these crazy live shows.
*  I saw.
*  The shit that he sends me.
*  I mean, I'll show it to you after the show.
*  See, during these live shows,
*  it's 100% uncensored because it's pay-per-view.
*  So they don't have to worry about YouTube.
*  They don't have to worry about.
*  It's whatever.
*  They are showing the most fucked up videos
*  I have ever seen in my life.
*  In my life.
*  Really?
*  In my life.
*  He sent me three things yesterday
*  that changed my idea of what's possible.
*  Oh my God.
*  You gonna do it?
*  Do one of his shows?
*  Yeah.
*  I would certainly do it if we were in town together.
*  Tom's talking about moving here.
*  If he moves here.
*  Everybody niggas moving out here.
*  Yeah.
*  You got the whole squad coming back here.
*  We're gonna open up a club here.
*  I'm down, son.
*  Come on down.
*  It's better here.
*  You don't have to pay taxes for the state.
*  People are nicer.
*  The barbeque's off the hook.
*  They said on the streets, they said,
*  on the streets, they said,
*  Joe ain't stupid, son.
*  The streets said, that nigga said,
*  I'm getting the fuck up out of here, son.
*  Well, I saw the writing on the wall.
*  I'm like, they're not gonna open up the clubs.
*  If you don't have a comedy club open, I can't stay.
*  If the comedy store was open,
*  there would be no reason for me to leave LA.
*  I know.
*  On the flip of that, just because it's not open,
*  it's not, there's no reason for you to.
*  Be in LA.
*  Be there.
*  You can create it.
*  Well, the only time I could create it though,
*  is in an absence of the club.
*  Cause I wouldn't ask people, hey, leave LA.
*  The comedy store's hopping and killing.
*  Come to Austin.
*  But when you can't open, they can't.
*  They're not allowing them to open.
*  And it could be years.
*  Who the fuck knows now?
*  Here we are now, eight months in.
*  No one ever, we thought it was two weeks.
*  But remember when you thought it was two weeks?
*  So it was two weeks, but then again,
*  even moving forward, Joe,
*  you gotta remove the possibility of something taking,
*  you gotta remove yourself from the possibility
*  of somebody taking something away from you.
*  And like with me, like that.
*  The way you're thinking,
*  and the way Dave has thought throughout this summer,
*  I was like, yo, we really can make this shit.
*  Well also, what we were saying before,
*  that we were all connected to Hollywood,
*  cause we thought we needed Hollywood
*  in order to get us on television,
*  in order to pay our bills.
*  We needed to get hired.
*  And then once podcasting came along,
*  I think people realized, no you don't.
*  You just need your friends.
*  And you have a bunch of funny friends,
*  and everybody's tight, and everybody tells people,
*  hey, go see Theo Vons at this place.
*  Go see this guy, go see that guy.
*  And we all get along together.
*  We don't need anybody else.
*  Yo, but Joe, the toughest part,
*  what did I notice in this podcast world,
*  which is predominantly white, that's the truth of it.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  It's like, there's a lot more white-caste podcast.
*  When it comes to that,
*  when you say like the friendship part and making money,
*  they really, about their life, they really do it.
*  They really do it.
*  They don't talk about it.
*  Every one of the guys that I've done,
*  from D'Lea, from Bobby, from the whole crew,
*  it's never no, oh man, it's like, let's do it.
*  Everybody helps everybody.
*  Everybody's friendly.
*  And there's only a few people in the podcast world
*  that don't have friends.
*  They're weirdos.
*  I don't know, they're out in the fringes.
*  They're out in the fringes.
*  Those poor people, they, a lot of people go into things
*  with like a legacy attitude,
*  and the legacy attitude that you know from radio
*  is you're competing against the other people
*  that are doing the same thing.
*  But the podcast world is not like that.
*  But some people are like that.
*  Some people will complain if a guest is on this podcast
*  and then on their podcast.
*  They'll complain.
*  If you were just on that podcast,
*  now it's gonna take away from people listening to me.
*  Nigga, I got more shit to talk about.
*  You ain't got no life.
*  Well, not on that, it's crazy.
*  Yo, I never understood that, son.
*  They like, aw.
*  I'm like, nigga, every podcast I go on,
*  it's talking about something else.
*  And not only that, but if you go on a podcast
*  and they like you, if you go on a podcast
*  and they like you, and then I hear,
*  now you're gonna go on Bobby's podcast,
*  I'm gonna watch you on that podcast too.
*  Because it's not like I'm gonna, like,
*  I do one podcast and now I'm out of time.
*  No, I have more time.
*  You're gonna have another week is gonna go by
*  where you want something to listen to.
*  And then more people are gonna listen to you on Bobby's
*  if they heard you on somebody else's.
*  And here's the thing, Joe.
*  If you're interested enough
*  for motherfuckers wanting to listen to you,
*  that's it, if you could do it.
*  The toughest part, this week, literally,
*  I think the anniversary of the first time
*  I ever was on this show.
*  Really?
*  I think it's this week.
*  Jamie's checking.
*  I heard those fingers, son.
*  My producers don't do that.
*  Them bitches be looking me right in my face.
*  I be trying to tell you.
*  It is, right?
*  Yeah, I guess.
*  What was it?
*  Was that, you were on before that, right?
*  February 19th, now you're on before that one.
*  Before that one?
*  No, this is the first one we talked about the RZA shit.
*  That was that one.
*  That was a year ago this week.
*  Yeah, that's when.
*  November 12th.
*  So, but yeah, but you've been on longer.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, but I'm just saying.
*  And the last one.
*  Oh, yes.
*  So, I know you guys wanna break down the story.
*  It's not that sentimental,
*  but I was just saying, I remember the dates.
*  Yeah, no, I get it.
*  It was that.
*  And it's been like, it's been,
*  I've been doing it for a year,
*  and it's been interesting.
*  It happens, right?
*  It picks up steam, it picks up momentum.
*  I see on your Instagram stories,
*  or your Instagram, either, you're putting clips up.
*  The little assets and shit.
*  Get people excited.
*  Yeah, but yo, everything you said,
*  it was like, once I got out of the mode,
*  I'm like, this has to be the greatest episode.
*  I'm like, wait a minute.
*  And I started looking at the numbers
*  of the most successful people in the podcast world.
*  It's like episode 1,582.
*  That's a lot.
*  Yo, I'm struggling for like,
*  yeah, this is the 30 episode anniversary.
*  Well, you know how Goggins tells everybody
*  he used to be fat?
*  I tell everybody, go to episode one.
*  It's fucking terrible.
*  It's terrible.
*  We didn't even think it was a podcast.
*  That's how terrible it was.
*  We didn't know what it was, but you did it.
*  We were doing it with just answering questions
*  off of Twitter and being stupid while we were high.
*  No one thought it was ever gonna be something
*  that millions of people listened to.
*  When we started it out, it wasn't,
*  there was no expectations.
*  Now people have expectations.
*  Now you realize how much money is in it.
*  You see all these people that get big deals.
*  You see all these people that are number one on iTunes
*  and number two on fucking Spotify, and you go, fuck.
*  There's a lot going on.
*  This is a whole network that you don't need a lot
*  to get into.
*  Man, the number one thing you have to do,
*  and I kept tricking myself when we were talking about it,
*  was talking.
*  Can you talk?
*  That's ridiculous that you don't think that you could talk.
*  It's one of the most funny things I've ever heard.
*  Son, I mean, with no response,
*  just like me talking to myself.
*  That's easy.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  It's like, you know, I got a better chance
*  of making a thousand people laugh than one person.
*  True.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  But it's been a great ride, man.
*  But dude, dear, you over there, Julius.
*  You know who's the best at just talking?
*  Bill Burr.
*  That motherfucker just, he never has a dead moment.
*  He will start on a subject and like, you know,
*  and then you know what they wanna fucking do,
*  and then an hour later.
*  He was one of the guys that had it.
*  I was like, what would your style be more like?
*  I just like, I don't wanna fucking talk to nobody.
*  I just wanna say what I wanna fucking say and fuck you.
*  And then it was like the Monday rant or something.
*  Yeah, Monday morning podcast.
*  Monday morning podcast.
*  And it was just like, I was like,
*  this motherfucker can talk shit for whatever.
*  It's like, whatever.
*  It's like a dude that goes,
*  he like wins all the bar fight conversations.
*  And it's the perfect platform for that.
*  Oh, for Bill, it's the perfect platform.
*  One of the things he used to do
*  is he used to use his cell phone.
*  And this is when, God,
*  the early days of the Monday morning podcast,
*  I don't know when it started.
*  I bet you it had to be around 2006, seven, eight,
*  somewhere around there.
*  It could be, I don't remember.
*  But what I do remember is that he did a bunch of them
*  where he like left voicemails.
*  So he would call himself or call a service
*  and leave a voicemail.
*  Really?
*  So he'd be sitting there at the airport
*  talking shit about some dude's haircut.
*  Oh yeah, I remember those, yeah.
*  And then he had some, it was just him really ranting.
*  Just fuck with people.
*  Yeah, the audio quality was fucking terrible
*  because he was literally talking into an old phone
*  at the airport and then leaving a message somewhere
*  and that message became the podcast.
*  And you know what?
*  But it was hilarious.
*  It didn't even matter the quality of the sound.
*  The idea was funny.
*  Just like when I told you that time
*  when Jamie was supposed to help me produce
*  and then he fucking reneged on me, right?
*  Right, he got real mad at me, whatever.
*  I remember it was like it was yesterday.
*  I understand.
*  I don't know how those two are connected.
*  But Bill Burr, when he first started out,
*  that was literally the perfect platform for him
*  in podcasting.
*  He's good at interviewing people.
*  I've been on his show before.
*  Other people have been on his show before.
*  He'll sit and talk to people.
*  He's fine with it.
*  But as far as ranting, he's the best.
*  Yeah, that comes from an angry place.
*  Yeah, but he's also been doing it the longest.
*  You gotta think how many fucking years
*  he's been doing that podcast where he just,
*  that muscle is flexed.
*  That muscle is tight.
*  He doesn't need, like you can form an opinion,
*  but he doesn't need the response.
*  Most people need the response and the feedback.
*  How else do you know if you're doing good or not?
*  Yeah, he doesn't think about that.
*  He's like, and another thing.
*  I was watching Seth Meier the other night
*  and he was doing this monologue or whatever
*  and it was going okay.
*  And then some people in the background were laughing
*  and you could just see the posture and everything changed.
*  Once he got a couple of people laughing,
*  it was like, that's important.
*  I heard his Netflix special's good.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, I saw a clip on it and it did not look bad.
*  It did not look bad.
*  When is this?
*  Is this recent?
*  Cause I know he's had one.
*  I wanna say his Netflix special was at least a year ago
*  cause it was pre-pandemic for sure.
*  I didn't see the entire thing.
*  And I saw some clips and I was like,
*  this is good delivery, it's good writing.
*  And I don't know that Seth Meier's really had
*  a long background in standup, did he?
*  No.
*  He had a background doing that show,
*  doing the monologue for the show.
*  But I think his standup was very good.
*  I thought it was solid.
*  Did you ever see it, Jamie?
*  It's solid.
*  It came out the other night in October last year.
*  Jesus.
*  That's not a good time to be coughing.
*  It was very good.
*  Into what I saw, the clips.
*  I didn't watch the whole thing.
*  But most of the guys when they do SNL.
*  But you know there's some people that have done talk shows
*  and then tried to do a standup special
*  and they don't really have the chops for it.
*  But that didn't seem like that with him.
*  He seemed very relaxed.
*  He probably was in the beast world, wow.
*  Well, he probably did the right thing too.
*  He probably hired a bunch of writers.
*  I mean, I didn't see all of it.
*  Maybe the part that I saw was the only funny thing.
*  I really have no idea.
*  A lot of those guys, I guess when they,
*  I guess to be buried into that show like that.
*  Yeah, it's hard.
*  You don't really have time to go out and work out.
*  No, it's hard.
*  And work that.
*  But if you could do it,
*  like Jimmy Kimmel could do standup for sure, 100%.
*  Jimmy Kimmel wanted to do standup, 100% he could do it.
*  He would be great at it.
*  What do you think about Jim Carrey on SNL as Biden?
*  I didn't watch it.
*  None of it?
*  Nope.
*  Not one piece of it?
*  Not a piece.
*  God damn, son.
*  I got shit to do.
*  If I'm gonna watch something,
*  generally when I get home,
*  I like to watch things that have nothing to do
*  with what's going on right now.
*  By the end of the day, I don't, I mean.
*  Oh, you like documentaries and shit like that.
*  New Netflix special lets you skip the Trump jokes.
*  Oh, there's a button you can skip Trump jokes?
*  Yeah, you can skip the intro on Netflix.
*  You could skip the chunk of stuff.
*  But this is him talking to people.
*  So he's interviewing people.
*  Well, this is just an interview about it.
*  Oh, interview about it.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Oh, that's funny.
*  Yeah, well, that's a good move
*  because people are tired of Trump jokes.
*  It's one of those subjects
*  that people are like enough already.
*  Man, I've been tired of him.
*  And now I'm like.
*  They're coming back around?
*  To be frustrated.
*  To be frustrated when a dude is on his way out,
*  it doesn't make no sense.
*  It's like he is still getting to you.
*  It's just a matter of time.
*  If you wanna say the people,
*  the voice of the peoples was heard,
*  it was a close situation,
*  but it is what it is and he's gone.
*  Why are you still mad?
*  People have some legitimate gripes
*  and I understand where they're coming from.
*  But my perspective is it's not changing anything
*  and it's not doing you any good to still be holding on.
*  If you are anti-Trump, Biden's,
*  I mean, I don't think it's 99% official, right?
*  I mean, they just haven't said it yet.
*  And when they say it, then he will become president.
*  And then Kamala Harris will be the new vice president.
*  So concentrate on good things now, it's over.
*  But people are so obsessed.
*  I heard them fuckers the other day,
*  I might've said this earlier,
*  look at Mike Pence and him having a meeting with no mask.
*  Man, okay, why you still keep getting mad
*  because this motherfucker don't have a mask on?
*  There's gotta be something else to talk about, son.
*  But they wanna talk about negative things,
*  that's the thing.
*  Some people get addicted to talking about negative things
*  and they can't regroup even after a victory
*  and now focus on positive things.
*  They wanna continue to focus on negative things.
*  And I can see their perspective too,
*  especially with all these crazy tweets,
*  like I won that election, it's all fraud,
*  it's all this, it's all that.
*  Man, if you've got some real claims,
*  now I don't know what the claims are,
*  I haven't really honestly investigated them,
*  but if you've got some real claims,
*  you gotta present the evidence
*  and then once you present the evidence,
*  you say all the stuff like I got robbed, I really won it.
*  If you wanna be in a position where you're respected,
*  if you're the president of the United States,
*  this isn't a regular guy, it's not like if you
*  were involved in some ridiculous
*  like small neighborhood election
*  and you were joking around on Twitter,
*  I won that fucking election, that's to be expected.
*  But when someone's in a position where they're
*  in charge of the nuclear football,
*  they literally are the commander in chief
*  of the greatest army the world's ever known.
*  And they're firing motherfuckers.
*  And you're saying shit like that
*  and firing people that don't agree with it.
*  Fire motherfuckers that like,
*  I know these other plays like,
*  boy this would be a great time for
*  a fucking terrorist attack right now.
*  Well one of the guys he fired,
*  what the guy said was he didn't believe
*  there was widespread voter fraud.
*  He's like you're fired.
*  If you don't believe that, you're fired.
*  Like this is like a mad man.
*  The interesting part for me is like
*  you trying to switch the thoughts
*  of a person that is a huge Trump fan,
*  it's a waste of time.
*  You're only gonna be,
*  the only thing you're gonna be is frustrated.
*  See here's the thing though.
*  I don't know, and this is where it's really important.
*  I don't know exactly how the election went down
*  in terms of like, was there like 0.01% fraud?
*  Was there 0.5% fraud?
*  How much fraud was there?
*  We gotta assume that when there's people counting stuff,
*  there's some fuckery going on.
*  Yeah but the fuckery that's been reported
*  has been like still no more than like 40 people, bruh.
*  And then the only other problem is
*  that it's all done through these machines, right?
*  And then there's been all these conspiracy theories
*  about machines that were supposed to have been
*  giving the votes to Trump, gave those votes to Biden.
*  Now I could repeat those things,
*  but I don't know if they're true.
*  But what I do know is, you know what I'm saying?
*  I do know is that I know Georgia,
*  I know the motherfuckers pulled all of them envelopes
*  up to the building and they cut them open
*  and they took them hand by hand.
*  They did them hand by hand.
*  Yo those ones that were recounts or whatever,
*  those you can't, it's no machine, it's hand by hand.
*  Right.
*  It's fucking probably.
*  And how does that work?
*  Did someone watch while they do it?
*  Like do they have a supervisor?
*  Cause I would imagine you would wanna have
*  like almost like two people watch while one person does it,
*  which is so ridiculous.
*  But it seems like you kinda, if you don't trust people.
*  I know if you don't trust people.
*  You kinda have to have someone watching it.
*  That's part of the argument that Trump's administration
*  was saying too, was that there were certain counts
*  that they weren't allowed to observe.
*  They had to be really far away and they couldn't actually see.
*  That sounds like people that like soybeans, right?
*  But.
*  That's a very soybeanish, that's a very soy boy attitude.
*  But what if they're telling the truth?
*  Here's the thing, I don't know and you don't know either.
*  So if they were telling the truth
*  and people were counting votes incorrectly or.
*  They find no evidence of that every time that he's.
*  I don't think they have either.
*  Every time that they came out with all these losses
*  and they're dropping them, dropping them
*  cause there's no evidence of it.
*  He's probably made, he's had to have made
*  every argument he can make.
*  No, listen, I agree with you.
*  I agree with you.
*  There's no evidence that they can present
*  that's gonna show people right now
*  that there was so much voter fraud
*  that they gotta return everything and start all over
*  or they gotta give it to Trump.
*  Like I agree with you.
*  I think this is what all these experts are saying.
*  They're all saying that even if there was voter fraud,
*  it wasn't enough to tilt the election one way or another.
*  But I don't know how these machines work.
*  So if I'm even commenting on it,
*  if I'm saying they couldn't have done it,
*  that's ridiculous.
*  I'm saying they must have done it.
*  That's just as ridiculous.
*  I really don't know.
*  That's like, when you're talking about voting,
*  you're talking about how many millions of people are voting
*  and all this information is coming in
*  and they gotta sort it out.
*  You're gonna have some mistakes.
*  There's no way around it.
*  But the question is, does it overall balance out
*  or are the mistakes all for one side?
*  If you find out the mistakes are all for Biden,
*  then you're gonna go, huh, really?
*  Well, who owns the company that makes the machines?
*  And then how are they financed?
*  And who programmed that?
*  And how are they programmed?
*  Is it possible to fuck with the data?
*  It is possible.
*  Can you show me how to do it?
*  You can do it.
*  You can, so, saying anything about the vote,
*  everybody wants to know exactly what happened.
*  I think there's very few people
*  that know exactly what happened.
*  I know the machines and all that type of shit,
*  but when they take the machines away and they say,
*  okay, we're counting these hand by hand,
*  the results of that have to be official.
*  Yeah, well, they definitely should be.
*  I'm not gonna say like the machines,
*  but they was like, these mail-in motherfuckers,
*  they had to fucking count every vote.
*  Yeah, it's a matter of how they're recording it, right?
*  You would wanna make sure
*  that everybody recorded it accurately.
*  I don't know how they do it.
*  But I would imagine that when I was talking to a guy
*  like Mike Baker, and he was saying
*  that even if there was fraud,
*  there's not enough fraud to overturn it.
*  I would imagine he knows some things.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't.
*  I'm a moron.
*  So me talking about, we all do that.
*  We talk about he won, she won,
*  and there's no way there was fraud,
*  or it was definitely fraud,
*  or I think Trump won by a landslide.
*  People get real connected,
*  they get real connected to who's winning
*  or losing this election, and I get it.
*  Man, I'm gonna miss Donald Trump, son.
*  Yo, I like-
*  He's not going anywhere, man.
*  TV, man, I'm gonna miss him on TV.
*  This motherfucker's TV persona is fucking-
*  You know what sucks?
*  What sucks that it's even-
*  His TV persona is like, he's a TV motherfucker.
*  It sucks that it's even possible
*  that someone could monkey with an election
*  to the point where you change the outcome.
*  It sucks that that's even a thought
*  that we could get into our head.
*  That's one of the crazy things about people.
*  We're so nuts-
*  But that was in Planet-
*  That if we believe in a side,
*  people that are good people will do some shady shit
*  to have their candidate win.
*  Yeah.
*  For sure.
*  That's politics.
*  We're so crazy.
*  That's politics.
*  Anything goes.
*  Anything goes.
*  Yeah, so what bothers me,
*  and I do think that Biden won the election,
*  and I do think, I mean,
*  I think there's probably some shenanigans,
*  but I think the result is most likely correct.
*  But it bothers me that there's even a question.
*  It bothers me that anyone would ever think
*  that anyone could,
*  but I think that there's Republicans
*  that think Democrats could do it,
*  and I think there's Democrats
*  that think Republicans can do it.
*  And I think it's gonna be real hard
*  to 100% trust the election.
*  That's one of the things that's kind of dangerous
*  about someone going after it.
*  This election is rigged.
*  This election is rigged.
*  When Trump is doing that,
*  he's encouraging people,
*  and maybe that's a good thing if they are rigged,
*  because maybe they're gonna be able to figure out
*  how to stop that from happening in the future,
*  or maybe it's gonna erode-
*  They have to.
*  Or maybe it's gonna erode
*  people's confidence in the elections.
*  And the more he does it, the more it erodes,
*  and the more it gets dangerous.
*  There's a real argument for that, too.
*  But listen again,
*  I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
*  Man, it's just...
*  I know, it's nuts.
*  It's nuts that anybody would ever think
*  there'd be any voter fraud on either side,
*  but we know that people have done it.
*  That's apparently how they got JFK in.
*  Wasn't there some crazy conspiracy
*  about the mob rigged votes for JFK,
*  and that's how he became-
*  Wasn't that a thing, Jamie?
*  I've heard-
*  Has that ever been proven?
*  I've heard talks about recently,
*  they were in such odds with each other
*  that they would never have helped him.
*  I think he was really at odds with them afterwards,
*  because he didn't,
*  look, the thought was that was one of the reasons
*  why he was assassinated,
*  that he kinda doubled back on his agreement with the mob.
*  The explanation I heard,
*  they were just helping local politicians,
*  not the way they did to the president.
*  Oh, he didn't trade his streets!
*  Well, his family were drug runners.
*  The Kennedys were moonshiners.
*  They made their money selling bootleg liquor
*  during the time where it was illegal.
*  They were basically drug dealers,
*  and then they became this gigantic political dynasty.
*  They were the Trumps, no, not the Trump family,
*  but they motherfuckers were-
*  They were more gangster than the Trump family, really,
*  because their literal background was in drug running.
*  Bootleg liquor, moonshot is drugs, that's drug running.
*  You just don't think of it now because alcohol is legal.
*  They were drug runners!
*  Yeah, and who had this shit?
*  Who had the sauce? Connected to the mob,
*  and they were connected to the mob.
*  You don't think they fucked with some numbers?
*  You don't think there was some corruption?
*  Who has the fucking money?
*  I think there's an assumption, too,
*  that both sides are gonna try to do it.
*  I mean, that was a watergate, right?
*  The results of this election, man,
*  it's gonna be interesting to see,
*  can Biden work with two parties, both parties?
*  I hope so.
*  I hope they prove the polarization
*  of people that are opposed to Trump being in office,
*  and now that they're not Republicans and Democrats,
*  I hope they work together.
*  Yeah, man.
*  That's what I hope.
*  That's what I hope.
*  I hope they work together.
*  Do it fast so Biden doesn't get a lot of time.
*  You gotta get used to President Kamala.
*  That's what you gotta get used to.
*  I said it, man.
*  She's gonna be the first president.
*  I said it.
*  That's the position.
*  I don't see how he can do eight years,
*  so what if the economy's going strong and four?
*  I think four, he's gonna keep it moving, man.
*  Who knows, man?
*  It's the setup.
*  I said it on stage, I said,
*  get ready for your first female black president,
*  because this is the setup for her.
*  She certainly could win.
*  They grooming it.
*  She certainly could take over, too, if he dies,
*  or if he can't medically continue anymore,
*  but here's another thing you gotta think of.
*  They're doing shit to people.
*  They're doing some wild shit in terms of medicine
*  and regenerative medicine and stem cells,
*  and they just hook him up to stem cells every day,
*  shoot him up with NAD and vitamin feeds
*  and steroids and growth hormone.
*  You never know.
*  They might keep that motherfucker around for a long time.
*  How Joseph Kennedy made his fortune.
*  Hint, it was bootlegging!
*  No, this wasn't bootlegging.
*  Oh, it wasn't.
*  Oh, I can't see the end because of the white shirt.
*  According to this biographer,
*  that is a rumor that started in the 60s and 70s
*  when they're trying to figure out who killed JFK,
*  and maybe it was the mob.
*  Who shot me, too.
*  Because they were in that business.
*  That sounds like the Kennedy family's
*  trying to cover up their dirty tracks.
*  It's a rumor.
*  The fuck outta here.
*  Nobody has, is there a rumor about you bootlegging ever?
*  No, I was looking, I've heard that, too,
*  but like, right away since he was in the stock market.
*  Well, maybe.
*  Maybe bootlegging, too.
*  Let's try another source.
*  Let's see,
*  Joseph Kennedy was a bootleggers.
*  Type that in.
*  Well, that story's gonna come out here,
*  The Daily Beast, the myth of Joe Kennedy's bootlegging.
*  So it is a myth.
*  I don't know where I would find the correct story to, you know.
*  I know, right?
*  Like, how do you know who's telling the truth,
*  and whether or not it's a big old historical cover-up?
*  Like, if you were bootlegging,
*  how much information would there be
*  about you being a bootleggers,
*  unless you got arrested for it?
*  For me?
*  I think cops were probably in on bootlegging back then,
*  don't you think?
*  Everybody that could make money was involved with it.
*  Sure.
*  Everybody, where's my piece?
*  Where's my piece? Why wouldn't you?
*  They probably were angry that the bars were closed, too.
*  And then they wanted a couple bottles.
*  Give me a couple bottles, couple hundred dollars,
*  so you can do whatever you wanna do.
*  Do you imagine if that's how we live right now,
*  if booze was illegal?
*  Imagine as much as people drink,
*  if you had to do it all secret.
*  You had to, like, have a big dude by the door,
*  you had to have a password to get in,
*  you're always worried about getting raided by the cops,
*  just so you could have a drink.
*  But people would do it.
*  They did it.
*  They did it for years.
*  They made organized crime.
*  That's where, like, Al Capone made all of his money.
*  Of a, well.
*  Yeah, that's the argument that's going on right now
*  with the Mexican cartels.
*  Like, the reason why they're able to make so much money
*  is because all that stuff's illegal.
*  And they're consuming it in the United States.
*  So you're playing a stupid game.
*  You're pretending people aren't taking it when they are.
*  You're making it illegal,
*  because you said they shouldn't do it.
*  But you wanna control it at the end of the day.
*  Meanwhile, you're just empowering organized crime.
*  And that's what they did with organized crime in Chicago.
*  That's what they did with organized crime
*  in a lot of areas of this country,
*  where they had booze-
*  And that's why they probably wanna position people
*  that they had influence over to be politicians.
*  For sure, they had so much money.
*  And back then, there was no internet.
*  Nobody knew what was in your bank account or where it came.
*  Bro, shut that ding off.
*  Jesus Christ. No, I was checking.
*  I didn't know.
*  Hold on a second.
*  Sorry, man.
*  Dude, put that shit on airplane mode.
*  What are you doing?
*  Do you know how to shut off the ding, though?
*  Come on, man.
*  Stop disrespecting me, man.
*  But you've done it a few times.
*  I don't understand why it keeps dinging.
*  It won't ding again, man.
*  All right.
*  I'm sorry, man.
*  What?
*  Oh, Don-El.
*  Don-El.
*  See, you can't say shit now.
*  You don't even know how to non-ding your phone.
*  I'll return this bitch.
*  Just shut the fucking ringer off, man.
*  I did, it was still dinging.
*  No, you gotta flip it up towards you.
*  You're keeping it down, which is-
*  It's off, man.
*  Okay.
*  It's gonna ding again.
*  I'm sorry, man.
*  It's gonna ding from beyond the grave.
*  That fucking Maggie is down here,
*  knock the fuck out.
*  She's adorable, man.
*  Man.
*  What are you just talking about?
*  I don't know.
*  Do you remember, Jamie?
*  Oh, Kennedy's being a bootlegger.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Maybe not.
*  I might be full of shit.
*  We didn't know you-
*  For sure.
*  We found out about it in the story,
*  but it was like, there was just a rumor
*  and I don't know how it started.
*  Right.
*  For sure, there's a lot of organized crime money
*  and fucking bootlegging.
*  That's a fact.
*  I'm on antibiotics because I got shot.
*  Yeah, you can't drink for how long?
*  Like three more days, son.
*  Refreshing, though.
*  Give your body a little bit of a break.
*  It is.
*  You miss it.
*  You're looking forward to my days from now.
*  No, I'm not missing it.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like after a show, a little shot.
*  Right.
*  But I just got this for all the people
*  that's been in the streets and got shot.
*  Gotta get better.
*  Are you nervous for the country right now?
*  Are you nervous about the future?
*  No.
*  Not at all?
*  No.
*  I believe that we always gonna find solutions to stuff.
*  Like the first thing, like you mentioned
*  about people that need to work or whatever,
*  the first thing that's gonna happen
*  is there's gonna be some type of stimulus package approved.
*  Motherfuckers gonna feel somewhat security
*  or a little better if they have some money
*  to be able to do something.
*  But this is just something that,
*  this is just something that we're gonna get past.
*  It's just a matter of time.
*  And with the vaccine being on board,
*  with them having more ways to test somebody
*  in a faster manner that don't cost as much,
*  I think it's gonna change people's attitude,
*  the way they feel about certain things
*  and things that start turning around.
*  I hope you're right.
*  My concern really is about how hard it's gonna be
*  to turn around the economy
*  with that many people out of work.
*  That's what my worry is.
*  So many people are gonna be broke
*  and so many people are gonna lose their houses
*  and so many people are gonna get evicted.
*  I just don't know how they stop that
*  and turn that around when all these jobs are gone
*  because all these businesses went under.
*  That's what scares me.
*  It's like that this wasn't anticipated.
*  I think there would have been another way to do it.
*  They certainly didn't lock down as much out here.
*  Not nearly as much.
*  And then that's a good point because I mean,
*  whatever you worked for,
*  whatever just could be pulled from under you,
*  just like that.
*  That's the thing about like,
*  you can't say that the people that are upset today
*  are soy boys.
*  They can't say that they're all pussies
*  because there's a lot of people that are upset
*  through no fault of their own.
*  They lost everything, right?
*  You could be the most disciplined guy in the world.
*  You get up early every day, you work hard all day,
*  you build a business and then all of a sudden,
*  COVID comes around and you find out your margins
*  are a lot smaller than you thought.
*  Nobody expected it to go eight, nine months, right?
*  So you're not making any money for eight, nine months
*  and you can't reopen?
*  There's a lot of businesses like that.
*  There's a lot of bars.
*  There's a lot of bailouts.
*  There's a lot of bailouts.
*  There's not enough bailouts.
*  There's so many businesses.
*  There's not enough.
*  And they're not gonna give it to all,
*  they're not gonna give you all you lost.
*  You're gonna lose a tremendous amount no matter what.
*  Boy, there was a lot of people getting that money
*  that was bullshit, boy.
*  There was so much goddamn fucking scandal with them.
*  PBA loans and shit, man.
*  Everybody was grabbing them bitches.
*  They'll find money, then you gotta pay it back.
*  I hope we figure out a way to make this economy bounce back.
*  But I say we, when I say we,
*  I mean people way smarter than me.
*  I hope somebody figures it out.
*  I hope my son had the best life he can have.
*  Yeah, well I hope so too.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I think that you're gonna just start,
*  people gonna be concerned about people that are close to them
*  and their family and how that situation is going.
*  Yeah, I mean everybody hopes that the next person
*  that gets an office is gonna nail it.
*  Everybody hopes the next person that gets an office
*  is gonna fix all our problems.
*  We gotta change the way we communicate with each other.
*  That's a big one.
*  Everybody's locked in this trap of us versus them,
*  of red versus blue, of whatever the trap is.
*  Whatever your particular trap is.
*  There's men versus women traps.
*  People get crazy with being tribal
*  and being on a fucking team.
*  We're supposed to be one team.
*  Supposed to be United States of America.
*  If we differ on small things like immigration
*  or things like financial issues
*  or how to use taxes.
*  The most important thing is that we all want
*  what's best for the country.
*  We all want the country to do well.
*  You wanna thank people.
*  That's how you want people to feel.
*  That's what drove me the most crazy
*  about Trump being president.
*  I felt like it was the first time I could ever remember
*  where people wanted things to be bad
*  so that he would be a bad president.
*  I guess they probably did with Obama too.
*  They wanted things to go bad
*  so they could blame it on him.
*  They would rather have something to blame on him
*  than to have everything go well.
*  If you asked a hardcore Trump hater,
*  would you rather, this would be a good question,
*  would you rather the economy become the greatest economy
*  the world has ever known and you'd be totally wrong?
*  Trump, even though he's a pussy grabber
*  and he's full of shit and he brags about himself,
*  became literally the best person to make the decisions
*  that were the best for the country?
*  Or would you rather the economy fall to the toilet
*  and Trump goes to jail?
*  Like, Trump goes to jail!
*  Yeah, yeah, there's no bar here.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  He would immediately, there would be no hesitation.
*  Put him in jail, fuck him, everything's fine.
*  Everything's fine.
*  That sounds like a relationship.
*  Whatever makes you happy, you like, fuck that,
*  I don't want him to be happy.
*  Well, they definitely didn't want him to do well,
*  which is weird.
*  Like, they wanted him to get arrested
*  and then the economy to bounce back.
*  That's what they wanted.
*  But another thing they wanted too, Joe,
*  they wanted to feel like you cared about them.
*  They wanted to feel like you cared about something
*  or somebody else other than your fan base.
*  That was a big part of it, man.
*  People didn't, I don't think people were just looking
*  for reasons to hate on him.
*  And I know some people that liked him.
*  Some people love it, some people love to know nonsense,
*  fuck it.
*  People love a guy who came along and said,
*  fuck you, to politically correct shit too.
*  There's a lot that people liked about him.
*  People liked the idea that he got fucked over
*  in this election too.
*  They liked the idea that the deep state was involved
*  and that people were rigging voting machines
*  and miscounting votes and people loved those stories.
*  I do not know if those stories are true.
*  I don't give a fuck about those stories.
*  They're a bummer though.
*  It's a bummer that there's those stories.
*  This would be the ideal scenario.
*  Whoever won, won.
*  If it's Biden and Kamala, they win and then that's it.
*  They transfer power, shake of hands.
*  People do what they've always done
*  with Obama did with Trump.
*  They don't wanna do that, son.
*  They don't wanna do that.
*  That's so corny.
*  You don't wanna shake a motherfucker's hand.
*  You don't wanna give him the secrets.
*  You don't give up the keys.
*  He's gotta do it.
*  You don't wanna give up the cars.
*  But he's gotta do it, especially if he wants to run again.
*  See, if Trump wants to do it again,
*  he can run one more time in 2024.
*  But the only way he's gonna be able to do that,
*  he's gotta be able to sit down and shake Biden's hand
*  and say, I'll see you in four years, bitch.
*  It's gotta be, you can't just keep saying
*  that the voting is 100% rigged
*  and I won this election by a lot.
*  And all that's fucking dangerous
*  because it's just dangerous for our confidence.
*  It's dangerous.
*  You got people talking about rise up.
*  It's gonna be something, something's gonna happen.
*  Dude, don't say that.
*  Here's the thing.
*  You gotta show the evidence first.
*  You gotta show the evidence first.
*  There has to be like,
*  you have to compile all that evidence.
*  If there really is that evidence,
*  you gotta compile it all and present it
*  in a very solid way.
*  You're trying, this got shut down.
*  Yeah.
*  It's not, I mean, it's above our pay grade.
*  Do you even understand national politics on that scale?
*  But I think that as a country,
*  I think you and I both know that this country's,
*  this is like, it's never been in a position
*  where you don't know what the hell's gonna happen.
*  You never know.
*  Like with, you never know.
*  There's so much turmoil and weirdness
*  and you never know,
*  is there gonna be another wave of this pandemic?
*  Are they gonna shut everything down again?
*  Whatever it is. What happens then?
*  Whatever happens then, we go with
*  what has become our new norm.
*  We go back to that.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like things are about to shift
*  by the spring or the summer.
*  Things are gonna be in a totally different place
*  in regard to how people feel about being in public.
*  Again, they're gonna have this,
*  they're gonna come up with some
*  super rapid testing situation.
*  I hope so.
*  That's gonna make the fucking essential workers,
*  people in the medical field, feel more comfortable.
*  They're gonna make other people feel comfortable.
*  And eventually like people are gonna make decisions.
*  Am I gonna fuck with this vaccine
*  or what am I gonna do to live?
*  I hope the vaccine and that the election
*  gets resolved quickly.
*  It is resolved.
*  Jamie, if you had a guess, if you had a,
*  no, I know, but I mean, let them,
*  let Trump say it's resolved.
*  If you had a guess, what percentage
*  of election fraud do you think there was?
*  Take a guess.
*  It's not zero, right?
*  Probably not zero, but it's like one, 2%,
*  like the normal poll.
*  I think it's really 1%.
*  1% poll.
*  I know that's a lot, but I mean,
*  there's 150 million votes.
*  I don't think it's one.
*  I guess that's a lot.
*  I don't think it's one.
*  But I think it's,
*  I think there's a sum less than zero number,
*  or some more than zero number rather,
*  that is voter fraud.
*  Any reasonable person.
*  It's a point, one of the points.
*  Yeah, it's not, and who knows which way it goes?
*  Because I bet there's voter fraud the other way too.
*  We're not hearing about that because Biden won.
*  But if Biden was like Trump and he lost that race,
*  who knows?
*  They might try to figure out a way
*  that the Republicans cheated.
*  I don't know, man.
*  Yo, I'm gonna tell you,
*  this shit has turned into comedy, son.
*  What's turned into comedy?
*  This whole just not quitting, just saying.
*  It's kind of crazy.
*  No, it's-
*  No, it's not even crazy.
*  It's entertaining.
*  It's entertaining.
*  I know it's unfortunate for entertainment,
*  but it's entertaining.
*  I get that it's entertaining, but it makes me nervous.
*  It makes me nervous when you start thinking
*  that there's people out there that think that,
*  that there's been a coup, right?
*  Or that Trump is attempting a coup.
*  There's like two different schools of thought.
*  One school of thought is the deep state
*  took over the election and they rigged it.
*  And the other school of thought is,
*  this guy is trying to win even though he lost,
*  and he's trying to figure out a way
*  to sue his way back into the White House,
*  and this is crazy.
*  So this-
*  But he's-
*  Yeah, so there's a, that's the problem is that there's not a-
*  He's gonna win on one end
*  because he's got the power of the people.
*  Like again, those, him losing, the support that he has,
*  he knows that there's a community,
*  they're gonna be fucking still on his dick right now
*  because he can shake some shit up.
*  So fuck him, fuck all of them.
*  Am I ever gonna get some elk?
*  Do you ever need elk today?
*  I have it at my house, yeah.
*  You can't cook it though, right?
*  I can cook it.
*  We'll have to figure out how much time we have
*  between now and the show.
*  Yo, you can bring some elk to the show, son?
*  Not enough for everybody.
*  No, just a sample?
*  Yeah, why don't you just come over to my house?
*  I'll cook for you.
*  What time do we have?
*  I don't know, we'll figure it out when we get out of here.
*  Let's figure it out off the air though.
*  But my two lesbian friends are supposed to meet me, son.
*  They're not like, no Menage Trois lesbians,
*  they're just like regular lesbians, they're my friends.
*  Okay, that's cool.
*  Yeah.
*  Who do they think won?
*  Biden.
*  What?
*  Hell, man, what?
*  I said my two lesbian friends.
*  Were they adopted?
*  Mexican son, Eli, who I fucking love.
*  You don't think there's lesbians for Trump?
*  I bet there's a whole website.
*  You know what, I never thought about that.
*  I don't think there's too many lesbians for Trump.
*  I bet there's a few.
*  I bet they get together and like, yeah, you know,
*  people are into things.
*  I don't know, I don't think that.
*  That's the stuff I never thought about.
*  Lesbians for Trump.
*  Some people are really into anime.
*  There's a t-shirt for it.
*  There it goes, lesbian for Trump.
*  Oh no, fuck.
*  Oh.
*  It's funny, but you would assume that if someone's a lesbian,
*  that's what I was kind of getting at,
*  that you would instantly know who they're voting for, right?
*  I mean, I know that's kind of profiling,
*  but I was definitely like short haircut.
*  You know, short haircut, fucking man,
*  cut out suit with the tie.
*  Right, like how many girls with blue hair or pink hair
*  voted for Trump?
*  Is it less than zero?
*  That's a good stat.
*  Yeah.
*  Trump pride gay Republicans
*  on why they're backing the president.
*  Probably five.
*  Because they get to dress up again.
*  Have a good time, it's a cool outfit.
*  It's such a weird time, man.
*  Such a weird time.
*  But-
*  You know, you just get on the river, bruh.
*  I get it.
*  I'm ready to just do some nature.
*  Do you think you're gonna move there?
*  Would you move there?
*  I think so.
*  It's a good place to be.
*  I think the community, I mean, it's just like,
*  there's such a community, man, this summer.
*  And it was just so simple.
*  Would you get rid of your place in LA
*  and just settle down there?
*  Yeah, I could do that.
*  I could do it.
*  Better for travel, really.
*  If you wanted to go left or right,
*  you're more closer to the middle.
*  Nature's just better for everything, man.
*  I just wanna be around some trees.
*  I think that's one good thing about people
*  that can escape from LA.
*  There's a lot of people that are escaping
*  from New York as well, and they're moving to the suburbs.
*  And they're liking it better.
*  They're more relaxed.
*  They get some space.
*  People are like, instead of being in the chaos,
*  I can drive to the chaos.
*  You know, it's like, fuck the people from-
*  Or not even drive now.
*  A lot of people are working from home.
*  Do you don't think it's gonna change?
*  I think there's gonna be a lot of companies
*  that realize, like, hey, I don't need this gigantic space
*  to handle all these people.
*  I can let people work from home.
*  They're more productive.
*  Because a lot of times, people in offices,
*  they get together, they talk, they have fun.
*  There's a lot of work.
*  The break room, the green-
*  Oh, man, I used to fucking be in the fucking break room.
*  I never was doing work.
*  Always in the break room.
*  I've seen dudes in cubicles doing this shit,
*  where the cubicle's here, and they're both on the outside.
*  They're just having a conversation.
*  They're nowhere near their computer.
*  People do that all the time.
*  If no one's watching, people do that all the time.
*  In some jobs.
*  Yo, they scootin' back-
*  Don't get personal.
*  If it's you, you work hard.
*  Scooting back from the cubicle, that's hilarious.
*  There's a lot of dudes that are working
*  all over the place that would be more productive
*  if they just had a certain amount of work to do,
*  and they could just get it done at home.
*  You know?
*  But sometimes, they wanna patrol.
*  I think it's a good idea.
*  There's a lot of people that have jobs
*  you have to be there, right?
*  Auto mechanic, a lot of people.
*  Fill in the blank, carpenter.
*  A lot of people have jobs you gotta be there.
*  But there's certain jobs, like why do you need-
*  Yeah, why do you need to sit through an hour
*  and 15 minutes of traffic
*  when you can just do it through Zoom?
*  And you sit here in a pair of shorts and a t-shirt
*  and get all your fuckin' work done.
*  Like, why do you need to go somewhere?
*  You don't.
*  With computers today, you don't have to go anywhere.
*  You don't have to go anywhere.
*  They just wanna control the movements of it.
*  They just want to...
*  It makes sense, and I think it's gonna go to that.
*  Everybody's like, I'm working from home,
*  I'm working from home, and they're getting the job done.
*  Everything is different.
*  A lot of people are gonna be able to stay home.
*  And so I think that's just gonna change
*  the nature of cities in general.
*  Less people are gonna have to commute to them.
*  But that's one probably good thing about this,
*  is that people are gonna not have to commute as much
*  so maybe the roads won't be as jammed up.
*  If that saves people so much fuckin' stress.
*  If you're a dude who works in Orange County
*  and you live in LA and you gotta make that drive
*  every morning, you ever see that fuckin' drive?
*  That drive's insane.
*  I've come from that drive.
*  I've been going the other way of that drive.
*  When you go Orange County to LA at 7 a.m.,
*  you wanna just fuckin' end it.
*  You're just like, I can't do this every day.
*  But you can do it for a minute,
*  cause that's the route that I have.
*  My county's out in Orange County,
*  and I did that trip a couple times,
*  and I kinda enjoyed being up in the morning with it.
*  Cause I didn't have to do it all the time.
*  Cause you don't have to do it every day.
*  If you had a job, and you had to be at your job
*  at 8.30 in the morning every day,
*  and you live in Orange County, you gotta go to LA,
*  you gotta leave your house before seven.
*  You gotta accept the fact that every morning
*  there's a likelihood, a high likelihood
*  it's gonna take you an hour and a half plus.
*  Or you can go on Zoom.
*  Or you can go on Zoom.
*  I want on Zoom.
*  Yeah, and you can wake up, instead of waking up at six,
*  you wake up at eight.
*  You wake up at eight, have a cup of coffee,
*  sit down, turn on your fuckin' computer.
*  I get up early now, so I got Maggie.
*  I understand, Maggie is outside.
*  Yeah, I gotta get up early.
*  I'm not like, the old Donnell is gone, Joe.
*  I get it.
*  Like, she's down there curled up.
*  I'm just happy that there's alternatives for some people
*  where they at least can work.
*  If they can't be in an office,
*  at least they can do some stuff on Zoom.
*  But for other people, man, that's what I'm worried about.
*  What I'm worried about is everything restarting.
*  Like, how long does that take?
*  Man, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe.
*  Donnell, Donnell, Donnell.
*  I know you worried about it and you have concerns,
*  and everybody worried about it have concerns.
*  But eventually it's like this,
*  yo, what the fuck are you gonna do?
*  You gotta figure it out.
*  People gonna have to figure it out.
*  Yeah, man, it's like, I understand.
*  You keep saying, yeah, man, then I feel sorry for them.
*  Sorry, eventually you're gonna have to figure it the fuck out.
*  Eventually, nobody's gonna be able to help you.
*  Nobody's gonna be able to vouch for you.
*  And you gotta do it your fuckin' self.
*  David Goggins said it, man,
*  it goes back to that same point, man.
*  They're looking for answers.
*  You are the answer.
*  You got two excuses, a good one and a bad one.
*  At the end of the day, it's the same fuckin' excuse.
*  I've said it before, and I know people are like,
*  well, it's easy for you to say.
*  It's not easy for anybody to say.
*  Whatever's gonna happen moving forward,
*  it's not easy for anybody to say.
*  Everybody's gonna have their opinion of it.
*  Everybody's gonna be on the opinion of,
*  well, give him a chance.
*  Maybe he can bring the world back together.
*  It's gonna be a lot of Trump motherfuckers like,
*  yo, fuck you, asshole.
*  There's been no supporter that's been angrier
*  than a Trump supporter, to the extent that there's sore
*  winners and sore losers.
*  You gotta pick a sore.
*  You can't just take both sores.
*  You see, the thing is, they think they got robbed.
*  That's why his tweets are dangerous.
*  And even if you do, Joe, even if you do,
*  have you feel, this department's fucked up.
*  Is this mine?
*  Have some.
*  This the part that's fucked up.
*  I've been sitting here for a while.
*  Probably not hot anymore.
*  What was I saying, son?
*  This is the part that's fucked up about being sore winners
*  and sore losers, you gotta pick a sore.
*  You gotta pick a sore, and everything is not gonna
*  always go your way, but you don't have to be upset about it.
*  See, the thing is, though, what he's saying to them
*  is it was a robbery, so he thinks it's a robbery.
*  It's starting shit, man.
*  It's definitely starting shit.
*  You got it, that's it right there.
*  Yo, why all your shit gotta be extra strong, man?
*  This is too big for a fuckin' teapot.
*  It's coffee.
*  Coffee pot, damn, son.
*  It just keeps the coffee warm after you're done.
*  I feel like I'm on a yard.
*  Everything is like a workout.
*  What's that?
*  Does he wanna come in?
*  Who out there?
*  Dave's out there.
*  Tell that nigga to come in, son!
*  Yeah, tell him to come on in.
*  Do we have a camera for him?
*  Did he take his test results?
*  Maybe that's when he was waiting on that one.
*  But he gets tested every day, doesn't he?
*  Maggie just jumped up.
*  Have you ever seen a baby dog, little tiny little dog?
*  I've never seen a tiny little dog.
*  I had one, I used to have one.
*  Wasn't quite that small, but it was pretty small.
*  I've seen little dogs,
*  I've just never seen one in the baby form.
*  David!
*  What's happening, bro?
*  What's up, how are you?
*  What's happening?
*  I haven't seen you.
*  I love the dicks.
*  Oh no!
*  What's up?
*  You wanna sit right here, son?
*  What's up?
*  Oh no, get in here!
*  What's up, how are you?
*  Don't step on the puppy.
*  I'm gonna beat you too.
*  What's she smoking on?
*  Oh shit, I show up, this joint right here.
*  Come on in here.
*  The whole circus is in town.
*  I don't know how many microphones we have, unfortunately.
*  You have a joint?
*  Do you have a joint?
*  Yeah, it smells really good.
*  I was smoking this since really...
*  Marijuana's semi-legal here.
*  How is this with marijuana?
*  I'm a semi-criminal, let me get some.
*  My guy.
*  Is there a...
*  Is there any coffee?
*  Yeah, this is coffee.
*  What's up, man, what are you doing?
*  Oh, bro.
*  Living the dream.
*  Good to see you.
*  How's Austin been treating you?
*  Great, we did two nights at Stubbs.
*  Stubbs Barbecue, the guy from the barbecue sauce.
*  So he has a stage?
*  It's an outdoor...
*  You never been there?
*  It's an outdoor venue.
*  Joe, you will love this place.
*  I thought you said you was there,
*  no, they said you was somewhere else.
*  I went to the Vulcan Gas Company,
*  that's the only place I've been in town.
*  Michelle is doing that.
*  Oh, that's great.
*  That's the gig she's got coming up.
*  Yeah, because Cap City's gone,
*  so people are doing shows anywhere they can.
*  Are you gonna buy a club here?
*  Yes.
*  You got to.
*  Yes.
*  I'll be the first gig.
*  All right, you heard it here, folks.
*  Who's gonna be?
*  I felt like I have to.
*  As soon as Cap City went under,
*  I was like, oh shit, oh now I have to.
*  But I don't know what's gonna happen
*  after Biden gets into office,
*  whether there's gonna be another lockdown,
*  like a national lockdown for a while.
*  So I'll wait until after that blows over.
*  Yeah, just keep moving forward.
*  That's all I...
*  You know what I mean?
*  Everything that I've seen you do,
*  moving here to Austin, it's gangsters, correct.
*  Thanks, man.
*  We find a way.
*  Yeah, we find a way.
*  We're just talking about that.
*  People find a way.
*  I was saying, what are people gonna do
*  with restarting the economy
*  and trying to get a job when all these businesses went under?
*  How does everything go brrr?
*  And Don, I was just saying, we do what we have to do.
*  We figure it out.
*  That's true.
*  I'm far from an economist,
*  but I will say that planning for your future
*  is a good thing.
*  It's a necessary thing.
*  Even though it's uncertain,
*  you have to remember the sun does rise every morning.
*  Yeah.
*  Just keep moving.
*  And people that are in this shit right now
*  never thought that it was gonna happen.
*  Now that they know that this is a possibility,
*  now we have to plan for the future.
*  Yeah, I've never seen this before.
*  Never.
*  You've never seen something as large
*  as the American economy stop and then start back up.
*  But it's a global phenomenon.
*  It's not like it's just happening to us.
*  We're just handling it terribly.
*  I like how you handle it, though.
*  I like doing those shows that you did in Yellow Springs.
*  It's a great idea.
*  It was wonderful.
*  Doing it in that chapel, that whole area outside.
*  It's amazing.
*  Yeah, it's a pavilion all outdoors.
*  I talked to my doctor, my family practitioner,
*  and he told me you should play outdoors.
*  If you're playing indoors, use UV air filters.
*  There's specs of a building that might be safer.
*  Many buildings now today are not outfitted this way.
*  You hope for the best.
*  You take every necessary precaution,
*  reasonable precaution, but it's a pandemic.
*  There's no guarantees.
*  Are you getting any people giving you shit
*  about doing shows?
*  No.
*  No?
*  Nothing?
*  No, I mean, even if I did, you know what I mean?
*  Who cares?
*  And that's it.
*  There's nothing you can do about it.
*  No matter what, you know, read about Jesus.
*  Seemed to be a really good guy.
*  They killed him.
*  That's just the nature of people.
*  Donnell, this dog is hilarious.
*  Man, this dog is an angel.
*  This dog makes everybody feel good, man.
*  She's so cute.
*  I've never seen a little dog as a baby.
*  I've only seen them as full grown little dogs.
*  But she likes this, this is gonna be her size right here.
*  That's how she's gonna stay?
*  Yeah, she's gonna stay like this
*  with a little bit more bark and more.
*  Now, how is it traveling with her?
*  Is it, you like it more?
*  Easy, son.
*  Or the company, I mean?
*  It's dope.
*  Like, I'm like, when I got her, I was like this,
*  oh, she's an emotional dog, right?
*  But now that I got her, I'm like this,
*  yeah, I'm an emotional human.
*  And like, yo, let me tell you something, son.
*  Sometimes I'll be up at 5.30,
*  and she'll be up, her ears will be up,
*  looking like, what we doing, nigga?
*  And I'm like, at least somebody understands me, right?
*  It increases the amount of love you have, right?
*  Because you have this dog.
*  And she follows me everywhere.
*  When I was at the show the other night,
*  I was on stage and they said she was shaking and barking
*  when she heard my voice.
*  Yeah, it's crazy, she was.
*  She was like, ah, ah, ah, where you at, motherfucker?
*  Oh, she loves you.
*  Yeah, it's a different world, man.
*  You got a little dog that counts on you like that.
*  Those are different kinds of dogs, too.
*  They're so little, they have to be held.
*  You have to carry them most of the time.
*  Is she scared or cold?
*  Like, why is she shaking?
*  She might be a little combination of both, son.
*  Maybe she needs a drink.
*  Maybe she has to piss.
*  Nah, son.
*  She's cold, how is she keeping it together?
*  Don't talk about her like that, she good, son.
*  She probably just need a little warmth.
*  Do you have dogs?
*  Yeah, I have one dog.
*  You probably have a huge wolf kind of dog.
*  No, I have a golden retriever.
*  I have the sweetest dog in the world.
*  He's the nicest dog ever.
*  That dog looks perfect.
*  He's so nice.
*  That dog looks like he has a great life.
*  He's just a love sponge.
*  Like, that dog is just all about love.
*  All he wants to do is kiss you and let you pet him.
*  Who spends the most time with your dog?
*  Me, probably.
*  Yeah, yeah, I can see that.
*  I spend a lot of time with him.
*  We have a morning ritual.
*  What's the ritual?
*  I just get up in the morning as soon as I see him.
*  Good morning, sir!
*  Good morning, sir!
*  He starts freaking out.
*  Woo, woo, woo!
*  And he go for a walk?
*  Wags his tail.
*  Go for a walk?
*  Well, yeah, he does that,
*  but he loves chasing balls more than anything.
*  He's a great dog.
*  He likes swimming.
*  I like chasing balls.
*  I did, I did.
*  Thank you, sir.
*  There you go.
*  Nah, he's a sweet dog.
*  You got a dog?
*  Three of them.
*  What kind?
*  Australian Shepherd.
*  And one kind of like this.
*  What do they call it?
*  A Chowini, I think they call it.
*  It's half Chihuahua, half one of those hot dogs.
*  That's the one, Baa Baa.
*  Remember the one in my special, Baa Baa?
*  That's him.
*  A Chowini.
*  You have this and half a dog.
*  And then my daughter has a little dog like this.
*  Not a Chihuahua.
*  I can't remember what kind of dog she is.
*  My daughter has a Chihuahua mix.
*  It's like a Chihuahua with like,
*  I think he's got some Whippet or something in him.
*  So it's a Chihuahua with long legs.
*  He's adorable.
*  You know, I wanted my kids to train animals
*  when they were little.
*  That's one of these things I should have followed through on.
*  But the reason I did it is because I wanted to learn
*  how to be patient with people.
*  And I figured if they trained a dog or something,
*  it takes patience.
*  Look at this dog, it's adorable,
*  but she don't know nothing yet.
*  Yeah, she don't know shit, sir.
*  She knows snacks.
*  The real problem is when you get dogs
*  that need a lot of training,
*  like if you want to have a German Shepherd
*  or a working dog, like a Belgian Malinois,
*  a lot of people get those dogs.
*  You don't realize, like, you basically got
*  like a little genius with teeth that lives with you
*  that wants to figure out problems.
*  You know those like, have you heard of those celebrity,
*  like the German Shepherd's, the guard dogs,
*  the real ones with that 200 commands.
*  Yeah, Schutzen training.
*  Yeah, that's what they do.
*  Yeah, I've seen guys do that.
*  Some comedian got one of those dogs,
*  spent like 200 grand on it, and it died in like a week.
*  Those are crazy, if you can have a dog like that,
*  that's a commitment, man.
*  Like those dogs need work.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  The ones that got bark jumps.
*  Those dogs are so smart.
*  They're from a long history of working dogs.
*  Those are task-oriented dogs.
*  This dog's from a long history of something being cold.
*  Isn't she adorable?
*  Come on, man.
*  She is.
*  Come here.
*  She doesn't want to be held back, bro.
*  Have you ever taken your dog hunting?
*  No.
*  You can't do that, right?
*  No, not my dog.
*  It's too dangerous for a dog.
*  Well, you wouldn't want him to be in the woods,
*  first of all, because you'd probably scare off the animals,
*  but second of all, he has like the instincts
*  to chase squirrels and shit.
*  He chases squirrels, but he's like a, he's a lover.
*  He's not, there's no aggression in him.
*  Like with other dogs, like he's always the beta.
*  He's always, he tries to be the alpha,
*  but they bark at him.
*  He's like, sorry, sorry.
*  The Australian Shepherd's like that.
*  Well, she's like the dog you described that needs work.
*  Like you can tell she's a herder.
*  She corrals kids, she corrals me.
*  Isn't that interesting?
*  Yeah.
*  They have it in their DNA.
*  I've seen that.
*  They really do.
*  And the dog is really smart.
*  I never trained this dog, but you would think I had.
*  I just talked to it.
*  And you could see her face trying to figure out
*  what I'm talking about.
*  It's really cool.
*  Where'd that end go?
*  They do think, I think he's doing something with the dog.
*  Put it out there.
*  He went out to beat his dog.
*  They do figure out words.
*  Like it's not just commands.
*  Like my dog knows, you hungry man?
*  You wanna eat?
*  Like he knows. Oh wow.
*  He knows when I say, you hungry?
*  What do you wanna do dude?
*  You wanna throw the ball?
*  He's like, let's throw the fucking ball.
*  That's dope.
*  We'll go over by where the ball is.
*  You gotta go outside,
*  and he'll just start walking towards the door.
*  Like he knows a few phrases.
*  Cause I definitely trained him.
*  Like sit and all that shit.
*  But sometimes you're just smarter than other dogs.
*  He's a really smart dog.
*  Yeah man.
*  Does he like Austin?
*  Do you like Austin?
*  I love it.
*  I love it here.
*  What do you do?
*  Have you like-
*  Oh, Donnell!
*  Down with the count.
*  Oh man, I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry man.
*  I'm sorry man.
*  Hey, that's actually, you did a great job.
*  You actually put it back perfect.
*  That's perfect.
*  I was dead in frame.
*  I'm sorry man.
*  Don't worry about it man.
*  That's the best recovery I've ever seen
*  from one of these stupid things.
*  These aren't ideal.
*  These cameras mounted on the wall.
*  I like the setup a lot man.
*  Thank you.
*  It feels homey.
*  You actually just tricked me into doing a podcast.
*  Sorry.
*  No, I'm going to come and do it like for real, for real.
*  For real, for real.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, as a matter of fact,
*  I should come after the inauguration.
*  Okay, let's do it.
*  I'll come after the inauguration.
*  That sounds great.
*  Nobody believe I got shot son.
*  Yo Dave, I don't know what's going on man,
*  but everywhere I go.
*  Don't eat on the air.
*  Why, I can't eat over here?
*  You going to crunch on the air?
*  Where?
*  You're crunching in the microphone.
*  You're eating.
*  Come on man.
*  That's disgusting.
*  Yo son, he said that he was going to bring enough help
*  for me and you.
*  I would totally do that.
*  Is it good?
*  Yes.
*  I tried to tell him about it.
*  Yeah, it's good.
*  So what do you do?
*  You make jerky?
*  You barbecue it?
*  I just put it on a grill.
*  I usually put it on a,
*  you know what a Traeger grill is?
*  No.
*  It's a pellet grill.
*  So it just has like little wood pellets
*  they make with sawdust.
*  I've seen those, yeah.
*  They compress the sawdust into these pellets,
*  pour it into the machine.
*  So it's basically just fire and wood,
*  so it's like keep it at a low temperature,
*  control it to like 265,
*  till it hits 120 degrees internal temperature.
*  Then I pull it and then I sear the outside,
*  one of two ways.
*  Either I do it in a cast iron frying pan
*  with beef tallow, which is rendered beef fat.
*  Oh wow.
*  Or I do it, I have a grill,
*  I could do it outside on another kind of grill.
*  Usually I like to do it in the cast iron frying pan.
*  You heard it here first.
*  Joe Rogan doesn't just like killing animals.
*  He likes cooking them too.
*  Yo, because Dave, and then he always has a perfect,
*  he got this perfect little chopping block he put him on.
*  I like it.
*  And he always throw the jalapenos on his side, right?
*  And it's just, so you see this perfectly seared meat
*  and then the knife is like a Japanese some extra shit.
*  Then you see a little blood,
*  it did a little jalapenos,
*  and he's showing off, son.
*  Do you cook at all, Dave?
*  Not anything like you guys.
*  Donel can't cook.
*  That's all I hear.
*  I couldn't believe it.
*  He challenged me.
*  I thought he was joking.
*  He's like, I'm gonna cook for all these people.
*  I literally thought he was joking.
*  I said, he can't cook.
*  He's like, what?
*  Like he was offended.
*  So he makes me take him to a grocery store.
*  This is in Ohio.
*  And I was laughing the whole time until he started shopping.
*  He goes to the lady, do you have clam juice?
*  I said, I was like, clam juice.
*  He started asking for all these fucking ingredients,
*  killed it, cooked for like 20 of my friends in Ohio,
*  and then went and did a show.
*  It was amazing.
*  And then I made him apologize to him.
*  He was like, you did a good job.
*  I was like, no, motherfucker.
*  You gotta do it on stage.
*  You said you was gonna promise us on stage.
*  Fuck that shit.
*  I'm saying it on the podcast.
*  It was amazing.
*  No, I made him say it.
*  I was like, he was like, yeah, Donel.
*  I was like, nah, nigga, what the fuck did you say?
*  How did you learn to cook?
*  Just watching my mother cook, just watching cooking shows.
*  But I do remember when I was younger,
*  my mother was a part of Publishers' Clarin House.
*  And I think they had like one promotion
*  where you get a Betty Crocker's recipe book
*  and it had all these recipe cards.
*  And it just sent it to you.
*  And it's like meats.
*  And then you see all these recipes.
*  And I used to look at the recipe.
*  I was like, man, we ain't got shit to make none of this with.
*  We had the recipe, we didn't have the ingredients.
*  So I just started reading those recipe cards.
*  When I got older, I was like,
*  I should start just fucking with this shit I couldn't cook.
*  And then I just started fucking around
*  and just started having fun with cooking.
*  Do you go off recipes now or do you have it in your head?
*  I go off of it 100%.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  It's like, you know, with cooking,
*  it's like a technique, an art of cooking.
*  Like an art of cooking.
*  If you know how to cook, you can cook whatever.
*  It just all depends on what spices or whatever.
*  But if you know how to cook, you know how to cook.
*  What's a specialty?
*  I don't really have a specialty.
*  Really?
*  I don't have a specialty.
*  I'll follow a recipe, somebody will do something.
*  I'll get inspired by something.
*  But I do know I make these garlic noodles, right?
*  It's not a specialty, but it's a whopper.
*  It's like a wet ass pussy dish.
*  It's a wet ass pussy dish, son.
*  It's nowhere around it.
*  They love the garlic noodles
*  and I make a dope ass garlic.
*  You can put whatever protein you want on it,
*  but the garlic noodles are fucking crazy.
*  In fact, you made those at night.
*  I did?
*  I was impressed.
*  I had, yeah, I had a part.
*  I love this thing you said, the metaphor.
*  We had the recipes, just not the ingredients.
*  That's a good metaphor for a lot of things in life.
*  We had the recipes, but none of the ingredients.
*  We didn't have it.
*  Well, that's a bar.
*  You should write that down.
*  Yeah.
*  Will I remember it, but this is the truth.
*  Someone will tell you.
*  It's true.
*  Just watch the podcast tomorrow.
*  It's true.
*  Yeah, everyone wants equal access to the ingredients.
*  That's right.
*  I had the recipe.
*  Real equality, right?
*  But none of the ingredients.
*  The difference.
*  That's part of a metaphor.
*  That really is the difference.
*  That's a great way to, that's a great metaphor.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  Yeah, for life.
*  That's what I was telling y'all niggas, man.
*  It's right there.
*  Yo, he been not listening to my story the whole show, Dave.
*  He doesn't believe you.
*  Anytime I mention I got shot.
*  I believed him the first time.
*  I believed him the second time.
*  I believed him every time.
*  You know Pierre Edwards?
*  Yes.
*  Great comedian.
*  I saw a video today.
*  It was on some guy's Instagram.
*  He's a comedian.
*  It was me introducing him at a comedy club
*  when I was like 17.
*  Wow.
*  Someone just sent it to me.
*  I had to believe it.
*  Pierre from DC?
*  Which one?
*  Yeah, Pierre from DC.
*  He used to do the funniest joke about getting shot.
*  I'm not gonna do another guy's joke.
*  But you know, he got shot in DC like one night.
*  Oh yeah, I remember that.
*  Yeah, he's funny too.
*  I got shot.
*  Nobody fucking believe me, man.
*  We believe you.
*  Yo, are you gonna bring some elk?
*  I told y'all I'll cook something.
*  I'm ready.
*  I'm ready, man.
*  I wanna see what they say in the streets.
*  What's all this fuss is about?
*  I want some elk, son.
*  Yo, everywhere I go, motherfuckers say did you try the elk?
*  That's all I know.
*  What is it?
*  Is it gamey?
*  No, it's not gamey.
*  It's not like, there's a weird taste
*  that people associate with like venison, a gamey taste.
*  And for the most part,
*  it's either hasn't been prepared correctly
*  or it wasn't taken care of correctly after the animal died.
*  Like that's for the most part with the gamey.
*  It's a different flavor.
*  But I think what people associate with
*  with not tasting good, like,
*  I think a lot of that, a lot of it, not all of it,
*  but a lot of it isn't just personal taste,
*  it's bad preparation.
*  I agree.
*  You get a steak from a grocery store,
*  you're assuming that professional butchers,
*  people that grow the cows, professional butchers,
*  all down the line, they get you a steak.
*  If you got a guy's deer meat,
*  who knows how this guy took care of that fucking deer.
*  He could have had that shit hanging in a tree.
*  You don't see no marbleization in that bitch nowhere.
*  No marbleization in there nowhere.
*  Sometimes people shoot them
*  and they don't get them into the morning.
*  See, this is what I'm talking about, Dave.
*  Look what the fuck I'm talking about, Dave.
*  Oh, wow.
*  No, wait a minute, that's a show on board.
*  Wait, you cooked it?
*  Exactly.
*  That was good.
*  Dave, this is go-to picture.
*  You're not gonna shame me.
*  You're not gonna shame me, John F.
*  I'm not gonna shame you.
*  This is a good elk day right here, son.
*  It is a good elk day.
*  Look, wait, what does the captain say?
*  Why she mention something about a jalapeno somewhere?
*  This is the final product.
*  Oh, shit.
*  It's pretty, right?
*  But what's that, a dry rub?
*  What rub is that?
*  That's Saskatchewan, blackened Saskatchewan.
*  It's a Traeger rub.
*  It's like a Cajun style almost.
*  Oh.
*  But it's got, it's like a blackened,
*  but not like, it's like a lot of salt to it.
*  You killed that motherfucker.
*  It's delicious.
*  It's the perfect rub.
*  I love that rub for elk.
*  So wait, when you cook it, you cut it up yourself?
*  You know how to cut steaks out of a.
*  Yes, that's the whole purpose.
*  I do, but that part is easy
*  because that part is what's called the backstrap.
*  That's the big, thick piece of meat
*  that's on each side of the spine.
*  Look at the knife, though.
*  Is that a Japanese?
*  No, that's an American knife.
*  Who made that knife?
*  What does it say in the caption?
*  Doesn't, there's no tag or nothing?
*  The dude who made it was shit.
*  Dave, you wouldn't eat that.
*  See if you can find that.
*  You wouldn't eat that thing.
*  It's in there somewhere, same knife, real close to it.
*  So if you're killing elk,
*  how long are you eating that elk?
*  You can eat it for a whole year.
*  Literally a year.
*  Yeah, they're huge.
*  Yeah, same knife here.
*  I got it, there it is.
*  The guy gave me the knife.
*  There it is, let's see.
*  Neanderthal, oh, Chumney Knives.
*  C-H-U-M-N-E-Y Knives.
*  That knife look right, son.
*  That knife look right.
*  It's a dope knife.
*  Yeah, you'd eat it for all year.
*  It's hundreds of pounds of meat.
*  It's like 400 pounds of meat.
*  They're huge.
*  They're huge.
*  So okay, say you're shooting elk.
*  You're bow hunting, I'm imagining.
*  Yeah.
*  What happens, it runs off,
*  you gotta follow it for like a day or two?
*  Like how does it go?
*  If you hit them right, they die pretty quick.
*  Ow!
*  Okay.
*  Damn!
*  He do it with a bow though, son.
*  Yeah, but you have to practice a lot, man.
*  This nigga do it with a bow.
*  It's not easy.
*  But the point is, I know exactly
*  where that meat's coming from.
*  I know the whole chain of command.
*  I know everything that's happened
*  from the time that animal got hit
*  until the time I'm cooking it.
*  That's interesting.
*  You know, cause yeah, this is mind blowing.
*  I get all my meats from strangers.
*  Yeah, most people do.
*  Yeah, you don't think about it.
*  I was in Alaska once and a lady told me
*  that she hadn't eaten something,
*  she hadn't killed herself in years.
*  This woman looked like a Betty Crocker model,
*  like a house model.
*  She was working in an ammunition store.
*  I had never been to a gun store before.
*  It was ridiculous.
*  This is in Fairbanks, Alaska.
*  There was so many, like think of a kind of gun.
*  The guy goes, this is a sniper rifle.
*  You can shoot a bear with this from two miles away.
*  Couldn't imagine why I would shoot a bear
*  that was two miles away.
*  I couldn't, that was the weirdest sales pitch.
*  I literally said that to him.
*  Yeah, that's like a thousand yards, right?
*  Isn't that, isn't two miles?
*  Two miles, way farther.
*  How many thousand miles is a mile?
*  Or how thousand, oh, 5,000 feet is a mile.
*  Right, it's not yards.
*  Yeah, that's crazy.
*  They can shoot things at a thousand yards.
*  Snipers have hit shots at a thousand yards.
*  Just think of that number.
*  It was a crazy thing to just be able to sell to somebody.
*  I'm not gonna get into all that gun stuff.
*  A mile is 5,000 feet, and then a thousand yards a bullet.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's so far.
*  That's really far.
*  That's a long squint.
*  They could, 10,000 feet for them is nothing.
*  That's the scope, though.
*  That has to be a scope.
*  Well, again, this was Alaska, so you gotta think,
*  things like guns there are more utilitarian
*  than New York or something.
*  People do need, you don't want a Tully out there, I think.
*  Yeah, everybody has guns up there.
*  Well, they also have bears and fucking moose and shit.
*  Yeah, it's crazy up there.
*  It looks unfinished.
*  It's beautiful.
*  It's a wild place.
*  It's one of the last real,
*  the people that live up there are a different kind of human.
*  They're more, they have, they're more durable.
*  They're not soybean eaters.
*  They have all these Alaska-isms.
*  That's it, they don't remember soybeans.
*  They call leaving Alaska going outside.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, it's like a cult.
*  They say the lower 48, we all heard that before.
*  They'll call the rest of the continental US lower 48.
*  Tons of them.
*  But it was fun up there, man.
*  I had a good time.
*  They're nice people.
*  I've only done shows up there once.
*  I did shows in Anchorage with Ari.
*  We had a good fucking time.
*  They were good people, but they're sturdy.
*  They're like, you can tell they survive winter.
*  They deal with shit that people don't have to deal with.
*  The male to female ratio.
*  Male to female ratio.
*  Guys outnumber women in Alaska, I think 10 to one.
*  10 to one.
*  It's not many women.
*  Awesome, motherfuckers are sexy as shit out there, bitch.
*  10 to one, well yeah, that's what you would think.
*  You'd think, oh, if you're a woman, oh, this is great.
*  10 guys, you got 10 dusty, dirt under the fingernail choices.
*  These guys are rugged.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  These guys are rugged, you know what I mean?
*  Yeah, stick to the jobs you have in Alaska.
*  I was the only dude in the nail shop in Fairbanks, Alaska.
*  Everybody else's nails and hands look like shit.
*  Yo, you was killing it, son.
*  I've been mining all day.
*  I met a guy who's a gold miner.
*  Weird jobs like that.
*  That's how it was when I was in the Air Force
*  when I was stationed in Kunsan, Korea.
*  It was like 10 guys to every girl.
*  And whoever she was, she was America's next top model.
*  She had the attitude, like she was like,
*  every one of them chicks was like, motherfucker,
*  you gotta compete.
*  That's why niggas was going downtown.
*  It's definitely an unhealthy balance.
*  You know Darnell speaks Korean, like conversation.
*  That's fluently, but just casual.
*  But no, I didn't know that.
*  We were in New York when we were shooting Chapelle Show.
*  We walk into a deli.
*  Yeah.
*  And two Korean guys sitting talking to each other.
*  Darnell turns up, you know how he talks.
*  He starts going, stop doing the thing.
*  And I thought he was fucking with him.
*  I'm like, oh, come on, man, don't do that.
*  I'm so sorry, sir.
*  And the guy, the guy looked shocked.
*  And then the guy started talking back
*  and they talked to each other for a couple seconds.
*  And I'm like, I was floored, staring at him.
*  I couldn't believe it.
*  And he goes, oh, they thought,
*  he said, they thought we were stealing, son.
*  And I told him that we wasn't stealing.
*  I think he called him like a dog eating motherfucker
*  in his own language.
*  Yeah.
*  And he was, he loved it.
*  He said it, you promised me you'd call him
*  a dog eating motherfucker.
*  Yeah, K-sick, yeah, I will, all right son.
*  Don't muck it up.
*  He was saying something about you
*  while you were standing there
*  and he didn't know that you could speak Korean.
*  Yeah, but we were engaged in the conversation.
*  Me and the guy was engaged in conversation.
*  Dave thought I was mocking him.
*  Dave thought I was mocking him,
*  but I was really having a conversation with him.
*  So Dave didn't know.
*  He thought I was like fucking with him.
*  Like, yo, you can't talk like that.
*  And then I was rocking with him.
*  I was like, oh shit.
*  These guys were floored.
*  I was floored.
*  They're like, when they see a black guy
*  going to one of those stores
*  that speak any level of Korean, they fucking lose it.
*  How often does that happen?
*  Well, clearly this means, one could surmise,
*  that when you were in the Air Force,
*  you spent a lot of time off base.
*  I did.
*  You would just be in town and just hanging out.
*  I would just go, when we had days off,
*  I would go to these little small cities
*  or whatever they lived.
*  They never experienced Americans, let alone a black guy.
*  And I would catch boats and shit over there
*  and just hang out with them.
*  And that's how they got accustomed to me
*  and I got accustomed to them.
*  Can you read it?
*  No, I couldn't read it.
*  Back in the day, I could spell my name.
*  But it was just like, I was with trustworthy people.
*  We all worked together and it was just like,
*  what can I do, man?
*  Let's go see what your culture is about.
*  That's cool that you learned that.
*  That's a rare thing.
*  That's probably a difficult language to pick up to.
*  The sounds are so different.
*  Well, to me, I think it's a testament
*  that you're a people person.
*  Which goes back to the original point we all made.
*  You find a way.
*  If you wanna hang out and talk to people
*  and nobody speaks your language,
*  I don't speak that language.
*  But you find a way.
*  Yeah, you will.
*  So did you learn from books?
*  Did you take classes?
*  Did you learn from talking to people?
*  It was just shared, we're at the main gate,
*  we worked at main gate.
*  You would have 12 hours, 16 hour days.
*  So you would have one American on one side
*  and two Koreans on the other side.
*  You could just stare at each other all day
*  or you could just start doing word association.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's point net stuff.
*  Oh, wow.
*  What did you just say?
*  They say, yo, Airman, I'm main gate.
*  Airman Rollins man, I help you.
*  That was the greeting
*  That's what they would say.
*  But I would switch it to me.
*  They used to be like, oh.
*  And they would say, yo, I'm telling you, son.
*  They used to get amped.
*  When I get a joint right, they'd be like, oh.
*  Lawless, why, why, why?
*  They was like, Lawless, don't answer the phone,
*  because I sound like them.
*  And then they would say something else.
*  I didn't know.
*  I was like, yeah, yeah.
*  They'd be like, oh.
*  Because your accent was perfect.
*  I would do the same.
*  Like, when I started learning Spanish,
*  I went to Ecuador once for like six weeks.
*  I just started picking up Spanish.
*  I had a driver that I just met the guy, hired him.
*  Said, you drive a car.
*  He spoke like a little bit of English.
*  And I spoke less Spanish, but we did the same thing.
*  By the end of it, by the end of six weeks,
*  my man, I could speak Spanish.
*  But I would mimic the accent of whoever taught me the word.
*  If I learned the word from an Argentinian,
*  I'd say like an Argentinian says it.
*  That's why when I do Korean or whatever,
*  when I do it even when I do it in my act,
*  when it's broken Korean, people know that's an adichie.
*  He got the tone of an older person, a respected person.
*  It's adichie.
*  Yeah, like they know like a real Korean
*  could tell who I was around to give me my accent
*  or however I did it.
*  So I have a friend named Japanese Naki.
*  I know Japanese Naki.
*  Yeah, she is from Tokyo.
*  And for some reason when she was in high school,
*  moved to Alabama, she learned English
*  from Alabama people.
*  Whoa.
*  And which created one of the more hilarious accents
*  I've ever heard in my life.
*  Oh my God, hell yeah, she got a,
*  I just like where she got a country,
*  she got a country accent.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, she's the best.
*  And she likes lemon pepper chicken wings too.
*  It's that kind of stuff.
*  In other languages, there's all these weird tones
*  that change the meaning of words.
*  It changes the meaning, especially.
*  Like in Korean in particular, right?
*  In Korean in particular, because you can tell
*  the way people use their voice when they talk to people,
*  older people always talk down to people.
*  It don't matter what you did,
*  it don't matter what it is for you to celebrate,
*  it's always like, ah, it wasn't enough.
*  Do you know that those problems in communication
*  is why Korean Air only teaches pilots in English?
*  They only learn and communicate in English.
*  They're not allowed to communicate in Korean.
*  How do you know that?
*  How do you know that?
*  They recognized that there was an issue with the superior
*  and dealing with a superior, like if you were my captain
*  and I was your, I couldn't say certain things to you,
*  the fucking plane's gonna crash.
*  Oh wow.
*  I can't simply say, you're doing it the wrong way.
*  You can't say it, but in English you can.
*  So they taught them to communicate in English
*  because it changes the way, or they only use English,
*  because it changes the way you communicate with people.
*  You don't have that cultural classification
*  of a superior, of an older person who demands respect.
*  I get it, and that's the one thing people don't understand
*  about, especially Korean culture,
*  is the level of respect that they have.
*  People think it's like, oh, they don't fuck with me
*  because I'm black, no.
*  The level of respect they have,
*  they give a fuck about being older.
*  That's money, that's prestige, that's everything.
*  You being older in Korean culture was money.
*  You know, I was around Koreans a lot when I was a teenager.
*  I like this cultural nuance.
*  Korea's a fascinating culture.
*  Yeah, and they don't have that.
*  What they don't have?
*  Hard workers.
*  What they don't have is like,
*  like Korean dads don't really have connection
*  with their kids like that.
*  They don't have like the ultimate emotional,
*  oh, you did a good job shit.
*  That's not even their job.
*  They're very hard on their kids.
*  That's it.
*  In general.
*  I had a good friend of mine who was a doctor.
*  He was going through his residency
*  while he was on the national Taekwondo team.
*  And the dude would literally be in school
*  and he would take breaks to put his backpack on.
*  He's filled the backpack up with books
*  and run up staircases and go all the way back down
*  and then go back to going to the library to finish his work.
*  And then he would find a way to go to the gym every day
*  and he won the national championship
*  and he was this Korean kid.
*  I've never met a person who worked harder in my life.
*  To this day, I think about that dude.
*  He was always tired.
*  I go, how you doing, man?
*  He goes, I'm always tired.
*  That motherfucker every day would be in that gym.
*  Every day.
*  Jungsik Chang, that was his name.
*  Is he still alive?
*  I don't know.
*  I haven't talked to him in a long time.
*  He was Jungsik Chang.
*  He was a guy that was like,
*  he was probably like the star student of our team
*  during my, when I was competing
*  because he was this guy that was not just
*  a national champion but also a guy who did it
*  while he was in his fucking medical residency.
*  Like the amount of work that he was capable of doing
*  was insane.
*  And he was like the way Koreans are,
*  the way he would describe it to me,
*  he was like nothing's ever enough.
*  No matter what I do, it's never perfect.
*  No one's here to praise me.
*  I gotta keep working harder.
*  Sounds like a fun guy.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  The younger and the Korean military.
*  When you were, when somebody was outranked or whatever,
*  they used to do this thing called education
*  where they could just talk to a little Korean motherfucker
*  any kind of way they want.
*  And they used to have this little greeting they used to do
*  and then you just see the other, the young Korean,
*  just like.
*  Like they could do whatever they wanted to this motherfucker.
*  He could not do nothing but just show them respect.
*  Yeah, you have to take it.
*  They used to, it wasn't no rules.
*  Like if you do this, they would fucking beat
*  them motherfuckers up or whatever and they came back.
*  But there's one thing I like that you described.
*  The reverence for older people.
*  I feel like here in America, we just discard people.
*  Yeah, really quick.
*  Yeah, it's not wise.
*  We should get more than half price at the movies.
*  That's a certain point.
*  Yeah, come on, that's the least they could do.
*  Wow, we've forgotten that it's important to have people
*  that are older than you that figure life out
*  a little bit better than you have to help lead the way.
*  We forgot that in this country.
*  When these guys were running for president,
*  the way they kept going in on Joe Biden for being old,
*  you know, whatever, it's whatever.
*  So come on, man.
*  Well, Trump's old too.
*  That's what I mean.
*  I like when Trump calls the elderly the elderly
*  as if that somehow doesn't apply to him.
*  Yo, that's how I am.
*  Yo, Dave, I did a show once, right?
*  And I was so caught up in myself.
*  I was like, look at all these old head motherfuckers
*  that I went to high school with, right?
*  I was like, old ass motherfuckers that are their same age.
*  I forgot the connection altogether.
*  That's real.
*  That's real, sir.
*  Every once in a while.
*  I'm old, but they are older than me.
*  And they're the same age.
*  Yeah, they're the exact same age.
*  They don't talk this shit.
*  Yeah, all my friends around my age.
*  You don't feel it.
*  Yeah, they're more like, they kept like,
*  you know what I mean, they dressed the part.
*  That's why it's very important for older people
*  to actually have their shit together.
*  Because when older people actually have their shit together,
*  maybe people will resume the idea of respecting older people.
*  Like maybe it'll become more of a trend in the future.
*  But when older people are that old,
*  and they're still crazy,
*  when that's the problem with a guy like Trump,
*  that old and still, I won this, and big.
*  Like all the craziness.
*  The girl used to bang, call her horse face on Twitter,
*  like that kind of craziness.
*  Yeah, that kind of craziness is like...
*  But you come to expect it of him, though,
*  and it became very entertaining, man.
*  He made it all entertaining,
*  but then it was involving people's lives.
*  But it's like clothes.
*  You know how you'll see an old person dressed up,
*  and you know that maybe like 30 years ago,
*  that outfit was the shit.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah.
*  But maybe he's not killing it today.
*  And it's like you can see him put it on one time,
*  and just be like, this is it, go on without me.
*  Fashion keep going.
*  Isn't it funny how fashion eventually comes back around,
*  and then you got dudes dressing up
*  like they're old timey photographers?
*  Like the vest and stuff.
*  When I grew up this summer, for me,
*  I just grew up with it, I don't even give a fuck.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I'm like, I remember this summer, son,
*  I was starting to buy shit that had waterproof on it.
*  Reversible.
*  I was like, fuck that fucking city boy shit.
*  I was buying shit that was fitting for the condition
*  and the weather that I was in.
*  Right, clothes become utilitarian.
*  Yeah, I was like, to what?
*  Whether you get out of a city.
*  You got to wear some work clothes.
*  To work, it's cold.
*  To work, that's right.
*  Everything's practical.
*  Alaskans understand that shit.
*  Boy, do they.
*  They get it.
*  It'd be a hard place to go.
*  If I had to go buy some clothes for a date in Alaska,
*  that's a tough one.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, you have nothing to lose.
*  I hope you like waiters, bitch.
*  You got a few days a year where it's not cold outside.
*  And those days, it's like 24 hours.
*  But those people are conditioned for it now.
*  That's where it's weird when it's 24 hours, son.
*  Well, that was part of it.
*  They had all these signs up.
*  Because this was like in November.
*  It was like Game of Thrones, winter is coming.
*  And there were these signs that said,
*  get your happy lights.
*  Have you heard of this?
*  No.
*  It's like UV lights that people put in their house
*  to mimic sunshine, just so that they don't get depressed.
*  I couldn't imagine.
*  It's like they're homegrown, man.
*  It's like all, that's crazy.
*  Do you remember that there's a vampire movie
*  a few years back called 30 Days of Night?
*  I don't remember.
*  It's all about vampires that show up in Alaska
*  because there's 30 days where it never gets light out.
*  Oh, that's a good premise.
*  So these vampires just fuck this town up for 30 days
*  because they know when.
*  So they bring this vampire familiar
*  that pulls the boat into the Anchorage shore
*  or whatever the fuck they landed.
*  And they get out in this small town
*  and just wreck havoc on this town for 30 days.
*  Robin Williams and Al Pacino did a movie the opposite of that.
*  It's called Nostomnia.
*  You ever seen that?
*  I didn't see that, I don't think.
*  It was a weird character thing.
*  Pacino's character is a cop.
*  Robin Williams is a guy he's looking for,
*  for a heinous crime, right?
*  The backdrop of the movie was that it was daylight
*  for 24 hours a day and the guy had terrible insomnia.
*  That's a rough way to live when it never gets dark out.
*  I remember doing it when I was in Anchorage.
*  I did shows up there with Orange Fear and we went fishing.
*  And it was like two o'clock in the morning
*  and it was bright outside.
*  I was like, this is weird, man.
*  I would love that.
*  It's weird.
*  Fishing at two, I would love it too.
*  Fishing at two o'clock?
*  Oh yeah, you can just keep going.
*  There's parts where it gets dark like barely
*  for like an hour. Did you fly fish?
*  You fly fish?
*  No, we were trolling for salmon.
*  How do you troll for salmon?
*  You pull a boat, you got like a boat
*  and you cast some lures in
*  and you're really trying to get the salmon aggravated.
*  That's what they wanted.
*  They're not really hungry at that point.
*  They're trying to fuck.
*  So when they get your lure,
*  they're really pissed off at it more than anything.
*  Jesus Christ, people have thought of everything.
*  Who the fuck would think to aggravate a fish?
*  Aggravate salmon, yeah.
*  Somebody that needed that.
*  Yeah, there's certain salmon that only eat plankton.
*  They eat microscopic shit.
*  They don't really eat fish.
*  This is in a river you were doing.
*  Yeah, you pull lures by.
*  I think that's, is that Chinook or sockeye?
*  Well, I'm trying to figure out
*  which one doesn't really eat fish.
*  And the only time you catch them is when you piss them off.
*  I don't know nothing about my salmon.
*  Like sockeye, I don't know my salmon's
*  had different personalities or anything.
*  Well, some fish just eat fish, right?
*  And some fish just eat microscopic shit.
*  And there's one particular type of salmon
*  that only eats microscopic shit.
*  And the way you catch it is by getting it pissed.
*  And that's in Alaska.
*  They do that out of like Bristol Bay.
*  I think that's Chinook, is that correct?
*  I'm trying to find it.
*  Salmon migrate, right?
*  Yeah, they migrate.
*  So are they salt water or are they fresh water?
*  They're both.
*  They're both, that's what I thought.
*  Yeah, they move through, I forget what it's called,
*  but they go out to salt water
*  and they come back to spawn in fresh water.
*  And they have to do it in the same river.
*  So if you dam the river up, they're fucked and they die.
*  They don't know where to go.
*  And they never wind up reproducing.
*  Which one gone is the most money?
*  Like which one is the most?
*  Salmon's huge.
*  Well, out of all fish, it's like probably tuna.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, but they're running out of tuna, man.
*  They keep just jacking tuna.
*  Talk to those old tuna guys in Japan.
*  They're like, we used to see a lot of tuna.
*  Now you go to the tuna market,
*  it's a fraction of what it used to be.
*  This is not as much tuna left.
*  Yeah, people love sushi.
*  I know they do in Atlanta.
*  This was a lot of money.
*  What happened?
*  He's referring to it.
*  I know they love sushi in Atlanta, bro.
*  They had a big thing about sushi in Atlanta.
*  What happened about sushi in Atlanta?
*  Quick question before I go.
*  This is what, because this is coming up.
*  And the next time we meet,
*  I wanna ask you about what you think.
*  The vaccine, are you taking it?
*  I'll take it if it works.
*  If I feel that the doctors have all gotten their opinions
*  behind it and they think, you know what it is?
*  It's like an mRNA vaccine, this new vaccine.
*  It makes your body think that it doesn't introduce
*  actual COVID into your system and you fight it off.
*  It makes your body think that it's COVID
*  and your body builds the proper proteins to fight it off.
*  A guy explained it to us yesterday, Nicholas Christakis.
*  He's from Yale.
*  He's a soybean boy.
*  He thinks.
*  No, he doesn't, he's a good man.
*  He thinks that he's a great man
*  and I won't let you disparage him like that.
*  No, I'm not disparaging him.
*  He's like, he's a soybean, mother.
*  He's soybean.
*  He's a doctor.
*  Okay, a doctor soybean.
*  Anyway, he thinks the vaccine will be very effective.
*  And even if it doesn't keep you from getting it,
*  it'll prevent or hopefully prevent you
*  from getting a bad case of it.
*  I don't know, though.
*  So what would you need?
*  Would you need just the consensus
*  of a body of doctors you trust?
*  And people's experiences,
*  because people have already taken it.
*  So if people have taken it, what is the experience?
*  They say that they felt like shit for a few days.
*  That's it.
*  Now, is that true?
*  I mean, who are they?
*  A few days.
*  I haven't talked to them.
*  What's a few days and what do you mean by feel like shit?
*  Did you try running four days later
*  and you still felt terrible?
*  So wait, apparently they're distributing this vaccine
*  almost now, right?
*  I don't think it's totally ready,
*  but it very soon will be ready.
*  And if it's effective,
*  they're gonna encourage people to take it.
*  It makes people real nervous.
*  But then they say they're gonna have it for like doctors
*  and like essential people at the beginning of it.
*  First, yeah, first.
*  And then it's gonna probably people that are high risk,
*  like older folks.
*  Yeah, but the thing is,
*  it's gonna have people have a sense of like,
*  there is something that could be done now.
*  It's a sense of hope.
*  It's a sense of progress.
*  It's a sense of like,
*  it was at one time when we didn't even have a thought
*  of a vaccine.
*  Now we got competitors and shit.
*  So people to think different.
*  Listen, if it works, we should take it.
*  But I know how people get real nervous
*  about that kind of shit.
*  Black people don't fuck with vaccines.
*  I told you that, son.
*  How do you feel about it?
*  Dave, black people don't fuck with no vaccines, Dave.
*  Well, I mean, I feel like it's inconclusive
*  because your caveat was,
*  I'd take it if I felt safe about it.
*  But that's just the thing.
*  Don't you feel like that same way?
*  Well, of course.
*  So now, for the first time we're learning
*  how a drug, the process of a drug going through trials.
*  We're learning this literally as a nation.
*  We're all watching this thing take place.
*  And an accelerated version of it.
*  An accelerated version of it.
*  Because usually a vaccine takes multiple years to develop.
*  Yeah.
*  So this is really quick.
*  To be able to have something this quick
*  and turn it around and have it be effective.
*  It's like those movies where they find a cure
*  and you're like, oh, that's bullshit.
*  They're doing it.
*  Well.
*  Not a cure, but a vaccine.
*  It's a big deal.
*  The good thing is, if another one comes around,
*  they're gonna be more prepared
*  to do something like this quicker.
*  Right.
*  Like, I think people needed to really understand
*  that in our lifetime,
*  something can kill the world's economy
*  and kill hundreds of thousands of people here
*  and a million people worldwide.
*  I don't think everybody understood that.
*  I think we knew it,
*  but I don't think we really expected it.
*  Right.
*  The Obama administration had prepared
*  for precisely that eventuality.
*  But I mean us.
*  Of course, yeah.
*  We couldn't wrap our mind around it.
*  Even if they told you,
*  even if you watched Bill Gates' speech at Ted Talk in 2015,
*  you would never internalize it
*  and think there's a pandemic coming.
*  Now we know.
*  Nobody.
*  Now we know there is.
*  Now we're gonna wanna invest in the medical infrastructure
*  to make sure that they prepare better next time.
*  This is, hopefully people are gonna learn from this.
*  Oh yeah, 100%.
*  People know.
*  Glass half full.
*  Nothing is gonna be new.
*  There's nothing gonna be new about it.
*  No.
*  Well the debate is largely philosophical, right?
*  I mean, to this end,
*  there's two schools of thought.
*  One school of thought is,
*  it's just gonna be what it's gonna be,
*  and you gotta keep moving.
*  Like, why close anything?
*  And the other school of thought,
*  which I thought was, you know,
*  well this would be more than just a philosophy.
*  It was a science.
*  Right.
*  And some of the premise when they locked us up was,
*  we have to wait to catch up to our medical infrastructure.
*  So we don't overburden our medical infrastructure.
*  We gotta suppress the disease
*  till we can build up the infrastructure.
*  And they gave us an early estimate of two weeks.
*  This is how a comedian does.
*  When a comedian's doing a real long set,
*  he goes, one more thing before I go.
*  And then he does that four or five times
*  and he realizes, oh this guy's gonna do another hour.
*  Oh yeah, that's so fucking rude.
*  Yeah, but you know the truth,
*  that's what the pandemic, the quarantine felt like.
*  Two more weeks, three more weeks.
*  Maybe we'll open bars and, you know, that kind of shit.
*  But there's no way to control it
*  other than create it yourself, right?
*  What do you mean?
*  Like the whole vibe of the scene, right?
*  The vibe of which scene?
*  The pandemic.
*  You said, how do we get used to it?
*  What can we do about it?
*  Well, he's also saying, here's the thing.
*  We never signed up to let people tell us
*  that we can and can't take risks or go to work.
*  And by saying that, if you do it,
*  you're gonna kill other people.
*  That's what changed the game.
*  And so everybody has to figure out
*  how much of that they're willing to accept
*  and how much of that are they not
*  and whether or not they're willing to take a shot.
*  Take this vaccine without knowing the long-term effects
*  of it or worrying about the long-term effects of it.
*  And some people are naturally averse
*  to taking any kind of medication.
*  They don't wanna do it.
*  And other people are like, if you tell me it's good
*  and all the doctors agree and it'll help mankind,
*  I'll fucking do it.
*  That's how I feel.
*  Listen, polio, shit doesn't exist anymore.
*  Smallpox doesn't exist anymore,
*  at least not in the numbers that it used to.
*  Yeah, you got the old vaccine for that.
*  That's the old vaccine.
*  But that's because of vaccines.
*  The idea that vaccines have done bad things only
*  or that they're dangerous only, it's crazy.
*  Vaccines are the responsible
*  for the giant population of people.
*  It's not vaccines.
*  I think at the core of this is you just trust.
*  Detrust these sources.
*  And if people realize that they're at the mercy
*  of someone that they don't necessarily trust.
*  Right.
*  That's the rub.
*  Well, maybe that's the problem.
*  Don't touch your own face and don't go outside.
*  I'll tell you when to come out.
*  Because that love of a renowned liar.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Tough one.
*  That was a tough one.
*  Especially here, it goes something really,
*  touches something really sore
*  in the core of an American's identity.
*  Like you said, how can you tell me to do this?
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy, man.
*  This was a tough one here.
*  It's a weird one.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think it's just redefine what it is to be a person.
*  You know, like if all of a sudden you have other people
*  that got elected into a position of power.
*  That's all they did.
*  They won a popularity contest
*  and they're dictating whether things go this way
*  or that way.
*  And they don't necessarily have the right answer.
*  They just have their own answer.
*  And Dallas is doing it different than this town.
*  And you know, Washington state's doing it different
*  than Nevada.
*  Everyone's doing it different.
*  But everybody's trying to do it also.
*  Yeah.
*  Governors can tell you what you can and can't do.
*  It gets real weird.
*  And I get it.
*  They're trying to keep the hospital numbers down,
*  but you told us it was gonna be two weeks.
*  Like you guys said, two weeks.
*  And now here we are like nine months later
*  and everyone's just waiting only for a vaccine.
*  But I'm not speaking about, you know,
*  if it's right, if it's wrong,
*  not speaking about like that.
*  I'm just saying whatever it was, that was very difficult.
*  Yeah.
*  That was very difficult.
*  Very difficult.
*  I was fine, but not knowing when you can work,
*  not being able to move around,
*  not being able to see my mother.
*  You know, you would never thought.
*  If someone had told me 11 months ago,
*  even the night before, the last night we went on tour,
*  where we were, Milwaukee.
*  Yes, it was Pabst.
*  The last show, it was the last night between shows,
*  right, it's a two show night.
*  And the energy had changed.
*  It went from festive to like,
*  people look worried when I got off stage.
*  And Tom Hanks had had it,
*  the one NBA guy who would touch everything and had it.
*  And then the horn starts ringing,
*  they're gonna shut the country down.
*  I literally go, that's impossible.
*  They're gonna shut down the world?
*  That's impossible.
*  This is what I thought, my initial reaction.
*  But the energy changed.
*  Now I go out and do the second show and immediately,
*  and I wasn't even thinking about this shit earlier that night.
*  I come out on stage and everybody reach their hand,
*  hey, I thought about it.
*  And I start shaking people's hands.
*  Oh, worried.
*  But yeah, it was if, but the day before,
*  when I've even been concerned about it,
*  went into the green room for 40 minutes
*  and talked to people who've been glued to the television
*  and watching the news,
*  and then they scared the shit out of me.
*  My behavior changed almost instantly.
*  It was interesting.
*  I'm gonna get too heavy, I mean, I'm only hanging out.
*  No, man, I didn't know such thing.
*  It's not too heavy.
*  That's exactly how I felt about it too.
*  I remember I shook a dude's hand on a flight.
*  I was flying to Vegas for the fights.
*  It was like one of the last fights before they shut it down.
*  And some dude goes, I don't know, you wanna shake hands?
*  Like, I'll shake your hand.
*  We shook hands, he had a mask on already.
*  And I was like, wow, he was ready to go down.
*  I think this was the very beginning of March.
*  This was the first time I would have been tested
*  at any capacity was when I did your show that time.
*  Mm.
*  That was the first time I had an antibody test or anything.
*  I would have never expected that here we would be
*  deep into November and we're all still kind of locked down.
*  When this started, you lived in LA.
*  You had no plans to come here.
*  Yeah, you're in Texas.
*  Think about it, your whole life has changed.
*  What's interesting about this time,
*  which is another thing we should talk about
*  next time we come, is that in May,
*  it feels like we're rewriting our social contracts,
*  the whole thing.
*  And COVID is an accelerant on this process
*  that I could have never imagined.
*  Yeah.
*  They're locked inside, man.
*  People are stuck in a house with their choices.
*  Do you like your house?
*  Do you like who you're with?
*  Do you like these things you've accumulated?
*  I hope you like them, cause you're stuck with them.
*  I made great choices, I like my choices.
*  When I was faced with it like that, I was like, whew.
*  I had it much better than many people.
*  But imagine people doing that en masse.
*  It's pretty powerful.
*  It's a pretty powerful thought.
*  What does this do to a society?
*  This type of isolation and...
*  And almost forced reflection.
*  Yeah, which is not necessarily a bad thing.
*  Right.
*  And we've always talked about how life is a rat race, right?
*  People get stuck in this rat race.
*  It feels never ending.
*  It's not good that all these people lost their jobs.
*  It's not good that all these people
*  are gonna lose where they live.
*  Not at all.
*  But it might help some people recognize
*  that if you just keep going in this rat race,
*  it never ends.
*  You gotta figure out a way out.
*  And now is a better time to figure out a way out than ever.
*  Because you kinda have to.
*  You kinda have to, and society as it existed 10 months ago,
*  it's not the same place.
*  It's not the same.
*  What's the country that...
*  There's a country, maybe somewhere in the South Pacific
*  or something, that measures their success as a nation
*  with what they call their gross national happiness.
*  This is a totally different premise.
*  What country is that?
*  I can't remember.
*  Maybe you Google gross national happiness.
*  General figure.
*  Thanks, Fingers.
*  It says Bhutan.
*  There it is, Bhutan, there you go.
*  This is a real principle.
*  It's a philosophy that guides the government.
*  Think about this.
*  This is a philosophy that guides the government of Bhutan.
*  It includes an index which is used
*  to measure the collective happiness.
*  This is the metric that they use to define their success.
*  If they tried that in America, they'd turn it into an app
*  and it would fuck up everything.
*  Oh my God.
*  People would just be striving to win the points on the app.
*  It would make people insane.
*  They'd get addicted to trying to be a better person.
*  This is a vastly better metric.
*  I'm not a communist and all that shit,
*  but I think that I know too many people who are very wealthy
*  who have what I consider a poor quality of life.
*  Just because, like you say, the wealth is the point.
*  Yeah, they chased it.
*  They chased it.
*  They didn't have any friends.
*  Right, you're very wealthy, you're hunting,
*  you love your dog, your dog hangs out with you
*  like fucking Scooby Doo, your kids like you.
*  You're living an adventure of a life.
*  Now you're doing the same thing you were doing in LA
*  in a totally different city just because you're following
*  that knowing feeling I gotta be free, whatever it is.
*  There's a little bit of that and then there's also
*  I think you're better off living in a place with less people.
*  I think when you live to be, you live in a place with LA,
*  it's great in that there's a lot of resources,
*  there's a lot of shit happening, there's a lot of people.
*  But it's bad in that sometimes people,
*  it diminishes the value of people a little bit
*  when there's so many of them.
*  People stop thinking about people as being as valuable.
*  I don't even think that it's that.
*  For me, the thing that I always had a hard time with
*  was the point of the place was show business.
*  So when I was coming up in my career,
*  everything reminded me of the things I didn't have.
*  And nothing let me appreciate where I was.
*  And then now I love it, it's a winner circle.
*  I'm doing great.
*  So I can get in any restaurant,
*  got the kids, you know.
*  But I remember what it felt like being there.
*  It's like, that's why I don't live there.
*  No disrespect to LA, but it's like if I like a restaurant,
*  I don't move in and say I just come when I wanna eat.
*  I'm gonna live in the restaurant.
*  I think your idea of living in another place
*  gives you perspective.
*  There's no question.
*  It's the best way to have perspective.
*  If you're stuck in that showbiz world,
*  you know, that becomes your culture.
*  Your culture is like this tiny fraction
*  of the human beings in the world.
*  And so many people just start relating
*  only to people in that culture.
*  Like that, you can get real isolated that way.
*  Yeah, and for what we do for a living,
*  how is that conducive to anything
*  that we wanna achieve? No, it's so wise.
*  Artistically.
*  No, it's a very wise decision.
*  Like really wise.
*  Yeah, it is. That smells great.
*  I told you, son, that's the one, son.
*  That candle is the shit.
*  I'll do a commercial for it right now.
*  You can cut this out of the thing.
*  Hi, I'm Dave Chappelle, and this is a black ash candle.
*  Smells way better than it sounds.
*  Take it from me and Ashy Larry.
*  Black ash, bitch.
*  Cut.
*  One take.
*  Yeah. That was beautiful.
*  Give it to me, I light it.
*  Oh yeah, do that.
*  Get the scent going.
*  So when you're touring now, do you just pick a city
*  and say, oh, I'm gonna do Denver three nights in a row,
*  find me a venue?
*  Well, I don't know if I want this on a show,
*  but just between us, well, you could, I don't know.
*  I'm not trying to.
*  We don't have to put anything on the show.
*  But I wanna post up here for like a few weeks.
*  It's cold in Ohio.
*  I like playing outdoors.
*  I like this Stubbs place a lot.
*  Beautiful.
*  It's rocking.
*  So I cut, that's why I say we do damn thing.
*  I'm thinking around December, January.
*  Stay here for four or six weeks,
*  try to finish the act that I was, boy, I was close.
*  When we were supposed to do those shows and-
*  Man, that summer was gonna be fire, son.
*  Me and Joe Rogan went on sale with some tickets.
*  This Joe, we must have sold 36,000 tickets
*  in like 10 minutes.
*  It was insane.
*  We were so excited to do the show.
*  And like a week or two before,
*  the shutdown happened.
*  I was part of that shit, son.
*  It was gonna be nice.
*  The ones we did were fun too, though.
*  What was it, Tacoma?
*  Seattle.
*  I've never seen you have bed.
*  Remember we watched Once Upon a Time in Hollywood
*  and all that shit?
*  Yes!
*  It was so much fun, man.
*  At two o'clock in the morning.
*  The conversations.
*  Was that there?
*  We were there.
*  Yeah, you were there.
*  Yeah, you were there.
*  That was when we were in-
*  Utah?
*  No, that wasn't Utah.
*  No, it was Seattle.
*  Yeah, it was Tacoma.
*  Tacoma, the Seattle area.
*  Tacoma Dome, that's right.
*  That was fun, man.
*  That show was fire.
*  That was fun.
*  That was so much fun.
*  And the conversations we'd have in the green room.
*  Every tour has its own culture,
*  but the culture of this tour that we did together,
*  it was great.
*  Yeah, Ian Edwards, who was traveling with you.
*  He was always famine, man.
*  He was always tired from not getting the right proteins,
*  Ian.
*  Ian, no.
*  Yo, this nigga slept the whole joint, son.
*  But Ian and I, the first time I'd ever left the country,
*  I was like 18, I had my 19th birthday there in Scotland.
*  I did the Edinburgh Festival.
*  And Ian Edwards was on the festival doing a show.
*  And we'd be, you know, black dudes from the West,
*  like way West, man, we hit it off.
*  We would crack each other up and then bam,
*  I just see him on the road.
*  Made me feel 20 years younger.
*  And we all sat around the green room.
*  The lights are red, music's good.
*  Really good vibes, really good company.
*  It was a perfect mashup.
*  We did two cities.
*  You nail it with the red lights in your room.
*  It changes everything.
*  I'm gonna steal that from you.
*  Oh man, man, please be my guest.
*  Maybe I'll go with purple.
*  Just to mix it up.
*  It's all about the ambiance.
*  Because I used to just sit in a room with hard white lights
*  and the fruit plate that I didn't know
*  how long had been there.
*  And no music and you know, the early days,
*  no friends, you just sitting in there
*  with maybe a joke book.
*  Just waiting, just waiting all the time.
*  Just waiting, just waiting.
*  And at some point you realize, well, this has gotta be fun.
*  I can't just be sitting in these rooms
*  looking at these walls.
*  Who the fuck has to bring a book to work?
*  It was that.
*  It was that.
*  So I just started sexing it up.
*  Like, just having fun.
*  And then when you start getting big on the road,
*  you start bringing your friends out and all that shit.
*  Then it gets really fun.
*  And you become like a surrogate family.
*  The longer you stay out together, you know,
*  you learn each other's creature habits,
*  you find out shit about each other you don't know.
*  You see what-
*  Fuck about the shack, son.
*  You see what people are made of.
*  Man, we had so much fucking-
*  I love the road.
*  We had so much fucking fun.
*  Yeah, you would love that Ohio shit.
*  Daddy, you remember that night?
*  I wish I could have gone,
*  but that's when I was planning on coming here.
*  Remember that night that we-
*  I was not doing any stand-up.
*  I had my drone that night.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  We had my drone out.
*  I don't even know how to fly my own drone.
*  One of them, one of my friends was flying the drone.
*  And it was late at night.
*  It was like, yo, get the drone shots.
*  So we get the drone shots.
*  And then the drone went up in the air.
*  It's like about two o'clock in the morning
*  and we thought we lost the drone.
*  We didn't see no red lights, no blue lights.
*  It was just gone.
*  We was like, oh shit.
*  Nigga, we gotta go find a drone.
*  We like, we about to get out of here.
*  We thought we lost the drone.
*  The drone was supposed to be at the bed and breakfast.
*  How well can you control those things?
*  Like the people that know how to drive it,
*  they can control it where they can't see it
*  through like measurements and distance and everything.
*  We had-
*  These things are good though.
*  They had buttons on it.
*  They could track a person or an object
*  if you wanted to just follow a car, anything like that.
*  You remember in LA, the paparazzi started doing
*  all this crazy drone shit.
*  I'm sure they got you.
*  The drone guys.
*  We had the drone shot.
*  I was drinking coffee.
*  You hear the buzzing.
*  Yeah, you hear the shit.
*  And you know that there's a dude a block away or somewhere.
*  Isn't that weird?
*  Like they could kind of find you now with a drone.
*  Well, we did the drone shot from the place.
*  We thought we lost it.
*  We was going to go search.
*  I was like, get my motherfucking drone, nigga.
*  Right?
*  We get ready, get everybody in the car
*  to go find his drone.
*  We don't see that guy nowhere.
*  All of a sudden, it was like a movie.
*  We saw these blue lights come up
*  and we heard the zzz and that motherfucker came.
*  Everybody was like, oh shit, nigga, the drone.
*  And that shit came all the way back down, son.
*  It was beautiful. That was a good shot.
*  That was a great shot.
*  I met the governor of Texas.
*  I went to the mansion to hang out with him,
*  Governor Abbott, and I had whiskey and barbecue with him.
*  And while we're hanging out at his house,
*  a drone comes by and hovers in the sky.
*  That's the one.
*  The light goes on and we're watching this drone.
*  The security guys are trying to figure out
*  where the drone's coming from and who's got the drone.
*  And it turned out to be like the fire department.
*  Really?
*  The fire department has their own drone
*  and they're flying their drone around looking for stuff.
*  That makes a lot of sense, man.
*  But they're like, that's like how you can spot fires,
*  how they can figure out what's going on
*  if there's some sort of a car accident.
*  They could probably send a drone out,
*  get video image of it so they know what to expect
*  when they get there.
*  Makes sense, right?
*  There's a new car like that.
*  Some...
*  That's a drone?
*  The headlights are drones.
*  You gotta look this up, man.
*  What is with...
*  The headlights fly away?
*  What do you mean?
*  The headlights are attached to the car, right?
*  They're on.
*  If you get out of the car,
*  they pop off and start flying around
*  and make a path of light.
*  I think that's the thing.
*  Audi created an autonomous off-roader
*  that uses flying drones to illuminate the road
*  instead of headlights.
*  Show Joe the video.
*  What?
*  It's ill as fuck.
*  Oh my God, they're ahead of the car.
*  The fucking headlights are ahead of the car.
*  It's the illest shit I've ever seen.
*  That's some Star Wars shit, right?
*  Yeah, precision drones.
*  If you have the key in your pocket,
*  they'll follow you like if you're walking in the woods.
*  It's crazy.
*  That thing looks wild.
*  It looks like some shit Jamie Foxx drives already.
*  He already has one of those.
*  Yeah, Jamie Foxx probably has this.
*  Jamie Foxx probably already has this.
*  He has one of those Resvanis.
*  Isn't that what it's called?
*  It's like a Resvani tank.
*  I ran into him at the gas station.
*  I was like, who the fuck is driving that thing?
*  Jamie Foxx, what's up?
*  That thing looks awesome, though.
*  That Audi, that's a slick looking car, too.
*  That's crazy.
*  Somewhere online, there's a video demonstration.
*  It's probably gonna be electric, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Is it?
*  Yeah, everything's electric now.
*  Look at this, look at this shit!
*  It's that.
*  Darn it, look at this, look at this.
*  Look at this, watch when it's driving.
*  Oh shit, that's the headlights?
*  Yes, the headlights are ahead, making the road bright.
*  Yo, that's some gangster shit right there, son.
*  They're flying like little UFOs, that's nuts.
*  Could you imagine if you saw that drive by you somewhere?
*  Yeah, you'd be like, oh my God,
*  I think I saw an alien.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's gonna be the future, look at that shit.
*  They fly ahead of you and illuminate the road.
*  That's bananas, and you just have to trust them
*  with your little bitch ass lights.
*  You got some little bitch ass fog lights.
*  You have to trust the daddies that are flying around.
*  That's how the government's gonna control you.
*  Man, I wanna slice a pizza.
*  Keep you going on their road.
*  No, no, no, you don't wanna look at that road,
*  that road's dark.
*  The drones only go on this road, come on.
*  Son, where can I get pizza?
*  Probably a pizza place.
*  Find a guest.
*  Come on, man.
*  You started like this, man.
*  Why you doing this to me, man?
*  We'll find a pizza place for you.
*  What kind of pizza you want?
*  Thin crust, I could get a pizza pizza.
*  A pizza pizza?
*  A piece of pizza.
*  A piece of pizza, yeah.
*  Pizza, pizza.
*  I gotta get some more gauze too, man.
*  You all right?
*  Let's take five, you wanna get some?
*  Yeah, can we get some?
*  Yeah, we can just end this.
*  It's already 4.35.
*  I've been doing this forever.
*  Oh wow.
*  He and I have been doing this for four and a half hours.
*  I know, man, he been disrespecting my gunshot wound.
*  I didn't.
*  I told Jamie.
*  I didn't, right?
*  Never.
*  This is not true, none of this is true.
*  Teamwork is dream work.
*  Thanks Dave, that was fun.
*  Oh my God.
*  Next time we'll do it for real, for real, for real.
*  Yeah, for sure, 100%, I would love it.
*  Thank you, son.
*  Don-el, that was fun, thank you.
*  Thanks for the candle, thanks for the cream,
*  thanks for everything.
*  Black ass bitch!
*  Thanks for everything.
*  DonnerRoms.com.
