# Joe Rogan Experience #1475 - Bridget Phetasy
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 16, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LQFV0ct3X8)
*  Hey, I came to make a citizen's arrest.
*  Oh, congrats.
*  Touchy these days.
*  We're less than six feet apart, I believe.
*  I think we're okay.
*  Do we need to wear masks?
*  No, we don't.
*  Well, you don't.
*  You got tested and I've been tested too.
*  I got one little Rogan test.
*  I feel special.
*  You are special.
*  Did you see that the LA is there?
*  They have a number now where you could turn in businesses that aren't complying.
*  Like what is going on?
*  Why?
*  What is this?
*  Who's doing that?
*  But this is bad government.
*  Listen, there's zero effort talking about giving people information on how to strengthen
*  your immune system.
*  Zero.
*  Yeah.
*  Zero effort.
*  Zero effort talking to people about lowering stress levels through meditation and exercise.
*  Zero.
*  Yeah.
*  Zero effort of keeping your body healthy.
*  Zero.
*  Zero talk about this.
*  Yeah.
*  Zero concentrating on the new data that's coming in about vitamins and all the different
*  vitamin deficiencies.
*  Vitamin D.
*  Yes.
*  Dr. Rhonda Patrick knocked it all out of the park on the podcast yesterday.
*  Fuck, man.
*  It's crazy.
*  These people are just like stay home, locked up.
*  Locked up, stay inside.
*  But aside from the government, snitches get stitches.
*  This is basic childhood etiquette.
*  Well, there were first given snitches for people who are violating social distancing,
*  but now they're moving on to businesses that are non-compliant.
*  But how are you supposed to make money?
*  How are you supposed to make money?
*  I don't understand this.
*  What is the thought?
*  Here's the crazy thing.
*  Garcetti said we're going to keep LA on at least partial lockdown until there's a cure.
*  There's not going to be a cure, you fucking dummy.
*  It's a virus.
*  And isn't it a cold virus?
*  Yes.
*  You don't cure viruses unless you find a way to eradicate it from the actual gene pool.
*  But did he actually say that?
*  Yes.
*  He said until there's a cure.
*  You can't say that.
*  No.
*  First of all, I'm sure what he meant is like a viable treatment, a vaccine.
*  But they're saying that even a vaccine, there's never been a coronavirus vaccine.
*  Mayor, LA will never be completely reopened until we have a cure.
*  That's his quote.
*  That just seems, I mean, we don't have a cure for the flu.
*  Poor lady who is the health lady.
*  Someone needs to give her a steak and let her lie outside in the sun.
*  Jesus Christ, you're the health lady.
*  I heard you're moving.
*  She looks tired.
*  That's been on the wires.
*  Listen, we're all talking about it.
*  All of us talk about it.
*  How all of who?
*  All my friends.
*  Oh.
*  Callan, Schaub, Joey Diaz, everyone.
*  You can just go start like a cult.
*  A Davidian ranch.
*  We're going to call it a cult.
*  We're just going to be up in up front about it.
*  All these people hide the fact they have a cult.
*  Ten years from now, it's just Waco and Joe.
*  We're just going to call it the cult.
*  We'll have the band play the cult.
*  Thanks, Schaub.
*  I would join if you started.
*  Super underrated band.
*  The cult?
*  Love removal machine?
*  Holy fuck, that's a good jam to work out too.
*  I would probably join your cult.
*  Thank you.
*  I would have you.
*  I would have you in my cult.
*  Basically, I have everybody.
*  If you're nice, just be nice and tell the truth.
*  If you fuck up, tell the truth about that.
*  We love you.
*  This is the idea of the cult.
*  We'll just call it the cult.
*  We just get a gigantic chunk of land somewhere and start building.
*  What do I have to pay?
*  What are the dues?
*  No dues.
*  That's the key.
*  That's where everything goes wrong.
*  Here's just two ways things go wrong.
*  The cult leader, that's a problem.
*  You should never have a cult leader.
*  So you're not the leader.
*  No, there's no leader.
*  It's just an amorphous cult.
*  I think everybody should be informed and get to vote.
*  That's how it should be.
*  But you have to be informed.
*  You can't just vote.
*  You got to be informed and get to vote.
*  You're starting your own state.
*  Something like that.
*  The state of Rogan.
*  But a few thousand acres.
*  That's all we need.
*  A few thousand acres in Colorado or Montana.
*  And helicopters.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of other shit.
*  I got some plans.
*  I've been looking at Idaho.
*  Idaho's good.
*  I know.
*  Wyoming's good.
*  Idaho, by the way, Boise is, I don't even want to talk about it right now on the podcast
*  and I want to blow it up for Boise.
*  They get mad at me when I talk about going to Idaho.
*  They're like, don't give away our secret.
*  Let everyone go to Texas.
*  I did a show in Boise a little over a year ago and I was like, I feel like I should not
*  tell people about this.
*  This is a goddamn secret.
*  You guys have this really cool town.
*  Boise is this really cool town.
*  It's a little red.
*  But hey, I get along with people that are red, by the way, more a lot of times than
*  I get along with people that are like ideologically left.
*  Like without thinking about it.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  There's people that are left because they're compassionate and they want people to have
*  freedom and the choice to do whatever they want to do with their body.
*  Were you raised Democrat?
*  No.
*  Yes, Democrat.
*  Well, I was raised hippie.
*  My stepfather had long hair down to his ass.
*  My parents went from New Jersey, like really Italian neighborhood to San Francisco and
*  then became a hippie.
*  But my stepdad was a hippie when my mom met him.
*  And then we moved across the country when I was seven.
*  We lived in San Francisco in like in the middle of like where Lombard Street is.
*  So it was all just flower children and gay people and fuck this war.
*  Like I was in San Francisco when the Vietnam War broke.
*  Oh, OK.
*  When I was a little kid, when it ended, when the war ended rather.
*  And I remember thinking like, wow, they're never going to have war again.
*  They figured it out.
*  Thank God.
*  And I was like, because I was worried.
*  You know, there's people that were around me that were, you know, if there was younger
*  folks, they were worried about being drafted.
*  And so you were pretty indoctrinated with all that.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  OK.
*  But I don't think that's what's going on here with with the left today.
*  There's a lot of weird cult shit.
*  It really is like cult shit.
*  It's like religious shit.
*  It's like instead of thinking rationally and looking at the faults of both sides, the faults
*  of one side are completely ignored or exonerated or, you know, you find a way to forgive it
*  or to find out for you do mental gymnastics and you can let them get away with all sorts
*  of heinous shit, privacy invading, invading shit, but going after whistleblowers, drone
*  attacks like fucking across the board.
*  Yeah, everything.
*  Right.
*  But I would say this is true about the Magus too.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah, you know, there's there's a certain amount of I mean, speaking of cults, it's
*  a little bit like dear leader.
*  They fell into something.
*  They fell into something.
*  You know, they fell into the the spell of a powerful figure that's right.
*  They feel like they don't have a word in.
*  They feel like they don't they're not represented.
*  First of all, it's really hard for assholes to find a king like all kings are noble.
*  Like most of the people that were running for president, most people that were president,
*  they were at least outwardly noble.
*  They weren't the type of people that talk shit on someone's call, some horse face on
*  Twitter.
*  You know, so there's a certain amount of dignity.
*  They're dignified to a certain extent.
*  And Trump is Trump.
*  Love him or hate him.
*  He's Trump.
*  And assholes have a king now.
*  They never had a king before.
*  And there's a lot of assholes.
*  It's a large market.
*  Well, what's interesting, I think on the left and what you're saying is it's more of a religion
*  It's a free floating ideology that everybody's a bit enamored by, but they don't have that
*  one personality that they rally around and that they focus on.
*  And they feel like they don't have a voice either.
*  So it's very similar feelings, I think, that drive that.
*  And it's similar also in that the really far left people are the ones that people point
*  to when they mock the left, whereas the vast majority of them don't fall into that.
*  Right.
*  Hard on the left, hard on them.
*  And rightfully so, I think, to a certain extent, because I do see a lot of this stuff like
*  the language policing and the erosion of freedom of speech to a certain extent as deeply terrifying.
*  But I've kind of been saying I see fascism on all sides kind of encroaching.
*  There's elements of it.
*  The creepy worship of the cult of personality, the, you know, just abiding by this mob mentality.
*  And I've just been, I've been feeling pretty nihilistic.
*  But isn't it also because you've been locked up?
*  No, no, that's normal for me.
*  So what's making you feel more nihilistic?
*  I've never felt less optimistic about people's ability to govern themselves.
*  So this American experiment is supposed to be one in which it's smaller government and
*  we, we can, you know, we're adults, we're grownups.
*  And now I feel like everybody's ratting on everybody else.
*  Everyone's looking to somebody to save them or tell them what to do.
*  There's this lack and it comes to the culture is just so lack of resilience, you know, just
*  psychological resilience.
*  And so I don't know.
*  I've been feeling you don't know who to believe.
*  Where do you get, where do you get your news from?
*  Where do you get your trusted news from?
*  It's a good question.
*  I don't.
*  I've been not getting news.
*  Like I just scan through things these days.
*  It's so frustrating.
*  There's first of all, there's too many series to follow.
*  There's the Obamagate series.
*  You got to follow that.
*  That's the nutcase.
*  Nutcase, nutcase.
*  The sitting president, the exiting president literally hires or gets the FBI to investigate
*  Trump.
*  I don't know anything about Obamagate, but I did see a takedown of Obamagate that was
*  pretty harsh where the guy was like, it basically relies on you having to believe a series of
*  conspiracy theories in order for it to even hold up.
*  And I am going to sit here right now before everyone's all like, I know nothing about
*  Obamagate.
*  I actually don't give a shit.
*  That might have been an older video.
*  That might have been an older video.
*  No, it's from last night.
*  Listen to Jimmy Dore's video on it.
*  Jimmy Dore's video is excellent.
*  He breaks down exactly what the administration did and that it's illegal and that you're
*  essentially using the FBI to spy on Trump.
*  And then when it turned out that all that Russia stuff that they were claiming was going
*  to happen didn't take place and that they knew it wasn't really happening to begin with,
*  that what they were saying was all exaggerating and hyperbole and they were trying to turn
*  it into something that it wasn't.
*  I don't know.
*  I haven't been following it.
*  It's not good.
*  It's not good.
*  What's the other story that we need to follow?
*  There's so many series.
*  There's so many going on right now.
*  Is Joe Biden losing his fucking mind?
*  Do they have him locked in a basement somewhere and they're pumping up steroids and coke right
*  before he does an interview?
*  Weren't they going to do like a whole Fortnite thing where he was going to be a, what do
*  they call it, a hologram in Fortnite or something and then like this is going to be our first
*  hologram president in the world.
*  Oh, a hologram debate, right?
*  Do you put anything beyond the realm of possibility at the point that we're at though in the world?
*  Doesn't it feel like we live in a fucking simulation?
*  It does.
*  Kevin Rose, you know Kevin Rose from DIG?
*  He put something up on his page a couple of days ago.
*  I retweeted it.
*  It's the new Unreal Engine, Unreal 5.
*  Oh, I saw that.
*  It's fucking insane.
*  It's fucking insane.
*  It's like movie stuff and it's in game action.
*  So the in game action.
*  Now there's a scene where the character that you're playing, it's a third person game and
*  you're moving this girl around and she runs up this hill and as she runs up the hill,
*  you see like rocks falling and you see the shadows.
*  It's spectacular.
*  And Kevin said, you know, he tweeted it to me and he said, look at this and imagine,
*  I believe he said 25, 50, 100 years from now, of course we're in a simulation because this
*  is going to be just as realistic in 25, 50, 100 years from now as the world that you're
*  experiencing right now.
*  But isn't there the question that we don't know that this isn't?
*  Yeah, that is the question.
*  I mean, it's a guy that I had on Nick Bostrom that explained it to me that I was, my feeble
*  brain was having a hard time calculating it, but he's basically saying that according
*  to probability theory, we are in a simulation.
*  It's more probable that we are than that we're not.
*  My friend was saying that they would start doing things like this, leading you to believe
*  you're in a simulation of people in the simulation started becoming self aware.
*  They'd start making you think you're in a simulation so that you could doubt it.
*  Of course, built in fail saves.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  But that makes sense, right?
*  So I'm going to ask you, Jimmy Dore, you get news from him?
*  I do.
*  I get news from Kyle Kalinsky, Jimmy Dore.
*  My political news is all from The Hill, Jimmy Dore, and Kyle Kalinsky.
*  The Hill is Crystal and Sagar, I always say his name wrong.
*  They have a really good political show.
*  And Kyle Kalinsky is very well versed in exactly what's going on.
*  And he's critical of both sides, as is Jimmy Dore.
*  Neither one of those is partisan.
*  Both those guys, even though they're left, both progressive guys, they're very open minded
*  and very honest about what's going wrong and what's wrong about it.
*  Jimmy Dore, especially, he has some fucking epic rants.
*  An epic rant recently about when people tried to whitewash the negative things that happened
*  during the Obama administration.
*  He's like, you guys are gaslighting people.
*  This is what happens when you have your standard, this is the relationship, right?
*  A guy goes into office, he promises a bunch of stuff, can't really do them, but people
*  like the way he talks, does some things that maybe aren't so good, you find out later,
*  and then he gets out and he makes shitloads of money doing speeches.
*  And Jimmy Dore highlights that, that he's making, he's even openly talking about it,
*  that press correspondence dinner, you know, that Jokey Depp.
*  He talked about how he's going to try those lines out at Goldman Sachs after he did them there.
*  And then he said he was going to make him some serious Tubmans.
*  They're taking over all the streaming.
*  I saw a whole thing about how the Obamas, I think, are, they're getting into the streaming
*  game and I read somewhere that the Clintons are, that could be wrong.
*  Well, the Obamas apparently have some sort of a deal with Netflix to produce shows, documentaries,
*  and then they have a deal where they're doing podcasts.
*  Did you like Obama?
*  I like him as a spokesperson and as, like, as a figurehead of who the president is.
*  I mean, he's a handsome guy.
*  He's incredibly articulate, really well-spoken.
*  The way he speaks is like a statesman, you know?
*  I mean, he's always calm and collected.
*  There's a lot about him I really like.
*  There's a lot about him.
*  But politics is a crazy, messy, impossible to do right business that no one has nailed,
*  especially at the highest levels.
*  No one's nailed it.
*  I don't know why he didn't do what he said he was going to do before he got into office.
*  I don't know what they revealed to him.
*  I don't know.
*  But when you listen, if someone does an accurate job of breaking down what went wrong, particularly
*  what's going on with this Flynn case, where they're trying to drop all the charges and
*  then some new judges coming in saying, no, we're not dropping shit.
*  I just feel so ill-equipped to process this stuff.
*  Because I'm not a lawyer.
*  I'm not a politician.
*  I'm an idiot on YouTube.
*  Thank you.
*  And I'm an idiot right here.
*  And I don't know anything.
*  And I often hear, even in my comments on the dumpster fire, they're like, oh, I get all
*  my news from you and Joe Rogan.
*  I'm like, no.
*  No.
*  Don't do it.
*  Don't do that.
*  Don't do that.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't do that.
*  No.
*  Don't get it from me or you.
*  No.
*  No.
*  I am not a trusted news source.
*  But then I'm like, but I don't know who is.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know who is either.
*  I'm here to talk shit.
*  OK.
*  And if I'm wrong, which is often, I will let you know.
*  I'm not here to lie, but I'm here to talk shit.
*  That's what I'm here to do.
*  Yeah.
*  The show, we just basically make fun of how bonkers everything is.
*  And I but I don't have any answers.
*  I don't know what the freaking pathway forward out of this ship show is.
*  It seems like it's going to get worse before it gets better, which is my fear.
*  It certainly is going to get worse.
*  It has to get worse unless the world starts back up and there's some sort of a shift in
*  treatment, some sort of a shift in how much more survivable the disease is.
*  It's pretty survivable.
*  The disease.
*  Are we back to COVID?
*  OK.
*  I mean, that's what's wrong with everything right now.
*  Right.
*  I mean, until that gets solved, the politics is just amplified.
*  What that is, it's like gasoline to the fire of partisanship.
*  Yes.
*  Everybody's in a panic and everyone's fearful and so many people are going to be unemployed.
*  And when people were unemployed, that's when Hitler kicked in, by the way.
*  Right.
*  Because people were, true, in Germany.
*  I know, I know.
*  But you're not making any arguments against the Trump is literally Hitler.
*  I don't think he's Hitler.
*  No, I know, I know.
*  I think he's Trump.
*  I think he's always been the same guy.
*  It's just that now they've expected so much more of him.
*  No, I think people...
*  They've now expected him to be a statesman.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think people are desperate.
*  And that's what scares me is that, you know, even in the city, there's just more crime
*  in my neighborhood.
*  There's more, now everyone's wearing a fucking mask.
*  It's easy to do crime.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what you do.
*  You're either a superhero, you commit crimes.
*  And I definitely see...
*  It's weird, like, where I live in LA is a bit of a crossroads area.
*  And it's a little bit like crossroads are the big freeways and some of the big arteries
*  of the roads.
*  And it's at night, because everybody's locked down, it's all the drifters and homeless people.
*  And it feels fucking weird when you go out in LA at night.
*  It's all just...
*  Mad Maxing.
*  It's like zombies.
*  Yeah.
*  Right, because nothing's open.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's nothing's open and no one's on the road.
*  I like this kind of drifter population in LA and they're the only ones that you see.
*  So it's so highlighted right now.
*  Is anybody doing a tally on how many more homeless people there are?
*  What I wonder is...
*  40% increase.
*  I just saw last night.
*  They're expected over the next 12 months, I think.
*  40% increase.
*  So go from 70,000 to like, what is that, 85, 87,000, something like that?
*  What in the fuck?
*  I mean, it's hitting LA hard because most of the people were like freelancers.
*  Everybody's in the gig economy here.
*  Everyone I fucking knew drove Uber, who is trying to make it as a comic or trying to
*  make it as any creative is doing as a side hustle.
*  So you take away...
*  Think about it, the makeup artists, all the people who are working in music, all the people
*  that are no longer in work because there are no live music shows, all the people lighting.
*  It's so bottomless in this town.
*  I'm worried about LA.
*  You should be worried because we have a guy who's running it that thinks that the solution
*  is keep everybody home.
*  That's not the solution.
*  No, no.
*  And now they're saying crazy things.
*  Like, I'll read you a quote because this quote is fucking nuts.
*  Someone sent it to me and I read it and I was like, is that real?
*  Did he really say that?
*  And he was talking about the mandatory wearing of masks.
*  And so this is the quote he said, bring your mask with you whenever you leave your home,
*  Garcetti said, that will help us get more freedoms.
*  What?
*  That will help us get more freedoms.
*  I'm fine with wearing a mask in establishments, banks or wherever, but walking, like on a
*  walk with my dog with no one around.
*  I'm not giving anyone the fucking coronavirus.
*  You're stopping our freedoms.
*  Yeah.
*  I was fucking it up for everybody, Bridget.
*  I go and get our freedoms, earn our freedoms, drive around with your mask on.
*  See, and I again, I think here's my suggestion.
*  Please get two constitutional lawyers on your show and have them debate the constitutionality
*  of this because I would like I know there's precedent.
*  There were two states that voted that the lockdowns were even now they voted in favor
*  of them.
*  And so I think Michigan was one and I can't remember the other one, maybe Pennsylvania
*  or somewhere.
*  So there's precedent and and there are people who are saying this isn't violating our rights.
*  But I would really love to hear two people who aren't idiots like me have a discussion
*  about whether or not this is the case.
*  Well, Wisconsin overturned it.
*  And then they had all these bars and all these people were just getting hammered in the bars
*  and people are really pissed off because the bars are packed with people.
*  I think people are getting pissed off because it looks like fun.
*  That's what I think.
*  I think they're using the excuse like, oh, you're going to transmit the disease.
*  I think what's really going on is they don't want anybody having any fun.
*  And they're depressed now.
*  And when people are depressed, misery loves company.
*  They want everybody to be depressed.
*  They don't want anybody fucking listening to Garth Brooks singing.
*  I got friends in low places, throwing back Jack Daniels and high fiving each other.
*  I grew up with that.
*  That was my upbringing in Minnesota.
*  You just described my high school years.
*  It's a great song when you're hammered.
*  You're hammered at a country western bar that comes on.
*  You're like, well, right.
*  Good times. Jack Daniels, too.
*  That you just described my exact high school.
*  Any kind of whiskey. Bring in the buffalo trace.
*  Bring give me what's that?
*  Give me some of that Dan Aykroyd skull vodka.
*  What's that stuff called?
*  Crystal skull vodka.
*  I think that most people can balance the two worries,
*  you know, the concern about their their their family, their economics.
*  A lot of people are worried about their own safety and sickness.
*  It's not just there's if you look online, you would think there's just two groups.
*  The like people who are shut ins and the people who are
*  are, you know, like grandma killers or whatever.
*  Right. Because you're insensitive and you want to go outside.
*  But I think most people live in the gray.
*  They live in the area of saying, OK, we understand that this is new
*  and we don't know really shit about it.
*  And I understood it as we were supposed to stay home so we could flatten the curve,
*  which I thought we did.
*  We for sure flattened it and help our our places like the hospitals catch up,
*  which we know they're going out of business because there's no one there.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And they said we need more ventilators.
*  Well, now it turns out that the people that go on the ventilators don't do well.
*  How crazy is that?
*  I like how funny is it going to be when it comes out?
*  The ventilators are killing people.
*  Well, that's what Michael Yo's doctor said.
*  I mean, not funny. It's not funny, but it is funny.
*  But it's ironic. Far away from it.
*  It's funny. It's it's I know people who are worried.
*  And I've I've had family, you know, I have a family member in the hospital right now.
*  I'm I'm concerned. But it's also they don't know.
*  They I'm not sure that they've tested him yet.
*  But that was the other thing.
*  It's weird when they test you and they don't.
*  And so I don't mean to laugh at it's a serious thing.
*  Any loss of life. But that happens a lot.
*  Well, that's the problem is that we're only thinking of covid.
*  And meanwhile, the flu is still here.
*  People are still dying from the flu.
*  Tuberculosis is still killing people left and right.
*  The heart disease is ruthless. Yeah.
*  Cancer is not stopping.
*  All these things are happening to people right now while we're worried about covid.
*  It just highlights how fragile we are.
*  We are. It's that old saying that's been around forever, that soft times
*  make soft people. Yeah.
*  This is just what we're seeing right now.
*  We've had some soft fucking times.
*  And now all of a sudden, a huge dose of adversity
*  and in a point where there's nothing you can do about it used to be when when people
*  when their business failed, you could probably point to one thing like, oh, he got sick
*  or, oh, they they lost a loan or, oh, he started drinking or, oh, whatever.
*  You could point to a reason why the business went under.
*  Now it's you can't work.
*  Right. Won't let you work.
*  That can't even make the decision yourself to work.
*  Right. Crazy. And there again, I believe there was precedent for lockdowns,
*  like in the 1918 flu pandemic.
*  I think this isn't because, you know, you talk about adversity.
*  And when this first started happening and people were asked to do this,
*  I understand taking away someone's livelihood and not giving them any right
*  to work is obviously something that's bullshit.
*  But also no one's had to make any sacrifice either.
*  So we're talking about a generation that hasn't experienced much adversity
*  and hasn't experienced having to sacrifice because my grandfather went off to war,
*  you know, when he was 18 years old.
*  You got drafted. He didn't get drafted.
*  He just went because it was World War Two.
*  But he sacrificed.
*  There was an attitude of sacrifice that you made for your country.
*  And so people, I think the reason people got so on board
*  behind this was they felt like it was they were doing the right thing.
*  Their civic duty.
*  I mean, I think a lot of it was fear for their own health.
*  But I also think that it was a sense of civic pride and duty.
*  And I actually don't think that's a bad thing that people rallied
*  to help save our most vulnerable people.
*  That's that's good.
*  But at what point are we now hurting more people than we're saving?
*  I totally agree with you.
*  My my thoughts on the lockdown in the beginning were this is great
*  because this shows that people can act together
*  to protect people when they're not worried about themselves.
*  I wasn't worried about it myself.
*  I know a lot of people that weren't worried about it.
*  Well, if I get sick, I'm healthy and I take care of my body.
*  And it seems like according to the actual statistics,
*  I'm going to probably be OK.
*  Some people aren't. So it's locked down.
*  Let's lock down. Let's not go anywhere.
*  Let's just let this show what's going on.
*  Let it ride out.
*  Because super smart people figure this out.
*  And the images coming out of Italy were terrifying.
*  And, you know, my friend was in Italy.
*  They were in lockdown in Rome for months.
*  Yeah. And they were all singing from balconies.
*  And she said she was saying watching America from Italy is funny
*  because you guys are so partisan about everything.
*  You cannot just.
*  She's like, we've been through so many wars in Italy that it just
*  there is a sense that the community can suck it up
*  and rally together for a little bit for the good of the community.
*  Yeah. But we don't have that.
*  There's also like 10,000 people over there.
*  Look who the fuck's over there.
*  They don't have very many people in Italy. So little.
*  And I think what we're experiencing now is what happens
*  when people who are in power don't understand the responsibility that they have.
*  And they also don't understand that this is a multifaceted problem.
*  You can't just look at hospitals and PPE and old people that are dying.
*  You have to look at the fucking economy.
*  You have to look at all the human beings that are sacrificing people
*  that are losing their jobs.
*  People that are losing their livelihoods for no reason.
*  That makes sense to them.
*  They're being forced to not work and they don't get it.
*  It doesn't make sense. Yeah.
*  And they're going to be angry.
*  And there's so many and rightfully there's so many groups, too, that,
*  you know, I worry about small businesses like they're never going to recover.
*  And this is really, unfortunately, the kind of march of Amazon
*  and all of these places that now suddenly you have any little small business,
*  mom and pop. So I started doing like free advertisements for small businesses
*  on my not huge podcast that I have, but just to help people out.
*  But can they work and do an advertisement?
*  Can they can these people?
*  Well, they can.
*  Well, they this one particular it's a hundred year old company
*  and they sell clothes up in Portland and it is a dad
*  and like his son who are running it.
*  And they were about to celebrate their 100 years and they can sell the clothes online.
*  But because they had so many huge brand, so many huge stores canceled their orders.
*  And what's the company's name?
*  I have to I have to look.
*  She's this woman. You should be prepared.
*  Sorry, I didn't know I was going to bring their game.
*  Let's try to pump them up.
*  And the other thing that I was thinking about a lot.
*  Let's get their name before we forget, though, because otherwise people keep talking.
*  Keep talking. You keep talking.
*  So tell me about what you've been doing that though.
*  That's really cool.
*  What what have you been hearing from your audience?
*  Like people who people are scared, they're worried.
*  The people that are prone to fear are really scared
*  because they're concentrating on the worst acts, the worst aspects, the disease.
*  And all my friends are is the biggest pussy.
*  He's scared more than anybody.
*  Everybody else is basically not worried about it.
*  And, you know, doesn't want to get it.
*  But I know now I know nine people that have gotten it.
*  And everyone's been fine, except for Michael Yeo.
*  And I also found out yesterday that Michael Yeo told me that not only did he do
*  all those things like fly to New York, do all their radio, do the do different shows,
*  do the shows at night, fly back on very little sleep and then drive to Vegas and drive home.
*  But he's also vitamin D deficient.
*  So when he saw the Rhonda Patrick podcast and saw the post that I put up on Instagram
*  that showed how, you know, there's a massive difference between the number of people
*  that are in critical condition in the ICU that are vitamin D deficient
*  versus vitamins, vitamin D sufficient.
*  And the vitamin D sufficient was really low, like four percent.
*  Whereas the vitamin D deficient was a huge percentage of the people that were in the ICU.
*  Huge. And this is not just in this was in Indonesia.
*  There was a study in New Orleans and a study in somewhere else.
*  But all of them came to a very similar conclusion.
*  I mean, it doesn't mean that vitamin D is going to absolutely protect you from this.
*  But Rhonda Patrick, if you go to my Instagram post, she actually breaks down
*  why this is significant when someone else was a little bit critical about it.
*  She stepped in and broke down why it was so important.
*  70 percent also of the US population is vitamin D insufficient.
*  And 28.9 percent are deficient in vitamin D.
*  Wow. Deficient vitamin D is very bad.
*  Yeah. That's 28.9 percent of our entire population. Wow.
*  So more than a quarter of our population is deficient in a really important hormone.
*  Yeah. Because it's a hormone.
*  It's not just a vitamin.
*  She was breaking it down in a brilliant way on the podcast.
*  And I like her a lot. She's a wizard. She is a wizard.
*  I and now we can't go outside. You can go outside.
*  I mean, I can go outside, but we can go.
*  We they open the trails, right?
*  Well, some places, some places not.
*  OK, I got the craziest.
*  Some of the beaches they had closed and they had the beaches closed
*  in all the Republican areas.
*  What's the name of the Portland place? It's
*  I always mess up how to say it.
*  It's day hand. It's D.E.H.E.N.
*  1920, which is when they've been in business and they have cool clothes.
*  And so they opened right after the Spanish flu pandemic
*  and right before the Great Depression. Yeah.
*  And they wrote it out all the way.
*  And they wrote it out and they were about to sentence.
*  And, you know, brick and mortar businesses were already in trouble.
*  And now this is just the nail in the coffin.
*  So what's the website called? It's D.E.H.E.N.
*  .com. 1920.com.
*  Yeah. D.E.H.E.N.
*  1920.com. Go support them. Go support them.
*  That's awesome. Thanks. I'm glad you're doing that.
*  That's very cool. So we've been talking to just, you know,
*  I reached out to my audience and a lot of people are OK.
*  And so they're willing to make the sacrifice.
*  A lot of people have their own health worries that they're worried about.
*  People who are overweight or diabetic are obviously more concerned.
*  And that's a problem in our country.
*  One of the things that I've been thinking a lot about is just the school.
*  And my uncle and I were talking about this that year,
*  you know, especially the vulnerable kids, kids who are at home
*  in homes that are abusive or kids who already are at a disadvantage.
*  Maybe they they live and
*  they're just like in the vulnerable communities and they're really.
*  Education is one of the only ways kind of out of their circumstances.
*  And now there is already something I believe it's called the summer gap.
*  And they they fall very far behind because they don't have like summer camps
*  and they don't have all the access that some other kids do.
*  And now they're missing almost a year or half of a year, six months.
*  And this is time and that these kids are never going to get back.
*  So I'm worried about those kids.
*  You know, there are so many all of this stuff.
*  It hurts the poorest.
*  You know, really, it's a it's a disease that hurts.
*  It's not even it's a divider.
*  Yeah, but it's it's a monetary thing, really.
*  It really comes down to if you're poor, you're going to this is going to hurt you.
*  But this is also a disease where wealthy people can lose everything.
*  People that have had like a really good run and had a great business
*  and built it up for years and years and years and worked hard all of a sudden.
*  Boom. It could be gone.
*  You could have nothing. Right.
*  So have you heard possible?
*  Have you heard anecdotally just stories of that?
*  My friends who own gyms.
*  They're going under.
*  That's that's the one of the things that kills me to all these like
*  jujitsu places and the places where kids go camp little camps.
*  There's a place by me that's one of the gymnastics places that I used to take.
*  The autistic kids to go to.
*  And I don't know how they're going to make it.
*  And I don't understand how they're justifying keeping kids out of school.
*  It's not a disease that is killing kids.
*  The amount of kids that die from this disease are very small,
*  much smaller than the flu, much smaller.
*  So if you look at how many kids die from the flu and you look at how many kids
*  die from Covid, we should be terrified of the flu.
*  But yet we'll let our kids go to school with teachers.
*  And we're not checking these teachers to make sure these teachers don't have the flu.
*  Yeah. And they often go teach with the flu.
*  Yeah. The real question is, do the teachers have something and can they give it
*  to the kids and the kids go home and touch grandma and give it to her
*  and give it to people that are vulnerable?
*  Yeah, that's a real question.
*  But that's not insurmountable.
*  That's something you need to test people for.
*  What's insurmountable is keeping schools closed.
*  What's insurmountable is keeping businesses closed.
*  It's not insurmountable to test everybody.
*  That's not that hard.
*  That's way easier than asking the entire economy to pause
*  for half a fucking year because you don't have any better answers.
*  Right. I mean, that's what's so upsetting is the failure to have planned at all
*  for anything like this.
*  Like you're going to shut the whole fucking economy off with no plan.
*  And then they're basically like, here's twelve hundred dollars.
*  Peace. Good luck to you.
*  Good luck. Good luck.
*  One time payment and good luck getting it.
*  And fuck you.
*  Want to kill Cliff?
*  He's got CBD in it. Don't be scared.
*  Tim Dillon was. Tim Dillon wouldn't even drink it.
*  Really? He was scared. Yeah.
*  Why? He's scared.
*  Get blasted.
*  Because he's so clean and sober and doing so well.
*  So am I.
*  And used to be. I know.
*  That's why I said, are you scared?
*  No, I'm not scared. Good.
*  I use not psychoactive.
*  No, no. Yeah.
*  I am worried about I always check on the people.
*  I'm like, how's everyone doing?
*  Because the other thing that bothers me and worries me is mental health.
*  Like I have a lot of single female friends and they haven't hugged anyone in like two months.
*  You know, they're just the lack that this is what we do to people when we put them in prison.
*  And we put we put people in isolation because it's really one of the worst things you can do to a human.
*  Yes. And so all of these people in isolation who might already be wrestling with depression,
*  anxiety or whatever, you know, mental like illness or problems they have now are alone and isolated.
*  And I don't I'm worried. I'm worried about people.
*  Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
*  You should be. Yeah.
*  It's not good. It's not good for single men, single women, single anybody.
*  No, it's especially folks.
*  I mean, have you ever been moved to a place where you didn't have any friends?
*  Yeah, I moved every year and a half.
*  Me too. I moved a lot growing up.
*  I'm very, very familiar with sitting alone.
*  I can't not watch people sit alone and eat, like especially in a lunch room, because it's trigger alert.
*  It's too much like, oh, I was the girl sitting alone for so long.
*  I remember when I first moved to L.A. in 94, I came out here to do a TV show and I didn't know anybody.
*  So I basically went to the set and then I went to the comedy store and I went to the gym.
*  And that's basically it. I didn't have any friends for a long time.
*  And I remember I was on the set and this girl gave me a hug.
*  And I remember thinking, God, it feels so good.
*  Like not not just a hug.
*  You weren't dating or anything?
*  No, no, no. She just like, it's not a hug.
*  No, I mean, you went in this time when you're like, Jim, on your little hamster wheel.
*  You know, no, no, I wasn't dating anybody.
*  No, I was just doing this stupid TV show.
*  And I had a girlfriend back in New York, but we're kind of on the outs.
*  And then I was just sort of settling in to whether or not I was going to stay out there.
*  I'd be good with Vaga. It's delicious. Right.
*  For the record. Kill clips.
*  This is a great one.
*  But anyway, this girl hugged me on the set.
*  And I don't think I'd ever gone that long without a hug.
*  Right. Right.
*  And it was like a couple of weeks.
*  And I was like, oh, like I like when you're thirsty.
*  Yeah. You get a drink of water.
*  Not just every hug feels good.
*  It's like nice. Yeah.
*  But this was different. This is like I needed it.
*  Yeah. Because people do need to.
*  People need each other. We need each other.
*  Yeah. Part of the reason I read a really interesting article,
*  part of the reason that Italy, the death toll was so high is there's a lot more intergenerational contact.
*  So the younger people are hanging out with their grandparents more than we do here in America.
*  Also, they smoke a lot.
*  I mean, those fucking people are all smokers over there.
*  It's crazy. It's like the 90s.
*  It's crazy. So you guys not read?
*  They don't care. You don't care about cancer?
*  You guys are out of your fucking mind.
*  And then it kind of goes through and ravages nursing homes here.
*  And it's crazy once it gets into nursing homes.
*  But so many of the people who work in nursing homes work at multiple nursing homes.
*  We should be making sure that they're not spreading it.
*  I was reading this thing that they were criticizing Andrew Cuomo for making old people go back to nursing.
*  I know because they tested positive and then they sent them back.
*  That is so crazy. Yeah.
*  This article was I was like, how has no one brought this up?
*  That's any of these discussions on the mistakes that have been made.
*  Yeah. When you ask me why I feel nihilistic, it's like our leaders have failed us.
*  I don't think they knew. I don't think they understood.
*  And also, I think they were in a situation where they had a clear room in the hospitals because these new patients were coming in and they were running out of space.
*  You know, the New York City situation is a different situation.
*  They got it way worse than anybody else.
*  They've had more than I think last time I checked, it was like 25,000 deaths, whereas the entire state of California is only like 1800 or something.
*  Yeah, it's low here. It's very low here.
*  I think it's a lot of it is because the governor acted quickly.
*  But I think you got to let go of the reins, man.
*  I do think it's part of that.
*  I also think we don't use public transportation as much and that we're not as on top of each other.
*  And we live, even though we might all interact, we're pretty isolated in L.A.
*  Jack Harrow, I called it the loneliest city in the world.
*  It's definitely a city where everyone's still even driving.
*  We're all in our little pods alone.
*  Hunter S. Thompson had the best description of L.A.
*  He said it's like a graveyard from the future.
*  Oh, wow. Well, now it's an actual we're in the graveyard.
*  Well, guess what, Hunter?
*  We've got up to the future.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  So I think there's something to be said.
*  Yeah. Something to be said for just how isolated we are already.
*  And just the actual physical distance.
*  You know, we have more land.
*  We're not all in apartments going up and down the same fucking elevator.
*  You know, there's just so much.
*  Some people are. Some.
*  But not as many as New York.
*  No, not as many as New York.
*  But still, I bet that's an issue where people do live in apartments.
*  I bet it's more of an issue touching the same elevator buttons and all that stuff.
*  It's very complicated.
*  You're making a lot of sense about New York, though.
*  But I think also the sun is a factor, too.
*  The fact that people are not getting any sun, you know, no one's outside.
*  You're not getting any vitamin D.
*  And if you're not supplementing, you're not getting that.
*  And I think that also they're getting a different strain of the virus
*  because they're getting a strain that comes from Europe.
*  Yeah, we're getting the strain from China.
*  We got the O.G.
*  Yeah, we got the O.G.
*  The O.G.'s milder.
*  Are they naming weed strains after this yet?
*  Oh, sure. Someone must have a fucking COVID-19 killer.
*  Yeah, is there like a Wuhan?
*  If you went back in the 1970s and smoked some hippie weed, like in San Francisco,
*  you'd be like, bitch, what are you guys smoking?
*  You smoke a whole joint to get high off this garbage.
*  Right. Yeah. I think that's how it is with the virus, too.
*  I think the Chinese version of the virus is not nearly as rugged
*  as the virus that went all the way through Europe.
*  Ah, because it morphed.
*  Yeah. But again, I'm a moron.
*  So what the fuck do we know?
*  We're like, actually, I don't even understand what a gene is.
*  I know how to spell it.
*  And I could point you to some papers that I've read.
*  So how have you been handling it?
*  Initially, I was scared.
*  No bullshit. Like we stocked up on food and I was worried about a bunch of things.
*  First of all, I was worried about the guns.
*  There's so many people that were buying guns.
*  I was like, whoa, this ain't good.
*  Like people that don't know how to use a gun, never shot a gun.
*  They're all lining up to buy guns.
*  And then there was a lot of my friends were super liberal
*  who never wanted guns, who are asking me how to get guns.
*  How do you shoot a gun? Where do you go to practice?
*  Hilarious watching liberals learn about their gun laws.
*  I'm like, you guys voted for me that my friends would be like,
*  do you have to wait 10 days?
*  Yeah. No shit, idiot.
*  Like, what do you think you've been voting for here?
*  Well, that's a good thing, though.
*  We should, you know, that's a good thing.
*  The bad thing is you waited until a pandemic to get a gun.
*  Yeah. That's the bad thing.
*  But I'm also just shocked at people who are so anti gun.
*  Don't act. If you're going to be anti gun, know your laws.
*  I have a great story. My friend, I will not name him,
*  but he's always had guns when he was younger and he's married
*  and they have a kid and his wife was like, no fucking guns.
*  You're never going to have a gun in this house.
*  We're never going to have a gun. He's like, OK, fine.
*  Pandemic goes down. Lockdown.
*  We need to get a gun. Get a gun. Go out, get a gun.
*  He's like, but what you said?
*  She's like, fuck what I said. Get a fucking gun.
*  Like immediately, like yelling at him.
*  We need a gun. We need a gun.
*  So he went out and bought two guns.
*  Yeah, it's not going to take much before shit go sideways in this town.
*  We have to be careful.
*  All you fucking liberals here in California, because you will turn this state
*  Republican, you will do it with all this craziness.
*  You keep things locked down.
*  If Texas starts thriving and all these other states start thriving
*  and they're doing well, Utah is starting to open up.
*  All these states are opening up.
*  If they start thriving and the cases go down,
*  we understand better treatment methods and people take better care of their bodies
*  and use smart nutrition.
*  California is going to be fucked and someone's going to come along
*  and exploit that and say, this is what I would have done.
*  And this is what I'll do now.
*  And they're like, fuck, yeah.
*  Newport Beach will come out.
*  Newport Huntington Beach will every 100 percent voted, 100 percent voted.
*  Even dead people voted in Huntington Beach.
*  They all vote Republican.
*  We I wouldn't it wouldn't hurt for our state to go purple.
*  I would like to see some balance.
*  Some libertarian type shit.
*  Well, I just think there's no balance at all in California.
*  It's so one sided.
*  There's no we need balance.
*  It's one sided ideologically, meaning that it's one sided.
*  Actually, too.
*  Yeah, but I mean, it's one sided subscribing to an ideology.
*  Do you think I I would disagree with that liberal ideology.
*  I think there's a strong liberal ideology.
*  Yes, I also think there is a strong libertarian bent that just isn't vocal.
*  Yeah, because they can't be.
*  But I think one side and politically.
*  Yeah, but we're one side and Hollywood is one sided ideology.
*  Yeah, this area, like if you're in the movie business or the television
*  business, any place where you have to get hired, the difference between podcasts,
*  stand up and then having to get hired is massive.
*  And you see these people that have been infected.
*  Right. You see these stand up comics that have been infected
*  by their connection to Hollywood.
*  So they'll spout up some liberal horse shit.
*  And then you you you ask him on you question them on it.
*  And they don't have a great rational response, but they know
*  the virtuous thing to say, especially public when you're on a podcast publicly.
*  They know the thing they have to say to be ingratiated with all these people
*  that are going to hire them for projects.
*  It's really fucked up because it's like it's like a form of self
*  censorship by limiting your your employment options.
*  Well, this is how I ended up in this space is I was I got picked up
*  by a manager for a script and we were going to either try and sell a show
*  or get into a writer's room.
*  And then on Twitter, I was like, why am I self censoring?
*  And I was doing comedy a lot.
*  And I kept feeling like I couldn't say I was self censoring around my comedian
*  peers, and I was like, this is fucking weird.
*  Comedians are supposed to be like the people saying all the shit you can't say
*  as all the time.
*  And so I started just be I became aware of that.
*  I'm like, what would happen
*  if I said the things I wasn't saying on Twitter?
*  And it was like,
*  a, it was people were like, thank you.
*  And B, I lost a lot of friends.
*  I lost people who and people because then there's that whole guilt by association.
*  Yes. And then my life took on a whole other path.
*  But I never heard from those managers.
*  That guilt by association thing is real, where people think that you shouldn't
*  talk to people that have different ideas or talk to people
*  that have somehow or another embraced these different ideas.
*  It's very interesting to watch.
*  It's it's weird because I grew up.
*  So my dad is one of 10 and we grew up one.
*  One brother went off and became like a commie in Germany.
*  And one.
*  I mean, he he was it was the 80s.
*  He was following.
*  I don't know. He went off on a journey.
*  And I had enough everybody.
*  There was a Republican uncle and there, you know, one of my uncles was gay.
*  And it was a whole mishmash of and my grandparents were like,
*  you do not fight about politics.
*  Everyone's allowed to have their opinion, but you don't.
*  You don't like lose family members.
*  That's why this whole thing of like, you need to go to Thanksgiving
*  and confront your fox watching, you know, parents.
*  There are always articles like around Thanksgiving where you like go home
*  and confront your everyone who writes those articles is mentally ill.
*  They're all mentally ill, anxiety ridden with a rotting foundation.
*  I you really think that it's a good idea to confront your fox
*  news watching relatives and yell at them over Thanksgiving.
*  You fucking idiot.
*  No, that's not what it's what you're not going to fix them and change them.
*  No, no, it's not going to happen.
*  What you're going to do is make an awful
*  thing, an awful holiday experience for the family.
*  Yeah, yeah. You're going to ruin it.
*  And again, I'm you know, blood is thicker than water.
*  It's just one. We were really raised to be tolerant, like ideologically tolerant.
*  That's good. Well, that's one of the first thing cults do.
*  They separate you from your parents. Yeah. Yeah.
*  The first thing it's a if someone says you need to get away from your parents,
*  you're like, oh, look, someone's starting a cult. Yeah.
*  Well, that's how I feel on Dumpster Fire.
*  We're always like our update on our cult,
*  because we always say Meghan Markle took Harry and like now he's in a cult
*  like her cult. What is her cult?
*  I don't know, but she separated from his family.
*  She moved him to another country. There are a lot of red flags.
*  He has no friends. He's completely isolated in L.A.
*  Well, he's probably never got that kind of pussy before.
*  His friends Harry, of course he has. No, no, no, no, no.
*  Very reserved. Got to be careful.
*  No, he was the partier.
*  Yeah, but I'm sure I'm sure you saw what happened to the one dude
*  who flew over to Epstein Island.
*  That guy's fine. I was the older one.
*  What's that guy's name? Andrew? Andrew. He's fucked.
*  He's fucked. They got him out of the castle.
*  He's gone. He's got to get a job now.
*  They kicked him out.
*  He should be getting money.
*  And what is he doing?
*  He doesn't get free royal money. What was he doing?
*  He was fucking the girls that Epstein brought to him.
*  I'm aware of what he was doing.
*  It's a horrific story.
*  No, that shit is as dark as it gets. Horrific.
*  It is as Tim Dillon and I always talk about this.
*  It is as dark as it gets. As it gets ever.
*  And the fact that they killed him and got away with it in front of everybody.
*  You're like, holy shit. Holy shit.
*  A lot's happened since I was here last. A lot. A lot.
*  Yeah, they fucking whacked him in front of everybody.
*  Wow. And then when you find out how many different
*  large tech organizations and people and influential people
*  that he was involved in. Oh, yeah, yeah.
*  It's crazy. Yeah. It's crazy.
*  It is straight out of something that you you couldn't even believe.
*  I wonder if it's so many of those guys like want to do something freaky,
*  but they can't like they want to get hookers and do something.
*  Can't they just go to the temple?
*  If you go to that island, the guy says, well,
*  what were they doing in that temple? Were they sacrificing virgins?
*  No, they're probably fucking probably saw mirrors in that temple and incense
*  and shit. It's so gross.
*  So speaking of cults, I was just thinking about this
*  because I ended up on a cult kind of like accidentally.
*  I didn't have a place to stay.
*  No, I was talking to Sam Harris yesterday and we were talking about
*  all of his time. I didn't know that he spent like 10 years as like a wandering hippie.
*  I had no idea. Yeah. And India.
*  And so I was like, you know, how a lot of people don't get out.
*  And when I was traveling for two years around the world,
*  I ended up on a lot of ashrams.
*  And one of them was an Osho ashram, which was that.
*  Yeah. Really?
*  So I came into my room.
*  I wrote a whole piece about it from Mel Maggi is leaking out of your body.
*  It's so I walked into my here.
*  I walked in and my roommate, Samantha Shahi, who is amazing,
*  was watching the documentary.
*  And there's this like exercise where they dance
*  and you go, who, who, who, who?
*  And it's a meditation that they made up.
*  And I'm like, oh, I've done that.
*  And they're naked. And she's like, of course you've done this.
*  And I sat down. I'm like, oh, my God, this is it wasn't Osho.
*  He's obviously dead, but it was his lineage.
*  And it was it was wild.
*  It was I was there for like three weeks.
*  Wow. But it was a documentary.
*  You know, great. They gave me a premserita.
*  Premserita. It means River of Love.
*  Oh, yeah. But he called me a scumbag.
*  Did he? He because they break you down in front of people.
*  And you know me, I couldn't stop laughing.
*  And so he was like, you are a scumbag.
*  Who is this guy?
*  The guru. He looks like a guru.
*  Like like how? Got a beard like long hair.
*  He was tan.
*  He said that he was 80, but it came out that he was actually 60.
*  So it's like, look how good I look.
*  And he's like, look at the shape I'm in from being here and eating
*  because they want you to stay.
*  And he was trying to like break me down psychologically.
*  But I think my brain is like too dirty to be washed.
*  I just don't think that's a great way of putting it.
*  I don't think that it is capable.
*  And so he was like, you are a scumbag out there.
*  You don't have work.
*  And I was like, actually, you're pretty right.
*  And he's like, say it, say you are a scumbag.
*  And I had to yell, I'm a scumbag in front of this whole group of strangers.
*  That's so funny.
*  It was wild.
*  So this guy who was breaking down, was he socially inept?
*  Like it was an awkward breakdown.
*  No, no. You didn't you didn't buy into it.
*  You sort of went around with it for fun.
*  I mean, I'm very curious.
*  So I like I think the writer and me and we talked about this last time, just
*  that when I was like the third in the open marriage,
*  so I remember vividly sitting just on their couch and being like,
*  should I do this? It's so weird.
*  But then like, but it's such a great story.
*  And the same this whole thing happened because I was with the Sydney Trust Fund
*  baby and he needed somebody to drive up to Byron Bay with them.
*  And he's like, oh, it's no problem.
*  You'll find a place to stay.
*  And there was nowhere to stay.
*  And he was off on Boys Week in Byron Bay during like Christmas.
*  I knew no speaking of knowing nobody.
*  I went to Australia on a one way ticket and knew nobody.
*  And so I was like, I'm fine.
*  One way ticket.
*  God, that's such a crazy move.
*  I told you 28. No, I was 30, 33.
*  I called it 33. Yeah.
*  And so three.
*  Yeah, I just went.
*  It was a I had been in L.A.
*  kind of grinding and I and I was like, if I don't travel now, I'm getting.
*  One way ticket is a wild move.
*  I do it a lot. Really? A lot.
*  Yeah, a lot. I'm kind of.
*  You have to figure out how to get back.
*  But imagine if COVID broke out right when you land.
*  I know. I was stuck in in India with seven dollars.
*  I had to have somebody like buy me a ticket out that that time.
*  An ex boyfriend. Thank you.
*  Oh, wow. Shut up, Casey.
*  Shout out to Casey.
*  Well, that's nice to get me out of India.
*  What did they do before?
*  Like in the old days.
*  India is basically like the old days when you travel there.
*  I mean, it's like you needed a ticket like the 70s.
*  Oh, I don't know.
*  I mean, what would you do?
*  My dad traveled around the world when he was in his 20s.
*  And I was like, how did you do it?
*  You know, he's like, oh, you know, we I went to talk to my parents for
*  they have no idea where you were. Right.
*  I mean, you have to just do everything by paper.
*  You look for bus schedules when you get there.
*  You know, you go find a hotel when you arrive in the city.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  How about hitchhikers like hitchhikers are the craziest asshole ever.
*  Like, let's just randomly hope this person who's just going to randomly pick me up.
*  Is he going to kill me? Yeah. Yeah.
*  And then you would read stories.
*  You read stories about this guy kidnapped this girl and cut her hands off.
*  Like, what? God, no. What the fuck?
*  That's my biggest. I'm I'm so afraid of of that.
*  I was like, that's always been in my most recent podcast.
*  I did every once in a while.
*  I do story hours where my cousin Maggie interviews me.
*  And I was telling all about my traveling and she was asking me.
*  And it turns out I like four near abduction stories that I completely forgot about.
*  But I have this I have that fear, but it's also been reinforced.
*  So when you join this cult, yeah, and they break you down, they say,
*  you're a scumbag. What's his accent like?
*  What was it like? It was a weird accent because he was from Italy originally.
*  Oh, and then how much of that cult was about banging a lot?
*  But I didn't I only had one cult boyfriend,
*  but he encouraged polyamory and I think my cult boyfriend saved me.
*  My cult boyfriend. I mean, why did he save you?
*  Well, because he was he had just come there to kind of recharge.
*  He was in getting his degree in philosophy and he had occasionally come
*  and he was a musician and then he left and went to Melbourne.
*  And then I went back into the city to drop him off.
*  And we weren't allowed to drink or anything.
*  And this is when I was still partying like a legend.
*  And and I got three bottles of wine
*  and I drank an entire bottle of wine in the park.
*  And then my friend came and took me back to the ashram
*  and I was hammered and I was crying and making a scene.
*  And he was like, what are you drinking?
*  And he said, do you have enough for the rest of everyone?
*  And so then everyone then he let everyone drink.
*  It was weird. Yeah.
*  Then it became like a it was a weird thing.
*  Started partying.
*  But then I was texting my I call him Sydney Trust, one boy.
*  I was like, get me the fuck out of here. I want to stake.
*  We it was during the playoffs.
*  And I think the Patriots were in.
*  And so I was breaking into bars up and down like Byron Bay to try and see the playoffs.
*  It was wild. That's what did they eat.
*  Oh, so we had to wake up at five and we didn't have we had a it was a wood grill.
*  We had a grill, but we put wood in it.
*  And that was how we got everything.
*  So everything we had to get a fucking fire started.
*  It was all vegan with some like if we got
*  cheese was like a treat and we would have to get the fire going to even like make coffee or porridge or anything.
*  And then we'd make lunch right after breakfast was done.
*  And then there was no dinner.
*  It's just like whatever is left over from lunch.
*  Really? So I didn't eat very well.
*  And we had to do four hours of work to stay on the ashram, like hard manual labor.
*  Four hours a day. Yeah.
*  Just for you. In the bush, in the Australian bush.
*  What kind of stuff?
*  Well, there was this Malaysian way of raking that was really interesting where we would mow.
*  But then you'd rake it all into a line and you'd have to put it in a tarp and take it all the way out of these fields.
*  And it was like a really interesting way of taking away all the scraps.
*  We had cold showers.
*  There were all kinds of bugs and shit trying to kill me all the time.
*  It was wild. It was a wild.
*  It was a wild experience.
*  And there was so much drama because everybody was swapping partners, like so much drama.
*  It's supposed to be this place where you go and meditate and get in touch.
*  And it was like as the teepee turned, it was just like nonstop.
*  Nonstop drama with like all that.
*  And he encouraged it and loved it.
*  And that's what's weird about these places is they use that to manipulate you into staying.
*  Oh, my God. Have you ever talked to Adam Eaget about his cult experience?
*  No. Yeah. You know, Adam from the Comedy Store.
*  He's the creative director of the Comedy Store.
*  He's coming on the podcast soon.
*  Oh, I love Adam. I love Adam, too.
*  Yeah. He's the best.
*  Yeah. He's he's got a crazy cult background.
*  No way. Yeah.
*  My friend Todd, who's a great guy, like not a cult member at all.
*  Just a super normal guy.
*  He watched the first episode of Wild, Wild Country.
*  And he was like, this looks great.
*  It's like they're having so much fun.
*  I go, I know, I know, but stay with it.
*  Stay with it. Because in the beginning, you're like, oh, yeah, like regular life is bullshit.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Like our society is bullshit.
*  Wouldn't it be great?
*  We just all loved each other.
*  We all embraced our fears and understood our position in the universe.
*  And we're kind to each other.
*  And and let go, let go of all this fear and all this bullshit.
*  And what better way to do it than to get a bunch of like minded people and move to a spot in Oregon?
*  Well, that was that in the piece I wrote about it.
*  I said I had a lot of conflicting feelings because it's amazing how quickly my
*  biorhythms adjusted to waking up at five or six, you know, living just the lack of waste.
*  We had the compostable toilets so that poor the poo became manure, you know, like manure.
*  This was the same on the weed farms, too.
*  And it's nice to just not feel like you're creating all that waste, because I know that every time
*  we get like a package from Amazon, I'm like, oh, this is not sustainable.
*  Right. It's always just it could be sustainable with hemp paper.
*  That's what's really crazy.
*  I mean, all this stuff could be fixed, all this chopping down of trees.
*  You could make some crazy number of like if you take 100 acres of hemp,
*  how much more paper you could get out of 100 acres of hemp and 100 acres of trees,
*  because you could regrow it every year.
*  Whereas if you regrown trees, you're not making paper out of those trees for years.
*  No, for years.
*  They got to grow and then you got to kill them in their prime.
*  Hemp is like the buffalo of plants.
*  It's nuts. It's not.
*  You can use every part of it.
*  My friend, Tom McCormick, said it's alien.
*  Yeah. And he's he's like a real marijuana wizard.
*  Like he really understands the history of it.
*  Yes. But if you look at the compounds of it, he goes, there's nothing like it on this planet.
*  And then if you pick up the stalk like he had a you remember Jack Herrer,
*  Jack Herrer was a guy who wrote The Emperor Wears No Clothes.
*  It was a book about his transition from being a goldwater Republican
*  to being like a pot evangelist.
*  Oh, OK. And I was very fortunate to meet him and know him.
*  But he had this this fucking it was either Todd or him had this stalk of hemp.
*  And it's it's like it feels like balsa wood.
*  It's so weird. Yeah.
*  But it's hard like this oak.
*  But it's it's the strangest plant.
*  Yeah, it is weird. Doesn't make any sense.
*  You're like, there's nothing like this. Yeah.
*  Everything that's hard, like if you have a piece of mahogany,
*  like it's heavy, but it's hard as fuck.
*  Like oak is heavy, but it's hard as fuck.
*  Hemp is hard as fuck. And it's light. Yeah, it's weird.
*  It's really weird. It makes the best paper.
*  You're fucked with hemp paper. You can't even rip it.
*  It's weird. It's I'm not because it has so much.
*  The fibers are so strong.
*  It's just a different kind of thing. Oh, I know.
*  Yeah. Well, we used to have to like break all the stalks at the end
*  when we tear the whole garden down at the end of the season.
*  And it was fun, but it was it was a lot of work.
*  And those plants definitely I loved working on the farms
*  because they just as far as not to sound all hippie, but it radiates love.
*  There's something in the garden just radiate love.
*  And I would love going in the morning when there was dew on the plants
*  and there'd be sun coming up.
*  And it was just so you could feel so much.
*  There's something special about them, for sure.
*  There's something going on.
*  You feel when you're next to them, especially if you go to a grow up
*  and there's like a bunch of them in the room.
*  There's a tangible difference you feel when you're in the room,
*  almost like you're around these little angels.
*  I know. Like you just love from like, yeah, you guys.
*  Real. Yeah. It feels so nice.
*  Yeah, it's it's good.
*  It's a shame sometimes that culture around it gets a little aggro,
*  like especially up in Humboldt.
*  It can be our humble is really weird because it's like it's
*  it's built on crime, essentially.
*  Yeah, it was an illegal business.
*  Agro it's like there's a kind of aggressive weed, bro type.
*  That is because the fact that was a crime.
*  So you get like, yeah, totem guns.
*  Yeah. And like there are V's and they're dry and humbled.
*  I mean, it's gorgeous up there, but it's definitely
*  compared to some of the more family operated places that I was on.
*  There was a whole different vibe and Humboldt.
*  And in that area, it was like, whoa, like the guns and the guards and the dogs
*  and the these people have been illegally operating out there forever.
*  But same with a lot of the other people that were kind of group.
*  I mean, the people I was working for, they were like third generation.
*  So they were like, oh, gee.
*  And and it was still very loving and family oriented.
*  And the whole vibe was very.
*  Gentle, it wasn't as like aggressive.
*  Did you ever watch the documentary, The Union?
*  No, the union is by my friend, Scott Scourgey and Adam Scourgey.
*  Sorry, Adam Scourgey has this.
*  I haven't seen him since like 2010 or something.
*  He had this documentary that he did about Vancouver
*  and about how Vancouver had this
*  underlying economy that was all weed based.
*  It's like the thing that was keeping like like you look at the economy,
*  if you look at the economy, like where's all the money coming from?
*  Oh, well, there's an industry.
*  We manufacture cars. We do this. We do that.
*  There was this whole section that was just weed.
*  And weed money. And it wasn't legal.
*  You know, he also did that the documentary, The Culture High,
*  which is another great movie on marijuana.
*  But The Union is all about this one particular area
*  where you see how intertwined pot growing is and how it's kind of accepted.
*  Yeah, it's still kind of illegal.
*  Yeah, yeah. That was the weird thing about it.
*  And they'll kind of 2000, you know, 2006 when it was shifting,
*  it was just that vibe of like it had been illegal.
*  And then it was in this weird gray area.
*  And it was still illegal even when I was working there.
*  But everyone was like, is that illegal?
*  Oh, my God. It's kind of a gray area.
*  Yeah, it's some legal to grow a certain amount medicinally.
*  And then by the time it became legal, here's a real problem.
*  The real problem.
*  Have you ever heard of what's going on with the cartels, cartels
*  growing weed and public land out here?
*  Oh, yeah, I've heard about this, like in the forest and stuff.
*  There's a guy named John Norris. He's been on the podcast before.
*  He was a game warden that when he signed up to be a game
*  warm game wardens because he's a guy who enjoys the outdoors.
*  Thought it'd be great.
*  You know, just going around, making sure everybody's following
*  the regulations, check your fishing license, that kind of stuff.
*  That's what he thought.
*  It turned out he had to run a fucking tactical unit to stop the cartels
*  from these grow ups and gunfights.
*  And they're using dogs, the sick dogs with a sick them on fucking cartel members.
*  It's crazy.
*  And it shows how it all starts for him that they found this one diverted stream.
*  And it was a very important stream for steelhead.
*  And these these fish were kind of fucked because the water had somehow
*  another been diverted and dried up.
*  So they thought, well, it's fine.
*  We'll follow this.
*  The stream get to the source of it.
*  And it's probably, you know, some, you know, some sort of an issue that we can solve.
*  Well, they get to the source of it and turns out there's a giant Mexican cartel
*  illegal grow out and they've they've diverted all this water.
*  And then on top of that, they're using super toxic pesticides.
*  Yeah, they don't use the poison to keep the animals from eating the leaves.
*  And then you get this poison that's in the fucking plant when you're selling it.
*  And he's like 90 percent of the places that are where the where marijuana is illegal.
*  And they're getting they're getting it from the cartels.
*  So they're getting this toxic spewed on weed and they're distributing
*  and they're growing it in California in all the state parks.
*  They're growing it in the national forest.
*  They're growing it in this public land.
*  They just they go out into the mountains.
*  I have a friend who found a camp like this at Tahoe Ranch.
*  They didn't know what to do.
*  They like, yeah, they like these are ranchers.
*  They stumbled upon all this this like piping and all this stuff.
*  And they're like, what in the fuck is this?
*  And then they found all these marijuana plants and they called the
*  I don't know what they call the sheriff's office or whatever.
*  And they came down towards it.
*  It's weird. I wonder how the illegal markets doing now that it's legal.
*  It's so they're still doing well.
*  Yes, it's not legal everywhere.
*  That's the point. And there's so much regulation.
*  So it should be legal everywhere.
*  Yeah, because all you're doing is propping up the Mexican cartels.
*  Do you see the shit that was happening in Sinaloa yesterday? No.
*  They have a gunfights in the streets. Oh, God.
*  The cartels are having gunfights in.
*  Go to Ed's manifesto, his Instagram page.
*  He's got this video where these people are hiding behind a wall
*  and you just watch and that that that that that that that that that that that that
*  that that that that that machine guns in the streets. Yeah.
*  And this is all because the cartels.
*  This is all in the cartels are pumped up because of what illegal drugs.
*  It's all that's their source of revenue.
*  Big marijuana is you always laugh when I say that.
*  But there is big weed.
*  And it's it's taking out a lot of the independent, you know, mom and pop growers.
*  It's like the Amazon of weed.
*  Yeah, well, I'm sure that's going to happen with everything that's worth money.
*  Right. Yeah. But I there I have I don't know.
*  I have mixed feelings about that, too, because in places where there's
*  this beautiful soil, they're paving over the soil and putting up like huge domes
*  where there's no ambient light.
*  And now you have light pollution in places because they're growing everything
*  indoor because you can control it, obviously.
*  So and you can keep the lights on all.
*  Yeah, it's like a fucking UFO just landed and all day and these like beautiful
*  woods with some of the best soil in America.
*  And I I definitely am the hippie in me is like, no,
*  we're going too far. Yeah.
*  But in their defense, that's how you make weed grow quicker.
*  Yeah, but doing it right.
*  I'm probably smoking some of that weed right now.
*  Probably, probably.
*  But you're also destroying an economy of local mom and pop growers.
*  Sloppy hippies should have planned for the future.
*  You should should have wrapped up your business years ago and hired guns,
*  armed guns.
*  So have you been baking bread?
*  No, Tom Papa has, though.
*  I know I was going to I got I got hooked.
*  I ate with my family.
*  We all ate the whole loaf in like two days.
*  I was going to bring you some, but I saw that I thought you were like
*  gluten free or some shit.
*  I'm mostly gluten gluten free.
*  Yeah. But when I can get some sourdough bread, I will eat the fuck out of it.
*  It doesn't seem to bother me.
*  There's something about sourdough.
*  I don't know if you know this, but also that there's less gluten in it.
*  Yeah. Way less.
*  I didn't know this. Yeah.
*  I can pull up why that is.
*  Why is there less gluten in sourdough?
*  It's been explained.
*  Do you know what it is? You know the answer?
*  I guess it's because he's using the heir heirloom flour
*  and he's only got three ingredients in there.
*  There's just less stuff in it.
*  Yeah. I mean, maybe because the heirloom flour.
*  But I also think there's a reason because of sourdough.
*  There's something about the process of sourdough.
*  Was Tom already baking?
*  He's been baking for years.
*  Oh, OK. Yeah, I definitely I was sick the first couple of weeks of the
*  lockdown. Oh, no.
*  Yeah. Worried. I was worried.
*  And I thought I had until your little not sure how accurate, but it's
*  what kind of cold symptoms you do.
*  I was sick. I had a fever and it would spike at night.
*  And my I did have like some chest shortness of breath and a cough that came.
*  But I kicked it.
*  But it was like it was hanging on.
*  So in that time, I couldn't work out and I was going crazy.
*  And it's got to be some kind of DNA thing.
*  What is the bread thing? Have you?
*  Delicious. No. But why?
*  You can't get flour anywhere.
*  It's like what do you mean?
*  Some kind of DNA thing?
*  What is it that everyone went on lockdown and it activated?
*  We must bake bread.
*  I've never experienced that.
*  That's what happened. There's a run on.
*  And you think it's the whole. Oh, no.
*  There's a run. You can't get flour.
*  There's a flower shortage staple like rice was.
*  I think it's like a DNA thing.
*  Well, toilet paper is a DNA thing, too.
*  That was the big.
*  No, but that just might be heard, you know, like sheep on this.
*  Well, Tom Green had a great analogy, a great theory on that.
*  He said, if you look at how big, how much space toilet paper takes up on the shelf,
*  he goes, it's a lot of space for like one roll of toilet paper, one
*  package of toilet paper.
*  And so they only can keep so much.
*  I was like, oh, that makes sense.
*  And then when people see it empty, then they panic.
*  I see toilet paper. They buy it and hoard it.
*  I was like, oh, because they've limited.
*  They've started limiting it now.
*  But yeah, I think my friend was just on the podcast.
*  He works at Nautical Theme Grocery Store.
*  And he was saying that he thinks that it's just like
*  I was asking him about the psychology behind this.
*  And he was saying he thinks that, you know, one person would take three.
*  And then the person standing next to them sees that and is like, oh, shit,
*  I need to take three.
*  And then that that person sees there's empty toilet paper shelves
*  and people are stocking up and then it just becomes this spiraling.
*  And then you start seeing it online.
*  And it became like a spiraling freak out.
*  There was a lot of logic.
*  There was a lot of freaking out.
*  It was weird. I freaked out in the beginning.
*  I was a little worried in the beginning
*  because I was worried that it was going to be as bad as they were saying.
*  And then as the numbers came in, especially the numbers of people
*  that weren't experiencing any symptoms and the numbers of people
*  that went through it and didn't even know they had ever had it.
*  And they tested positive because someone in their family had had it.
*  And yeah, yeah.
*  And they had the antibodies and it's like, wow, what is this fucking thing?
*  It's weird.
*  It's so it's like you're talking about a multitude of different diseases.
*  Yeah, it really is.
*  It's very different.
*  Have you been going crazy not being able to do stand up?
*  Where's all that energy going?
*  Well, I have been worried about you.
*  I just accept things.
*  I'm good at accepting things.
*  Yeah, I've learned how to do that in my life, you know.
*  This is just how it is.
*  Are you enjoying are you spending more time with the kids?
*  Yeah, I'm enjoying that. I'm enjoying that.
*  It's weird for them, though, because they have to do school online.
*  And it kind of sucks.
*  They're just not good at it.
*  It's not it doesn't feel like I sat in to watch one of them.
*  Like, this is so uninspiring.
*  Yeah. If I was a kid, first of all, I was a fuck up in school.
*  Yeah. If they ever did this to me while I was in high school,
*  I would have just quit school.
*  I would 100 percent quit school at 16.
*  If this was what was going on, I'd be like, well, the world's ending.
*  Why the fuck am I going to sit in front of a computer all day and listen to this
*  boby dork tell me what to do is fuck.
*  So I've been I've been, you know, weirded out,
*  but also enjoying the time together.
*  But then also very fortunate that I have this place.
*  I can come here. I work out here.
*  I can I can do a lot of stuff here.
*  I get to do podcasts still.
*  So I get to hang out with people like you.
*  Yeah. Good to hang out with my friends.
*  Have a good time.
*  But for sure, I miss stand up.
*  And I just I don't like the idea that these bureaucrats get to tell us
*  what to do and what not to do. I don't like it.
*  It's not what's that going to look like when what are they planning on doing
*  when they open up? Is it going to be limited seating?
*  I mean, how do you how are you going to go to your on your tours?
*  I'm at the I'm at the forum November 1st.
*  It's almost OK.
*  And it's like that's that's just going to be like me and a mannequin
*  on either side of me.
*  I'm like, what am I going to do?
*  That's a real show that I have in L.A.
*  That's the biggest show that I have in L.A. Right.
*  It's like 9000 people like that.
*  Is that possible? I don't even know yet.
*  I don't know.
*  I think you should let people make a choice for themselves, make them get tested.
*  And there should be a place like, you know, how you sign up to vote is
*  you should be able to sign up to get tested.
*  I don't want something that tracks you where you carry it on your phone.
*  No, no, I don't want it like a like a ticket.
*  You know how you have like if you get an electronic ticket,
*  you get that ticket and you can bring it to they scan your ticket
*  and then you can get on board a plane. Right. Yeah.
*  Why don't they do that with testing?
*  They can do that with testing.
*  And so if you want to go somewhere like you want to go to a concert, scan it.
*  Is it valid? It's two days ago. OK.
*  And have you left your house?
*  They've been doing it for two days.
*  No, but at least it would help.
*  The number one thing that we need to concentrate on is the number one thing
*  that you don't hear a goddamn peep about.
*  And that's nutrition and health. Yeah.
*  Those are the things.
*  Stress, managing your stress.
*  This is how to meditate.
*  You fucks take some of those taxpayer money and set up.
*  Take some of that tax money and set up some sort of an online resource
*  that can show people how they can improve their immune system. Yeah.
*  Show that you have a little meditation courses. You fucks.
*  Do you think that people are
*  becoming more succumbing to bad habits or improving themselves?
*  I would think it's both.
*  I mean, yeah, you can't generalize because people handle things.
*  Some people have been amazing through this. Right.
*  And some people I've become bigger fans of because the way they've handled this.
*  And then some people that I can't talk to them like you fucking pussy.
*  You're falling apart. Yeah.
*  Like I know people that are scared to go outside. Yeah.
*  Like they don't want to do anything. Yeah.
*  They don't want to go in. I hear it's worse than they say.
*  Where it's worse than they're telling us.
*  Where are they getting that information?
*  It's more attractive to them than the opposite.
*  But can they afford for it to be attractive?
*  Some of them? Yes. I'm talking about some of them are wealthy people.
*  Because I know people who have both fears.
*  They might be not healthy, but they're also poor.
*  And they're more afraid of being poor at that.
*  You know, they're they're trying to balance these things like I need to still go to work
*  because I can't. Yeah.
*  Well, here's a fake narrative that it's either money or lives.
*  Right. That's a fake narrative.
*  And this is why it's a fake narrative.
*  If the economy collapses, the deeper it collapses, the more lives it's going to cost.
*  And that's a fact.
*  Does it? These are this is a real statistic.
*  Like you can you can actually measure this the way the economy goes.
*  You will correspondingly you will see a loss of life.
*  So economy goes down.
*  If there's more depression, there's more drug addiction.
*  If there's more suicide, you will see a loss of life that's directly attributable
*  to the way people respond to the economy collapse.
*  Is that factual?
*  Yes. I mean, I definitely.
*  Bloomberg had a report on it.
*  And if you could, you could there's there's an equation like in how the economy dips,
*  you'll see a corresponding loss of life due to suicide, corresponding loss of life due
*  to drug addiction and overdose.
*  There's look, depression is for sure.
*  It takes in a lot of factors.
*  Some people have it just genetically.
*  Some people have it because of the circumstance.
*  As your circumstance erodes, it's much more likely that you're going to be depressed.
*  Oh, I agree. I just I remember reading an article that kind of pushed back on this.
*  There there were all these statistics and studies done after the Great Depression.
*  And actually, it weirdly kicked in people's resilience.
*  But listen, what you said after the Great Depression.
*  Right. So everything falls apart and it kicks in people's resilience and the people that
*  survive are the ones that you can look at the actual studies, because I'm not sure when
*  it started counting the lives that were lost.
*  My grandparents went through the depression and I used to talk to them about it.
*  And when my grandmother died, one of the things they found little coffee cans filled with
*  money all over the house.
*  Yeah. Dollars and change.
*  Store them in all different places.
*  They were terrified. They were terrified of things going south.
*  Yeah. I mean, I've been poor for so long in terms of being freelance writer and always
*  I do a weird thing where I don't invoice and all of my editors are like, we owe you
*  money. But it's that psychological like, oh, I have money there and I store it all over
*  my house. I have money everywhere.
*  Just like loose change and dollars.
*  And because I have that scarcity fear always.
*  I take things way farther.
*  My fear is that money won't be worth anything.
*  Right. That's my fear.
*  Yeah. You know, when someone says, oh, you should be saying you have gold bricks at
*  home. No guns.
*  And I know how to hunt. Yeah, that's what I'm worried about.
*  Like legitimately worried about not having food.
*  I have water purification tablets.
*  I have pumps that I can pump creek water and get it to the point where my kids can drink
*  it. That's what I'm worried about.
*  Right. Like legitimately.
*  Well, then you're probably that's a real fear that people should have.
*  I have that fear.
*  Many people are starting to understand that it's people like you and me and everybody
*  else are responsible for the food chain.
*  OK, this this food supply chain, this food supply is not permanent.
*  It's not just going to stay there.
*  And all these ranchers that have been struggling to pay their bills, struggling.
*  Now they're fucked.
*  We treat our farmers like such shittness.
*  I feel like it's well, we're not aware because we're not near them.
*  Right. And that's what I think.
*  Even my friend who I interviewed, he was saying people are thanking him for his
*  service and he hates it at the nautical grocery store.
*  And he was.
*  But I think that it's people who have never even had to consider the food supply
*  chain are considering it.
*  Right. And they're suddenly like, oh, my God, thank you.
*  Remember how they were really pumped about firemen?
*  Yeah. After 9-11.
*  Yeah. People who generally don't get who provide a service and just kind of go fly
*  under the radar. Yeah.
*  But yet I don't I don't think people consider much where their food comes from or how
*  it even gets on the shelves.
*  They're definitely doing it more so now.
*  And there's also a lot of people are inquiring about hunting.
*  They're looking into it. There's a uptick in searches and I get questions about
*  gardening, hunting and prepping.
*  You know, as we like I think those people are out of their fucking minds now because
*  I used to consider like, oh, well, if there's a natural disaster, like if Yellowstone
*  blows, you really want to be right next to it.
*  Fuck this. Yeah, we're close.
*  You don't want to be surviving nuclear winter when everything becomes fucking
*  horrible, gray sky, wasteland and everyone's freezing and choking.
*  It's not good.
*  And that's that's what's happened to human beings before.
*  And there was a point in time where we've done this so many times, whatever the
*  volcano was, there was a super volcano that blew somewhere around 60, 70,000 years ago.
*  I forget where it was. Was it Indonesia?
*  Yes. And it killed most of the people on the planet.
*  Oh, wow. Most of the people we got down to a few thousand people.
*  That was like 70,000 years ago.
*  Wow. It's really nuts.
*  Yeah, that's crazy. This has happened many times.
*  It's just these things happen.
*  That just don't happen enough where they happen during our lifetime.
*  We say, oh, that's the thing we have to worry about.
*  So now we've experienced a real global pandemic during our lifetime.
*  It's a little like now this is something we know we have to worry about.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's it's a I it's a little bit light, like it's pandemic light.
*  It's certainly not like the 1918.
*  Not even close. But look how we're reacting.
*  Right. We're reacting like it is.
*  Which I think was precautionary.
*  But it's still going on.
*  That doesn't make any sense.
*  I know. Now they're asking people to rat people out if you're you're fucking
*  opening up your business.
*  This is Gestapo.
*  Yeah, it's what's always worried is are we the frog in the boiling water where
*  at a certain point you say, hey, everybody self locked down and don't work.
*  And everyone's like, yeah, I'm not stoked about it, but OK, I'll do that for my
*  fellow man. And then a couple of months go by and the numbers come in and you're
*  seeing, you know, you're not seeing the outbreak in Florida from the spring breakers.
*  You're not seeing they they're well, they've been open now.
*  Yeah, I was just there. I flew to Florida last week for the UFC.
*  Yeah. Saturday night I flew in.
*  And so they're just.
*  I went to a restaurant, Bridget sat down, had a steak, had a glass of wine.
*  My friend Eddie Bravo sat down, ate together like gentlemen.
*  That like doesn't look weird when you see it.
*  And it was strange at the restaurant because it was like us.
*  And then this other older couple walked in.
*  There was maybe one other couple towards the front and a couple of young people at
*  the bar, fairly sparse.
*  All the waiters had face masks on.
*  Yeah, we ate. We ate dinner.
*  But now the conspiracy theorist to me is like, now they're going to see how far
*  they can fucking push it.
*  Well, I don't think that's a conspiracy theory.
*  I think that is just like your cult friend that was calling you a scumbag and trying
*  to break you down. Yeah.
*  When you're in a position of power, there's like there's there's an archetype
*  of a person in a position of power and then all the potential things that can go
*  wrong when a person's in a position of power.
*  All the abuses of that power.
*  I mean, they're they're documented right throughout history.
*  But this is one of them control.
*  I'm telling you what to do. You want more rights.
*  You want to get your rights back. Well, daddy says you got to put your mask on,
*  even though it doesn't make sense.
*  It's like we're all grounded. But here's the thing.
*  It's it's not like things are getting worse, but their grip is getting tighter.
*  Right. Yeah. That's what is deeply.
*  Rights are generally not given back once they're taken.
*  Exactly. And that's what the problem is.
*  And this is what the problem when people want to talk about like Marxism,
*  and all the positive benefits of socialism, it'd be great if everybody like
*  helped all the people that weren't doing so well and chipped on in.
*  And it would be great.
*  But the problem with the big state, the big government is what you're seeing now.
*  Yeah. Regular people making shit decisions.
*  Yeah. Regular people like Gavin Newsom is a person.
*  Yeah. He's not a genius.
*  He's not a wizard. He's not from another planet.
*  He's a human being who grew up in the United States of America.
*  And he has this incredible amount of power over 40 million people in the state.
*  And he's deciding we're going to go stage step one.
*  And you're going to be go outside and look at the sunset.
*  You can do yoga. Don't go near anybody.
*  You can you can golf. No cart.
*  And he's got masks.
*  And they put this fucking list of shit that you can do and you can't do.
*  And then they get to tell people they get to tell you not yet.
*  Not yet. We're going to open up a little bit on May 15th.
*  OK, a little bit, a little bit. What we do.
*  You can go to the beach now, but don't sit down.
*  Yeah, you can't freaking sit down.
*  You can't tell people what to do like that.
*  You know, it doesn't make sense.
*  This is what you tell people.
*  Please be cautious.
*  Please use social distancing.
*  Let's be smart.
*  Let's take care of our vulnerable, vulnerable, vulnerable people.
*  And let's take care of our health.
*  Let's take care of our bodies to eat correct.
*  This is a good opportunity for you to cut all the bullshit out of your diet.
*  Stop eating so much sugar.
*  Stop drinking so much. Stop smoking cigarettes.
*  This is a good time to work on your health, because what you're seeing
*  across the board is vulnerable people that are getting really sick from this,
*  whether they're vulnerable because they have underlying health conditions
*  or they were stressed out or their hospital workers.
*  They're vulnerable because they're getting this massive viral load.
*  Right. All these people.
*  Viral load sounds so dirty.
*  No, it just sounds so dirty.
*  Every time I hear it, I'm like, you get it in sperm.
*  Like COVID is in sperm.
*  So that's a real viral load.
*  That is viral.
*  Every time I hear it, I'm like, that's the dirtiest term, but I love it.
*  Have you seen the prisoners given each other?
*  Oh, I saw that video.
*  That crazy. I never know what's real, though.
*  I always have to like fact check and go find and see if the video is real and go.
*  Which everyone should be doing, by the way.
*  Most people are. I don't either.
*  I see it. I'm like, yeah.
*  And then I'm like, easy, Bridget.
*  Settle that. I know. Let's look at this one carefully.
*  This one this one confirms a lot of your biases.
*  You might want to double check when you find out that prisoners
*  getting released that are even like sex offenders, like violent sex offenders
*  and they're putting like a hairdresser jail.
*  But it's it's so crazy.
*  Like, oh, you might get a cough.
*  We're going to have to let you go.
*  Don't rape any kids while you're out there.
*  Knucklehead. You're supposed to be in jail.
*  Supposed to be in jail for 30 years.
*  We're going to let you out because we don't want you to get a cough.
*  Yeah, I don't. All of it.
*  Again, I come back to trying to stay optimistic
*  in the face of conditions that feel like they're rapidly deteriorating.
*  No, it is. But you don't even get high.
*  That's the problem.
*  You you have to stay sober.
*  It's not for you. It is for me.
*  I picked the worst fucking decade to get sober ever.
*  I mean, what an idiot.
*  I got sober in 2013, which means I got sober right before Trump
*  started running and now through a fucking pandemic.
*  But honestly, I I have been able to.
*  I'm actually grateful because how much the alcohol consumption is up.
*  If any indication of how much bread I've been eating
*  is how much weed and beer and alcohol I'd be consuming,
*  I would be in the hospital with cirrhosis of the liver.
*  Yeah, you're you're becoming you're just using that the bread.
*  Not really. I mean, I I like it because it's a challenge
*  because it's really fucking hard to make.
*  Making sourdough bread.
*  Making it is a fucking challenge.
*  No, what is it?
*  Hey, look up how many people are
*  how much alcohol consumption is up.
*  Where where though?
*  Just overall United States alcohol consumption down in restaurants and bars, though.
*  Yeah, I know. That's the problem.
*  It's actually up, even though everyone's drinking alone.
*  Listen, just Google it. You know, but I'm trying like I don't.
*  I got to figure out what to Google.
*  How about Google?
*  Google alcohol consumption up during pandemic,
*  because someone was telling me this and it can't be true.
*  Like at houses within houses or like from grocery stores or like
*  just overall alcohol consumption.
*  Just Google alcohol consumption up during pandemic,
*  because what he was telling me is he goes, listen to this.
*  Bars are closed, right?
*  Because alcohol consumption is way up.
*  Yes. Think about that. Yeah.
*  And I don't know.
*  I don't know how he knows it.
*  Have you seen this person that would know that?
*  Have you seen the like Zoom happy hours?
*  Oh, the people get hammered on Zoom.
*  Those things I would I would rather die
*  than get hammered with a bunch of people on Zoom.
*  I I'm like drink alone like a fucking real man.
*  Don't do this happy hour.
*  I don't know. I get it.
*  Drink alone like a fucking real man.
*  But seriously, I think Jamie, the first Forbes opinion article says
*  there's a survey that was taken of 2000 adults that says 16 percent
*  were drinking more, 19 percent drinking less.
*  Yeah. I don't know where they're getting the numbers.
*  Yeah. It's a lot to.
*  His statistic was much higher than that.
*  It was like in the high 30s, 30 percent increase in alcohol
*  consumption during the pandemic.
*  Yeah, because everybody's day drinking.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  There is that meme that was going around.
*  That was hilarious.
*  Like pray for the teachers next year who are going to have kids coming in
*  who have been taught by their moms who have been or their parents
*  who have been day drinking like their parents.
*  I have been day drinking, but I've been drinking wine.
*  I drink wine every night.
*  I have a glass of wine.
*  You you pretty are a pretty moderate drinker anyway, though.
*  Yes. Yeah.
*  I'll go off the rails a couple of times a year,
*  especially on Fight Companions.
*  When we do these fight, I guess that's probably the hardest I drink ever.
*  We get hammered.
*  Here's the best statistic I've ever.
*  It doesn't mean that doesn't mean much off premises.
*  Alcohol sales off premises, alcohol sales were up 55 percent
*  in the third week of March this year.
*  OK, well, that makes sense because people are drinking at home.
*  But I wonder if like overall says, while most people in the United States
*  remain stuck at home during COVID-19 pandemic, many are increasing
*  their alcohol purchases and likely their consumption.
*  No, they're just stockpiling it and using it for hand sanitizer.
*  According to the data reported by Nielsen, an international measurement
*  of the data analytics company.
*  So up 55 percent off premise, alcohol sales were up 55 percent.
*  So I wonder what that means in terms of overall, like what percentage
*  of alcohol sales were done in bars and restaurants and what percentage was?
*  I guess that's what off premises.
*  Yeah, you would have to really know what that would be.
*  Yeah, you'd have to know how much alcohol was sold to the restaurants.
*  And then all that's hard to find because it's usually through.
*  It's not like a retail. You're getting it right.
*  Fifty five percent a big number, though. Yeah, that's big.
*  But I think a lot of I mean.
*  I don't know if I if I was drinking, I'd be drinking a lot.
*  I can tell you that all my this is what the reason I brought it up is
*  the friends that I have were like, you know, they would maybe have a glass
*  one a night. Now they're going through a bottle or two every night.
*  That was my normal. But yeah, this is fill out.
*  Yeah, I was getting thick. Yeah, I was.
*  I definitely the first, you know, like I was saying the first three weeks,
*  I was kind of sick.
*  So I started baking bread because I needed a challenge because I couldn't work out.
*  And man, that like Warren, the covid-19 is real.
*  Now I have another now I have another challenge.
*  The bread baking. No, now I can.
*  And now I have to lose the covid-19 that I gave.
*  Oh, the covid-19 pounds.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Brad will put it on you.
*  Are you noticing like not doing anything and not moving?
*  I think there was like three weeks where I was like, you took seven steps.
*  Just staying at home.
*  Just do you exercise equipment at home?
*  Do you have? I do. Yeah.
*  And so my sisters and I have been doing this has been fun.
*  We've been doing we call it something is better than nothing
*  because all of us the first couple of weeks were just off the rails
*  with the like sweets and my other sister is baking.
*  And she's like, I need to dial it back.
*  So we started doing workout videos to.
*  But we to hold each other accountable, we zoom.
*  And so then we share the screen.
*  And it's so fun.
*  I mean, I wish I could record.
*  My sisters are hilarious.
*  Why is that OK?
*  But it's not OK to drink on.
*  It's fine to drink on Zoom.
*  I just don't I can't admit.
*  So here's my issue.
*  It's hard enough for me to work out and because you can see yourself on Zoom.
*  So it's that's already I'm fine with that.
*  I'm used to going to a gym and seeing myself in a mirror and working out in a class.
*  I'm not used to seeing myself drinking while I drink.
*  And so the idea of being on a Zoom with people and being able
*  to see my little square head getting wasted.
*  But you're not supposed to look at you.
*  You're supposed to look at. No, I know.
*  But you're still able to see yourself.
*  I'm just going to put a little I don't know.
*  Do you know amongst your friends, are people ramping up their
*  alcohol consumption, the people that you know that drink?
*  Yes and no.
*  But I was on a family.
*  I'm on a family.
*  Like, it's funny in the beginning, everyone's like, we're going to have these
*  like group texts, we're going to keep each other sane.
*  And like after three weeks, there's just nobody here.
*  You never know what keeps it together after a month.
*  A month is like where everybody starts going off the rails.
*  Well, and it's funny because everybody just started.
*  Everyone adjusted and they were back in their own lives.
*  But it was mostly just us sharing memes of the guy with the big deck.
*  And, you know, like all the funny memes that were going around.
*  But my it was like family members, cousins.
*  Like I said, I have a huge family.
*  So cousins were all around the same age.
*  And it was like all of them sharing their booze supplies
*  because they were afraid that like the stores are going to be shut.
*  And definitely that's how a lot of my friends were talking about it, too.
*  They were worried that they wouldn't be able to get booze.
*  They would have to go through this sober.
*  Yeah. And I think you find that, Jamie, your friends are
*  friends your age getting hammered.
*  No, no. Same age.
*  I don't think so.
*  No more. I mean, probably smoking a little more weed, but.
*  So do you think it's like an older suburban thing?
*  Like, no, they're always drinking.
*  Like the wine moms are just still more.
*  They're just maybe more.
*  I think they're going.
*  But I'm trying to think it was a generational thing.
*  Like how are like kids in their 20s handling that?
*  They're not getting drunk every day.
*  I don't know.
*  They're probably more pliable, too.
*  They have less to lose.
*  So all this shit's going down like, dude, I was.
*  So when my nephew, it was his first year of college, and now he's back at home
*  and he's great, he's like super active.
*  And but if I was like a 20 year old
*  who wasn't in college and was back in my parents basement,
*  I would I was partying when I was like 17.
*  I would be really worried about the future, though.
*  Wouldn't you be worried about the future if you're 20 and you saw this?
*  I don't know. It's funny because either either my nephew is just like a badass
*  or super resilient, but he just he's like, it's fine.
*  He might be a moron. He's not sure.
*  He is.
*  He's not sure if he's going to go back to college because they want to pay for,
*  you know, well, that's the kid with my kids school, too.
*  My kids go to private school.
*  I'm going to pay for all the money to have a lazy teacher
*  socially distanced to you. No way.
*  He's like, I'm not taking on this.
*  But here's the thing.
*  The death rate between kids is so fucking low.
*  It's crazy. Yeah. So low.
*  Yeah. Talking about all the way up in the college.
*  The death rate is so small. Yeah.
*  That it doesn't make any sense to keep them out of school.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  I think a lot of the you know, I think Alabama and all those colleges
*  were talking about how they were going back.
*  I'm pretty sure they really teach down there.
*  It's football. They've got to get the college football going.
*  Yeah, that is a thing, right?
*  What are they going to do with these stadiums?
*  They're going to be filled with people.
*  I don't think they're going to allow that.
*  I don't know.
*  I've Fox says there's been speculation on for the NFL that they're going to pump in,
*  I think, probably just for the people watching.
*  But crowd noise and fans, fake fans.
*  No, no, no, no, you can't.
*  I'm going to go out.
*  This is still four months ahead.
*  I'm going to go to a Joe Rogan show and it's going to be canned laughter
*  pumped into the stadium.
*  Canned laughter and a few fake.
*  Who was saying this?
*  Who's like Fox, I think?
*  Oh, that is so dumb.
*  That's that would be so offensive.
*  That's just preparing us for this new world.
*  What's the new world, Joe?
*  I don't know.
*  What is it?
*  The social distancing that we're all in the matrix.
*  There's no reality.
*  Are they just trying to get us to be in our house and like order?
*  Is this I was joking that this is like a plot by Amazon and Netflix
*  just got us all inside.
*  I was joking. This is a plot from a I to get us to some
*  to like symbiotic, the symbiotic relationship that's inevitable
*  that where human beings are going to merge with some form of technology.
*  It's already happened with things you carry around, like your phone
*  or your glasses or something that someone's made that you can't live without.
*  That makes your life better.
*  Yeah, it's eventually going to be a part of you.
*  It's going to get inside. Yeah.
*  And once that gets inside of you, you're going to want it to get,
*  you know, be more and more and more immersed in that world.
*  And some people are like, man, I don't want that.
*  I want to live in the real world.
*  I want to be able to go to the lake.
*  I want to be able to hug people and touch people.
*  Well, what better way to stop that shit from taking place?
*  You can't go anywhere.
*  You got to stay inside.
*  So all your world is virtual.
*  You can't come near anybody because they might kill you with their fucking spit.
*  Do you think that people will put up with that, though?
*  I mean, is this how America breaks breaks up?
*  Is this as it does it become the the pro open and pro closed states?
*  And then we just divorce.
*  Well, this is what's happening.
*  Yeah, it's right. It's right wing, left wing.
*  Left wing people want the government to take care of everything.
*  They want everybody to get checks and they want everybody to stay home forever
*  until there's a cure. It's not going to be a cure.
*  This is something that's going to be around.
*  And we might have herd immunity and might be able to wipe it out that way.
*  This is not something that they can just spray away or inject away. Right.
*  So this is something will hopefully one day they'll have some sort of real
*  treatment, whether it's a vaccine or whatever it is.
*  We're probably going to have to take a vaccine every couple of years or every year.
*  Yeah, it's not none of this is good.
*  I mean, you take the you get the flu shot if you get it.
*  And it's not going to keep you from getting the flu.
*  There's still other strains that are out there.
*  But it helps you even if you do get those strains that aren't the strain.
*  Exactly. Then there's herd immunity, right?
*  Where more than 60 percent of the people get it and the virus sort of dies off.
*  That's that's a that's a positive possibility in the future.
*  But there's people that want to get back to work.
*  And there's people that don't want anyone to go anywhere.
*  And those and it's become this sort of, again, this ideological battleground
*  where the people that want to go back to work, you're putting dollars over money.
*  You know, like one of someone said, you're going to be the richest man,
*  the cemetery to Elon Musk, because he wants to open up his factory.
*  Like what are you talking about?
*  Like, are we going to be to stay home forever?
*  We're going to be scared of everything.
*  Why would you drive when you know how many people die in driving accidents?
*  Stay home. Don't do anything.
*  And I think this is put, you know, the.
*  We make these calculations all the time
*  about how many people is it acceptable to die?
*  It's just not so in our face.
*  For instance, with opioids or the OPE,
*  if you're using these to help people manage pain,
*  but you know a certain amount of people might become addicted or die.
*  There's all kinds of tradeoffs that we're making driving another good example.
*  So we're constantly making these cost benefit analysis in our society.
*  It's just not usually you have to make it.
*  Now it's like you have to be part of the person who's saying, am I going to be?
*  But it's also there's so much false information or confusing information.
*  And I don't again, I come back to what we started talking about.
*  I don't know that a lot of people know who to believe.
*  And if you just believe your tribe, it's much easier.
*  I think if I was just like gobbling up all the CNN or gobbling up all the Fox,
*  I would be happy little frickin no nihilism, Bridget.
*  Or you'd be angry wanting to overthrow the government, not wanting to,
*  you know, get things back to the way things used to be.
*  Or I'd be terrified and not leaving my house because I was worried that I was
*  going to get.
*  There's all those, all those things.
*  But if you just look at the raw numbers and this doesn't discount any of the
*  deaths, doesn't discount the tragedy. I know people are, but my grandma,
*  but my friend, I knew a guy, I knew a guy. He was young.
*  Everybody knows a guy. You're right.
*  But if you just look at the overall numbers,
*  this is not what we thought it was going to be. It's really simple.
*  And this is why you want to move.
*  Yeah. I don't like that. They're telling me that you have to stay home.
*  I don't like that. They're telling me you have to wear a mask when you go
*  outside. No, if I'm around people and you want me to wear a mask in a business
*  or something like that. Okay. Yeah. I'm fine with that.
*  Until everything settles down, we figure this out. Okay.
*  You can't tell me I leave the house. I have to put a mask on.
*  What about if I walk around in my backyard? Do I have to have a mask?
*  What does that mean? I mean, yeah, if I'm running on a trail,
*  I have to run on a trail with a mask on the fuck out of here.
*  And your ideal way to transition back.
*  What would it be? What would it look like?
*  People take risks. Let people do what they want to do, but educate them,
*  educate them in terms of their immune system, educate them in terms of like,
*  here's where it could go bad. This is why you need to wash your hands.
*  Like one of the things I said is that women were getting it less than men.
*  And people are like, why? I'm like, cause we're gross. We don't wash.
*  We're fucking disgusting.
*  So guys are picking their nose after they're touching a faucet and other people
*  touched it. And is that why they're getting it more?
*  Could be a bunch of factors, but I would guarantee that one of them is that men
*  are gross.
*  Yes. Men are gross.
*  Yeah. I guarantee you that has to play some sort of a part in it.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's been somebody,
*  I think I'm a writer. I forgot her name. Megan, someone, she had a tweet.
*  She said it's a black, it's a black light. No, it's a, yeah,
*  it's a black light on like the sperm filled hotel room, basically the pandemic.
*  It's just revealed like all of these institutional failures and all of the
*  structural failures and all of the ideological battleground is up to 11 now.
*  And I find that most people are wrestling and don't know what they're doing.
*  Really what to do.
*  But I think most people are grown up enough to want to be able to take that
*  risk for themselves. I walk around and I see all these businesses.
*  I'm like, how are these businesses going to come back?
*  They're not going to lose like 40% of them. Look,
*  I think we you gotta let people make their own decisions.
*  And the decision you've already made has already cost something.
*  It's cost businesses. It's cost a lot.
*  It's cost a lot of people's livelihoods.
*  So it's not like there's no loss here. There's a loss here.
*  And if you don't think there's a loss of life,
*  talk to people that are that are dealing with suicide. Talk to them.
*  I know a guy who talked to this sheriff and he was saying that they used to have,
*  I do. Everyone does. Everyone.
*  They were saying that he used to deal with one suicide a week.
*  Now he's dealing with five a day. Wow. Really? Yes. Holy shit. Yeah.
*  That seems like it should be a bigger story. But it is a big story,
*  but it's just not being talked about because the narrative is always stay or
*  safer, stay at home, this and that. And this is crazy.
*  We went down. There's a lot. There's a real loss.
*  It comes with your business going away. It's not, it's not just loss of life.
*  It's loss of business, loss of livelihood.
*  And that could lead to loss of life. Yeah. And it's going to last for years.
*  It was creepy. I was texting me the pictures of the phosphorescent, you know,
*  it was, it was amazing. And we're going to tell people,
*  they can't go look at nature. And so I think it was Cinco de Mayo.
*  We went down and everybody was out. It was so many people. There were no cops.
*  I couldn't believe it. It was, I was like, yeah, I was going to do. Yeah.
*  So tell people get off the beach. Yeah. That's so, so that night,
*  everyone's wearing masks. Everyone's responsible, socially distancing.
*  It was fine. It was really cool. It was chill.
*  You could tell everyone's going crazy. So crazy.
*  People were partying because it was Cinco de Mayo. It was awesome. I'm like,
*  yeah, good job, California.
*  I went down the next day and it appears the word had got out and they had turned
*  the Ferris wheel down at the pier into like a weird, creepy dystopia message.
*  It was just like, Hey, support our cert, our healthcare workers.
*  And then there was a red cross and the Ferris wheel and the police were there.
*  And they were like, everyone off the beach, the beaches are closed.
*  We will cite you. And no, to the people's credit,
*  no one gave a fuck and didn't move,
*  but they were driving up and down and telling everybody.
*  But it was a creepy vibe with the like Ferris wheel and the messaging that had
*  totally changed overnight.
*  I'll go to the hospitals out here. They're empty. Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's a real problem. Hospitals are going bankrupt.
*  I know. I know. And, and there's,
*  I read a thing about how college might go bankrupt too.
*  So I don't know how the schools are going to stay afloat.
*  A lot of private schools that are charging exorbitant rates and expect people to
*  do that shit in front of a computer. They're going to go under. Yeah.
*  They're going to go under. But I mean, again, you at least have a platform.
*  You can talk about this and, and an audience that you hear from and what,
*  what's the general.
*  There's a certain percentage of people that are cowards and they just want to
*  trust in the government and let the government make these decisions.
*  They're doing this with sound science and no, but they're not, but they're not.
*  If they were, I'd be like, okay, I get it. Cause I was like, okay,
*  I get it in the beginning. I didn't protest it in the beginning.
*  I canceled gigs. I backed off. I said, I think they're trying to save us.
*  But then when you get the science in, when you get the actual numbers in,
*  you're like, no, this is way different than they thought.
*  They thought it was going to be hundreds of thousands dead in California alone.
*  No, it's a thousand people, 1800 people, whatever it is.
*  Do you think it'll be worse than average age of people die?
*  This is older than the average age. Yeah. It's like 85 plus.
*  The average age people die of this is older than the average age people die.
*  Yeah. Like what I'm worried about Joe Biden. He's got no chance.
*  This is my other question for you while I'm here.
*  What do you think about that? You were Bernie bra, right?
*  I like what I like, what Bernie stood for.
*  I like the ideas that he stood for. This is what I like.
*  I like the ideas of helping the people that are downtrodden,
*  helping communities that are hurt, making it so that college is free for people.
*  You don't have to be financially in debt,
*  hundreds of thousands of dollars when you graduate from college.
*  We can take our tax money and put it in good things.
*  That's what I like about what Bernie stood for.
*  OK, what I like about him is this health care issue that we're dealing with right now.
*  I mean, would it be great if people didn't have to worry about going bankrupt if they get sick?
*  This is what I like about Bernie Sanders. Yeah. All those things.
*  And that's what he stood for that made sense to me.
*  I was like, let's try this. Right.
*  It seems like this is a move towards compassion.
*  I just wonder how feasible those plans were.
*  But a lot of people say they're not feasible at all.
*  I was like, let's see. Let's see. Let's see.
*  I don't know that.
*  You know, the idea is like socialism never worked.
*  But the way he describes it is democratic socialism.
*  He doesn't describe it as a socialism where you're thinking about some sort of military
*  dictatorship like North Korea or something. Right. China.
*  It's not it's not the same thing.
*  And when you equate those two, that's when people get weird.
*  But the problem is, whenever people get in the kind of position of power
*  where they have this big government machine and they control over people, they abuse it.
*  Yeah. I mean, that's the problem is you.
*  I don't know. Our health care system sucks.
*  But I don't know that I trust the government to make it better
*  because there's nothing that they do that they do very well.
*  No, there's not one thing.
*  Well, they well, they're really good at the post office.
*  The post office is awesome.
*  Yeah, post office is one of the best.
*  And, you know, some things are social.
*  I like the National Parks. Yeah.
*  Yeah, I'm all for the National Parks. Yeah.
*  But other than that, there's I don't know that I would want.
*  I think that the health care thing drives me crazy because I don't.
*  Again, I just feel hopelessly dumb.
*  And it's such a huge, massive problem.
*  And it causes me and so many people I know, you know, debt and problems.
*  And it's not fair to you shouldn't.
*  I don't understand why it's tied up with your job.
*  Like, that seems like a really silly idea that makes no sense to me. Right.
*  And if you do have a nationalized health care system,
*  what do you do about people that abuse their body?
*  What do you do? What do you do about them?
*  It's just so many. Yeah.
*  They'll let them cost more money than anybody else anyway.
*  Even in private. Right. What do you do?
*  What do you do if people just want to keep eating until they explode?
*  What do you do? I don't know.
*  You say, well, all our tax money is going to go to you.
*  No, because we have to keep you alive.
*  But that's why I understand.
*  I understand from a heart perspective.
*  You know, I think when I when I was I was reading this stuff
*  that I wrote when I was like 24 and I was a waitress and I was like, holy shit.
*  I was AOC. Like, I sound like AOC.
*  I was fucking outraged.
*  And when you're a bartender, you're always seeing like the downtrodden.
*  And you don't. And as a waitress, you generally you're not unionized.
*  You don't have really very much protection.
*  If I was still a waitress right now, I'd be fucked.
*  And you don't have anybody really speaking for you.
*  You're totally dispensable.
*  And I was reading all this stuff and I hated like the whole system.
*  I was like, burn it all down.
*  I didn't have health care because they don't give you health care if you're a waitress.
*  So I was reading that.
*  I'm like, yeah, it was her.
*  But now that I'm, you know, 40, I'm like, how does this?
*  I don't I still don't know how to make this work.
*  I still don't know how to change that.
*  I understand from the heart perspective, wanting to help all the people
*  who are vulnerable and downtrodden.
*  I just don't know that that their solutions are the best solutions.
*  But I don't really know what are.
*  Yeah, it's a human problem and human problems never have an answer.
*  They're always messy.
*  Who do you think Biden's going to choose?
*  Probably Kamala Harris. Really?
*  Yeah, makes sense.
*  She's the sting of Tulsi Gabbard serving her during the debates,
*  has sort of worn off a little bit.
*  And as long as you keep Tulsi quiet and she doesn't have any opponents now,
*  she's not running against anybody.
*  What if he picked Hillary?
*  What would you do?
*  Be hilarious.
*  Hillary would just shove her hand deep up his ass and start working
*  his mouth from below like a puppet.
*  So turn him into a literal puppet.
*  It's going to be weekend of Bernie's.
*  It will be a weekend of Bernie's.
*  It will also be Dick Cheney and George W.
*  Right. Because Dick Cheney was really running the show.
*  And George W. is out there fucking sawing wood in Texas.
*  And I mean, we have Joe, we have a fucking election coming up
*  on the heels of all this shit.
*  And now they're talking in California about digital elections and Hillary's behind it.
*  So as soon as Hillary says everyone should be safe to vote and voting at home,
*  oh, this bitch is running a game.
*  Something's going on.
*  Everyone's losing it, though.
*  Everyone's losing their minds.
*  I mean, I see all this stuff, too, about like Fauci and the
*  and Gates and the conspiracy theories.
*  And there's it's so hard because so many conspiracy theories have ended up being true.
*  Like Fauci is a virus expert.
*  That's what he's always been. Right.
*  There's no conspiracy.
*  He's a guy. No, but there are there are conspiracies around him
*  that he's in cahoots with Bill Gates and like they did a whole thing.
*  And stop. Stop. Yeah.
*  He's a guy who's a virus expert.
*  He's been a virus expert his whole life.
*  If he fucking waited until he's 70 years old to cash in his Illuminati chips.
*  And this is it. We've been running this scam for years.
*  I've been pretending to work on AIDS and all these different diseases and all horse shit.
*  I'm just evil looking to get paid.
*  And finally, it's coming my way.
*  No, he would have already cashed his chips.
*  He's not a bad guy.
*  He runs three miles a day.
*  It looks like he does. Yeah.
*  Healthy. He looks vibrant.
*  He used to be seven. Now it's three.
*  Oh, really? Yeah, because he's busy.
*  Was that what he said? Yeah.
*  Good for him. Because he's working on, you know, all the all the stuff.
*  I'm not. Look, the only conspiracy that gives me pause
*  is when you see people like Bill Gates saying we need a virus.
*  We need some sort of a vaccination.
*  We need to vaccinate.
*  Everyone's going to be vaccinated.
*  Like, OK. But have there ever been a virus that's ever been
*  there's a real vaccine that would work for a coronavirus?
*  I don't think there has.
*  I don't think they've had.
*  I don't think they had a virus.
*  They were working on a vaccine rather.
*  They're working on a vaccine for SARS, but it never happened.
*  And I don't think they've ever had any sort of a vaccine for a coronavirus.
*  Is that what he's saying? He's saying.
*  He's saying they need a vaccine and they're going to come up with a vaccine.
*  And that's the solution. Everybody has to be vaccinated.
*  But I don't know if that's even will.
*  You know, the idea is it'll take 18 months for a vaccine.
*  Maybe or maybe they won't come up with one. Right.
*  It's possible that they won't have a vaccine in 18 months.
*  So what do you want to do, Bill?
*  And if they do have a vaccine, where's the money go for making the vaccine?
*  Who's getting paid?
*  How many how many dollars is it?
*  Where's that money going?
*  Like how is it a business now?
*  So if you're having if you have a vaccine, that vaccine turns out that we got to
*  vaccinate the whole population.
*  OK, so you're going to vaccinate eight billion people.
*  And then where's that money?
*  Who gets the money from the manufacturer of the vaccine?
*  Is it you know, are you going to do it completely egalitarian?
*  Are you are you going to be like, yeah, is it free? Is it free?
*  New coronavirus vaccines are says finding one by January is a credible goal.
*  OK, OK.
*  Pharmaceutical executive.
*  He sounds like a character in a movie.
*  Monsef Slahoui, former pharmaceutical executive at the White House,
*  chose to lead a crash development program acknowledged at the 12 to 18 month
*  timeline cited by Dr. Anthony Fauci was already very aggressive.
*  But one by January is possible.
*  A credible goal.
*  So maybe it is.
*  Did you see? Here's the thing.
*  Until they have one, you can't say we got to vaccinate everybody.
*  We got to say, let's look at all the all the possibilities.
*  What's the matter?
*  You know, crowd we just read January 20, 21.
*  Is what you're saying.
*  But I was like, that's that's the next.
*  Oh, yeah. I just like jumped ahead.
*  I was like, oh, shit.
*  That's six months.
*  Well, that's what some people are saying that things are going to be.
*  I'm just so happy I got pot.
*  So you have pot pot.
*  So happy. I'm I'm.
*  Don't you miss it? Yeah, I do.
*  When people smoke it around you, do you get uncomfortable?
*  No, feel free to smoke.
*  But do you get uncomfortable? No, not at all.
*  People, I mean, being rock medians and.
*  But you worked at a weed farm when you were sober.
*  That didn't freak you out at all. No, no, no, no.
*  I I'll make you this promise, Joe, if I ever smoke weed,
*  it will be with you for the first time.
*  I don't want to be the person who fucks up your life.
*  I have friends that used to be all sober, like full sober.
*  And now they smoke pot. Yeah.
*  Only only pot.
*  I did that when I didn't drink, when I was trying not to drink.
*  I smoked weed and I definitely.
*  Just made me want to drink.
*  That's that's the problem.
*  I get it. But yeah, of course, I of course I miss it because it
*  it puts, like I said, it's like that that fuzzy distance.
*  It puts that nice, warm, fuzzy distance of between me
*  and kind of the harsh reality of the world.
*  And now I'm very just present with it.
*  But I've just been tripping out on Sam Harris's freaking meditation app,
*  which is like a drug because his is so crazy.
*  I've done a lot of meditation in my life. A lot.
*  I'm a yogi. I come to I've probably done many, many years,
*  but his is so science based.
*  And then it's like focus on your consciousness.
*  And now suddenly you have to focus on the thought.
*  And it's like, what happens to the thought when you focus on it?
*  And it fucking disappears.
*  Jim, you know, we share joints.
*  Oh, my God. I scared.
*  I scared these men.
*  He's been tested. Bring them in and multiple times.
*  Multiple times.
*  Well, yeah, Sam has had quite a bit of experience with not just meditation,
*  but all sorts of altered states of consciousness and those silent retreats.
*  He goes to those silent retreats with.
*  Yeah. But the thing. Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's hard. Yeah.
*  So yeah, when I was in Sri Lanka,
*  I was the last time I used LSD and I was determined to use it intentionally.
*  And because I couldn't hold joy, I come from a pretty chaotic upbringing.
*  And every time I would be in a place where I was like experiencing joy and having fun,
*  I would panic. I couldn't experience it.
*  And I'm like, I'm going to take this acid and rewire my brain
*  and I'm going to be able to just sit and enjoy myself and not feel like the rug
*  is going to get pulled out from underneath me.
*  And it worked.
*  You got lucky.
*  I got real lucky because I've had bad trip.
*  My worst trip ever, I was kicking heroin and I decided to do mushrooms
*  because it was the only drug I had left.
*  And it was it was a nightmare.
*  Hunter S.
*  Thompson apparently stole some sign from the Farley Brothers Theater.
*  Do you know the Farley Brothers Theater?
*  And Farley Brothers?
*  What is it? The one the ones in San Francisco, they they're the ones who produced
*  behind the green door with Maryland Chambers.
*  And there was a theater that they had in San Francisco that was like
*  they do like sex acts.
*  And he stole the sign from the theater and gave it to this couple on there.
*  It was I think the Jackalope had it on his Instagram
*  and gave the sign to the couple for when they got married as a wedding gift,
*  along with a bunch of acid.
*  Oh, God. And the wife did the acid and lost her mind.
*  Oh, no. Got checked into a mental institution.
*  This is a horrible story. Stay there. Stay there forever.
*  This is so sad. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Although it would be cool if you're like, yeah, I had a wife.
*  There it is. The Jackalope Jacka underscore Lope is a guy
*  I've chatted with multiple times online.
*  He's a Hunter S. Thompson nut.
*  So it's this is the O'Farrell Theater. That's what it is.
*  OK, I'm thinking the Farley Brothers, the guys who make the funny movies.
*  Yeah. Hunter stole this sign from the O'Farrell Theater in San Francisco,
*  signed it and gave it to a friend, along with 20 hits of acid as a wedding gift.
*  The bride took the acid, was committed to a mental institution
*  and never came back. True story.
*  That's on the one hand, that's tragic.
*  On the other hand, how dope would it be to be like, yeah, my bride,
*  my Hunter S. Thompson gave us acid and my bride went insane.
*  Depends if you love your bride.
*  So the sign says warning if observing any type of sexual activity offends you.
*  Please do not enter.
*  This is a private theater club and we wish to preserve the privacy of members
*  and avoid offense to any person.
*  Admission is limited to adults who will not be offended
*  should they observe any type of sexual activity.
*  That's a pretty freaky sign.
*  And he signed it. So he signed it at the bottom.
*  Wow. Well, at least he saw the sign, even though he doesn't have his wife.
*  Do you know? Whoa. Yeah.
*  I mean, he obviously kept it.
*  I think, yeah, someone got it.
*  Someone kept it. Sold it to someone.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of stories of that.
*  People doing acid just losing it.
*  It's a switch flips and that's it.
*  I was afraid when I was a burning man.
*  I'm like, I went sober.
*  Did you really? I did.
*  And I was I don't know why anyone needs drugs there.
*  I can see why they want to take them,
*  but I would be the girl that lost my mind on the playa
*  and left it there and never I wouldn't come back.
*  My brain would be I can see how you could break your brain.
*  Oh, yeah, for sure.
*  I mean, I've definitely had those weird experiences where you have.
*  You had this or you kind of float out of your body and you're like,
*  maybe I won't go back.
*  That sounds like people are burning man have that every day.
*  That's that's a typical burning man. No. Why?
*  It's dirty. It's not dirty.
*  Oh, it's everyone's got a mask on because it's dusty.
*  They were the original social distance.
*  No, they were well prepared for this.
*  I was saying, you know, he's having the last laugh right now.
*  The burners because you have like all the masks. Right. Right. Right.
*  And they're going to go back and no one's going to stop them.
*  No, they canceled it.
*  I think they can't.
*  Didn't they cancel it? No, no.
*  I feel like I don't let them.
*  You guys are all going to like damn the man.
*  And they're like, oh, well, you can't come.
*  They're like, OK, it's postponed.
*  So when? That's hilarious.
*  The burners are like, damn the man.
*  And the man is like, you can't have burning man.
*  And they're like, OK, when is burning man supposed to be?
*  What is it? It's usually at the end of August.
*  The last week of weekend of August.
*  Wow. These pussies are already backing off.
*  Come on, kids. Come on.
*  What if they come up with elite, like really effective tests?
*  They're not even kids that burn like the burners are old.
*  The old the people I went with, they they they've been going forever.
*  That's even weirder.
*  Why? 55 year old burners like, hey, man, we're out here doing it.
*  I think everyone needs to go once.
*  It is like nothing I've ever seen.
*  And of course, the minute I get there, someone opens a suitcase full of drugs.
*  I'm like, God damn it.
*  Like, no, I can't.
*  I was so close because it was during my experimental year of sobriety.
*  And I was determined to make it.
*  I'm like, I just got to prove to myself that I'm not an alcoholic and an addict.
*  So you just wanted one full year under your belt.
*  Yeah, which I did.
*  And then you just kept going.
*  Well, no, I went then I traveled around the world and I was like, fuck this.
*  Oh, so that was the Australia days.
*  Yeah. I got drunk right before I left for Australia because I'm like, this is
*  why would I go to Australia and I drink?
*  Well, that's good because that shows that you could both quit
*  and then get back on and then quit again.
*  Yeah. But the second time I quit, I was like,
*  I want to kill myself.
*  I don't know that I have another time in me.
*  Maybe. But well, don't you think that now things are different
*  because now you've developed like this audience and you have a successful podcast
*  and people enjoy your tweets like you have a lot of people.
*  Fucking Gavin Mcgowness, if I was tweeting while I was drinking,
*  I'd be banned from everything.
*  There's no way I'd be I'd be somebody like the one of the band.
*  He's the one that first ones that comes to mind.
*  Yeah. Alex Jones.
*  Alex Jones, I would be if I was drinking and tweeting.
*  No way. Yeah.
*  I would cancel. When do those people get to come back?
*  Like, what do you what are we doing?
*  Like if you do you put people in jail for life?
*  I don't know. That's a weird second.
*  These aren't crimes, right? No.
*  So nothing you want these guys done as a crime.
*  And, you know, maybe I mean, wait.
*  But Alex did have some kind of legal problems, legal problems, civil suit
*  versus the families of.
*  So there was some kind of crime.
*  Well, there's some kind of
*  there's there's press, there's something for a lawsuit.
*  Right. There's grounds for a lawsuit.
*  And he's been battling this lawsuit for quite a long time.
*  So let's assume that gets settled.
*  When when, if ever, do you let people like try again?
*  Like, but here's the thing, it's like it's not.
*  It's if a company owns something, there's two arguments.
*  And like there's the David Pakman audience, which is
*  argument rather David's argument is that I believe I hope I'm not misquoting him.
*  He'll be on soon.
*  Is that the company should have the ability to set their own guidelines
*  and remove people from the platform if they say things
*  that they feel are objectionable or things that don't align
*  with the way the company views things.
*  The problem with that is if it gets so big
*  that the companies, you know, got trillions of dollars and,
*  you know, it's seen by billions of people every day.
*  And then who gets to make the decision that what they're saying is objection.
*  Right. I know. And is this an ideologically based decision or is this like,
*  OK, don't show murder. OK, good. Good call.
*  Let's not show murder.
*  You know, don't say.
*  Whatever about the government.
*  Well, that gets weird.
*  Yeah. Don't say this about the pandemic because videos getting removed.
*  I know. That's weird.
*  I did a joke about this on Dumpster Fire on my show on YouTube.
*  And I was like, does YouTube know what their content is?
*  It's like half of it is people putting yonis up their vaginas.
*  They're like the little jade eggs up their yonis.
*  You know, they have like all kinds.
*  There's a lot of those videos.
*  There's a lot of wacky science being presented on YouTube.
*  There's definitely a lot of that.
*  But they're trying.
*  I think their ideas, they're trying to stop disinformation
*  and they're trying to put the kibosh on conspiracy theories.
*  But some of the things these people are saying is correct.
*  Well, and like Shermer would argue that the only, you know,
*  more speech is the only way to correct incorrect speech.
*  Yes. That's what everybody would say.
*  That's that's thinking about it logically, because the problem with
*  silencing these people, particularly like the 5G folks, right?
*  This is a big one. 5G.
*  Every time you try to put a 5G conspiracy video up, they take it down.
*  Do you know that?
*  I mean, I've heard a lot about the 5G.
*  But here's the thing.
*  They'll leave up the flat earth ones because they're like, this is so fucking stupid.
*  Go ahead.
*  Stay up. 5G is like a little like, God damn it.
*  People really believe in this.
*  We got it. We got to step in.
*  You got to step in to stop morons
*  from believing something that makes no sense.
*  Little Duvall had one Instagram thing on his page that cured it all up.
*  And he goes, all you 5G people.
*  It was basically that 5G is only in five countries.
*  Coronavirus is in over 100 countries.
*  Obviously, it's not 5G that's causing this shit.
*  I know it's so I'm with you because I'm pretty much a free speech absolutist, I think.
*  And and then, you know, even when I was thinking,
*  I was reading Sam's book and he mentioned something.
*  It has nothing to do with free speech.
*  And I don't really know where he stands on all this.
*  But I was just thinking when you're talking about how he was mentioning
*  just how that ideology led to someone flying a plane into the trade centers.
*  You know, so bad ideology is something we have to eradicate with more speech, obviously.
*  But it's also potentially these companies don't want to be responsible
*  for someone doing something.
*  This is where I get confused because I'm all about free markets, too.
*  And if it's my company, like, fuck you.
*  If you say something, get out of my house.
*  But they don't apply their terms evenly.
*  So if you have terms of service and you're like, you can't say this and people don't say this.
*  But they will say what you're saying is inciting violence to one person.
*  And then they'll say to another person, oh, you said punch a Nazi in the face.
*  Here's the blue check. Exactly.
*  And so there is an unfair application of the terms of service.
*  And I think that's where most people get upset.
*  And like you're saying, some of that, you know, I don't I don't really know anything about Milo,
*  but I do know that he's been pretty much like depersoned.
*  I don't even know if the guy can get like a bank.
*  You know, I think they once they have trouble getting like bank bank accounts and stuff,
*  or they can't get maybe maybe it's not bank accounts, but like Venmo.
*  You know, they get banned off of the PayPal.
*  So how are you?
*  I guess it's just the early warning signs of people interfering with being able to make a living.
*  But how are they supposed to make deciding that they don't want you on their platform?
*  And if they decide if they're in a position like a Venmo or PayPal and that's what you're using for donation,
*  they can say your ideology doesn't match up with the values of our company.
*  We're going to kick you off. But you got to show what that ideology is, like what specifically is it like?
*  Have a conversation about it. Like, what are you talking about?
*  Like, it depends on what you're saying, because if it's someone just saying something that's opposed to your views politically,
*  you know, like you got to let people talk this shit through.
*  Yeah. I mean, if it's one thing, if you know, I mean, this racist stuff on YouTube,
*  you could find things that are sexist on YouTube.
*  You can find things that are homophobic on YouTube.
*  You can find a lot of stuff.
*  We can't decide that the disagreeable boundary is left and right.
*  You can't do that because there's crazy religious stuff that you keep on YouTube.
*  Yeah.
*  There is, I mean, you want to talk about conspiracy theories.
*  I watched the beheading.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I've seen.
*  Well, they take those down.
*  They take them down, but they still, I've seen them on YouTube.
*  But there's plenty of religious ones.
*  The point is, there's plenty of people saying absolutely outrageous shit that can't be real.
*  And you don't do anything about that.
*  So when you're talking about conspiracy theories and you're talking about, you know, ideological rifts between people,
*  they're not even with it.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Something that can even distribute.
*  And.
*  But how do you think they should address that?
*  You know, when do you think these people get to talk again or whatever, which is an insane thing that we're even saying.
*  The fact that we're even saying like, when do we let these people talk again is fucking insane.
*  This is what I think.
*  I think that at a certain point in time, we have to look at whether it's the ability to tweet something or post a video or,
*  you know, make an Instagram post.
*  You have to think that this is this is a way to express yourself that we should all enjoy along with the same way we enjoy the idea of free speech,
*  free speech and the ability to assemble, like the ability to assemble and talk about things like this is very similar to what these tweets are.
*  But they're private companies.
*  But it's it.
*  One of two things has to happen, I think either they have to change their perspective and they have to allow opposing ideas on their platform, even as heinous as they might be.
*  Or we have to find a better alternative and we have to find a company that recognizes the flaws in the current model or the old model.
*  And they say, look, we can't do this.
*  This is just you're making the divide stronger.
*  When people find out that, you know, like the Veritas stuff, you know, that that guy, Project Veritas, James O'Keefe, when he was exposing that these Twitter executives were saying how they were talking about the strategies they use to
*  silence MAGA users, to silence Trump supporters, and you just find certain algorithms and things they say, and then you make it so it's difficult to find their page.
*  Like, that's creepy shit.
*  Right.
*  Like you got to let people choose.
*  Yeah, you got to let people choose what they like and what they don't like, because there's a line and you can keep moving that line.
*  Right. You can say we don't want anyone who says anything bad about X, Y or Z.
*  And who gets to be the arbiter of that decision.
*  And then it can get to a point where what happened to Zuby, where he got banned off of Twitter for saying OK, dude, for somebody.
*  Right. Right.
*  Someone said, I bet I can have sex with more women than you can.
*  And he goes, OK, dude.
*  And they're like, violation.
*  You're done. Turns out it must have been a trans person.
*  He still doesn't even know.
*  And then they reviewed it and still kept it upon review.
*  But he's still on Twitter.
*  They suspended him.
*  They put him in Twitter jail.
*  Right.
*  They're basically letting you know, hey, you better censor yourself.
*  Right.
*  Better better fucking get on board.
*  The idea that you can't say OK, dude to somebody.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I use dude with my girlfriends all the time.
*  If I'm talking to a female friend, I'll be like, dude, like it's a normal thing that men and women say to each other.
*  If they're even if they're just friends, it has nothing to do with someone who's trying to insult somebody.
*  Right. Right.
*  Or pretend that you're a guy or misgender you.
*  That's not what it is.
*  What bothers me is that he said that, you know, and it might have been like, OK, dude, I but we're ascribing intent.
*  So they're saying you meant this.
*  Right.
*  In one way, even if he might have been like, whatever.
*  But here's the thing.
*  Why is it OK if that person calls you a cunt or a fucking idiot or a moron?
*  But it's not OK if you call them a dude.
*  Yeah.
*  Is that the worst insult?
*  I missed that whole thing.
*  I was off offline.
*  Deadly.
*  Yeah.
*  People dead naming is a that's a banable offense on Twitter.
*  OK.
*  So if you used to be a girl and then you decided to transition to be a guy and I insist on calling you Bridget on Twitter, I'm banned for life.
*  Dead. OK.
*  OK.
*  Is that in the terms of service?
*  It's a new thing.
*  Oh, OK.
*  It's a thing that they've adopted over the last couple of years.
*  So this is where his OK dude falls in line.
*  So another misgendering misgendering is another reason you can get banned for life.
*  OK.
*  I mean, I'm all for whatever respecting what people want to be called.
*  But then it moves into like when you are enforcing it.
*  Now it's it's said line kind of Jordan Peterson drew in some respects where it's like I'll be polite.
*  I will polite.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not a monster.
*  I will respect whatever people want me to call them.
*  If you said Bridget, I want you to call me Josephina.
*  I would call you Josephina because I'm not an asshole.
*  Yeah.
*  You can change your name.
*  But if suddenly Twitter was like you called him Joe, I'm going to ban you.
*  That that gets into another territory.
*  Here's a good example, too.
*  Like if you decide that you want to be called Debbie and I'll go, OK, when I speak to you,
*  the noise that comes out of my mouth will be Debbie.
*  If you don't call me Debbie, you're getting kicked the fuck off Twitter.
*  But if you then go and my pronouns are zeer and czar, I'd be like, nope, nope, nope, not not making up.
*  I'm not playing Dungeons and Dragons with you.
*  I'm not. You're either a he or a she or you can even be a they.
*  That's who you prefer.
*  You can't make up one.
*  I'm again like they doesn't even.
*  It's funny because the younger generations much more lax about this or like whatever.
*  I'll call them whatever they want.
*  Like the kids these days are like, I don't care.
*  I don't they just in the same way that I grew up and my my older folks might have been like,
*  oh, gay marriage. And they'd be all outraged.
*  And we were all like, oh, whatever.
*  Here's a controversial question.
*  There's way more kids that are trans today.
*  Yeah. Way more. Oh, God.
*  Right. Isn't it?
*  Is this because they feel comfortable enough to be trans and they've always been trans?
*  Or is it possible that it's a cultural thing and then it seems like it's more acceptable to be trans?
*  So they just take a chance or they or they maybe it's just the experimental cool thing to do.
*  Well, there's a lot of people that experiment with all sorts of things.
*  And this is not denying trans. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*  But we've got to be really clear because I don't want anybody to be upset.
*  But there are impressionable people that look, you could talk.
*  Somebody talked those fucking Heaven's Gate guys into cutting their balls off
*  and waiting for the comet that was going to take them away to some other planet.
*  You could talk someone into being gay.
*  You could like Tiger King did it.
*  Joe Exotic talked those guys into being gay.
*  And then he that story with Travis is really sad.
*  It is sad. But this is what I'm saying.
*  I was like, can could someone talk you into being trans?
*  Or is that the one thing you can't talk a person into being?
*  Because you could talk a person into being a whole lot of things.
*  Well, I wonder, too, if it's, you know, culturally,
*  just one of these things that they're trying on like a loose garment.
*  But then because they've done a lot of study and you're not talking about everybody.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. Small percentage.
*  But I'm just saying that maybe they've done a lot of studies that many times
*  when kids experience gender dysphoria when they're younger,
*  a lot of the time they'll grow out of it.
*  Well, a lot of time they become gay men or I don't know about.
*  There's been studies on this. OK.
*  Allegedly, allegedly.
*  I'd ask. We're morons.
*  I wouldn't know how to phrase that.
*  And so you get put on the list.
*  I just what worries me is
*  cosigning on that and giving young kids
*  who might grow out of something like hormones and stuff like that.
*  That's where I feel like, OK, maybe it's in the culture.
*  It's like the kind of cool thing.
*  Maybe you're maybe it's
*  there's more because it's more acceptable.
*  Or maybe it's just something that you're kind of like I there was a part of my life
*  where I was like, am I a lesbian? Maybe I am.
*  I don't know. I'm not.
*  But maybe it might be something that's a curiosity when you're younger
*  and it might be something that is like the cool thing.
*  So, yeah, I think that we have to accept that.
*  That's not always going to be the case for everyone.
*  For some people, that will absolutely be the truth.
*  But with children, here's what I'm hesitant about.
*  What freaks me out is not people that are like you or me,
*  that are like, oh, is this a good thing to do?
*  It's people that know it's the best thing for the child.
*  That's what's that's what freaks me out.
*  What freaks me out is people that are pro transitioning at a really young age,
*  100 percent of the time, and they think it's amazing.
*  And they do you know I'm talking about?
*  Yeah, that's that.
*  I mean, there are doctors cosigning on this shit.
*  He's three and he's trans. He's a boy.
*  Yeah. Are you sure?
*  I mean, I'll get in trouble.
*  I'll probably get in trouble for saying it, but I just don't. I.
*  And maybe when you're a young.
*  I don't know, when you're an adolescent up to like 13, 14,
*  I would maybe even argue.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know how you can cosign on that and be like, yes, this child
*  who should be listening, you know, this child knows what's best for them.
*  I wanted to do a lot of fucking things when I was a kid that that I couldn't do.
*  You know, if I wanted to become if I was a talented musician
*  and wanted to go join a band and I was some kind of phenom at 14,
*  my parents would have been like, oh, too bad. You have to wait.
*  They would have made me they would have said, you're too young to go do that.
*  Yeah, you're not going to London with these fucking perverts, Bridget.
*  And I'm not calling.
*  It's an ideological battle.
*  No, you're not. It's an ideological battleground.
*  Here's the thing is like the people that say that it's not something
*  that you should be hesitant about, it's not something that should concern you.
*  Those are the people that have a problem with it, because what is your justification?
*  Like you're you're you must have some massive generalization
*  or there must be a switch that you know of that I don't that someone is definitely
*  trans or not trans when they're young and they're confused.
*  Yeah, because it's the one thing that they know about.
*  If you asked a three year old, what are you going to be forever and you can't change it?
*  What's going to be your occupation?
*  Some might say turtles. Yeah.
*  You know, I don't know that you can.
*  Well, someone had a great line. I forget who it was.
*  I'm comic. I don't know. Twitter said you don't let a six year old pick out their outfit.
*  Why would you let him pick out their gender? Yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah. So there's that's another.
*  And again, I'm not a parent.
*  So you are. You have a little bit more ground to stand on.
*  I will get into this argument with people and immediately it's like, well, you're not a parent.
*  So kids vary wildly.
*  That's why the idea of being blanket for kids transitioning with hormone blockers and all this crazy shit.
*  Like I had a conversation with Adam Conover about it and it was like a big viral moment for this discussion.
*  And people called me a transphobe like nothing could be further from the truth.
*  I'm not anything.
*  I love everybody equally.
*  If you're if you've got your shit together, I want you to have your shit together.
*  Really do. Even if you don't have your shit together.
*  Yeah. But I mean, if you're a person who can talk and I'm not prejudging anybody on anything.
*  Yeah. But when you start talking about children and their future and I know that it's synced up to a virtue,
*  it's synced up to some sort of an ideological virtue signaling thing that you can do to say that you're pro-trans.
*  Pro-trans, pro-children transitioning.
*  And you're not.
*  And then when I ask you why you're so certain and you don't have good answers, I'm like, OK, this is a cult thing.
*  You're in that cult and you know there's things that you have to say in order to be accepted by that cult.
*  Yeah, that's that's what worries me is that it's more like take away from the children.
*  The kids are I allow for kids to explore and whatever.
*  I think it's great that society is more open and open to the world.
*  And I think it's more open because phobias of any any like transphobia, homophobia, these are not helpful for our society in general.
*  I I do worry that parents eager to be progressive, you know, warriors for their team and in these progressive enclaves
*  and trying to kind of out woke each other, will use their children as means to their like little advertisements.
*  And it sounds horrible, but it's true.
*  What you just said sounds horrible, but it's true.
*  You see it in on a very small scale.
*  I used to work at a I taught theater to kids at a very like in Tamesco at a camp.
*  They used to be there.
*  And this one kid came in and this kid must have been five or six years old.
*  And he had a T-shirt on that said I never live east of the 405.
*  And I was like, wow, you are using your child as an advertisement for your wealth.
*  Like it was just a little walking billboard that said my parents are rich basically.
*  And you see this all the time with, you know, I was I was watching.
*  It doesn't necessarily mean rich. It could be Venice.
*  No, I know. But Huntington Beach.
*  No, east of the 405.
*  I would never live east of the 405.
*  Yeah. Huntington Beach is west of the 405.
*  That's the beach.
*  Yeah, it's west.
*  But the kids never live east of the 405.
*  So I wouldn't live in Inland Empire.
*  I wouldn't live in the valley.
*  I wouldn't live in Encino.
*  That's east of the 405.
*  No, actually, that's west.
*  Encino is west.
*  No, the kid was saying I would never live east of the 405, which Huntington Beach and all that is west of the 405.
*  Right.
*  All the beach communities are west.
*  Right. But that's not a rich community.
*  Huntington Beach.
*  They're pretty.
*  I mean, anyone living on the beach and in L.A.
*  Venice is pretty rich.
*  Long Beach is rich.
*  This is like tech rich now.
*  This is where Snoop comes from.
*  Long Beach is changing.
*  It's not cheap.
*  It's $800,000 to get a little house in Long Beach.
*  But isn't it also like people on the west side are like extremely liberal?
*  Yeah, in general.
*  That's part of me too.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  But anyway, my point is that people often use their kids as billboards for whatever signaling.
*  I was watching some, it was a bunch of people protesting the lockdown and this little kid
*  was chanting something at the dude about fake news.
*  And I was like, this is what we do to kids with sports.
*  It's easy to indoctrinate children.
*  Very easy.
*  Did you see that one guy that was walking around?
*  I think Sam Trippley had it up on his Instagram page.
*  The guy was walking around at the protest in Newport.
*  Newport might have been Huntington Beach.
*  And this guy's walking around with a megaphone, why everybody's saying, we open back up California.
*  Bill Gates is the devil.
*  The Bill Gates stuff is so funny to me.
*  It's so weird.
*  He became a villain out of nowhere.
*  What's that quote?
*  You either die a hero, you live long enough to become a villain.
*  He's lived long enough to become a villain.
*  Right, the Gates Foundation literally gives millions of dollars away to charity.
*  When I was in Rome and all over the world, when you go to any of these places, what he's
*  done in Africa, did you see the whole documentary?
*  He built freaking toilets for all of Africa.
*  He literally figured out how to fucking help them with one of the biggest problems in Africa.
*  And everyone's like, fuck Bill Gates.
*  In Rome, everything's crumbling, in Greece, because they don't have the money to maintain
*  all their antiquities.
*  And so the Gates Foundation is everywhere, keeping all of our history basically from
*  crumbling.
*  He fucked up, talking about vaccines and people like, you want to get rich off the backs of
*  all these people you're going to inject your microchips into.
*  I did a radio hit and it was a right wing guy and I didn't really know much, but he
*  was asking me out of the blue, he's like, and then did you see Melinda Gates today?
*  I was like, oh shit.
*  When I do these hits, I'm like, oh no.
*  I'm like, I'm not going to get into this whole anti-Gates thing.
*  Well, he's done so much good.
*  But to be fair, she was out there saying that, talking about when we should open up and vaccines
*  and I'm like, yeah, maybe just, I keep saying this, if I was rich, you would never fucking
*  hear from me right now.
*  I would be on a beach.
*  There's so much, it's a class war.
*  Listen to me.
*  If you had money, you would still be spouting out, stop your bullshit.
*  If somebody gave you a hundred million dollars, you would wait about a month and you'd go
*  right back on Twitter.
*  You know I'm right.
*  You know I'm right.
*  You love doing it.
*  It's fun for you and you're great at it.
*  No, you're right.
*  You're one of the best tweeters alive.
*  No, you're probably right.
*  I'm right about that.
*  You're one of the best tweeters alive.
*  This thing that they're doing where they're telling people they're going to have to get
*  vaccinated, this is what is a part of the problem because there's a lot of people that
*  have kicked this disease.
*  We got to figure out why they kicked it, whether it's nutrition, whether it's genetics, we
*  got to figure that out.
*  And this thing that you're saying, everybody's got to get vaccinated.
*  No they don't.
*  No they don't.
*  It's weird.
*  You don't even know, first of all, you don't even know if they're going to be able to nail
*  this vaccine.
*  I hope they do.
*  I hope they do.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  It's weird to see the convergence of the anti-vaxxers and all of this talk because I wrote a piece
*  about, it was like a satirical piece.
*  I was saying why stop getting mad at anti-vaxxers for bringing disease into the herd.
*  It was during the measles outbreaks, which we've almost eradicated and now it's making
*  a comeback.
*  And there's so much overlap in those communities now with this, but you can't really conflate
*  the two because we know how to get rid of the measles.
*  We know we can get rid of the measles.
*  We have something that works.
*  Right, but it's a liberty thing.
*  See, the problem is whenever you start telling people what they have to do, even if it's
*  good for them, they get mad.
*  Well, and even with the vaccine thing, I don't like to be so black or white about even that
*  because there is a conversation to be had there.
*  Is it good to have vaccines that protect the herd immunity from diseases we've pretty much
*  eradicated?
*  Yes, because you're putting a lot of other people at risk and pregnant moms when they
*  go to the waiting room and there's so many side effects if somebody has measles.
*  Now, should they have 67 vaccines in order to attend school, including HPV?
*  That's not herd immunity.
*  Why do they need to get the California?
*  Why do they need that when they're babies?
*  Have you seen the list?
*  It's a crazy list.
*  I mean, you know.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  So that's where I'm like, well, the problem with anti-vaxxers is they do cause people
*  to get cavalier about this shit and then measles makes a comeback.
*  That's real.
*  Polio makes a comeback.
*  The only reason we're having this conversation is because we got rid of that shit.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  It's just hubris.
*  When someone says we have to get a vaccine and everyone's going to have to take the vaccine,
*  people automatically get cautious.
*  And then when that person's a billionaire that might be connected to the Illuminati,
*  you're like, hey, this fucking guy is going to make money off this vaccine.
*  Everyone's brains are broken.
*  I think Trump broke everyone's brains.
*  Everyone's so worried because everything becomes this partisan thing.
*  And then it's like, yeah, I'll get measles to own the libs.
*  There's so much, like I'm going to do this thing that like cut off my nose to spite my
*  face or whatever that.
*  Yeah, I'll be a martyr.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a lot.
*  It's a lot.
*  It's a lot.
*  So, but wait, I still want to know when do you think the people should be able to like
*  talk again?
*  The deep person.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That's a good question.
*  Well, Alex Jones at least has infowars.com.
*  He could do his own thing and people go to that.
*  Gavin's got a show still.
*  Does he?
*  Yeah.
*  Is he still on YouTube or did they kick him off of YouTube?
*  I don't know if he's still on YouTube.
*  Because they kicked him off a lot of things a little while ago.
*  And it didn't seem like there was a clear reason.
*  It's like they just decided they were going to get rid of him.
*  Interesting.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like he had been on.
*  He had some scandals, but he had stayed on YouTube.
*  Right.
*  And basically followed the rules.
*  Right.
*  So what happened?
*  Oh, is he still on there?
*  He's definitely still on.
*  Oh, OK.
*  So that's interesting too, right?
*  And then I think he just...
*  They have their own thing.
*  And if you go on Telegraph, they're all there.
*  They're all hanging out.
*  It's Telegraph.
*  It's like the... where... it's like a micro blogging service.
*  And I think Milo's there and Gavin's there.
*  And it's a little bit like Twitter, but it's kind of like for the band and for people who...
*  For the Misc...
*  Yeah, I saw him.
*  He was on one of those things.
*  Gabb or something like that.
*  Talking about Milo was complaining about the...
*  About Milo was complaining about the actual numbers he reaches now, how unsustainable it is.
*  Obviously there's a lot of people that like him.
*  And there's...
*  Look, he's a funny guy.
*  He says funny shit.
*  He really does.
*  And I don't think he's been accurately portrayed.
*  I don't.
*  I mean, I think he definitely said some stupid shit, but that's part of the fun of what he was doing.
*  He's a provocateur.
*  And he was definitely doing some stuff that...
*  There's a question of whether or not there's multiple accounts that they were using, that he was using to...
*  Yeah.
*  You know, anonymous accounts.
*  That was an accusation.
*  But Twitter didn't want to substantiate that when I talked to them about it, because I think they're worried about the legal ramifications.
*  We addressed that.
*  Yeah.
*  It's problematic because you end up, you know, as someone who's kind of all for free speech,
*  I often get told that I'm bad because I have to defend people whose language I don't agree with.
*  That is what free speech is.
*  It's not defending everyone who says things that I love.
*  It doesn't make any sense because that means you're right all the time.
*  Like if you're only defending the things that you believe in, you write all the time about everything.
*  But I have to defend the people who say things that are even atrocious and that I can't...
*  I would never get on board with because that's what free speech is otherwise.
*  And like you said, it is that slippery slope of who gets to be the arbiter of what is said.
*  Right. And what are your guidelines?
*  And when I'm saying this about letting people do it, like, or arguing against ideas that you don't agree with,
*  like you should be able to or not to.
*  You should be able to express yourself and respond to the criticisms that you receive or choose not to.
*  But the idea that only my ideas should get broadcast because your ideas are contrary to my ideas.
*  I'm going to cut off the pipeline for you to express those and work those out.
*  And look, there's a lot of people that had some terrible ideas early in their life and then they changed.
*  There's that guy, what's his name, Christian Picciolini, who was in the KKK.
*  He was in some sort of white supremacist organization when he was young.
*  And now he talks about the dangers of these organizations.
*  It's like me being AOC when I was young.
*  Exactly. Well, people change. They change.
*  And you have to be able to... if there's no path to redemption, what is the point?
*  Right. So what is the path to redemption?
*  You leave people with nothing. And hopelessness is the worst.
*  So if you're taking everything away from somebody and then you're saying you're in the bad place now forever,
*  what is their incentive to even open their mind and have a different... why not just double down?
*  Let's give a recent example. Here's a recent example, a good one.
*  London Real. London Real had an interview with David Icke.
*  I don't know who any of these people are.
*  Okay. London Real is a popular YouTube show.
*  Okay. And they had an interview with David Icke.
*  David Icke is a conspiracy theorist who thinks that the elites turn into lizards.
*  He says he's seen their eyes shift.
*  Okay. This is... he talked about it on this podcast.
*  Seen their eyes shift. Yes, I've seen their eyes shift.
*  Okay, right there you should be like, okay, this is fun. This is fun time.
*  This guy thinks that the fucking the Queens and Lizard Lady.
*  Right. But you want to look out for people that are so fucking dumb that they're like,
*  oh, did you hear about the lizard people? Yeah, they're real men.
*  But there's a lot of those people. Hey, hey, hey. So what?
*  Right. So what? I agree.
*  This is evolution here. We're stopping the flow of evolution.
*  Because if... look, this is how I feel about televangelists, right?
*  If you're so dumb, you want to give Joel Olsteen all your money even though you're poor
*  because you think that somehow or another this is going to save you
*  and God's grace is going to be upon you because you tithe all your money to Joel Olsteen
*  and he drives around to Bentley and you're happy for him.
*  Yeah. Okay, that's legal. Yeah.
*  And it's dumb as fuck, but it doesn't work on you.
*  It works on only the dumbest of dumb people.
*  And so they're like, oh, I guess it's okay. This is the same thing.
*  This is the same thing. If you're so fucking dumb, you really believe
*  that David Icke's seen people's eyeballs shift over
*  and that there's lizards that are secretly transforming into politicians
*  and then going back to lizards when no one's looking. Come on.
*  Yeah. Come on. So if you take that guy off, you just make them bigger.
*  So there's a giant story that this David Icke podcast was removed from YouTube.
*  It keeps getting removed. People keep uploading it.
*  It's like that plandemic documentary that everybody keeps sending me.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. It gets removed and then people upload it everywhere.
*  We're going to upload it everywhere. They're trying to hide the truth.
*  Just leave it alone. It makes it seem real.
*  It makes it seem way more real. Yeah, it makes it seem real.
*  Nobody would give a fuck about that David Icke interview.
*  I mean, it would because it's on London Real and it's a popular program.
*  So some people would have watched it, but nobody would have really thought
*  that the fucking lizard people are there.
*  Nobody would. And the people that do think that they're going to think anything.
*  You could talk them into cutting their balls off and riding the fucking comet
*  and joining your the hellboggling people.
*  But the thing is, like, you got to let that exist.
*  You got to let these. But they will with some shit.
*  They will with the Flat Earth people. Yeah, it's weird.
*  Maybe the Flat Earth shit is still up. Oh, I know. I know.
*  But they get to the 5G and they're like, no, too much. Too much.
*  So David Icke was talking about 5G.
*  From what I said, I don't even what I read, rather, I don't even.
*  I don't even. I didn't watch the whole thing, but I don't even think he was saying that 5G causes it.
*  But he was doing some. He was doing some wacky, very articulate conspiracy shit.
*  Yeah, we live in just weird, weird.
*  It's only getting weirder. But here's what's interesting.
*  OK, this is what we need to accept about people like David Icke and a lot of these people.
*  There is clearly a lot of entertainment value in someone saying preposterous shit
*  that any intelligent person knows is not true.
*  There's some weird entertainment value in someone that really does believe that aliens live amongst us
*  and that they're shape shifters. And then if you look back, all of our leaders have all been related together
*  and they're part of one gene pool that the ancient Sumerians brought together.
*  They came here from Pranit Nibiru. And there's there's something really entertaining about that.
*  Not just Scientology. There's a lot of a lot of it.
*  Right. So people watch my YouTube show. Right.
*  That's that's fine. Now I know. But I'm saying like this is this is an it's kind of an art form.
*  This is what I'm thinking. It's an art. It's a kind of performance art along with like a little bit of horse shit.
*  And some people like crazy standup guy, Andy Kaufman.
*  Yes. It's like everyone's become Andy Kaufman. Right.
*  Alex Jones is funny than Andy Kaufman's ever been. Alex Jones is fucking hilarious. Often.
*  Did you see the whole bill that he's Bill Hicks? Yeah.
*  Conspiracy. That's not real. I went down that rabbit hole. That's the silliest shit. I know. But there are videos.
*  But he had one thing we're talking about, like if it's between his family starving or eating his neighbor.
*  I know. I'll eat your ass. I thought it became this jack. Come on.
*  Do you don't think there's entertainment value in him saying he's going to die? Right.
*  But there's something to that, like to to stop that and ban that.
*  You're you're not you're not stopping anyone from you.
*  You're not stopping anybody from anything bad by not having Alex do this entertaining thing about eating his neighbor.
*  You're not saving anybody. Yeah. You know what I'm saying?
*  But you got to you got to like what are you doing?
*  Like what is he doing that's so awful? I don't know how to fix any of it.
*  It's it's it's entertaining.
*  Like why is it only acceptable if you have some kind of entertainment?
*  Because there's so many rap videos that you could watch that I enjoy.
*  But they're talking about shooting people and robbing people.
*  And it's everywhere on YouTube. It's so prevalent. Yeah.
*  And somehow know that that's OK.
*  Like it's fucking weird what's allowed and what's not allowed.
*  Yeah. I it's I guess I didn't I underestimated the culture wars.
*  I never really I didn't I kind of stumbled half ass into them.
*  It's complicated. It's so complicated.
*  And it's not just a or you know it's not like one tribe or another has I I'm very skeptical of anyone.
*  Who's all in on like 100 percent.
*  This is the way 100 percent. Right.
*  Covid is going to kill us all. We should stay in 100 percent.
*  We should open everything fucking back up.
*  Let it ride. There's somewhere in the middle.
*  You know what's the Rosetta Stone of the culture war.
*  No. To catch you six nine.
*  That fucking rapper dude with stupid tattoos all over his face and the rainbow hair who is a rat.
*  He ratted out all these gang members and I miss this program.
*  Now he's at what was it was it wasn't the protection program but he why is he the guy.
*  He's he's he got a much lighter sentence because he ratted on people because the rap culture has always been no rats.
*  Snitches get stitches. That's always been the culture.
*  He is now the most popular rapper on earth.
*  He has a video that he just released a few days ago.
*  That is what is it now.
*  150 million views on the video.
*  Wow. What is it.
*  OK. It's probably more than that.
*  I said 150 but that was probably yesterday.
*  Fifty nine right now.
*  Fifty nine million views.
*  Why is it terrible.
*  Why does that make him the Rose out of stone though.
*  Because there's no logic.
*  There's no logic to anything people are doing.
*  If you're trying to look for logic in what's popular or human behavior or what people are really excited about like what's scaring them.
*  What's what's good and what's bad.
*  This is the guy that's the Keshe six nine.
*  I thought you meant I thought you meant he was like the the the key to translating.
*  This is the key to translate.
*  OK. It's all nonsense.
*  He's nonsense.
*  It's nonsense.
*  The world is filled with nonsense and people are paying attention to this nonsense and frantic about this nonsense.
*  It's even creepier with the sound off.
*  It's terrible.
*  Here with the sound on.
*  I've never heard it with the sound on.
*  Well it's standard rap braggadocious type shit.
*  It's nonsense.
*  But people love it.
*  Looks kind of entertaining.
*  I mean that's what I got a good beat to it.
*  I listen to it.
*  But does it have one hundred and fifty million worth beat.
*  I don't think so.
*  I mean that's what everyone calls it clown world.
*  Isn't that what everyone says.
*  It's clown world the world.
*  Yeah.
*  Like we live in a clown world.
*  We do kind of live in clown world.
*  It's idiocracy.
*  It's something.
*  What happened.
*  It's so much.
*  We had it all.
*  And we are just pissing it away.
*  We'll bounce back.
*  Do you think.
*  Yeah.
*  So you're ultimately after a long winded slightly terrifying conversation about the culture.
*  Ultimately who do you think.
*  Do you think Biden's going to make it to the election.
*  Well it's going to be a joke if he does.
*  The idea that people are you think Trump is going to win on Biden.
*  I don't think if they let the two of them talk in the same room and have some sort of a debate.
*  I think I think Donald Trump's going to eviscerate him.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't even think he's going to be close.
*  Yeah.
*  He still has his wits.
*  He's still sharp.
*  He's still mean.
*  I know he's still well prepared with the digs and how he calls him sleepy Joe.
*  I know.
*  I know how dismissive he was.
*  He's he's a troll.
*  But do you see how dismissive he was when he was talking about something that Biden said.
*  The vice president Joe Biden said he was first of all Biden didn't say that he was a Democratic operative said that he was Biden probably doesn't even know this is happening.
*  It's funny he has these ads on Facebook Trump that are all like anti.
*  They're like oh he's too old.
*  They're like you're four years apart.
*  The coast.
*  Have you seen Trump's 404 pages on his website yet.
*  Oh my God.
*  They're.
*  I'll show you this is fucking hilarious.
*  This is also made as a death surprise.
*  He trolls everyone.
*  Like when you can't find something it's like a page.
*  I think that's even stock.
*  I think this made it into one of our earliest episodes of dumpster fire because we have a whole segment on the show called Troll in Chief and it's basically like every week.
*  What the fuck is he doing.
*  Who's he trolling now.
*  Do you want to see the most adorable Trump thing.
*  Yeah there's a lady who put together this.
*  That's OK.
*  Let me say it again.
*  Oh my God.
*  Here's your loss is me.
*  That's this 404.
*  It would choke Biden with his mouth.
*  It's not the only one.
*  Oh God like Hillary one like he has a didn't have a Warren one too.
*  Aren't you looking for something that doesn't exist.
*  I mean how do you come on.
*  That's this guy understands the culture.
*  I want you to look up hashtag toddler Trump on Instagram.
*  Oh I saw this.
*  I saw this lady made this face swap video that's worthy of Kyle Dunnigan.
*  It's Trump's face on a baby and she starts telling it.
*  She starts talking to the baby accused the baby doing things the baby.
*  No no no no no.
*  Have you seen it.
*  Yeah it was on Jimmy Kimmel show.
*  Right.
*  But the lady let's give the lady credit who made it.
*  She's she's got a bunch of funny shit on her.
*  Jimmy Kimmel credits Dr.
*  Fakenstein.
*  So oh is it.
*  Yeah.
*  OK.
*  Perfect.
*  So again I don't think this lady attributed back to you know being the arbiter of what's
*  online with the deep fakes and shit.
*  It's going to get so wild.
*  Give me some volume on this.
*  Go from the beginning.
*  What Jimmy Kimmel is talking.
*  Oh this is the Jimmy Kimmel one.
*  No no no don't do that one here.
*  Go no hashtag on Instagram.
*  Go to toddler hashtag toddler Trump.
*  OK.
*  You said it's adorable but it's honestly also terrifying.
*  Deep fakes are terrifying.
*  They are.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a this one is particularly cute though.
*  Yeah.
*  Here I'll send you the.
*  I found it.
*  Here it is.
*  There's a.
*  Here it is.
*  That's it.
*  You did.
*  You also said the virus could go away by April.
*  No sir.
*  You said it would disappear like a miracle.
*  Yes.
*  You said only 15 people have it and it would go down close to the ground.
*  No.
*  No sir.
*  You said it would disappear like a miracle.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  You said it would disappear like a miracle.
*  No sir.
*  You said only 15 people have it and it would go down close to zero.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  Come on.
*  How cute is that?
*  You said chloroquine would treat it.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  That's a bad thing.
*  You said we should try injecting disinfectants.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  You said anyone who needs a test can get one.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.

*  Imagine if your kid actually had Trump's little face, and you'd be like, what do we do?
*  Imagine if your kid was born.
*  And that was actually a real baby.
*  If he wasn't even a face swap.
*  It's just people.
*  Their kid got a fucking shit head, rolled the dice.
*  Kid's got a 70-year-old man's face.
*  The fuck do we do?
*  And you're like in a liberal place.
*  Your kid looks like Trump.
*  And you're taking him to the supermarket.
*  this way we voted for pence i mean
*  that that's the i the internet at its best is what's doing stuff like that there's a little
*  pens can be president like if if trump some what if he dies what if trump gets covid and dies that
*  would be that's not happening what if pence won what if whatever they're really do you think this
*  country would handle president pence yeah i mean be super religious well now yeah but it doesn't
*  matter because now the culture wars it's just who are you know red and blue yeah we are deep and
*  we're deep i people are always talking about how the civil war is coming and i'm like that's
*  ridiculous i don't know if the civil war is coming but something's happening there's a violent split
*  between two sides here and i think we're using it as it's sort of a focus of our frustration and
*  our attention that's not necessarily rational well everything more than it is everything's become
*  political yeah everything well it's the focus of our attention instead of like the the distraught
*  feelings that we're having because our life's been turned upside down by a virus then it's become
*  trump's fault trump's fault no it's first of all it's that lab in wuhan or the wet market that's
*  that's what happened yeah okay that's that's whose fault it was was it their fault that they didn't
*  stop sooner yeah but a lot of people didn't know what the fuck was going on was there bad mistakes
*  made yeah but it's a lot of it's touch and go what did china do a wrong thing yeah they fucked up hard
*  and you can't listen to them you can't trust them did the world health organization carry their water
*  and have their back yes they do you can't trust them did did who can you trust trust yeah i wonder
*  what the fuck this was that's the problem though you we live in a world in society where people
*  don't know who to trust so it's easier to just get on board somewhere ideologically for your own
*  brain you know we need we need like a news snopes but a good one like a one something that breaks
*  down the news and says okay is this true here's why it isn't and here's what we know because
*  here's what we don't know and here's where it gets confusing it's so much entertainment i was watching
*  that interaction that trump had with the reporter the other day and which one the chinese lady yeah
*  and there's me chinese american the woman yeah and the the interaction his interactions with
*  the press are my least favorite it if and i was saying this before we started if if this was like
*  a movie i was watching i'd be rooting for the meteor there's no likeable you know the press
*  thinks they're david and goliath but it's really like goliath and goliath and all the people just
*  desperately looking for truth are the little david's out there trying to get make sense of it
*  but it's not there's no everybody's so narcissistic there was that freaking thing last night on
*  anderson cooper had you know they had gretta on and then they talked to gretta and then he manages
*  to take precious time during a pandemic to talk about the fact that people on twitter were giving
*  him shit because they put gretta thunberg on there as an expert i'm like how do you guys manage
*  to always fucking make the news about you there's so much shit going on in the world and you're
*  worried that people called you out because yeah nothing says this isn't an overblown hoax per
*  head like there are people who think this is a hoax and there are people who think that it's a
*  doomsday called the pandemic and then the way that they're gonna calm people down is by putting
*  gretta on but did you see cnn had this thing where rand paul was talking to dr fauci and then
*  this is the title of the argument or the title of the article was something along the lines of
*  rand paul says to to dr fauci you're not the end all hear his response you know what it really said
*  what he really said he went over this first of all rand paul is a real doctor he's a doctor
*  second of all he's had covid he survived he looks like it he needs some vitamin day
*  he survived it and he also survived it with a fucked up lung that he got when his neighbor
*  attacked him and broke his ribs right they had to remove a piece of his lung so this guy was in
*  rough shape before he got covid and then was describing to dr fauci his reservations about
*  the advice that fauci is given and then the direction that the current government is the
*  way the way they're handling this in terms of like locking people down and making people stay at home
*  and he had some reservations about that it wasn't simply like he like said some awful thing to dr
*  fauci like you're not the end all he said basically with all due respect as much as i appreciate you
*  or as much as i respect you i don't think you're the end all for this and then dr fauci's response
*  was i i am not the end all for this and what i am is a biological virus scientist or whatever the
*  fuck he is explained what he did i mean he handled it well too but you look at the the title of the
*  video was so misleading the title from the video could have been rand paul and dr fauci in an
*  exchange yeah but that doesn't that doesn't get clicks but you can't trust anybody who doesn't
*  give you that because that's what the thing really was so anybody who doesn't give you that is
*  fucking with you they're pulling your strings nobody's but again when the news became a business
*  it became a problem it was it was now it's incentivized all there are all the it's perverse
*  incentives i know but don't you think if there was a place where you knew that didn't take place
*  there would be value in that i can this in this crazy battleground yeah i do i do but there's no
*  institutional support for it i don't know about that i think if someone did something like that
*  on the internet i mean even believe and i don't agree again with like everything rand paul says
*  but i do think what was the bill that didn't get passed because these fucking the the patriot act
*  came up um yesterday parts of the patriot act came up for renewal and there was a basically
*  yesterday wasn't a bill passed that some amendments that were getting it was an amendment and they were
*  supposed to pass an amendment that was against the um i think it's like internet searches without a
*  warrant yeah so now they can search because bernie and a bunch of other people didn't show up to vote
*  now they can search our searches without a warrant yeah matt taibbi tweeted about that like all the
*  people that are pro bernie like look what he did yeah i uh obviously that's not good i'm not but
*  again you're not hearing that stuff gets lost no you don't that's the shit that makes me want to
*  like burn everything down because our our freedoms those are the ones the freedoms that are actually
*  getting passed through and i think only like 14 democrat democrats vote voted against it i don't
*  i don't how is that not a huge part of the news today because because people actually get fucking
*  pissed off about stupid petty shit because i think they can get their minds around it and when it
*  comes down to like oh they can now search your internet searches without a warrant everyone's
*  like i can't deal with i don't yeah but bill mahr told rose mcgowan in the 90s that he has a huge
*  cock why aren't we marching in the streets why i know there's so much data coming in there's so
*  many things to think of because we can't march in the streets you can't even go outside as we're on
*  lockdown yeah that's the thing i'm wondering what's going to happen in california um i have a friend
*  of mine that i respect very much and he sent me these messages today and he goes they're going to
*  fucking riot he goes people are not going to tolerate california being locked down until august
*  now there's people that are not going to just stand by while their families go hungry and there's no
*  money coming in like these bureaucrats and politicians don't understand what they're saying
*  what they're asking and he said they're going to ride i just feel like they're not in touch with
*  people the politicians i mean they think that you know i hear online they're like oh it's all these
*  rich people who are mad that and they this doesn't affect them like who do you think i go to the
*  beach with it's not it's the people who are living inland it's not like yeah rich people have pools
*  they're not mixing with us plebs down at the beach i think it's plebs plebs i mean
*  it is plebs but i always say plebs yeah it's um they work with politicians they're they're
*  you know like when you're around comics and you think you can say things because you're used to
*  saying crazy shit around comics like you ever do that when you're around people yeah and you just
*  drop a word that you probably shouldn't say and people are oh yeah she's a cunt you called her a
*  dumb cunt like and people just like really fall apart like oh i'm sorry i'd say things that are
*  purposely wrong on for fun like that's part of okay i won't do that around you no okay but not
*  you i'm saying you know when you're around people that aren't comics yeah you slip up i do all the
*  time well that's how politicians are yeah around politicians all the time yeah so they're saying
*  stupid shit that doesn't really resonate with people that are actually losing their livelihood
*  that was like that one chick who she's like responsible for the ab5 bill and she said to
*  like fuck elon musk on twitter exactly she's destroyed like livelihoods long before the
*  pandemic came along she was fucking people up how was she fucking people up she because ab5 makes
*  it impossible to be a freelance contractor basically you either have to you it was why
*  freelance writers were trying to get her to make revisions and now she has two more bills that are
*  revising i'm like when your bill is so bad that you need other bills to try and fix it because
*  she didn't think of all the consequences of this bill what is the bill ab5 it's a bill that makes
*  essentially it was supposed to make it so these gig workers had to become employees and theoretically
*  it's i mean everyone says that it's because she's basically in the union's pocket so you either you
*  either need to join a union or become an employee but most people in la myself included are freelance
*  so it made it so you can't do more than 32 freelance pieces per month for example and so
*  people in california were losing their writing contracts because companies in dc and places in
*  new york were like we don't want to deal with this because we basically have to make you an employee
*  otherwise we'll get a fine so you have to either make some it it basically kills your ability to
*  be a freelance worker yeah it's nuts if you haven't i'm not an expert on this my friend kira
*  davis she's down um she is like deep down the rabbit hole and she's been you know fighting for
*  because it hurts like manicurists it hurts anyone who's basically freelance anyone who gets anyone
*  who gets a um uh why am i blanking on it what is it where you get like a freelance if you hire a
*  designer you know up to a certain amount of money you have to basically make them employee
*  it's messed up what's my gym oh was it like a 1099 yeah if so and it's it's just like
*  completely messed up so people were have been yelling at gavin through this whole thing about
*  during the pandemic they're like you have to overturn ab5 because now you're hurting people
*  you're this bill is hurting people who could make money at a time where they can't even make money
*  at all and yeah i can't believe you know you i you really things i know but ab5 is in california
*  and it's like it's fucked a lot of people up in particular freelance anything photographers writers
*  makeup artists anyone who basically gets paid um not by salary so do you think or not by the
*  unions talk them into passing it this way it's something to do with the uber driver the the
*  ride share drivers because their her argument is that it's to protect workers like uber and lift
*  drivers who the company can say you are you're working a gig and we don't need to protect you
*  at all or give you any kind of benefits or give you sick time or anything or insurance or anything
*  and so it forces you to either join a union basically but they're so her argument is that
*  it's protecting vulnerable people from being exploited by these big corporations which there
*  has to be a way to do that without forcing everybody either to become an employee because
*  she's saying basically you can't work like she said to me as a freelance writer you cannot work
*  you can't write more than 32 freelance pieces per month or you will have to join um you'll have to
*  be employed by whoever you might be writing now if you're a freelance writer some of my friends
*  are cranking like a hundred of these things out it's how they make their living so i don't know
*  is it there are people who are much more educated on this than i am i i know very little about it
*  but because basically the way you protect yourself if you're someone like me who all i get 10.99 by
*  everyone i get 10.99 by patreon um you have to incorporate so i have to become a corporation
*  but that costs 800 in california just to incorporate so not everybody has the money to
*  become a corporation and that's the way that you could protect yourself from getting a fine
*  because if i made a certain amount of money or if i wrote a certain number of pieces i would be fined
*  for not having um either the person that works for me would be fine i again i'm not exactly sure how
*  it works because i had to just take measures and incorporate but not everybody can do that so
*  that's a bummer that sounds like there was good intentions but it just got fucked up she's she's
*  i wish that i could believe that but just seeing the way she behaves even when anyone calls her
*  i mean there were there's a whole website devoted to people who are telling stories of how i had
*  three friends who were writers who had to leave california so people were leaving california
*  before any of the pandemic because they couldn't make their living here anymore and this was her
*  and it was because of her bill she totally fucked over all these people single moms like people who
*  are supposed to be the people that in theory she was protecting and there's a whole website with
*  story after story after story um larena what's her last name gonzalez just the fact that she's
*  the one who went after elon just tweeting fuck elon moss yeah come on yeah that's it that's your
*  whole thing such a virtue signaling move but i mean again i can't we have a president who's
*  who's tweeting you know there's like no civility in politics anymore he provides jobs that's true
*  that's one thing that trump did that really eroded it was his lack of civility encourage
*  lack of civility among these young politicians that are coming up like and that's when you get
*  to see things like fuck elon musk imagine if you saw a politician say that 10 years oh my god i
*  can't i can't believe it even every time i hear it i still flinch it would be insane yeah it would
*  be insane you wouldn't believe it was real now how is that real yeah that it's it's something that
*  i wish got more attention and it's definitely something that was turning people red before
*  all of the pandemic and the lockdown when talcy gabbro was on she said fuck a couple of times
*  and i was like she's running for president she said fuck we're gonna get in trouble no she yeah
*  but it's a a lot of people were already kind of leaving because of this and there's a i'll send
*  when we're done i'll find you the whole website california's got real problems right now and
*  especially again if these other states open up and they control everything and they do all right and
*  they don't have massive deaths i mean one thing that i i have read is that sweden did have a
*  larger number of deaths than people of the countries of a similar size because there's
*  been this narrative that they did it right they did it right it's not true though i think once
*  you actually dig down into it there's more again more nuance to that exactly yeah that's what i
*  read today that it wasn't necessarily but also what sweden did they did because they thought it
*  was the right thing for them that's a whole different way to live they live in little
*  villages there's not that many of them it's not it's not a giant ass fucking country like america
*  the idea that you should have the same law for idaho in boise or in the fucking mountains as you
*  have for new york city is bonkers yeah that's crazy like you can't have that yeah so it is kind
*  of interesting that the states get to choose how they handle this yeah yeah i mean that's the way
*  should work that i'm actually glad to see that that's yet the then the other weirdest part of
*  this whole fucking clusterfuck that we've been talking about is watching the trump is literally
*  hitler crowd for a while they were all calling for him to institute martial law yeah i'm like
*  you guys are crazy the governor said that the governor said that today he was talking about
*  martial law why well no but he they wanted trump to institute federal martial law i'm like you want
*  the guy that you're saying is literally hitler to take over the whole country and not let every
*  state do what they're supposed to do do you even hear yourselves right because they don't want
*  people deciding in this state that they should be able to open up early it's what's up jim
*  i'm trying to understand it so that's why i didn't want to bring up too fast but a federal judge
*  just passed something that said uh los angeles has like a week to move all homeless people away
*  from the vicinity of a freeway or underpass what oh shelter good
*  it's unreasonably dangerous to allow people to live in areas that may be contaminated with lead
*  and other toxins or that carry increased risk of being injured or killed in a car crash or
*  earthquake wait a minute no no that's why they're moving them no they should move them because
*  they're not supposed to be there what about the fact that they're like it's unreasonable to let
*  them get typhoid he said he was compelled to intervene because neither the city or county
*  appeared to be addressing this problem with any urgency no they're not doing shit look gavin our
*  gavin newsome our governor was the mayor of san francisco have you been to venice since this no
*  because they put they made all the market p you know how you go down to venice and there'd be all
*  the booths well you can't do that and nobody's allowed out and it's like a tent city oh my god
*  they're everywhere well you know they did a on purpose tent city in brentwood oh okay oh yeah
*  the big one by the veterans that's crazy they have american flags on their tents i'm like did
*  that come with the tent they gave you they're never gonna move they're never gonna move so if
*  your person is thinking about buying they're nice tents with american flags so they're looking at
*  that and then they're you know if you're gonna buy a house in brentwood like you're gonna you
*  invested all your money you've saved you finally we're gonna put our first money down on a home
*  honey and then you look like let's 2.3 million dollar 1200 square foot over pricey news and bad
*  news yeah the good news is we found a spot in brentwood the bad news is it's three feet
*  from the homeless shelter so you're gonna hear people do math and and fucking shoot heroin in
*  the middle of the night i drove by that the other day i was shocked it's like the whole around the
*  whole park and in it well they're around the park with the people that don't want to follow the rules
*  so inside the in the inside the park you have to social distance you have to keep your tent
*  x amount of feet apart but outside they're like fuck you man i'm over here i'm a rebel so there's
*  people on the outside with their own tents so you got the inside tent people that are the rule
*  following homeless people and then you get the outside tent people that don't give a fuck
*  just outside the park yeah just outside the park how about san francisco they put them in hotels
*  and give them weed and booze i was like i say let's i was joking that that seems like a good
*  way to solve their housing crisis just incentivize homelessness if you left where would you go
*  hmm it's funny because i've been thinking about leaving before everybody was thinking about
*  leaving and now that everybody is i'm like this is like when everyone's reading harry potter i'm
*  like no well it sounds like that bill was the first alarm right there have been a couple alarms
*  i mean for me i can't i'm not wealthy and i can't get ahead i want a house you know i was i was
*  looking at arizona actually arizona's great yeah and i was looking around there and it's close
*  enough to uh i i like tucson you know it's hot as fuck but um prescott is interesting it's much
*  cooler there but it's like a retirement community from what i can tell what about sadona a lot of
*  hippies there you can pray i'll never start your own cult i'm gonna start a cult so don't as a spot
*  for you maybe just start talking about channeling and energy i was i was thinking about texas you
*  know like everybody but that's the problem everybody's thinking about texas and it's gonna
*  they're wild and free for now until everybody moves there and votes like a lib exactly that's
*  what they did in nevada you know nevada's governor is a democrat where where would so you're thinking
*  about texas i thought are you really gonna go you're gonna leave the comic store i don't know
*  if the comic store is gonna exist why because it's been shut down for months and it might
*  continue to be shut down we don't know when they're gonna be able to have a live show again yeah
*  we don't know yeah what if it's 2021 what if it's somewhere around like be very tempting
*  April of next year yeah i mean if it's not making money that spot would be very hard if you owned
*  it not to just be like all right it's gonna be a high rise listen this whole world right now i'm
*  saying listen like i know but the whole world in a year from now is going to be unrecognizable the
*  whole world this is kind of a disruption of the economy is unprecedented we've never had it
*  worldwide no one's ever had it yeah it's not like things are just going to start back up again
*  people that would work forever are starting from scratch this is what's so frustrating to people
*  because politicians for the most part are not people that are successful business people
*  they're politicians yeah especially the lifetimeers and they're getting to dictate how
*  professional businesses operate and run and what they need to stay open and what they need to stay
*  alive and their solution to everything is we'll get them we'll send them money and but in the funds
*  do you see the Pelosi's fund this is what they would they put in a bunch of like like provisions
*  for women who own cannabis businesses and shit it's like a social justice warriors dream it's
*  i feel like again i i hate to be the like both sides girl but i think everybody's that's a bit
*  of a grab grab bag for everybody and that's how it always is with politicians right yeah with the
*  bailouts i'm so like no bailouts like fuck all these especially the cruise ships fuck you they're
*  not even american i know they're not even supposed to be here i know it's outrageous that's why we
*  put the homeless people put them on the cruise ships like you know we're talking about that
*  because then the amount of money that across a week it's like 100 bucks a week yeah you could
*  be on a cruise ship like that's like less than 25 dollars but that's where they all get it i think
*  of course but they'll be fine they'll be like prisoners will they get it and but everybody's
*  asymptomatic i just every time the cruise ship stuff comes up i think about bill burr's routine
*  oh he has a routine on cruise ships yeah he does a whole thing about that's how he's gonna like
*  thin out the population if he's a dictator which uh specials is on it's on um
*  the most recent one walk your way out i think no not the most recent one it's the one uh in between
*  yeah yeah yeah i think that's the one i haven't seen it is so i saw the black and white one and
*  i saw the paper tiger one's excellent it's really good the most recent one's my favorite
*  that's probably that's my favorite really the i don't know paper tiger is really good too
*  the new one's very good i was listening to it i was watching that i didn't i don't know if i saw the
*  whole thing and then one day i was in my room and my roommate was watching it and all i heard was
*  screaming for like 25 minutes and i was like who what are you watching she's like bill burr i was
*  like oh wow he got angry this special i don't remember him being so mad um i thought she was
*  watching just something but yeah she's screaming laughing no he was screaming all i heard was
*  screaming from the television i'm like what are you watching oh i thought it was her she was
*  screaming at him yeah it was funny it was really it was that's a good idea though but but homeless
*  people on the cruise ships would really solve the problem because it costs jamie and i were
*  talking about it with tim dillon but it costs like 105 for a week like you can't eat for 105
*  dollars for a week yeah right if you only got 100 bucks a week for food you'd be kind of
*  fucked like god damn it you know if you want to eat healthy you'd have to go mcdonald's like that's
*  like 10 bucks a day is 70 for the week imagine living on 10 bucks a day for food you have to
*  you'd have to eat fast food or really good food but even if you ate steak and fish yeah yeah that's
*  that's more than 10 bucks a day yeah you know if you're eating healthy carnival cruise look at this
*  look at this 105 i loved him four nights okay that's not bad that's different were we looking at a
*  carnival one before maybe we should do a stand-up show on a cruise
*  are they up and running they are up and running no this is for september it says so but in september
*  they are what if we take all of stand-up comedy to the cruise lines why do that when you go to
*  texas texas comedy clubs already open texas the comedy clubs are open houston comedy club houston
*  improv's open brian cowell's there next weekend okay okay he's there yeah like what is today's
*  day i think cal's there the two weeks all of that two weeks all of that angst the energy for me has
*  been going i've just been pouring it into like my it's basically me yelling in my garage my
*  neighbors must think i'm insane um and dumpster fire but it's not the same you know i have two
*  my roommates samantha and my cousin that's my audience and i just am like well and then
*  people sold out of course it's sold out bam i mean this is this is the this is the difference
*  this is the thing that could make me move what stand up being able to go do things yes my friend
*  in austin adam curry he texted me he goes i went to a restaurant it was like wow yeah he was telling
*  me about it yeah he did it weeks ago yeah texas it was like two weekends ago he went to a restaurant
*  texas is yeah there was a great book that i was reading it was all about the genius of the texas
*  constitution and why no matter how many people from and i'm not exactly sure why so don't even
*  ask me to explain it but i should find the book um it's basically like their constitution is so
*  good it couldn't become california even if everybody in california moved there
*  really so i have to find this book it's really it's interesting i'm just not that well they were a
*  republic right they were they were like uh they were a unit could actually secede from the union
*  they weren't they weren't the same as a might at this rate they might it might be worth it for them
*  who knows this this fucking thing is so weird like the world is a different place than it was in
*  january january rolled around you had one idea of the world and here we are in may and it's a
*  different world never that's never happened before without some sort of a monstrous i mean it has i
*  think terrestrial event or war yeah other than that what's ever happened like this where everybody
*  got shut down financially yeah that's that's what's the positive side of things i think is
*  that businesses will start again hopefully people will get through this they'll be resilient i think
*  people are and i think also people will understand that it can go away right and so we'll be much
*  more hesitant to give up the reins like we did this time i was on mother's out on mother's day
*  and it was basically in brentwood and it was like everyone was out there's traffic again yeah people
*  were driving around yeah they're not following the rules no no no but we'll be much more hesitant to
*  give up the reins this irresponsible government they didn't know what they were doing and they
*  pretended they did and once they had an idea and they were implementing that idea they refused to
*  be flexible and they changed the goalpost is elon actually leaving he's thinking about leaving he
*  doesn't know what to do he opened up his plant he's like fuck you arrest me and they're like oh just
*  kind of open up they're not doing shit about it that was like the cops on the beach they were
*  like please leave the beach and everyone's like fuck you elon musk has a goddamn bullhorn though
