# Joe Rogan Experience #2178 - Sam Morril
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=my3ylLkGJmU)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Shrain by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day!
*  Cheers sir.
*  Cheers.
*  Awesome to be at the club last night.
*  It was fun having you.
*  Last night was fun.
*  It was a good night.
*  Really fun.
*  Yeah, it's a fun place man.
*  Yeah.
*  A little Disneyland.
*  Yeah.
*  It also is like a throwback.
*  I'm like, I left Kill Tony on Monday.
*  I was like, I haven't had my shirt smell like cigarettes in a while.
*  Yeah, all those guys in the green room are smoking cigarettes.
*  I had one.
*  I don't smoke.
*  It's so contagious.
*  But I was like, I have one.
*  What the hell?
*  What the hell?
*  Yeah, that's a what the hell room.
*  Yeah.
*  This is a, I mean, it's one of those things like you create something with like this intention
*  and you kind of hope that it'll work out good.
*  But that place almost sort of made itself into what it is.
*  It's like, it's got an energy to it.
*  I think it's also because of that building.
*  Now, the building was made in 1927 and everybody's performed there.
*  Willie Nelson performed there.
*  Stevie Ray Vaughan.
*  Like you look in the wall, black flag, all the walls inside the green room, all those
*  posters.
*  Those are all bands, misfits, all bands that performed there.
*  Wow.
*  Because it was a rock club for a long time.
*  And then the whole thing, it was like all, but it's a big venue though.
*  I don't know if it was two different rooms.
*  I think at one point in time, it was just one room.
*  Yeah.
*  And then I think with the Alamo Draft House, they turned it into two rooms.
*  Then it was a movie theater for like 10 years.
*  And then when they went under, we had the two rooms.
*  Then we just adjusted everything and changed a lot of stuff and turned it into a comedy
*  club.
*  Yeah, it's cool as fuck.
*  But it's got, that building's alive, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Like you walk in the building and you're like, this fucking building's alive.
*  It feels like everyone's a comedy fan too.
*  And you walk in, it's pretty cool.
*  Yeah.
*  You build it, they will come.
*  It's like the field of dreams.
*  Yeah.
*  Not for everybody.
*  For you it is, but not for everybody.
*  What do you mean?
*  Well, I mean, a lot of people are building comedy clubs.
*  They don't come.
*  Yeah, but they don't do it that way.
*  You did it right.
*  But we did it, I swear to God.
*  I mean, it sounds stupid.
*  I don't believe in fate necessarily.
*  I don't not believe in fate, but I'm not like one of those people that's like preaching it.
*  If I wanted to believe in fate though, I would believe in fate because of this.
*  Because it's like every, it's like, you ever drive and you just hit every green light for
*  whatever reason?
*  I can't drive.
*  I have a license, but I'm dog shit.
*  It hurt me as a young comic because Joe List would always shit on me because we did a road
*  gig like, I want to say like almost 15 years ago together, where I got us the gig, it was co-headlining,
*  but it was a casino run and the thing was like, you have to split the driving.
*  It was like 30 hours of driving total.
*  So he's like, can you split the drive with me?
*  I said, of course.
*  And we got, I already fucked up because we flew into the wrong city on the wrong day because of me.
*  I was such a fucking young idiot.
*  So we flew into like Michigan, we were supposed to start in Wisconsin and he was like, you fuck,
*  so we're pro rated?
*  I was like, I fucked us, we're pro rated.
*  And then he was already mad at me.
*  And then he's like, all right, it's your turn to drive.
*  And I started driving.
*  He was like, what the fuck is happening?
*  This is horrible.
*  And he always quotes me as saying like, no, I'm not a bad driver.
*  I just can't turn well.
*  And he was like, yeah, that's a bad driver, you fucking idiot.
*  So he tells this story about me all the time being like a city, he calls me a city hick.
*  That's like, he started calling me that.
*  But yeah, I can't really, I have a license.
*  I passed the test, but I'm dog shit.
*  It's not that hard though.
*  I know I'm that bad.
*  I don't know why I'm that bad at it.
*  That's so weird.
*  You're so smart.
*  I would imagine you're smart to talk to.
*  Thank you.
*  I'm a bad driver.
*  You're good socially.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  You're easy to talk to.
*  So I would imagine you'd fucking be able to negotiate the distances between vehicles and
*  turn the wheel.
*  I bullshit my way through a license.
*  I failed two tests in New York.
*  They were in the Bronx.
*  And then I got a driver who I made her laugh out of the gate.
*  And I was like, I'm in.
*  Like I just said, like, I suck at this.
*  I failed two, please don't fail me.
*  And she laughed.
*  And I was like, I'm in.
*  I'm going to.
*  And I hit something and she passed me.
*  Wow.
*  Would you hit?
*  I don't remember.
*  It was a cone or something.
*  It was like, it was minor.
*  It was minor.
*  Yeah.
*  It was a kid.
*  It was not a big deal.
*  I hit a kid, but she was like, you got me to laugh.
*  Man, I can't imagine not being able to drive because it's just like, it's free.
*  Driving is freedom.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't drive and there's a car there.
*  Like, what the fuck?
*  It's also freedom to have someone else drive you though.
*  If that still happens.
*  That's true.
*  If everything goes sideways and there's no more Uber and no more Lyft.
*  Yeah.
*  And you have to figure out how to work a stick shift.
*  I'm in trouble.
*  Yeah.
*  You're in real trouble.
*  Yeah.
*  If there's a civil war, it's going to be hard to hail a cab.
*  Yeah.
*  If there's a civil war, where are you going to go?
*  I think I'm going to cave pretty early.
*  Are you?
*  No, I don't know.
*  I don't know what I'll do.
*  Come here.
*  I'm welcome here?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  And if it goes sideways, you want to be in Texas.
*  Because this place is already ready to be its own country.
*  But why do you guys want me?
*  What do I bring to the table?
*  You're funny.
*  That's all you need.
*  I'll take it.
*  Good guy.
*  Good guy.
*  Funny.
*  Good to hang with.
*  That's all we need.
*  I have one bad set that there's going to be a talk later.
*  We've got to cut this guy.
*  Nah, we've seen too many good sets.
*  I'm not buying it.
*  One bad set, you just need a pep talk.
*  That's like Theo Vaughn.
*  Oh, I did a gig with him once and we did a gig in Edmonton together and he was so in
*  his head when I was like, they were like obsessed with you.
*  What are you worried about?
*  But we had to cancel the fucking, this was crazy.
*  It's how we're in Edmonton and there was like wildfires in Edmonton.
*  And this is how different personalities we are.
*  Like I'm fucking in my, I'm like, oh, the show is going to be canceled.
*  We're not going to be able to perform out here.
*  This is like bad air quality.
*  And he's like, nah, man, it's cool.
*  And then within 10 minutes the agents call and they were like, the city shut down.
*  You can't, and this was like right after COVID.
*  So I'm like, we can't perform indoors.
*  We can't perform outdoors.
*  Like, can we do fucking anything?
*  And they were like, we just stay an extra day.
*  And we're like, of course.
*  And then we were like, the air will be better, right?
*  And they're like, it's the next day, 10 times worse.
*  Like you couldn't, it smelled like a casino, but outdoors.
*  Were you in New York when they had that orange smoke in the air?
*  I felt so whenever something bad happens in New York and I'm not there, I feel like a
*  trader because I'm such a city hick.
*  But no, it was on, I was like, I think the second time I did my own tour bus.
*  So I was like really pumped to be on the road.
*  And I saw that I was like, I'm a piece of shit.
*  That's Canadian smoke too.
*  That was Canadian smoke.
*  That was weird.
*  The orange thing was weird.
*  It's like end of the, there's a lot of end of the world shit happening lately.
*  Oh yeah.
*  A lot.
*  The orange thing was weird too, because there was this great conspiracy because there was
*  some missing chemicals.
*  There was apparently missing chemicals, like serious amounts.
*  Does it always have to be like a comic book?
*  It's always so fucking creepy.
*  Well, the whole world is like basically some bizarre movie now.
*  The Trump thing, the shooter, all the stuff that's coming out about the shooter now, the
*  more you read about it, the more you're like, what is going on?
*  Black rock thing too, right?
*  Yeah.
*  He did a black rock commercial.
*  They knew that there was a suspicious person 10 minutes before Trump went on stage.
*  They still wouldn't let him go on stage.
*  They saw him on the fucking roof and they didn't engage.
*  They saw him on the roof with a rifle.
*  It's a bad Secret Service right there.
*  They wouldn't put Secret Service agents on the roof because they said there was a slope
*  to the roof and it would be dangerous.
*  It's more dangerous if the president, ex-president, get shot, which he did.
*  They let him get off.
*  The kid got off three shots and apparently there was one that we saw that hit his ear
*  and you see the bullet, like the photographer got a bullet flying by his head.
*  Apparently there's another one of a bullet going by his left side of his head.
*  So it went by the right side of his head, hit his ear, went by the left side of his
*  head as well because the guy got off three shots and he just missed Trump every time.
*  There's a one shot of him turning his head and I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?
*  It was that close?
*  Dude, it's so crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  It's so crazy and the fact that they had such poor security guarding him, they did such
*  a terrible job.
*  My uncle's convinced it's bullshit.
*  My uncle's like, there's no way this is real.
*  I don't think it's not real but look, here's the deal.
*  Okay, I'm not accusing anybody of anything.
*  I just want to be real clear.
*  But they have organized assassinations before.
*  And when they organize…
*  It usually starts a war.
*  …assassinations, it looks just like that.
*  And when they organize assassinations, one of the things they like to do is have some
*  fucking loser kill the president and then they kill the fucking loser and that's a
*  wrap.
*  This kid kind of like stops all the leads.
*  Everything's like, where's he go?
*  So they have his phone, they say they can't get into his phone.
*  Bitch, I know you read my text messages.
*  So how can you not get in that kid's phone?
*  How can you not get in that kid's phone?
*  It's always shady, right?
*  They always die instantly.
*  Like Kennedy assassination too, like a nightclub owner kills Lee Harvey Oswald.
*  I'm supposed to believe there's a nightclub owner with a heart of gold out there?
*  Runs right up and shoots him in front of cops.
*  Yeah.
*  What is this, the end of Shaft?
*  The fuck is going on?
*  The end of Shaft.
*  No, it's like, it's ridiculous.
*  Superfly.
*  That was the end of Superfly.
*  The new Shaft ended like that too.
*  The end of Superfly.
*  He tells him something stupid like that.
*  It's cinematic as fuck.
*  It all feels like a movie.
*  Yeah, it seems like a bad movie from the 70s.
*  Yeah.
*  It's weird.
*  That's how every 70s movie ended.
*  By the way, a guy just gets shot in the face.
*  Right, there's a lot of that.
*  Every movie, you're just like, it's like a guy gets shot in the face and then the credits
*  and you're like, I guess this is...
*  The guy on the roof is just bananas.
*  That roof was 150 yards away.
*  If you're a good shot with a rifle, hitting a human being at 150 yards is quite easy.
*  I don't know if his rifle had a scope.
*  I'm assuming it had a scope.
*  Someone said he was using iron sights.
*  Can you find out?
*  But he wasn't set up in advance.
*  He just went up there, right?
*  That's how they...
*  He had a rangefinder.
*  Okay?
*  So, the kid was walking around the whole perimeter of the area with a rangefinder, which is...
*  Instantaneously, if you're Secret Service, you see someone with a rangefinder walking
*  150 yards from where the president is, you tackle that fucking guy.
*  You don't let that guy get on a ladder.
*  This is your Super Bowl.
*  What the fuck are you doing?
*  He brought a ladder.
*  The guy didn't just bring a rifle.
*  He got through there with a rifle and a ladder.
*  I don't know what kind of rifle it is.
*  I don't know if it's kind of rifle where you could disassemble and reassemble like an assassin,
*  like screw it together.
*  But whatever it is, all of it stinks.
*  Part of it stinks.
*  And every person who talks about him, it's like the classic incel, like never spoke,
*  never...
*  This was an old bit of mine.
*  I was like, that should be the...
*  If you want a gun, you have to be a good conversationalist.
*  You better be chatty.
*  Because that's like every person who does these shootings things are assassinations.
*  It's like they're the quiet, creepy fucking dude.
*  Yeah.
*  It's very strange.
*  The whole thing's very strange.
*  There was also photos of him where he had long hair and wore lipstick and looked like
*  a good girl.
*  I think that was bullshit though.
*  I think that was fake.
*  Yeah, I think that was bullshit too.
*  But that's a problem.
*  Everything's bullshit now.
*  The commercials, the Black Rock commercial, and then there's some videos of him in high
*  school talking about having a 10 inch penis.
*  He looks like he's just having fun with his boys.
*  There's a video of him saying he's a 10 inch penis?
*  But it's like he's joking around.
*  I have a 10 inch penis.
*  That kind of thing.
*  Weird dude.
*  Just a weird kid.
*  Yeah.
*  But how did he get in the Black Rock commercial?
*  What happened after that?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, if I was the CIA, let's not even say CIA.
*  Let's say if I was some shadowy intelligence agency that did these undercover operations
*  that are a little sketchy.
*  I don't like flying kids like that.
*  That's your money maker.
*  That's how you do it.
*  If you got a plan, you want to do something, you get some guy that's basically got nothing
*  going on in life, and then you mentor him, become friends with him.
*  Maybe that guy's dad is an alcoholic who beats him.
*  Maybe his mom is a fucking junkie.
*  Who knows?
*  Maybe his life is terrible and you can provide mentorship and you can provide just camaraderie.
*  Something like, wow, I wish I was a secret agent.
*  And then you tell this guy, you tell this kid, hey, you can help America.
*  We can work you into the program.
*  You can be one of us.
*  So now you are saying conspiracy.
*  Listen.
*  You're entertaining it.
*  The conspiracies are real.
*  They're real.
*  I mean, whatever the fuck happened in Dallas, Texas in 1963, it's not what they tell you.
*  That's one thing 100% you're going to be sure that is there is no objective journalism with
*  no slant, not leaving anything out.
*  Whatever happened with Lee Harvey Oswald and the motorcade.
*  And Kennedy and having some beef with the CIA and some weird shit over maybe Bay of
*  Pigs or something, right?
*  Like they immediately.
*  How about Alan Dulles, who he fires.
*  He fires and then he gets assassinated and Alan Dulles is running the Warren Commission.
*  He's a part of the Warren Commission.
*  It's shady.
*  So much Kennedy shit over the years is so shady.
*  The shadiest.
*  Yeah.
*  The shadiest.
*  That he's the biggest indicator, the biggest piece of evidence that someone from somewhere
*  organized together to kill that guy.
*  It wasn't just Lee Harvey Oswald.
*  Although I'm of the opinion that Lee Harvey Oswald was also a part of it.
*  Yeah.
*  Because everybody wants it to be binary, right?
*  They want it to be one or zero.
*  Yes or no.
*  Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone or he was just a patsy.
*  But that guy clearly was also doing something with intelligence agencies because he was
*  able to go back and forth to Russia.
*  He learned Russian.
*  He married a Russian woman.
*  Yes.
*  Came back to America.
*  And he was also living very well when he was over there.
*  He was spending money that like, you're not making this on whatever per diem horse shit
*  you're making over there.
*  Exactly.
*  He was like going to night clubs and shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  The whole story sucks.
*  The whole story seems like he was some sort of undercover operative.
*  Like he was getting paid out.
*  Yeah.
*  And then I think that's how they do it.
*  They make you think you're a part of something and then they pin the whole thing on you.
*  And then, you know, I think there's probably multiple shooters.
*  I think there's probably multiple.
*  The grassy Noel thing seems super legitimate.
*  So have you ever looked into how many people who are witnesses that wind up dying in mysterious
*  manners?
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking crazy.
*  It is like we make fun of Russia for that shit.
*  But listen, we do it too.
*  Of course.
*  We're just a better country.
*  And we're cooler.
*  For sure.
*  I'm pro-America.
*  Let's get real.
*  Come on.
*  America all day.
*  All day.
*  But like if you read, I was reading a Putin book and literally every chapter just ends
*  with a guy like the light going out in his hallway and getting shot in the face.
*  And I'm like, this seems like a pretty fucked up rise to power.
*  You know?
*  Oh, Putin had the most fucked up rise to power.
*  That woman who just wrote the book on him, Masha, what's her name?
*  You know?
*  Did she wind up missing?
*  She's, I think, either on trial or going to prison for saying something anti-military
*  in Russia, which I'm like, all right, you know what?
*  Know your audience.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe don't say that in Russia.
*  She wrote a book on Putin?
*  What a gangster she is.
*  Yeah.
*  It's pretty badass.
*  That's a crazy move, man, to know they're going to come get you when you write that
*  book anyway.
*  Yeah.
*  Ooh.
*  That guy might be the richest man alive, you know?
*  He's really rich.
*  They don't know how rich he is.
*  I always hear that there are always rumors that he's not doing well and then nothing,
*  but there's always stomach problems.
*  Didn't he have like a stomach cancer?
*  That's all rumors, right?
*  Yeah.
*  But also, how much access to medicine does that guy have?
*  You know?
*  I mean, if there's a way to cure something, that guy, they're going to get it to him.
*  And you have to think that Russia is not captured by the pharmaceutical industrial complex, so
*  he probably has access to all of the off-book medicines that the FDA won't approve, and
*  all the trials, stuff that's like the good shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Shit that probably works right now.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like what Kobe used to go to like Germany for knee operations, because he's like, they
*  won't do this to me in America.
*  He would go there for Regenekin.
*  Regenekin, I've had Regenekin done.
*  Regenekin, it's like a very advanced form of platelet-rich plasma.
*  And I had a bulging disc in my neck, and one doctor was like trying to convince me that
*  I needed to get surgery.
*  He was like, we got to trim that disc.
*  You scolded me for doing this.
*  I did something like that.
*  Yeah, well, I almost did it, and I know too many people have done it.
*  That's why I was like, don't do it.
*  You can't do it.
*  But you helped me a lot, by the way.
*  I think I told you this.
*  Yeah, how's your neck now?
*  It's much better?
*  I'm great, dude.
*  I'm fucking awesome right now.
*  That's great to hear.
*  I saw another clip of you recently where you were talking about getting older, how you
*  have to just lift weights for your health.
*  I was like, all right, I got a trainer for my dad.
*  I'm like, you guys are getting older.
*  Lift weights.
*  I didn't do it, dude.
*  I would just play basketball.
*  I was like, I'll just hoop.
*  Then I started to have fucked up neck problems and stuff.
*  You gave me that neck thing, the iron neck.
*  Then I just started lifting shoulders.
*  I have such bad shoulders, man.
*  You're holding your neck up.
*  You got to...
*  Yeah, if you don't do anything, there's no muscle there.
*  Your muscle only exists if you have a reason for it.
*  If you get a cast, if you break your arm, your arm just shrinks out because you're not
*  using it.
*  Your body only uses muscles.
*  It only has muscles where you use them.
*  If you stop using them for a long period of time, they just fucking shrink.
*  It's a weird thing.
*  If you have to be bedridden for two weeks when you get up, you're a week as fuck.
*  Your body's like...
*  It doesn't maintain itself.
*  Except the dick.
*  The dick is up every morning.
*  It seems fine.
*  The dick's rocking, dude.
*  If you get older, it's more extreme because now your body's producing less testosterone,
*  less human growth hormone, you're not getting as much sleep, you're not repairing in your
*  sleep, and if you have bad diet on top of that, then it's all compounding over the years
*  and getting worse and worse and worse.
*  Your body doesn't have the nutrients to repair itself.
*  With all this atrophy, then you start getting people that bend over to pick up a package
*  and blow their back out.
*  How did you blow your back out from just bending over to tie your shoes?
*  That's the thing too, practical strength.
*  If you're lifting for like...
*  If you're doing deadlifts, you're like, all right, that's picking up a box.
*  This makes sense as opposed to people that are just trying to look...
*  I don't give a fuck about that.
*  I just want to not pull shit.
*  Yeah, you just want to not be old.
*  You could do a lot of stuff with just chin-ups and push-ups and bodyweight squats and Hindu
*  squats and...
*  There's a bunch of different things that you could do that are just...
*  The most important thing is you've got to do something.
*  It's not just walk around.
*  Really even cardio's not enough because cardio doesn't...
*  You don't strain the muscles to make them strong.
*  You need to do that.
*  It's a requirement for people just brushing your teeth keeps you from getting cavities.
*  It's the same thing.
*  You just have to think about it that way and most people don't.
*  But also think about it, it's like a compounded benefit because you get the benefit of that,
*  but then you also get the mental benefits.
*  If I'm not feeling good, if I'm a little out of it in my own head, a good solid workout,
*  I get out of there, I'm like, everything's fine.
*  Dude, I did it this morning.
*  I was like, I didn't want to do it.
*  I was hungover.
*  I didn't want to fucking do it, but I just light.
*  Just go light.
*  And then you get out of there and you're like, oh.
*  It feels so much better.
*  Way better.
*  That's my message to the world.
*  Please fucking do something.
*  I think we're designed for it.
*  I think that's what kept us alive for hundreds of thousands of years before we had agriculture
*  and we organized cities and we developed the stockpiles of food where you didn't have to
*  work as hard.
*  And then everything just shriveled away.
*  I think everybody had to do physical things.
*  And especially cities like this, you can just get in a car and just not walk.
*  At least in New York, I do find myself, I walk most places.
*  So I'm like, I'm doing something.
*  But it's not enough, but it's something.
*  It's better than nothing.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's definitely not enough.
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  You got to lift a little bit of weights.
*  Yeah.
*  And the problem is people have lifting weights in their head.
*  A lot of people, especially very smart people that have had bad experiences with jocks.
*  In their head, lifting weights is like some douchey vanity thing or a bunch of bros or
*  bumping chests.
*  You can't think about it that way.
*  Just because dumb people do a thing doesn't mean the thing is dumb.
*  No, it's actually smart.
*  The thing is actually very smart.
*  But intellectuals, a lot of very intelligent people don't exercise.
*  Yeah, Bill Gates does not look good.
*  I don't know if you'd call him an intellectual.
*  But you know what I mean?
*  Like a guy who has a lot of...
*  Sure.
*  A lot of...
*  A lot of resources.
*  A lot of resources.
*  Yeah.
*  But then Jeff Bezos does look good.
*  He looks very good.
*  Yeah.
*  He looks like he's Jack now.
*  Mark Zuckerberg looks great.
*  It's just a thing that people usually concentrate on one aspect or another.
*  If they're really into physical fitness and really into athletic shit and training and
*  sports, generally they're not as well read on international politics and environmental
*  issues.
*  It's one, or either you're socially conscious, really kind of aware of the world, understand
*  exactly what's going on in Gaza, or you know how much creatine you should take every day.
*  You know what branch chain amino acids are going to produce the best results?
*  And you know what peptides are the best for healing?
*  It's like we put things into two different boxes.
*  Either you're really into your body or you're really into your brain.
*  But I say you got to be into both.
*  Because if you're not really into your body, your brain is not going to work as good.
*  You're not going to have as much energy.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially as you get older.
*  Yeah, dude.
*  Yeah.
*  It's real.
*  It's...
*  The hangovers get worse.
*  They do.
*  It's fucking...
*  I didn't have that much last night.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I know.
*  I had like maybe two drinks.
*  Yeah.
*  Two good sized drinks on Tuesday.
*  And then Wednesday morning I woke up I was like, oh I feel like shit.
*  For two drinks.
*  They're stout.
*  It's probably really like legit four drinks.
*  When you're pouring them it doesn't count.
*  But I do that too.
*  That's what we do at the Comedy Cellar and you guys do it here too.
*  I saw it's like the pint...
*  Liz who manages the Comedy Cellar will drink martinis out of a pint glass.
*  And I'm like, yeah that's not a drink.
*  That's not a drink.
*  It's like eight drinks.
*  Yeah it's multiple drinks.
*  But martinis are...
*  Jamie bring over that fucking...
*  That Buffalo Trace, sir.
*  That's a drink.
*  Yeah.
*  Having a bar is interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  In what way?
*  Just that it's too much access?
*  I just go there and I see all these people just drinking.
*  It's like this is...
*  I have a bar.
*  Like what the fuck happened?
*  I know.
*  It's a cool bar.
*  It's a great bar.
*  Lovely people working there too.
*  And it's just such a great hang.
*  Especially because you know...
*  Generally they're mostly just with comics and waitstaff.
*  Thanks sir.
*  And you got to do that thing you were talking about yesterday about the...
*  Where's your glass?
*  Oh here we go.
*  Let's go.
*  Thanks dude.
*  Yeah well cheers to the fucking club being awesome man.
*  Cheers to you brother.
*  Thanks for being here.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  My pleasure.
*  Yeah having a bar is fun.
*  It's really nice.
*  It's nice.
*  It's a good place to hang.
*  What you don't have here is something I love about...
*  And look I'm a New Yorker till I die I'll never move.
*  But what I love about leaving a bar in the winter and just like the cold air hitting your face and your shit face.
*  I'm like oh that's just like...
*  It's like almost like getting slapped by the fucking earth.
*  Yeah.
*  I love it.
*  And there's a few like bars and we just like you leave a dive and you just feel like fuck I feel like a...
*  It gets cold here in the winter.
*  Does it?
*  Yeah it gets you.
*  We've had...
*  How cold?
*  Well it snows.
*  Really?
*  It snows every now and then.
*  It snowed real bad one year.
*  Like the first year we moved here and they closed everything down.
*  It was hilarious nobody knew how to drive.
*  And they don't have any plows.
*  So they don't just do anything they just wait till it gets warm.
*  Like this is the dumbest approach to snow management ever.
*  Fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  So nobody knew how to drive.
*  And you would see people in like Corvettes going sideways through intersections.
*  It's just everyone's sliding around.
*  Yeah.
*  So every year it gets below 30.
*  It gets in the 20s sometimes.
*  Yeah.
*  Trying to find...
*  This is the Jewish shit I'm going to do.
*  I might pop an antacid with this.
*  Because I've been drinking coffee all morning.
*  Does that help you?
*  Yeah.
*  Ulcers and shit.
*  Oh you have ulcers?
*  Ugh dude.
*  I just read something about that that they think ulcers have to do with some sort of stomach bacteria now.
*  Yeah.
*  Well these should help.
*  They used to think that it was like the lining of your stomach was getting eroded by stress.
*  And now they think it has something to do...
*  I think stress hurts it.
*  Oh it has to.
*  I hate to sound like a Jewish stereotype.
*  I think stress hurts everything.
*  Yeah.
*  I think stress hurts your immune system.
*  It hurts the way you sleep which fucks everything up too.
*  It exacerbates everything.
*  It just makes sense that things come up with stress.
*  But I think they have some new theory about the creation of ulcers that's different.
*  I think it has to do with microbiome.
*  Yeah.
*  I had to get put under and they were like...
*  They did the x-ray thing and they're like that's a fucking ulcer.
*  It's a big ulcer.
*  And I was like alright.
*  Damn.
*  But...
*  So what do they tell you to do like eat wise?
*  Just didn't do...
*  God it sucks.
*  They're like everything's bad basically.
*  You're like can't like...
*  I'm like oh how about coffee?
*  They're like yeah you can't have coffee.
*  I'm like well how about alcohol?
*  It's also I have a drinking pod with Norman.
*  So I'm like well I have to work.
*  I have to go do my thing.
*  And they're like what do you mean work?
*  I'm like well I drink on my podcast.
*  And they're just like...
*  What?
*  They're just like are you a fucking idiot?
*  And I was like yeah no I just...
*  Can I have one?
*  They're like drink clear liquor.
*  Like they're like...
*  I'm bargaining with them that I can still drink.
*  That's hilarious.
*  And then...
*  So then we did that.
*  And...
*  But then...
*  Yeah they're like no acidic foods.
*  No spicy foods.
*  I'm like this is like all my favorite shit.
*  Like acidic food is the best food.
*  And...
*  Yeah so I just had to chill for like two months with that.
*  I was boring as fuck on the road.
*  My friend Gary Veeder tours with me and he's so annoyed.
*  Because he wants every meal to be like a fucking home run on the road.
*  And I'm like you can...
*  I'll get whatever you want but I can't...
*  He wants to like share stuff so we can try more things.
*  So he's just getting annoyed that I'm getting like plain ass food for two months.
*  Oatmeal and chicken breasts.
*  That's everything I was eating.
*  Really?
*  But you feel weirdly kind of good aside from this like stinging in your stomach.
*  So you've never had one?
*  No, no I've never had one.
*  Damn.
*  Yeah I don't get ulcers.
*  It's such a weird thing.
*  And it sucks because all my friends who have had them are just like pieces of shit.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah my friends are like I've had them.
*  I'm like yeah you're like a fucking drug addict.
*  This sucks that this is who I'm comparing myself to you know.
*  When did you start getting them?
*  I got one years ago on the road in Montreal and I went to a doctor and he was just like
*  very French a matter of fact.
*  Like no alcohol for 11 days and I was like 11 day?
*  I was like how the hell...
*  I was a young comic.
*  What does it say?
*  Once common thought that stress, smoking and diet were the principal causes of stomach
*  ulcers however the Heliobacter pylori bacterium is now known to be responsible for the most
*  how do you say that way?
*  Duodenal ulcers and 60 percent of stomach ulcers.
*  The H. pylori bacterium also prompts many symptoms of indigestion.
*  Treatment for stomach ulcers includes the use of antibiotics to kill the infection
*  and acid suppressing drugs.
*  Yeah I take a pepsi a lot.
*  Also people that eat a lot of like...
*  Antibiotics.
*  It's interesting because antibiotics kill all the good bacteria too.
*  Yeah.
*  So that probably compounds the problem.
*  Yeah I'm probably on borrowed time here.
*  Antibiotics are tricky.
*  My friend Gordon, Gordon Ryan, he's like the greatest jujitsu athlete of all time.
*  He had staph so many times that he was basically on antibiotics for a whole year
*  and it ruined his stomach.
*  Like his stomach is fucked.
*  In what way?
*  He has the craziest stomach issues like some buildup of like fungus in there
*  and he's always ready to throw up.
*  He has a hard time putting down food.
*  I should be laughing at this but it's crazy.
*  It just sucks.
*  Well also when you see the guy, the guy looks like a Greek god.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're like there's nothing wrong with that guy.
*  Meanwhile his stomach is completely fucked and it's all started from...
*  You're not supposed to take antibiotics for a year
*  but all these meatheads are doing jujitsu in this basement in New York City
*  and everyone's getting staph infections and they don't want to stop training
*  so they just keep taking antibiotics and keep training.
*  That makes sense.
*  And then you know years later you're dealing with this stuff.
*  I gotta know how the fuck any doctor prescribed him that
*  or if he just self-prescribed.
*  Well if he's like a famous athlete I mean he probably...
*  I don't think he was that famous back then.
*  Like he wasn't as known back then.
*  He's very known now.
*  All you need is one doctor to be a fan.
*  Yeah.
*  I had a doctor back in the day he was like I love you on Kona
*  and I'm like can I get muscle relaxers?
*  He's like sure.
*  I mean I wasn't doing well but he had seen me kill on TV
*  so he's like this guy's cool.
*  So I was just racking up pills from him.
*  That's hilarious.
*  He's in the Philippines now I think.
*  He's not even in America anymore.
*  Oh boy he's on the run.
*  He's on the run.
*  He's on the run.
*  But for a while dude it was beautiful.
*  A lot of guys go to the Philippines and come back with wives.
*  A lot of older guys.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of older guys go to the Philippines.
*  They're pretty women.
*  Yeah pretty, young, super happy to not just be eating noodles.
*  Let's get out of this fucking country.
*  That's the pitch.
*  I would do like some just regular protein and yeah.
*  Well when you find out what most of the world makes in terms of money
*  you're like you know the number like with the 1%
*  if you're in top 1% of the world.
*  $34,000.
*  Oh shit.
*  Yeah.
*  If you make $34,000 American dollars you're in the top 1% of earth.
*  Crushing life man.
*  So all these people that talk about the 1% are like hey look in the mirror fuckface.
*  It's all of us.
*  It's literally all of us.
*  We're all ridiculous.
*  We're talking about people in America.
*  You know like this inequality of wealth.
*  What about the world?
*  Yeah.
*  What about the whole thing?
*  Also depends on the state you live in though because.
*  Oh yeah.
*  34 in some states ain't getting you far.
*  Oh it's not getting you far in most.
*  In most states it's not getting you far you know.
*  I mean it's certainly not getting you far in New York and LA.
*  But just you know just live.
*  Good thing to make $35,000.
*  Yeah nice.
*  Yeah dude.
*  People aren't walking over here.
*  Yeah.
*  For no reason you know.
*  Yeah.
*  They're walking across that border.
*  Yeah.
*  Because where they are is so bad.
*  It's so bad you can't imagine it.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a good point.
*  I love America.
*  It's the best.
*  I'm a big fan.
*  I'm a big fan.
*  I like even the cities I think I won't like.
*  I did a bit of my new special about Springfield Missouri and all the feedback I was getting
*  was like man it was so nice you talked about our city without shitting on it.
*  And I was like yeah I had a great time.
*  I will have a great time in any city for a night or two.
*  Well I think now in particular because of the internet there's more aware cool
*  sort of in tune people everywhere.
*  It used to be like back in the 80s when you would go do gigs on the road like
*  you're in the middle of bum fuck Ohio like it could be a terrible gig.
*  They don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
*  No references.
*  Everybody's dumb and drunk.
*  It could be horrible.
*  But somewhere in the 2000s that really changed.
*  Yeah.
*  You start to see when you go on the road kind of go to anywhere.
*  And if they're finding about you online and then you know they're finding out that your
*  tickets are for sale online then they go there.
*  Like these people are tuned into the world.
*  They just happen to live in Lexington Kentucky.
*  That's a great city.
*  It's great.
*  I love Lexington dude.
*  That place is fun.
*  I've had some good times there.
*  Forlouable.
*  The racetrack.
*  I want to go to the Kentucky Derby.
*  Have you been to Keeneland and Lexington Kentucky?
*  No.
*  Oh god.
*  What's that?
*  What's Keeneland?
*  It's like their horse racing thing.
*  You bet on the horses and everyone is so well dressed like seersucker suits.
*  They're fucking that was my opening line in the city.
*  I said I was the only person there that didn't look like a villain in Django Unchained.
*  They're all so well dressed with their mint julep and their drink.
*  And I was like I fucking love this.
*  That is not to mention like the bourbon in that town is so fun.
*  You just get fucked up and you feel good.
*  It's like a nice quality.
*  You go to like a random pub there and you look at the bourbon menu and you're like what the
*  fuck there's like a diner menu.
*  It's beautiful.
*  Yeah.
*  I like Kentucky.
*  Kentucky's great.
*  Underrated place.
*  I've never been to the Derby but everybody tells me it's a trip.
*  I read Hunter Thompson's.
*  The Kentucky Derby is decadent and depraved.
*  Have you ever read that?
*  I haven't.
*  Fucking amazing.
*  It's good.
*  Great piece.
*  Yeah it's just talking about how these rich monsters are there like letting their hair
*  down and getting crazy at this horse race Derby with all their nutty hats and you know the
*  women have to wear those bizarre hats.
*  But it's a scene.
*  It's a scene.
*  I have a buddy who goes every year.
*  He's like you gotta go.
*  It's fucking incredible.
*  And his wife go and they get dressed up.
*  They do the whole thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean it's that's what I love is like if it's new to me I want to do it.
*  Did you say formula?
*  You were saying formula racing?
*  I just started watching it a little bit.
*  And it's it's I mean it's here now right?
*  Yeah you should come.
*  You should come.
*  I might.
*  Do the weekend.
*  Really?
*  At the club when it's in October.
*  It's really fun.
*  Yeah if the weekend's not booked already I'll find out what's booked.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah dude it's amazing.
*  It's so fun.
*  First of all they're so fast when you're like sitting right next to the track like yeah yeah.
*  Like holy shit they're going 250 miles an hour.
*  Dude I know I had a friend who's driving me.
*  He's a very wealthy friend I have and he's driving me into McLaren and he was like showing
*  off in LA going fast and I was like what the fuck are you trying to kill me?
*  He's like dude we're going 50.
*  But it feels like you're going like 150 in those things.
*  Especially if someone knows how to drive.
*  Oh dude he's good.
*  I mean but those uh those racers are fucking incredible.
*  They lose like 20 pounds a match.
*  Yeah it's nuts.
*  It's super physical.
*  Yeah it's super physical and it's all about the reaction times.
*  I mean those guys they're the g forces they're experiencing going around those turns like
*  they have to have like stiff necks.
*  They have to have like stout necks just to handle the forces.
*  I respect it a lot.
*  It's one of the things I didn't really get till I watched that documentary Senna on that
*  racer and then I was like wow this is like knowing the angles and knowing when to turn
*  and just it's all any sport if you're thinking you fucking lose.
*  Right.
*  And there's a there's a uh a basketball analyst,
*  Wolf Frasier would always be like he's aiming his shot.
*  You know you can't be aiming your shot you got to trust the muscle memory.
*  Right right right right.
*  Anytime you think in sports it's fucking over.
*  I was just reading that Agassi book it's so good.
*  I didn't realize how good it my friend Matt Ruby was like you got to read the Agassi book.
*  It's hilarious.
*  He's so fucking he's a good writer.
*  I'm sure he had help but like it's well written and he's just talking about like you know he's
*  so in his head and he's like mad he's playing someone like Pete Sampras who's like he's
*  like I wish I was this this dull you know like this guy's like a brick wall he doesn't feel
*  shit.
*  Meanwhile Agassi's like going to see Broadway shows he's like an emo guy he's getting he's
*  an interesting dude he's like you know so angry like from his all these guys had abusive dads.
*  Right.
*  But he's you know he's he's so rebellious and angry his dad's forcing him to play tennis
*  that he's at this like tennis compound they're forcing him to get better and he's crushing
*  everybody because he's a prodigy but he's doing it in like mascara and a pink mohawk and an ear
*  and it's like a fuck you it's so funny I mean he's such an interesting guy I had no idea I
*  just didn't I don't know tennis that well but I mean I respect the fuck out of any
*  any sport that like you turn on you're like this is kind of great to watch.
*  Oh yeah tennis is insanely difficult to do at a high level when you watch those guys moving
*  and falling back and forth and all the different setups.
*  Oh my god.
*  Oh my angles and speed and like mind games because you're on an island man you're not
*  you're not like it's not a team sport you get like a high five every once in a while you're
*  alone that's why they're like cursing at themselves like you see Mack and we're like breaking a
*  rack and you're like I fucking get that.
*  And you have to be an insane physical shape because you can't get tired and not go for the ball.
*  And the heat and the different courts and the clay and grass and oh clay is so weird.
*  Oh it's the weirdest.
*  That's a weird court.
*  You're playing on clay.
*  It rains you're like so it's mud like what are we doing here this is so fucking weird
*  but uh yeah no he's there's a story about him when he was nine and his dad is such a fucking
*  grifter that is that his dad Jim Brown the football player sees him as a kid and he's
*  just like looking for a game for money at this country club and he's like let's let's play
*  someone and everyone says no and Agassi's dad's like he'll play you for money and it's like he's
*  fucking nine you're you're pimping out your kid for money against the best running back maybe ever
*  and he's like no I'm not going to play your kid for money and he's like I'll bet my house that
*  my kid will beat you and Jim Brown's like I don't need a house how much money you want to play for
*  and his dad goes how about 10 grand it's like their life savings he's putting this on his
*  son who's nine years old and you know then he sees Agassi hit the dad goes to get the money
*  and he's like fuck this kid's kind of good and he goes how about I how about I just play you
*  you know for fun and then we'll decide how much Agassi whoops his ass like six three six three
*  and he goes I'll play for 500 Agassi whoops his ass takes him he's nine wow against a fucking
*  hall of fame athlete and his dad it's like his dad did it imagine like you're thinking about your
*  family's mortgage and your siblings and their future and you're like if I lose we're fucked
*  imagine doing that to a kid like of course she's angry and broken I don't know any we talked about
*  Tiger Woods before but I mean any athlete who like is that good they probably had a fuck it's like
*  a porn star you had a fucked up dad basically yeah if you get pushed that hard I mean if you
*  get pushed that hard to be the best of the best as a child that means you're missing everything
*  else you if you want to be the best of the best there's no way you're going to birthday parties
*  just no way you're sitting at home watching cartoons yeah no you're going to training in
*  the morning you're getting coaching weirdly though Hitler good childhood really and he was one of the
*  best also heavy meth user I think meth can erase all good parenting yeah all good parenting goes
*  by the wayside some people are just some people are just uh I've got one of the best I mean evil
*  motherfuckers obviously but uh yeah some people yeah it's weird when there's like a serial killer
*  and he's just in it for like the love of the game you know what I mean because every once in a while
*  they're like no he had a good childhood like what was his insky have a good childhood I think he did
*  no no he didn't no he didn't Ted Kaczynski he was like a nerd but like I don't know no no no no he
*  had a bad thing happen to him when he's a baby he was sick and then they took him away from his
*  parents and he was brought to a hospital we had no physical contact for me yeah for months and
*  months it was a part of the documentary on Netflix about him it's his brother talks about it and
*  then after that like his brother was a good guy though yeah his brother was a really good guy his
*  brother turned him in yeah so he was a sociopath from the time he was like he was getting no love
*  at all as a baby from like months and months at a time I forget the the length of it whatever this
*  illness but they basically kept him in a crib and when he cried that was it no one comforted him no
*  one picked him up but that's what a lot that's what my sister did to a baby that's yeah but I mean
*  never ever zero zero minutes in any day was anybody touching him for weeks and weeks and weeks and
*  months and months and months on end and his brother said he came out fucked up from that then
*  he's in Harvard he's a genius and they put him through the LSD studies of Harvard and part of
*  the right yes yes so which is also some CIA MK Ultra shit Wormwood that shit so they put him
*  through this uh these LSD studies at Harvard and part of the studies were humiliation and like to
*  see how he responds to like severe humiliation so they should just scientists like look at this
*  pussy I don't remember what they did like how they did it but it was like coordinated organized
*  humiliation and just psychological warfare just to see what kind of response it has on this fragile
*  well now we know yeah well now we know so then he goes to Berkeley becomes a professor and saves
*  up his money just live in the woods live in the woods and kill everybody's making technology
*  yeah what a fucking weird guy meanwhile he has a point like his point was technology is terrific
*  is gonna destroy the human race and eventually take over us and he was right he's right it's
*  happening right now it's about he was right he could have gotten his message out in a different
*  way probably maybe he's a little heavy-handed in this approach
*  it's crazy the writing i'm like this motherfucker was on to something or he was
*  undeniably brilliant but in the documentary uh his brother talks about like say if like he asked a
*  girl on a date and the girl said no like he would just like write the most evil vicious letters to
*  her and harass her and he was a crazy person before the lsd studies and then the lsd studies
*  they just cracked him yeah damn yeah now i remember there was a story about him like he made like a
*  little like he used his intellect he made some kind of uh like firecracker to show off to a girl in
*  high school and she was like freaked out by it i'm like holy shit what a defining moment for a guy
*  who becomes pure evil and uses explosives right to kill scientists yeah technology makers yeah
*  yeah yeah it's um it's a weird part of our history is those experiments that they did on people
*  and i'd like to know how many of them turned out real bad like how many of those people that were
*  involved in the harvard lsd studies went on to become psychopaths like how many lives got ruined
*  because of that well who was the guy as errol morris made the documentary on netflix about
*  uh the guy who was in the i think was his dad no someone's dad was in the lsd studies and they
*  absolutely threw him out a window like he knew something he knew too much and they threw him out
*  a fucking window yeah 100 they do that and it's like imagine you just grow up and you're like
*  my dad was murdered by the cia i mean it's pretty fucked up it's very fucked up you want a cigar
*  you like i'm not a big cigar guy no no but i'll keep drinking with you all right i'm just thinking
*  about popping a cigar you want to be rude fuck it if you have one i'll have one all right let's go
*  what do you got here project mk ultra did cia scientist frank olson jump or was he pushed
*  yeah he's probably pushed i mean it's it's always one where it's like was there a note
*  right and even if there was a note they could have fudged that but the official verdict was
*  suicide oh he fell from the window of his manhattan hotel room in 1953 died on the sidewalk in his
*  undershirt and shorts at about 2 a.m the official verdict was suicide but a second autopsy raised
*  questions although not proof of a possible homicide olson's family many others have been
*  searching for answers in a hall of mirrors dude i i a woman jumped out the window in front of me
*  one splat like 10 feet in front of me in manhattan i was i was going home i was like in sixth grade
*  and i was on i was trying to get the bus and i'm with my friend i i stopped to take out my metro
*  card and right in front of me she could have killed you i mean if i didn't stop i'd be dead
*  it's crazy to think about i didn't you're just so uh your mind protects you it's really
*  fucked up when you when you experience something like that because i wasn't scared i was just kind
*  of like oh shit um i was like oh shit this there's like a movie going on or someone's
*  shooting a movie you don't like accept it as real you know so you thought it was a fake
*  body yeah but it got me out of a history test the next day i call i remember i called her
*  what did she look like when she hit the ground face first didn't die instantly that's the one
*  thing i remember face first
*  good yeah she face first she was mumbling to herself that was the most fucked up thing is i
*  think she hit the ground yeah oh it didn't kill her instantly she muttered something like i'm cold
*  and my friend's mom saw it and she went into a store and got her a blanket oh god how far did
*  she fall from do you know i don't know probably like i would guess at least eight stories would
*  be my guess but like maybe five i don't know and she lived oh well not in the end she didn't live
*  but she didn't die instantly oh god damn but i remember i called my friend's mom who was like
*  a major narcissist after this and i i was just wanted to talk to someone because my parents
*  weren't home and i uh i was like trying to tell him and the mom just like picked up the phone and
*  talked about herself for like 20 minutes straight no and then she's like how was your day i was like
*  i just saw someone die and she's like all right well elliot's not home right now like that was
*  it jesus it was a weird fucking call put that lady in the lsd studies see what we could do with her
*  that should be a punishment well i think it shouldn't be yeah we're talking again about
*  like this kid on the roof with trump like that's the kind you find someone who's all fucked up from
*  life and you know i do another with the whiskey too sure that's a a very specific kind of person
*  you know it's hard to make a real a total narcissist like your friend's mom who you just
*  tell them about someone jumping off of a fucking roof in front of you and almost killing you and
*  splattering in front of you and they don't even care that doesn't have anything to do with me
*  didn't know what to say i don't think it was like malicious the way she's like oh i'm sorry i you
*  know i i don't think she meant bad but i think she just wasn't equipped to give me anything some
*  people aren't equipped to have real conversations they just talk just talk and talk at you i know
*  yeah but if you find someone who's really fucked up like if you were a part of a secret program
*  you would probably kind of want to be going to visit schools to see if you could find someone
*  who's on the edge yeah recruit them you know get them especially if you're planning on killing them
*  anyway like this they knew that if this kid was going to go on the roof and shoot the president
*  they could talk him into going on the roof let's assume not even this scenario because let's not be
*  crazy let's just say if you wanted to set up a scenario we're going to have someone assassinate
*  the president you get some guy whose life is a fucking complete and total disaster you either
*  hypnotize him or you mentor him you give him psychiatric drugs you do a bunch of things you
*  get him to do it and you know that once he gets on top of that roof and shoots the president
*  everyone's going to shoot him and it's nice and clean they never let those guys live my question
*  is though of course but my question is do you want him actually to kill trump in this scenario
*  yeah they definitely wanted him to yeah there was also an iranian don't you think i find it a little
*  irresponsible this is gun no no i was a little you guys keep talking i'm sorry i interrupted but
*  i can't find a picture of the gun i'm so put off from people like you know lauren bobert and shit
*  or like being like biden hired biden hired him to do this and you're like stop trying to pour
*  gas on the fire yeah how do you know we are so fucking lucky he's not dead so lucky the country
*  like i believe in the i and i and i part of being maybe an entertainer is like i get to see a unified
*  crowd that's part of the beauty of of being able to tour as a comic is like i get to see a room of
*  people laughing together and i i always hate when comics are like going out of their way to divide
*  a room yeah and i feel the same way i mean more so even about politicians who i'm like why are you
*  trying why are you aiming for chaos like you really can kind of unite people if you give a good
*  speech of course you really can like you really can inspire people and unite people with the right
*  words yeah and the right like the right real feeling behind it where it really resonates with
*  people and they go well you know what he's right he's right we should do it differently we should
*  we should relax a little get our shit which is really funny one after the assassination attempt
*  biden is like we have to put aside our differences like you were just saying it was hitler i know but
*  also there was they're making a big deal that biden called trump and that he uh and he was like
*  there's no place for this i'm like murder yeah we shouldn't there should not be place for
*  assassinating people there also should be no place for you using so much hyperbolic statements
*  that you're saying that your opponent if they win it's the death of democracy because they kept
*  saying that over and over again he's going to be addicted yeah they'll do that both sides he's going
*  to be a dictator he's going to be a tyrant it's the death of democracy he's going to put people
*  in camps it all started when we started comparing every politician to hitler because it gave us
*  nowhere to go right right right here's the problem like every cable news show
*  they thrive the way politicians are trying to thrive now it's like chaos it's like you are
*  poisoning every audience member who watches this shit cable news is literally they're pouring
*  poison down your throat and the way they're set up they kind of have to do that because otherwise
*  they're not going to survive they were already they would when trump was out of office they were
*  dipping like a motherfucker a huge dip huge dip huge dip because he was he was giving them content
*  yeah yeah the fear content yeah yeah it's uh it's it's not a good time for being informed it's a
*  very confusing time in terms like understanding exactly what's going on in the world yeah it's
*  real weird yeah it's just weird real weird you know you know you don't know what the
*  fuck is happening it's the official reports of things and there's so many different things that
*  are popping off there's so much going on and ukraine and in israel and it's like yeah what's
*  going on in america and someone just tried to kill the president and like you see how i couldn't
*  believe that shit i was i was like this can't be fucking when did when did the world turn into the
*  world wrestling federation i was in italy i was in italy when it was going on with the the trump
*  yeah on the roof yeah cop went on the roof he pointed a gun at the cop and the cop jumped off
*  the roof you never see that in like an eastwood movie yeah the cop is like i'm getting out of
*  here fuck this shit yeah he fired eight times that's right really uh this man also says his
*  father reported it missing later with his rifle yeah the father made a phone call did he give him
*  the so i know is the dad's gun we don't do they know if it was a gift or if it was he borrowed
*  it or stole it that says the son missing along with his rifle so that was his son's rifle
*  no it says well it's hard to say what he's saying there because it could be saying the son was
*  missing with his rifle but it could be saying the son was missing with his son's rifle see what it
*  says that crooks father reports his son missing along with his rifle like that could either be
*  interpreted as crooks father's rifle or the kid's rifle right am i wrong no yeah you're right yeah
*  there were over a dozen firearms found in the crooks household so there was a lot of guns in
*  the house how would you like to have that be your fucking kid oh my god they used dna to identify
*  him well you can use a photo i saw his face but no they said that fbi used that uh dna to figure
*  it out oh and they're not sure it's not giving a date or any explanation on exactly how they did
*  that and people were like thinking how they ran a dna test they might have used like dna.com or
*  ancestry.com or something like oh they definitely probably use those fucking things all those
*  databases we're all compromised i shouldn't have done it i shouldn't have done it too you did it
*  too yeah i did it why why'd we do it well because a drunk girl in a bar convinced me to do it and i
*  was like yeah what i was hammered i was like yeah i want to know how fucking uh ashkenazi jew i like
*  who gives a shit i know right like clearly i have some turkish in me with these eyebrows i know what
*  i am basically but she was like no you need to know and she did it like on the spot in the bar
*  she ordered it for me and then i was like oh wow i'm a fucking idiot well you gave away all your
*  dna to china and now they can make a bio weapon that specifically targets you that's a new thing
*  that they can do now how does that work well certain people have certain genetic like people
*  are different right like there's certain people where certain genes impact them differently like
*  for instance the reason why some black people get sickle cell anemia is because their family has a
*  history their ancestors have a history of protection against malaria so because they've
*  survived malaria somehow or another that gene manifests itself in sickle cell anemia right and
*  like people from certain parts of the world have genes that are more associated with alcoholism
*  or have genes that are more associated with certain so if they could find like a particular
*  vulnerability that you may have or that certain races may have even you can create a bio weapon
*  specifically and this is all theoretical of course but specifically to target an individual person
*  don't they kind of already know if that's your tendency what race you are like i don't know i
*  mean i think it's probably really like some people think they're one thing and they find out they're
*  not like they do a woody allen film festival in new york and just nuke it and i'm like fuck
*  i walked right into that one i think but but for the biological thing i think it's like
*  there's very specific things like you're different than me and and i'm different than jamey and there
*  could be a certain biological weapon that only targets jamey's dna and they can use it on him
*  see if you could find out whatever the fuck that is now because they're they're talking about this
*  in terms of like the vulnerability of selling our entire dna database because apparently if you
*  signed up for one of those it's either dna.com or ancestry.com or 23andMe one of those sold their
*  whole database yeah and i think by the way do you get the alert where they're like we found another
*  family member for you i'm good i'm good we're fucking we're tapped out here i'm busy yeah i'm
*  about to change my number anyway i'm going to blend the family as is i've stepped siblings i'm
*  like let's let's cap it here yeah let's that's enough of bringing strangers into your life but
*  they tell you what's funny is they tell you like random shit on those sites where they're like you
*  prefer salty to sweet and i'm like holy shit that is true yeah yeah yeah but then sometimes you feel
*  like you're talking to a chick who just knows your astrological sign and i'm just dumb and i'm like
*  yeah i guess i guess i am but there's certain things like cheerful the taste of cilantro
*  some people it tastes like soap do you like it or not i like it yeah yeah some people don't like
*  what does this say potentially hypothetical but this is what people inside the government have
*  said okay uh that's what it is where you can actually take someone's dna you know their
*  medical profile and you could target a biological weapon that will kill that person or take them off
*  the battlefield and make them inoperable you can't have a discussion about this without talking about
*  the privacy and commercial data and the protection of commercial data because expectations of
*  privacy have degraded over the last 20 years people will rapidly spit into a cup and send it to 23andMe
*  and get really interesting data about their background and guess what their dna is now owned
*  by a private company it can be sold off with very little intellectual property protection or privacy
*  protection and we don't have legal and regulatory regimes that deal with that the data is actually
*  going to be procured and collected by our adversaries for the development of these systems
*  that's what i'm talking about oh cool we're all fucking stupid this is flat out alex jones stuff
*  like you've heard this five years ago like alex relax yeah they're finding your own personal
*  dna and they're developing weapons specifically designed to target you
*  i'll say for myself they don't need to do much research you could take me out pretty fucking easy
*  i think it's just to know that they have them for everybody anybody that might be it's creepy as
*  fuck oh it's very creepy even just like the was it the cambridge analyticus stuff just the stuff
*  they have on you you're like yeah this is like not good i don't i don't like the tip of the
*  iceberg yeah but then i also think of it in like terms of podcasts we're like if we log this many
*  hours we're not going to get cancelled because there's too much shit to pull from right so i
*  look at it the same way i'm like if you have this much of everybody right maybe we're all okay well
*  think about podcasts if we've said awful shit we have said awful shit in these little clips
*  but we've also said not awful shit way more thousands and thousands of hours and we're
*  comedians yeah so people go yeah but what what was the whole conversation like why did shane say that
*  why did joe say that why they say that well it's because you why did shane why did shane call me a
*  dirty jew because the nicks beat the sixers that's why suck it shane sorry dude go nicks in the moment
*  it had to be okay but i think you know i saw him two months ago in in nashville he is off it's like
*  a video game getting away from shane because he you can't get away unscathed i'm like dude i'm
*  so hung over i done killed tony the night before i was in nashville i'm like please i the big boss
*  yeah i'm just like trying to get away from him he's like you need one more drink to call that
*  hangover i'm good but then he talks between him and joe de rosa i'm like this is like the two bosses
*  yeah i'm like joe you're 46 for fuck's sake stop doing shots you're smoking marlboro reds and doing
*  shots you're 40 fucking six yeah and he's not a healthy 46 either no doing marathons when we're
*  in here we do protect our park shane's always the one with the beer bong it's like dude it's time
*  it's time you see that big fucking meaty hand reaches across problem with guys like shane for
*  me are like i still enjoy drinking and i like the buzz that builds gradually i don't like just getting
*  super fucked up i like getting fucked up like over the course of the night but i like building
*  to like i like the the build yeah and shane drinks like a 19 year old he does but he drinks bud lights
*  which is the calculated move you're gonna drink a lot that's the stanhope move too i know stanhope
*  because cocktails now but for the longest time stanhope drank light beer he goes i like a light
*  beer because i could just start it early just keep a nice slow burn dude you're pretty good
*  impressions that's okay that's not bad if i talk to him from around him i can do them i love him
*  i i uh he was a i was such a fan of his i i mean still am but i mean i remember those like old
*  albums like something to take the edge off and shit yeah oh he's great oh my god that bobby barnett
*  story doug stanhope like that's just it's just a i fuck the chick story yeah but it's not it's like
*  got layers and there's henry phillips playing the bass in the background yeah stanhope is like uh
*  and he's so cool he's such a cool fucking guy he really is that guy like that's not an act he is
*  like uh a telow he says he's like the closest we have to bill hicks yeah but he's a different thing
*  you know he's just he's his own thing you know it's like for sure he's he's doug stanhope you know
*  for sure he he inspired a lot of stanhope wannabes oh dude the mics we all i saw i'm a different
*  generation of you in stand-up but like i remember the guys who were getting like when i was coming
*  up the guys getting ripped off at the mics from mitch headberg dane cook a little bit of burr a
*  little there's some burr i mean obviously a lot of a tel i mean i'm one of them let's fucking be
*  honest like like we all know who we like i remember norman and i would like laugh talking about like
*  he's like i'm like a norm mcdonald jerry seinfeld thing and i was like i fucking was obsessed with
*  danger field natal so it was like you know uh and then do you see the handwritten notes we have in
*  the green room i love them dude i love the green that's so cool no i love comedy history shit like
*  those are from his wife his wife gave them to us i talked to her on the phone i because i i was
*  after whitney's podcast where she was driving me to we were doing the same show and she's like do
*  you want to talk to she knows i love rodney so she's like do you want to do you want to uh talk to
*  jone dangerfield i was like yes so she calls me or she calls jone dangerfield and jone picks up the
*  phone and and she's i'm like oh i loved your husband so much i was like back to school was
*  like my favorite movie ever and i love his stand-up his carson appearances i'm like i
*  i'm obsessed with danger field and she's like you want to hear a danger field joke no one's
*  ever heard and i said yeah when he was going under for a big operation he he was like fuck i might
*  not make it if i don't have my mind i don't want to be i don't want to be alive it's all i have in
*  my comic and he comes out of it and the doctor goes did you cough anything up and he goes yeah
*  500 last week to a whore
*  he woke up with a fucking joke so cool i love shit like i danger back to school to me is like the best
*  comfort watch ever because it's like it's only every character serves to set up his stand-up
*  yeah his wife's like you're impossible oh yeah and you're easy you know like it's all just perfect
*  fucking jokes yeah yeah that's you're tall and fat yeah well you're short and ugly you know
*  yeah you remember the scene with uh this i think about the scene because it's been ripped off so
*  much but when they're getting it's like burt young is so funny in that movie too but when
*  they're getting drunk at the bar it's like young robert downey jr who's like hilarious in it too and
*  they're they're bringing them pictures bring us a pitcher of beer every seven minutes until
*  someone passes out then bring us one every 10 like you can't be more fun than that yeah no he was
*  great i saw him live when i was a security guard whoa where i was a security guard at great woods
*  no shit great woods is a uh it's a concert place in mansfield massachusetts and uh i was working
*  security there and this is i was 19 years old and i got to see a lot of people there i got to see uh
*  i got to see bill cosby there wow i saw but that was a good show it was a good show i saw bon jovi
*  there nice i was barely paying attention to bill cosby i was trying to pick up this girl i was
*  doing a lot of chatting i missed a lot of the comedy part this is before i decided i was going
*  to be a comedian so i only good for you having to work to pick up a woman at a cosby show
*  set a good example for the future yeah but um so i was backstage like there was like this back area
*  and rodney was back there and rodney was wearing a bathrobe he had nothing on his but a bathrobe
*  just naked in a bathrobe with slippers and he goes on stage like that that's how he'd go on stage
*  he'd go on stage balls ass naked with a bathrobe on and slippers and just murder so he went through
*  this phase of his career towards the end where he would go on stage in a bathrobe and he's just
*  balls naked with a bathrobe on it's so weird and he would be backstage hanging out with people his
*  balls would be hanging out and he didn't even care apparently had this giant dick and these huge balls
*  and they'd just be hanging out and rodney would just be smoking joints and hanging out backstage
*  80 plus is like kind of adorable 80 plus and super wealthy and famous and he's doing this
*  enormous theater it's like this place where bon jovi does you know in in mansfield massachusetts
*  it's huge performing arts place he was the best man i my mom got me a dvd set of his for my birthday
*  when i was a kid and it was like i loved it it was like yeah look see oh my god see he would take
*  out what's he's got a fucking sock over his dick and he's just got the serious face it's perfect
*  oh dude look at the back to school robe too it's yeah dude that the score for that movie too dany
*  elfman like dun dun dun dun dun dun it's so cheerful yeah but uh yeah he uh on the dvd set
*  is it's kind of sad there's a set when he's really old and he's it's he's in vegas and they're not
*  good the crowd is not good he's kind of struggling but there's a moment where he just is like fuck it
*  and just rattles off like so many in a row so many great one-liners and they start to pick up and
*  they start giving applause break and just pauses he goes i know a lot of good fucking jokes
*  it's such a triumphant moment you're like 80 years old he's just like fuck you i'm a store i'm still
*  a pro i met him at the laugh factory like many many years later after i'd seen him when i was a
*  you know security guard i was uh just just moved to hollywood like 94 and he was there and he was
*  still doing like a little bit of stand-up and he showed up and i met him there with his wife i don't
*  know if it's the same wife he was always moving around but he was uh you know it was interesting
*  just to see him it's just weird was he cool yeah he was really friendly hey what do you know
*  you know it's like he used to get fucked up with the comic strip yeah because his club danger
*  fields in the city they'd be like why are you always doing drugs here he's like what am i
*  gonna do drugs at my club you know it's like fuck you i'm doing drugs here but uh i mean that was
*  i never really played danger fields it was like a bad club by the time i came around it was a bad
*  club when i played it i loved it i used to take it was always been a bad club it was always a bad
*  club it was a it was a good club when he did the young comedian special from there when he did
*  rodney's young comedian special those were great amazing dude i remember the lineup dude it's like
*  robert shimel kinesis bill hicks yeah dude lennie clark yeah yeah bill hicks had a set on there that
*  i was like this is phenomenal yeah robert shimel i still remember the joke he opened with because
*  it's such a good fucking joke where he goes he opens with this joke he goes i heard a guy got
*  arrested for animal necrophilia how do you plead for that i'm sorry runner i thought the cat was
*  alive all is fucking it that's a too open with a fucking a dead cat joke and and crush no he was
*  a beast i love robert shimel's stuff yeah robert shimel was amazing he was amazing those old
*  comedian specials really got me into comedy those were like really oh yeah man they were the way
*  you found out about like rick dukeman that's the way you found out about people oh he was hilarious
*  yeah he was an la guy that for whatever reason it never made it you know he but he was funny on
*  the young comedian special i was like man this guy's good i remember those lineups they were
*  just fucking beasts like there wasn't a they were all killers they were good comics in there
*  fucking dice coming out with oh yeah smoke yeah bob nelson with the football helmet on i remember
*  that shit yeah yeah yeah yeah don marrera oh i love him jerry seinfeld so many comics came out of
*  those young comedian specials like rodney was the gatekeeper he well you know he really cared about
*  comedy and he really wanted like young comics you're doing that dude yeah i will i learned a
*  lot of it from him that's one of the reasons why like having his handwriting notes on the wall of
*  the green room is it means a lot to me because i kind of think about it the same way i like
*  i know about so many comedians because rodney dangerfield was generous and he wanted people
*  to know about great comics he didn't feel threatened by him he wanted them to do well dude i still
*  remember his intro for bill hicks on that special where he goes this next comic he's so far ahead of
*  his time his parents haven't even met yet give it up for bill hicks i'm like dude you you found
*  jokes in the intros yeah that's how good he was and it's accurate but you but you're also like
*  you created this place i'm like it must feel cool to see these young comics like
*  finding themselves it's like fucking cool yeah it is cool it's real cool i enjoy it i mean it's
*  selfish too you build a good culture it is so similar to sports where like you see there can
*  be a talented rookie but he's on a team with no good vets and he ain't going to be good right
*  because you need you need someone to guide you i was very fortunate that i had good comics looking
*  out for me when i was a young comic and the culture in new york is also strong i mean like
*  you know collin quinn and david tell when i was young were like very like oh this is how you be
*  a comedian you you keep turning over new shit and you keep like i love i'm on the early shows a lot
*  the comedy seller and it'll be i'm usually like following either collin or jim norden
*  and they're so prolific like they're just always taking chances they don't give a fuck
*  and it you know they give a fuck but they don't give a fuck in the right way where they're like
*  if this doesn't work i'm gonna make it work and like they're doing like nip jim's new shit is so
*  interesting it's so it's so good i mean but it's all like veteran leadership and it all leads
*  bleeds down to like yes and then we want to do that for the next generation like i want the i want
*  i'm excited when i see funny young comics yeah yeah me too there's young comics at the seller
*  like maddie weiner is a fucking killer like she's a young comic who's you know there's like ethan
*  simmons patterson daniel simonson they're like young fucking killers at the seller and you're
*  like oh fuck i used to be the guy who would go up and kill and now i'm like fuck i got to turn over
*  jokes and then they're going to become like you know it's it's all good for the culture you know
*  it is it's good for the culture and it's good for us it's good for you selfishly to be generous
*  because those people that are coming up the better they do the more it's going to fuel you
*  and you're going to do better it's good for everybody and it's right about like having
*  like a culture of top comedians it keeps everybody strong and that's the club i mean like last night
*  we're hanging out with ron white this fucking brian simpson i've never met him i'm a fan oh he's the
*  best he's such a nice guy he was very nice he made fun of me for being a next fan but other than that
*  it was pretty cool that kid arey maddy from um estonia opened up i talked to him for a while
*  yeah we chatted for a bit fucking killer super smart yeah you know and he's one of these young
*  hungry dogs that's coming up and there's a gang of them at that club and there's people moving
*  there from all over the place like tyler fisher and all these other people that i need to tell us
*  yeah he opened for me at hyena's the weekend i got banned there that's where we met you got banned
*  i've been banned from a couple clubs i don't get it do my act that's what my agent goes what did you
*  do my jokes no they were starting the show like an hour late every night and it's like when you
*  have a 10 30 show and you're starting at 11 30 i'm kind of like guys come on fucking turn it around
*  and uh then they were doing like blowjob shots on stage they bring people in the crowd i'm like dude
*  you're just fucking please just bring me on i was like it's like i'm going on 12 30 every night
*  who's doing the blowjob shots this the club did that so they're like so they're trying to encourage
*  people to drink yeah which i'm fine with i want i want to make money i'm fucking i'll drink on
*  stage and be like fucking have a drink with me right i'll even do a shot with the crowd sometimes
*  i don't give a shit but like you gotta uh you gotta stop delaying the show so much with nonsense
*  and and i and then i remember i made fun of the logo the hyena's logo just like fucking having fun
*  with it and uh he came in my room he goes we're a fucking family business and i was like i made
*  fun of a hyena what am i doing to your family i don't know it was a hyena in a tux and then
*  like two weeks later someone sent me they changed the logo
*  but i remember tony was like he was like we had fun we were laughing a lot so how did that get
*  you banned he i made fun of the club and shit on stage i was like joking i was like blowjob
*  shots starting out i'm joking around i'm not being like harsh but like i'm fucking around and he was
*  like he emailed my agent at the time and he was like if you don't drop sam as a client i will never
*  book one of your clients again and like you know i wasn't a huge act and and uh he and he said uh
*  and he said uh if you three clubs you own too so it's like i'm like oh so now you're putting me
*  in a position where i'm an asshole so my agent called me like what did you do and i was like
*  nothing nothing you know fucking uh and then she was she was like not as supportive as she should
*  have been to me she should have been like fuck you like he's doing his jokes you know but uh she was
*  like this is what you do because i did i did something at the same thing at the syracuse funny
*  bone which was what happened with this how did it resolve it didn't i was just like i'm not going
*  to write him an apology i'll apologize if i do something wrong happily i'm not like i don't have
*  an ego in that way we're like if i fuck up i'll totally be like hey i'm really sorry did they have
*  anything specific that they were saying to your agent i said i disrespected the club
*  am i making fun of the highita logo blowjob shots dude what do you fucking talk about disrespecting
*  our sacred institution dude it always what i like about your club is like i always find as a young
*  comic you you don't get the love you deserve at your home club usually right because they see you
*  as as like a door guy or like right that's where you started but i think you you do raise people
*  up there which i don't think is normal i really i think like new york comedy club in new york does
*  that a little bit where they like kind of develop young guys where i think is good but i do think
*  like comic ship is where i started dude they didn't really build i still have love for the club but
*  they didn't really build us up they kind of like took pleasure in keeping us down a little bit
*  yeah they would do like lottery shows to us they recorded me one fucking week they were like you
*  want to audition for the main spots you got to be on like an america's got talent type show and i'm
*  like you're fucked by the way just auditioning for the late night back then i remember i auditioned
*  so you do a lottery it's like over 100 comics who which sounds like nothing now but in the day that
*  day it was like you know yeah and i remember i auditioned i draw six out of six so you're going
*  on after the regular show it's like an eight o'clock show the next show starts at 10 30 same crowd
*  and i draw six out of six i'm like fucking going on at like 11 they're gonna be tired i hope these
*  comics don't suck so they walk the crowd and the guy who goes on before me has a fucking nervous
*  breakdown on stage so i'm not making this up he on stage he goes he goes i'm fucking bad at this
*  oh my god i'm fucking bombing and i watched him walk 70 out of the 80 people for my audition
*  and i'm like i gotta go on for 10 people now this is crazy and i just went on and like the owner
*  walked up to me and he's like yeah i mean like the bar was low at that point he's like you didn't
*  walk the last 10 good job but he was like he didn't panic so like i'll give you i'll put you on for
*  late night so that was like but then for the regular spots they were like you gotta uh they
*  they fuck with you my point is like your club like i feel like and and some of the fucking with is
*  good it is good because it makes you like how bad do you want this shit right yeah but so i think to
*  a certain point the hazing can be good but also like it's a new generation you know it's it's
*  different it's it the hazing is probably good because it weeds out the people that aren't going
*  to have the gumption to push forward and and get through bad sets and get through all kinds of
*  and i just tell comics all the time be nice to club owners because you don't want to be one of
*  them i would always say that and then i want to become one of them but i always said that because
*  like they're different than us they like we need them that we're not going to go do that we're
*  not going to go open up a fucking club so you need these people so it's just like there's an
*  adversarial relationship like you feel like they're fucking you on the money or they're not they're
*  lying about it being sold out or whatever it is where you're not getting what you deserve or
*  that's in the beginning usually in the beginning yeah once you become undeniable then they have
*  to pay you right but the thing is it's like there's a separation between the people that do it and
*  the business and that's where all the friction comes from in my club there's no separation
*  from the people that do it in the business because the people that do it own it and it's all ours
*  like the way i refer to it i don't refer to it as my club i refer to it as our club this is our club
*  this club is set up for comedians it was never set up to make any money the whole concept about
*  it was i just want to make something where i don't lose money i just want to break even if i break
*  even i'll be super happy it's not a money-making venture at all so the money structure is different
*  the comedians get most of the money and there's plenty of money for the bar and there's plenty
*  money for the wait staff there's plenty of money for everybody it's just you can't be greedy and in
*  most environments the club makes most of the money and the comedians don't until a certain level
*  you know and then they can get the door like big comics big names where they sell out anywhere and
*  it's like a good thing to have them at your club and then clubs make a deal but they're still
*  making money they're just not making an insane amount of money but my point was the comedians
*  do all of the fucking work if it wasn't we're selling the comedians we're not selling we're
*  selling drinks to see the comedians but that's not i don't think that's the normal mindset like
*  i can't tell how often i be at a club and i hear the drink shake and i'm like i'm here to move
*  drinks yeah you know i mean you just it's it's that's the business part that's because the people
*  that own that business aren't comedians but it's funny that that's the best way to make a business
*  is to make a business where you just do it the best way to express the art form like and then
*  there's a lot of great clubs too i'm like i'm not i don't want to sound here like i'm no i love clubs
*  like comedy works in denver hilarities in cleveland like i fucking love them i love
*  chad and nick and sam yeah wise guys in salt lake is fucking beautiful guys in salt lake
*  is fucking incredible yeah you know there's there's a lot there's so many great clubs i'm
*  forgetting a million right now listen i'm forgetting a million too but i love them and i'm they and i
*  love comedy clubs i really do love just the i i really don't really respect comics who don't
*  tour i don't like if you're not i can tell when you're special if you didn't fucking
*  tour with it right i can tell if you like i did new york in la and i was like here you got to take
*  that shit to chattanooga and noxville and fucking also when you're doing new york and la you're
*  doing like 15 minute sets i know but you know i mean like they do an hour there and they're
*  but like you got to just take it you got to sludge it through the mud this is something i always
*  always talk about with a gaffe again you know all those like new york guys would be like you got a
*  tour you got it they really emphasize like cut the fat dude yeah yeah cut the fat and then see how
*  different people in different places react to it because your act is going to go over different
*  san francisco than it is in florida i know just is just is but both are fucking great both are
*  fucking great you know like tampa for whatever reason has been in the side splitters you know
*  they've always been fucking really good you know i make up with hyenas never i'd be happy to
*  i'd be happy to if you're listening hyenas the one in dallas i don't know you probably just gave
*  him the right direction get rid of your stupid fucking hyena get out of here with your logo if
*  if you if someone can make fun of it and it hurts your feelings you got a dumb logo
*  i don't give a shit either i mean like it's like i know what am i going to hold a grudge against
*  hyenas i don't know the grudge against that guy that wanted you to get dropped by your agent
*  i got to ruin your career pretty classless pretty classless that's such a shit move and i didn't
*  have i didn't have a lot of juice and like to be told like i fucked up i'm like a little bum that
*  she told me i kind of fucked up i'm like you know i didn't you know i'm like i'm not a diva dude i
*  like i i'm one of your dudes who like happily do 45 weeks a year on the road i'm like i'm out there
*  i'm happy to do this yeah you're making money off me stupid yeah have my back not a ton at the time
*  but i was out there working yeah enough well it's kind of think like it's like a young athlete like
*  if they keep going they're gonna eventually make it into the majors and they're gonna make money
*  i think of it in sports analogies like always that's just how i always because i love sports so i
*  just also sports is another thing like comedy like there's no guarantee you may make it you may
*  not make it yeah it's hard instead of tearing an acl it's like drug problem drug problems girlfriend
*  problems there's so many things that can go wrong with you mental health problems there's so many
*  things can get wrong on the and also it's so not guaranteed that you're going to keep coming up
*  with ideas oh dude i'm i'm this is my six hour of jokes that i just burned and i'm like i'm fucking
*  tired i'm like my mind is tired like i i just don't feel like i have it i never feel like i
*  have it after this it's really hard to keep doing this it's a constant process it's a privilege to
*  to deal with this challenge but it is fucking like i'm like wow i don't feel funny most of the time
*  you'll come up with it just like it always did like shane was saying that after his last special
*  now the stuff he's doing now is arguably the funniest shit i've ever seen from him it's just
*  how it always is i like my new shit but it's i don't really like it it's gonna take time it's a little
*  it's a five-year-old kid right now it's not a it's not a 25-year-old man crashing through the
*  front line it is a five-year-old kid trying to entertain a fucking room full of drunks
*  yeah ain't lasting long well it's just you have bambi legs your jokes have a little bambi legs
*  they're all awkward and shit they're not moving that good yet it's so true it's it it is uh it is
*  cool though to like it's more fun to be in the creative mode because like when i'm about to
*  tape and i'm killing i'm like i'm a fucking hack because it's you know it works like who gives a
*  shit yeah it's supposed to work too easy yeah you're like this should work but then when you're
*  when you're struggling a little bit you're like this is fucking this is comedy yeah this is the
*  and then when you struggle and then you come up with a new punch line a new tag line
*  you know i just added a new tag to one of my bits that makes me laugh and it's like it just came out
*  of the blue like one night sitting in front of the computer i'm going over my material i'm like oh
*  like this this is it and like to add that in then i add it on stage the next day and then
*  tony's like when did that come from yeah like i wrote it last night when your friend notices the
*  best family yeah norman watched me the other night and he was like that's fucking that and franklin
*  i was like the new line the new stuff yeah new stuff is a golden gift from the cosmos new stuff's
*  amazing it's so weird when it hits you in the middle of the night too you just wake up in the
*  middle of the night you're like you just like stumble over to a fucking phone voice memo fall
*  right back asleep yes you got to do it oh always and it's 90 percent of the time it's shit but that
*  for that 10 you have to just do it there's been way too many times where i convinced myself that
*  i would remember it and i didn't remember it i know there's a sign filled episode about that
*  where he like tries to write it down he's like what the fuck is this yeah but yeah it's it's so
*  i mean it's funny for what a sitcom sign for was it would like tap in a real stand-up shit every
*  once in a while oh yeah i mean it started off with him doing a monologue yeah remember that that was
*  the early days yeah he would do a monologue at a club every time yeah he's great bits in there he's
*  interesting now hearing him talk about stuff now because he's kind of realizing where all this
*  woke shit is gone he doesn't care now it's kind of beautiful to watch him be like like someone
*  heckles him he's like fuck you and you're like oh my god yeah jerry versus heckler this is entertaining
*  well they're all going after him with the palestine stuff now so they're interrupting and he it's just
*  funny really but you know he's it was a great clip oh my god stop giving jews money yeah but he also
*  like but he also is like you know he's talking about something like it's just funny when a
*  clean comic is getting heckled right because i'm like yeah you were you're probably heckling a bit
*  about like sponges or something well it just shows you like at this time in history nothing is safe
*  this time in history is so screwy that total complete compliance and adherence to every
*  single letter of the doctrine is demanded and even then they'll move they'll move what it is
*  they'll move the boundaries they'll move the the goal posts and then what you were saying a month
*  ago is now problematic and now you have to adhere to a new thing yeah and i also just think like
*  it's it's annoying that we have to go that way because like why can't we just all enjoy jerry
*  like i guess that's what i think like why can't we just all enjoy this like i kind of even if you
*  don't like even if you say something i don't like i'm like i try to separate the comic
*  from the whatever else you know i could still listen to cosby that's interesting yeah that
*  one would be tough i just have to fall asleep sometimes at night and uh no no no i actually
*  don't really listen to cosby but i do think i can i do it with movies all the time like i don't
*  i don't agree with like woody allen roman polanski or woody allen but i fucking love
*  movies and i and i think woody allen's made some of the best movies ever so yeah he's made incredible
*  movies and he was a great stand-up i mean you know uh i can i can separate for the most cosby's tough
*  because what's it called himself yeah it's tough yeah it's tough to separate right yeah it's also
*  just feels dishonest because it's the cleanest shit ever and it's like rape and this one lady
*  was saying he might be the most prolific serial raper in history yeah like who knows how many
*  people he did it to that don't come out about it i know you know how many people don't know what
*  happened it's also tough when the person who does the shit is so holier than thou and so beloved
*  but also just so much like you know yeah you need to do things this way it's like those types of
*  so that's a that is tough but like you know those are the type of people that are usually creeps
*  yeah it's like male feminists are usually the biggest fucking piece of shit yeah because they're
*  they're putting on an act that they hope you'll respond to if you're a woman you know that's what
*  it is they're just the most it's a bait and switch and it's the most manipulative thing and one of
*  the things you get from those guys the creepiest of them they will go after other men and they
*  go after other men publicly i remember jamie kilstein went after me for a fucking rape joke
*  in like 2013 i had a fucking rape joke that like i got torn to shreds for by these like fake you
*  know feminist things i did i still remember the joke it was like i was i was fucking a black girl
*  not a great joe i was talking to black girl while we were having sex she kept dropping the n word she
*  was like no and then i paused and i was like you guys are worried i was going to say the n word
*  then everyone was like thank god rape joke so that was a joke that like that somehow that word is
*  more offensive than me raping a person yeah so like the joke killed it would always kill and then
*  i had another one in the same set this woman saw me i said the whole set was rape and no i said uh
*  i said my girlfriend never makes me wear the condom because she's on the pill ambient another fun one
*  right there were two quick silly jokes to me right but she wrote a hit piece on me tore me to shreds
*  it was like it went like fucking it got shared because i showed the collin quinn i was a young
*  seller comic at the time it's like 2013 and i showed the collin and he goes the most fucked
*  apart is she omitted the punchline from your jokes okay so she is trying to just show that
*  you're a piece of shit she's not even showing the comedy here yeah he says you have to write
*  something so i wrote something uh and it then it got shared a ton like all these websites like
*  salon jezebel tore me to shreds i was like he's a nobody all this shit like just like cutting me
*  down i was a no i was i had nothing going on and they wanted me to go on like kumail bell show at
*  the time to like defend and i'm like my my manager at the time was like i don't want your first tv
*  credit to be defending a rape joke and i was like i agree so it didn't do shit but then like here's
*  the fucking best part so i had a trans joke in my in my netflix special that was like pretty pro
*  trans i was just like being a contrarian i was like everyone's doing these like trans bad i'm
*  gonna go the other way have fun with it went viral and all these people are like like this is how you
*  fucking do it blah blah blah one person writes fuck him he made uh bad jokes in 2013 it's the
*  person who fucking tried to cancel me in 2013 who is now a man so she she's now a guy so that's the
*  joke i did in the special i go but you know that people can change yeah yeah yeah so that's what i
*  say that's why i call my new special you've changed for that but i'm like yeah what is the
*  so you can be a different person but i can't grow as a fucking human right the hypocrisy forever is
*  absurd it's absurd and also guess what i am a different comic than i was in 2013 not in like
*  a fucking i'm i'm better i'm a better stand-up i take if i go there now i hope it's a better joke
*  yeah but like how come there's only room for growth on your side it's fucking absurd absurd yeah well
*  it's and i accept whatever you fuck you choose to it's your body do whatever the fuck you want
*  but but the idea that like you get to do whatever you want but then everyone else is like a target
*  to you is insane it is insane but it just shows you the disingenuous approach to things and also
*  that the people that are involved in this sort of attacking people they're not enlightened for a
*  lack of a better term not saying that i am but their their level of compassion is not it's not
*  for everybody it's only for people that agree with them you're progressive but only you can
*  progress exactly and it's also only people that only the only people that agree with you 100
*  but then let's look into your own life i guarantee you're a mess i know well these are the people
*  that went after shane too you have to realize and and the fucked up way they went after shane was
*  that uh i remember they went after shane so hard i remember i think was cnn had a thing they were
*  like people who were canceled this year and it was weinstein cosby and shane and i was like this is
*  like a sat question which one doesn't fit yeah this is so fucking unfair so you know uh i think
*  that shit that ship is sailed i think it's for the most part over and i think like we're mostly
*  laughing about it now yeah but you know but now you see it with the tenacious d guy and now it's
*  it's predominantly the left that goes after people but like now it's it's kind of this was the right
*  where they're like celebrating the the kyle gass thing well i'm like hey man it's either all okay
*  none of it's the south park guys either all okay or none's okay yeah the guy said something on stage
*  because he's signaling to all his liberal followers and he's trying to be cool and he probably had no
*  idea that that was going to get out to the rest of the world he thought he was just saying it to
*  his crowd and he didn't understand because he's like 60 years old you know you see that guy he's
*  old as fuck i don't i didn't see it he's like a super old triple vax liberal yeah and he you know
*  he said something and it was a stupid thing to say and then they he had to cancel their whole
*  fucking tour and they get death threats and i'm bummed that jack black canceled on him well they
*  all cancel well that's your friend though i mean that's that bummed me out because i think jack
*  black's hilarious so that we didn't throw his friend under the bus he said he was blindsided by it
*  and that he doesn't support hate speech political hate speech yeah i mean well but what is hate
*  speech is my other thing it's like you either made a joke you either say it's a joke right or it is
*  actual it's either a joke or it's not a joke it is the definition of too soon yeah that's what it is
*  sure it was two days and the joke bombed yeah right i mean it was like oh jesus i don't like
*  the i don't think do i think it's a good joke no no but also like why are you calling for i don't
*  like the calling for people's heads either yeah i don't like it either i think they're just delaying
*  their tour he's just gonna take some time off he just wanted a vacation no i really think that's
*  what the decision was i think the decision was to stop the tour and then come back yeah maybe yeah
*  isn't that what they said tours canceled he's been dropped by his agent oh never mind whoa
*  i was about to be like you know what summer is hard to tour but now yeah has everybody been
*  dropped or just that one guy just says jack black hasn't been dropped yeah you're a dumb
*  fucking agent if you're dropping that one yeah if you drop jack black like yo at first i thought
*  jack black said it no when i saw the clip i was like oh no i was watching tropic thunder the other
*  day on tv it's still funny it's amazing it's really funny it's the last free movie they don't
*  do anymore dude you can't do a movie like that someday it'll come back around i asked robert
*  downey jr on the podcast i said do you think you make tropic thunder today he's like oh you could
*  make it i saw that he's awesome he's great yeah yeah yeah that's uh you know ben stiller doesn't
*  get enough credit for kind of just going for it with that shit that was in that movie yeah went
*  for it so did tom cruise remember when tom cruise played that fat agent with the awesome i was like
*  i said i want to see you do more comedy yes enough i know like i know you want to do your own stunts
*  and you're like a fucking death wish and it's badass and stuff but like i want to see tom
*  cruise in a comedy yeah well listen i know tom tom cruise is a loon but tom cruise because the
*  fact he's a loon can kind of do anything i mean he can like he played the vampire listat an interview
*  with the vampire and all of an rice's fans were protesting like why people did not want tom cruise
*  to play listat but he's great he's great but if you didn't know tom cruise at the time was top gun
*  he was like fucking blockbuster boy and then all he's gonna play this homosexual vampire
*  who's like this it's called acting yeah but it's it was too beloved to them to the people like have
*  you ever read an interview with a vampire no i haven't fucking amazing but he's more gay than he
*  is a pool shark and he played a pool shark in the color of money so who gives a shit yeah the pool
*  shark wasn't believable but he did but he did learn how to do it though that was more offensive
*  to me than the vampire he learned kinda kinda if i watched him play i'd be like come on but you're
*  gonna pool yeah that's the difference i saw but if you watch someone play guitar and you don't
*  know how to play guitar i don't know what's going on right but if you're a really good guitar player
*  and you say oh he's not even hitting the right keys when that sounds coming out this is bullshit
*  that's not how you play guitar it's like seeing comedy in a movie punchline it's usually rough
*  punchline with sally fields and tom hanks it's rough yeah it's fucking awesome with the lockers
*  they have lockers yeah they have lockers i love tom hanks but yeah it's not fucking uh yeah it's
*  comedy doesn't the only time i saw it kind of work was when sandler did it in the in the judd
*  appetow movie where like because sandler does stand up though right he's a real comedy yeah yeah
*  you could do a movie with comedy in it like louis did with with louis you know you know he's such a
*  good show i sent him an email like a year ago it was like 2 a.m i just wrote him an email being like
*  man i i miss shows like this and i miss the representation in new york and i and i love how
*  like uh you make new york like disgusting and ugly but also like kind of beautiful and a mess
*  and and like against you at all times like there's a scene in that show where he uh he misses you know
*  what i'm talking about with the flight he misses the flight and the woman's just typing in he's
*  like what happened to the flight she just keeps typing she goes uh it uh it was cancelled he's
*  like why and she goes it crashed and he goes oh my god is anyone okay and she's like keeps typing
*  she goes everyone's dead except one baby like that type of joy is so absurd and silly but it got me
*  so good because like we'll get so angry when we miss a connect flight and then everyone's dead is
*  such a great like that was his mind and and he wrote like a long thing back just being like uh
*  that was like a really cool time in my life and and uh like how much you know we put into it that
*  show i think is like brilliant you know he edited that show on his macbook and and the music yeah
*  and he edited that show on the 12 inch macbook the little tiny one and i go why are you doing
*  it on that he goes i like doing it on this little thing yeah that show is i re-watched it recently
*  and i was like amazed at how well it holds up like it's it's a great show it's a great show and i
*  remember when he did lucky louis i like that too lucky louis okay but i talked to him at the
*  improv one night we're hanging out and i was like what would you do different you know because it
*  was like it had all fallen apart yeah he goes i would uh would fire all the writers he goes i
*  didn't want to fire them he goes i just i would have fired everybody well he also was trying to
*  do like a jackie gleason like sitcom-y type thing and his strength is being himself right so that's
*  i still enjoyed it but yeah louis like on another level yeah well louis was him with freedom you
*  know it's like if you take a guy like that and you just just let him he's gonna do the best he can
*  he's gonna do the best he can always yeah just gotta let him do that and get out of the way
*  you're not going to give him good ideas you're not gonna help i know you're not gonna tag once
*  for a joke and it killed him immediately and i was like that's a good comic right there oh he's great
*  he's good at comedy yeah i did king kong joke he gave me a great tag once about king kong's wife
*  giving him shit and i had a joke where i said it's a joke that i did in the joke in the movie the
*  joker i say i did a million jokes for that movie and there's the one they use but i said uh you
*  know men and women look at sex definitely men look at it like women look at sex like uh like buying a
*  car you're like can i see myself in this long term is it safe is it reliable could it kill me
*  and i said men look at sex like parking a car we're like there's a spot there's another spot
*  oh i have to pay never mind and louis goes you should add uh handicapped hope no one sees this
*  i had a handicap line but his hope no one sees this hit harder and i was like there there we go
*  it just worked hope no one sees this is so much more fucked up and funny oh yeah i had a handicap
*  line but it worked but this one then killed and i was like he's good and i never i don't really
*  normally take tags but when it's louis you're kind of like let me try it and then it was too
*  good to not tell too good yeah yeah you gotta take it yeah but it's like so fun when you have a joke
*  and people think it's over and then there's you know there's one more line especially if you're
*  doing like you know a tough crowd and they're like and then they're like all right they have
*  to like give it up a little bit that was good yeah yeah yeah it's always great when you find those
*  too when you've got the beginning of a joke and it's kind of doing okay in the early days of the
*  joke you just started trotting it out you're fucking with it and working and you're like
*  god there's something there and then you find the next thing and boom you open up a new door
*  now you have a whole new door that is attached to the premise that's a bunch of new angles you can
*  take yeah it's fucking it's a it's a great thing it's like you have a toy that you find it you're
*  like oh i didn't know it did that yeah it's so cool uh louis said he's gonna take a year off
*  and so he's basically taking i think a year and a half i think he took it yeah i mean he's i saw
*  him it's almost a year right yeah i saw him uh at the cellar and he was uh he was trying some new
*  stuff and it was funny and was recently yeah he's always okay so he's back yeah he saw i i hate when
*  in a comic like that's in the back of the room when i'm fucking around just trying to find
*  my god damn it and i get off my go hey louis like what's up man god damn it i was fucking around
*  yeah i love that when people are doing that though i know you're funny i'm not gonna like if i see
*  someone have a weird set where they're working on new shit i never think oh sam sucked now you know
*  like that would you would be an idiot for thinking that yeah i guess we're always in our head a
*  little bit you know always at part of it once you think you're not once you think you're awesome
*  i had a set once where i switched the order of things on the spot for some strange reason
*  i decided to try it this way and it worked great but i realized as i was into the set that i missed
*  a giant part of one of the bits because i switched it around and it didn't fit anymore and i couldn't
*  add it anywhere else and so i was in my head but i was still killing yeah well i was in my head and
*  then after it was over i'm like i gotta listen this it must be fucked up but it no it was the
*  recording was great yeah i was listening to him like this was all like a self-inflicted mind fuck
*  because i knew that there was more to the bit but they didn't know there was more to the bed
*  they just thought you knew there was more exactly and that it's annoying though when you even there
*  was more meat on the bone i hate that i mean the worst it happens a lot when you do you like well
*  let me try sometimes you try to flex you're like let me open with an abortion joke and see if i can
*  dig out of this hole and it misses and you're like oh fuck now they hate me but i do it all the time
*  like i i have a new hitler chunk i was doing at your club last night and i'm like let me open on
*  this and they're like now you can't open on the hitler joke you gotta earn it give them four
*  minutes yeah you gotta get them to trust the way you think about things so i love late night sets
*  still even though they're like so i mean but i like not even that many comics do anymore but
*  when you watch an old one and you're like oh a guy had you had to open on this joke for a reason
*  like there's this comic in new york nick griffin who's like he was like the master of the letterman
*  sets i thought his letterman's did like 11 lettermans they're all flawless you know and every
*  opening joke was perfect he had a joke where he goes they say to live every day like it's your last
*  so uh i've been crying a lot lately that's a great fucking joker uh you know uh he goes i hate oh
*  there's another one he opened with i always look at the opener because i'm fascinated by he goes
*  i hate these celebrities lady gaga you know oh the press uh the press is bothering me oh cool
*  visa's bothering me that's like all right you're self-deprecating out of the gate it's a quick joke
*  i like the quick laugh yeah yeah visa's bothering me want to trade it's like a great line yeah
*  the construction of a great joke and and starting off with a great joke so important for opening
*  acts i always tell that for guys on the road like if they've never done like a big theater before
*  and they're coming with me i'm like this and go out there say hi to them don't rush don't rush
*  into your first joke yeah but when you commit that first joke's got to be a banger because they
*  don't know you and it might not get the laughs you think it deserves because the audience isn't
*  warmed up yet but you got to accept that but you got to start out with a banger well even if they're
*  not laughing hard at least like okay okay like they might not be laughing but they might have a
*  smile on their face yeah you know and then literally warming them up yes you're warming them up and
*  that's why i appreciate comics who warm up crowds with jokes and not just like bullshit oh yeah i
*  have a respect for people that whatever way you warm them up however you get them cool but like i
*  toured gary veider and it's just killer deadpan one-liners they're all just like deadpan and i'm
*  like this is he's low energy so they have to listen and for me that sets the table where you know every
*  joke is fucking killer dude i have to piss or i'm gonna break let's take a little break we'll be
*  right back yeah ron moved out here in like 2017 or 18 yeah and i call i mean he was always at the
*  store too because he had a he had a condo in Beverly Hills or excuse me he had a house in
*  Beverly Hills it wasn't a condo it was a mansion and um he just said i'm fucking moving to Texas
*  he goes i love it here i travel it's in the middle of country easy to take a flight to anywhere
*  people are nicer no traffic food's fucking great and that kind of put the seeds in my head that
*  was like the first seeds in my head i was like did you not like la no no there's too many people
*  i think you get around too many people it's not good for your head i think too many people like
*  that people become uh they become a problem rather than a a resource you know there's too many they
*  get in the way they're in the way of things too clogged up and i think it creates anxiety when
*  you're stuck in traffic all the time i think that's bad for you i wanted to just also i didn't trust
*  it i felt like it could fall apart at any moment it was always like i was always waiting for the
*  next earthquake or the next fire i was evacuated three times from my house from fires yeah last
*  one uh two houses in front of my house burnt to the ground right in front of my house what the
*  fuck yeah the wildfires were crazy yeah it's fucking scary right fucking scary when you see
*  him coming you know um i came home from the comedy store it was like one o'clock in the morning
*  and uh me and my wife were looking out the window at the fire coming over the hill and uh we made
*  an early call we said look if we're wrong we'll come back the house is still here but let's just
*  get the fuck out of here now i'm like that's too close they weren't evacuating yet i'm like let's
*  get out of here and so we got all of our shit and we got a hotel in beaverly hills and then next
*  thing you know it swept through our neighborhood that's fucking horrible it burnt 40 i think 40
*  houses in my neighborhood jesus christ dude is crazy that's awful between my neighborhood and
*  that's like what is it like july or what i don't remember what it happened i want to say i don't
*  know i mean la is dry it's dry all it takes is a good wind and and fires but it happened three
*  times three separate times we had to get evacuated yeah it was weird man and when you see when you
*  see it when you see the walls of flame that are from the left to the right everywhere you can see
*  as flames you see houses going up it's spooky man it's spooky like a horror movie yeah and then
*  you realize like i talked to a fireman once this is one of the reasons that freaked me out at uh
*  one of the time i'm wearing an la fire department show shout out yeah fire department shirt it's a
*  badass job fucking tough people man yeah they those those fucking people they don't get nearly the
*  credit that they deserve so i was talking to this guy and he was telling me he goes dude one day
*  he goes it's just going to be the right wind and fire is going to start in the right place and it's
*  going to burn through la all the way to the ocean and it's not a fucking thing we can do about it
*  i go really he goes yeah we're just we just get lucky he goes we get lucky with the wind he goes
*  but if the wind hits the wrong way it's just going to burn straight through la and there's not going
*  to be a thing we could do about it because these fires are so big dude when they're talking about
*  like thousands of acres that are burning simultaneously with like 40 mile an hour winds
*  and the winds just blowing embers through the air and those embers are landing on roofs and those
*  houses are going up and they're landing on bushes and those bushes are going up and everything's dry
*  and once it happens it happens in a way where it's so spread out that there's nothing they can do
*  there's nothing you just have to evacuate nothing nothing they can do just got to get out of there
*  it's fucking weird dude one of the worst i ever bombed ever in my career and i wasn't that good
*  at the time either so it was easy to make me bomb but i was uh i had done one of those naka one of
*  those college things and uh i got i did well at the thing and i i got a bunch of gigs and so i was
*  really funny at the naka show i killed and so i got this gig and i was headlining and jb smooth
*  was opening and uh it was this weird gig in new jersey and it was in the middle of nowhere and
*  this is back way before navigation so you would get a piece of paper that would say take the 405
*  to the this take a ride here go down to the you know so you have to really follow the directions
*  it was complicated and i remember i left real early and i still it took a long time to get there
*  and i finally found the place and i was there but jb smooth was not there and the show was supposed
*  to start in like 20 minutes and so i said uh what do you guys want to do and they said well we'll
*  just wait for him don't worry about it everyone's just sitting in the hall like waiting for the show
*  to start it's fine so they go okay great so i sat down and i started watching tv and there's a show
*  on about the malibu fires and it is the most fucking depressing thing i've ever seen in my
*  life this guy who was a fireman his act i think his house was actually saved the guy that was
*  crying but um he was just weeping because his whole life he had invested and saved money to make this
*  house and built this house and his house survived but like his neighbor's house is fucked his other
*  it like it's so random which houses get burnt which houses did and then there was this kid who
*  was calling for his dog so his kids walk into the street like rusty where are you rusty
*  it's the saddest shit the dog's dead as fuck you know like everything's dead it's like you're
*  looking at the most insane wasteland of burnt homes and people weeping and crying and people
*  died in their cars it was horrible horrible shit and then they come in the room and still like
*  jb is not going to be here in time so we're just going to have you go up first and then if he gets
*  here he'll go on after you i'm like okay yeah and so i went on stage like sad from the malibu fire
*  and i was not funny at all i could muster yeah funny i couldn't and i remember this girl was
*  dating at the time she was there with me she was what the fuck was that i was like i watched the
*  malibu fire thing i was fucking sad now she's dry too yeah ah and then jb went up after me and
*  murdered murdered he's funny he came in loose and like he was like i got lost and he was just
*  killing someone's just got to not watch the news never watch the news but that's what that that's
*  the thing about this cable news like i watch it i'm just like why would i watch this i feel
*  fucking horrible you feel horrible and it's not helping you and i mean you really like you've
*  got to be real careful about any input that gets in your mind before you go on stage yeah you
*  shouldn't have an argument with your girlfriend you shouldn't call your friend that owes you money
*  you shouldn't talk to your parents yeah you know you have to be careful about what input like that's
*  why i like the green room at the club you go in there the music's playing comics are in there
*  everybody's hanging it's a good vibe like it feels good and then you go on stage with a smile on your
*  face like you have to yeah that's what it's supposed to be no bet dude i mean we've all done those
*  benefits where they're like those are gonna be like here this is a benefit for uh you know
*  i did a benefit recently i didn't fucking think i don't i usually look what it's for so i know
*  it's a good cause but i was like in a rush and i just showed up to a benefit you know like all
*  fucking okay what do we find i like within 30 seconds i open on a joke drinking on muscle relax
*  there's like silence and i'm like okay something's wrong here whatever i keep powering through bombing
*  my dick off the crowd's looking at me like who is this guy this guy sucks and i get off and the guy
*  running is like what the fuck is wrong with you and i go what do you mean he goes it's a benefit
*  for a guy who died from drinking on muscle relaxers and i was like so i chose the wrong material and
*  how about let me know that before i go on stage they sent something i didn't read it was my fault
*  entirely it was completely my fault but i i yeah i was like oh shit but i've done those days where
*  they're like sometimes you do a benefit where you know what it's for and you buy over they're like
*  you know it's a you know a thing for a cancer benefit or like a holocaust thing and they show
*  holocaust footage and you're like hey not a great warm-up back yeah listen i'll just give you money
*  yeah you want to check i'll send you a check i'm not performing but if it's walking distance i'll
*  pretty much always do it just for the fun just for funsies it's like it's easy to just walk in
*  and do a set it's like i've done some that were good i've done some benefits that were fun and
*  they were good but i've also done some that maybe go i'm never doing one of these again
*  yeah this is just not worth doing i think comedy should only be in a comedy club like when i hear
*  about people doing corporate gigs i'm like what are you doing and why are you doing that i know
*  but it's not that are you going to notice like i do notice if you like if you have let's say you
*  have ten thousand dollars in your bank account do you notice if you have ten thousand five hundred
*  you don't who's getting paid 500 for one of those things i'm just saying so if you have my problem
*  was if you have 10 million in the bank right like some people i know that do these fucking things
*  and you get tortured for ten thousand dollars like tony just did one he got tortured for ten
*  thousand dollars he goes it was the worst thing i've ever done in my life i go why did you do it
*  he goes offer me ten thousand dollars and it was right down the street so i just did i go you're
*  not going to notice that ten thousand dollars but you're going to feel that bomb you're going to feel
*  you might get a funny story too i always think like i mean dude that's why i do morning tv things i'm
*  like it's going to be bad but it's going to be funny bad okay you brought that up because that
*  morning joe one was amazing oh my god that was hilarious because you know what the funny part is
*  like i wasn't even misbehaving on that one they just hated me and it was even funnier like
*  he he set me up in a way where he was like he clearly hasn't watched my shit which is fine i
*  know he hasn't but i clearly a producer is a fan of mine so they're like giving him lines for my
*  special to cue me up so he cued me up for a gun baby joke and i was like okay i'll tell the joke
*  and i told it and he just looked at me like yeah and i'm like yeah dude well what do you want well
*  i sent you that stuff on him like that's the guy that was gaslighting us like this is the best
*  biden ever and if you don't want to you don't believe me f you well he you know the thing
*  about a lot of those guys are is like as i said it's poison these cable shows but instead of
*  being like sometimes you'll follow a comic and they're like a hack but they know they're a hack
*  and they're like i'm sorry i just have to go out and do that and you're like oh yeah right but he
*  like goes on the acts like the all these guys they go on they act like they're like doing the lord's
*  work or edward armura or something and i'm like oh so you're gonna do this and think you're like
*  there's like this type of like liberal elitism where it's like there's two types of like older
*  liberals there's like the type that like is like an old hippie and is like oh man that was cool
*  you did that shit and then there's types that look at you like well he wasn't a liberal no he used to
*  be a republican yeah and then he got on msnbc yeah you gotta you gotta go with the money i guess
*  panties yeah but it was uh that was a weird segment but i actually was awesome i get off on that a
*  little bit i kind of like when i know it's gonna be bad i think it's funny because i'm just like
*  well it's live what do they i can just do whatever i want yeah it's funny to me when it goes horribly
*  those are state-run propaganda shows that's all they are they're bullshit news distribution
*  and i'll happily go back i do enjoy it like i think i enjoyed it there's something i enjoyed
*  watching him react and it was a great joke that's a good bit it's a very good bit yeah and watching
*  him not respond to that very good bit i'm like you can't even admit that that's a good bit that's
*  what bums me out a little bit is like they kind of like just fucking smile come on i know you're
*  not admitting that i'm not saying school shootings are okay i'm just saying this joke works right it's
*  just a joke sometimes you can just smile at the at the fun of the jokes but like i guess i think of
*  those crowds and you think of those crowds are like not only do you think i'm i'm shit you think
*  you're better than me and i feel it and that's a bummer well that position of being that guy
*  in the suit with the fucking makeup on in front of the camera speaking the truth that's an
*  intoxicating power position i guess i don't know well i mean i don't know but it must feel all right
*  it's an intoxicating power position for those people you know they want to be that guy that is
*  the the center of the new show and you know all the people are waiting for them to talk and there's
*  all the cameramen and they're all pointed at him makes them super important there's people behind
*  the scenes with clipboards they're all looking at him yeah those idiots like that it's funny
*  because the producers were like quoting my bitch they knew who i was and yeah they're regular people
*  yeah and they were they're really cool and so i'm sure that's who gave them that thing they were like
*  talk about guns and babies i was like you got it and uh i mean fuck god bless even l sharpton kind
*  of chuckled at least i was like i got something out of him even you know come on give me something
*  al sharpton's an old school grifter he knows a good joke yeah come on i mean that guy's entire
*  career started on a false rape accusation yeah yeah get out there and do the real thing buddy
*  you see what he looks like now he's lost like a bob all of his weight he's like he's like super
*  super thin oh there i am wow i look well what the fuck is wrong with me yeah let's hear it
*  disappointed sam i'm not gonna lie but i'm used to that wherever i go i show up at places and people
*  oh no it's earlier in this is the end you gotta go watch party it's way earlier
*  i'll show you i'll shock her because she said something about him no no go to the beginning
*  the beginning where he sets up the gun jokes the funny one hey they give me a nice plug though
*  there's something presidential election and sam joins us now sam i just i gotta start with this
*  quote because it's most relevant it is it is oh no not go to the past the election here yeah this
*  whatever this is just me making a biden joke or whatever trump biden joke then yeah the next
*  right there maybe parallel of guns and babies together but you do it masterfully explain
*  well both are easy to hate but then you hold one and you're like i kind of get it you know
*  we laughed at that yeah yeah both annoying on airplanes
*  yeah if you're dating someone new and they have either you're like it could be a problem
*  you know and both will be in a school soon yeah yeah exactly
*  he did not like that yeah exactly that's one that you can't like what do you do what do you even say
*  to that yeah but you know he laughed a little bit it was a little more than i thought yeah a little
*  give me a hint it wasn't that bad but al sharpton was laughing yeah because i told him i was like i
*  bet you're a sam or l fan just like playfully and he was like i bet i could be yeah and then i was
*  like i was like you know i brought up the thing about like uh and frank uh no when uh justin
*  bieber went to and frank's house and in the signing book wrote i think she would have been a believer
*  i'm like that's how i feel about you and me did he say that i said that to him no did justin bieber
*  really do that yeah yeah he got a lot of shit for that years ago whoa yeah but come on we were
*  entertainers we fucking get it how old was he he was a baby he was young yeah i mean yeah the fuck
*  is he supposed to do yeah he just figured things out he's been shocking he was in a shocking phase
*  you know i think he was like i meant i think he meant it in like good spirits i don't think he was
*  like trying to be like fuck her i think he was like trying to have fun with it you know yeah but
*  but i said that to al sharpton he was like yeah he like went with it i was like all right well the
*  thing is those places are not places for humor there's no no room for humor because they think
*  they're saving the world it's like but the world stays and then you just annoyed everybody your
*  entire career and you didn't save anything ever you never changed anybody's opinion you didn't
*  that's why i'm shocked they want me on these shows because i'm just like i'm like i'm i'll happily go
*  in but i'm just shocked in there i'm like i'm i'm there just like laughing in the green room like
*  this is gonna be bad like i know it's gonna be bad they need anything but yeah i went on the
*  ari melbourne once and he just like would set me up for jokes and then look at me like so why is
*  that funny and i'd be like are you fucking kidding me because it's a joke i don't know clearly it's
*  not funny i don't know you know but you're just rolling with it was a big thing difference between
*  being funny on a talk show in front of a person who's not ready to be laughing and then an audience
*  that's why i play the producers usually i'm trying to get them laughing because then if you hear
*  laughs in the background it's undeniable but if i'm just bombing for one dude yeah it's fucking weird
*  yeah you want to play the camera guys yeah the normal people camera guys in the grips i love
*  doing that shit though i i all my friends are like you're a psycho for going on morning shows
*  because like you have stavros and norman are like i'm not waking up at 7 a.m to do this i'm like i
*  will happily you still do it of course if you will have me the last one that had me was uh in
*  salt lake city utah and they were like they knew i do this so they were the guy came in the green
*  room was like fucking with me i'm in the green room my friend gary veder i made him come with me
*  because i'm like i can't do this it's like a bank robbery i need an uber waiting for me because i
*  need to get right out right but the guy was fucking with me in the green room like the anchor was
*  like a handsome mormon guy being like oh you're gonna fuck with me and i looked at gary like this
*  guy's got like an edge i was like i was like yeah i guess i don't know and he's like yeah let's see
*  if you fuck he was like kind of being a dick and i was like all right so then in my head i'm like
*  i'm gonna fuck with him so i went on there and it was like the week the diddy shit broke and i was
*  like man how about that p diddy and he and he was just like well we're not going to talk about that
*  and i was like well anyway p diddy i just kept doing it and he got pissed and his anchor the
*  woman was cool as fuck she was laughing but he just kept being like well you're well you'll never be
*  invited back and uh no yeah and i was like i had to pretend i was upset that i was never going to
*  be back on uh good morning salt lake i was like oh no and then uh and then but then of course after
*  the segment i'm leaving and i'm trying to get out of there with gary but all the crew is like
*  stopping me and they're like grabbing me they're like trying to take selfies because they're like
*  we all hate him so i'm like oh cool that's hilarious but uh yeah you ever see sagura when
*  he used to do dj dad mouth yeah i love it i love it's fun it's like you know what it's such a fake
*  type of tv that it's fun for us to go on and just be ourselves yeah and it's i love that shit i love
*  i still have a weird fondness for like the comfort of that and then fucking with it i don't know why
*  but i'll throw sometimes i'll be like at home and i'll throw on good morning america in the
*  bed i'm like this is kind of funny how like i don't know they're like cooking something it's
*  peaceful i don't know it's weird to watch some of those shows like i watch the view every now and
*  then just because i don't know i've never seen one episode i've never seen it yeah yeah you
*  got to go for a walk after you see them just go what yeah i still i used to know uh whoopi
*  goldberg from the movie eddie where she's the next coach that's how i choose to think of her yeah
*  that shows never seen there's a bunch of those shows where you're just like who are these people
*  and how do they think this way yeah but you need to know that those people exist and that there's
*  a bubble and those people exist in a bubble and they all think they're right and they clap and
*  there's no one disagrees with them yeah well it's good to well that's i would happily go in the view
*  man i would love to go i've i've heard it but i think i'd make a nice little impression i love
*  the clip of norm on the view that's the clip i've seen yeah norm was great norm was really talking
*  about hillary clinton killing people it's pretty funny i just like disrupting like i think the
*  disrupting is really funny it's very funny yeah norm was the best at that he was yeah i wish i
*  knew him i only met him twice and he was so nice the two times i met him but he was uh i met him on
*  last comic standing where i got eliminated immediately i i had a pretty good set but then
*  i had a feeling they weren't going to move i watched two comics in front of me fucking bomb
*  and move on by the way uh but i yeah i remember keen and ivory wayans was like uh you were funny
*  on some jokes and not funny on others and i just like sarcastically responded well i loved all your
*  scary movie films and and it got a big pop and he goes i only did the first two i'm like it was a
*  joke i don't know i'm fucking trying to survive here and then afterwards norm saw me on the way
*  to the bathroom and was like i like these shit on him that was funny yeah and that was like my one
*  interaction with and then another time i met him at carolines where uh we were doing march madness
*  style do you know what that was where it was like one on one you had to do like 60 seconds or 60
*  seconds and i was in the finals i think i lost to dan soder in the championship which was like i was
*  happy to i love dan so i was kind of like it's kind of fun to even be in the finals with dan
*  but norm was hanging with us and he's like he said something he's like man i hate this shit they
*  it's like they take you out back and fuck you in the ass and we were just like yeah wait like we
*  didn't know he was talking about we're like it's norm just fucking go with whatever he says he's a
*  fucking legend you know i uh randomly sat next to him twice on airplanes wow yeah well you guys
*  were buddies right yeah well we knew each other we knew each other from the clubs but just randomly
*  we happened to be in the same city the same town on the same plane and he sat next to me twice
*  that's amazing yeah it was amazing and so like for three hours me and norm just talking shit and
*  having fun and one time one of my favorite stories was he was on he's like yeah quit cigarettes and
*  quit smoking say fucking cigarettes are terrible they're terrible for you they kill you and so we're
*  talking about things and we get off the plane and he immediately runs into one of the the shops and
*  grabs a pack of cigarettes and he's lighting it before he gets out the door out the door he's like
*  i go i thought you quit cigarettes i did but we were talking about it i wanted one you know i just
*  couldn't help myself so funny oh he was an animal legend yeah real legend and even the way he went
*  out you know didn't even tell anybody just went to canada who the fuck would ever do that anymore
*  like no one no one everybody makes a big deal out of it they post on social media these tearful
*  videos i'm in stage four and you know thank you for all your hopes and wishes and prayers and
*  yeah and norm was like i'm just gonna ride off in the sunset yeah you're so fucking fun and you know
*  you see so many videos of him online now like anytime anything comes up there's always a norm
*  joke and you kind of forget that he's dead you know he's so funny it's weird that it's like giving him
*  a second life kind of a weird way because i think it's really unfortunate some of these
*  guys who are brilliant like they don't get their due until obviously was huge and he was a weekend
*  update guy did so much great stuff and movies and all that stuff but not what he deserved not what
*  he deserved and i felt the same way about greg giordano and about like patrice i think a lot of
*  those guys kind of didn't get the love they deserved yeah until i feel afterwards if patrice
*  survived he would be the number one podcaster in the world that's what i feel like i feel like the
*  only reason why i'm number one is because patrice isn't alive because he was smart but also
*  hilarious but also did not give a fuck like did not give any fucks and would tell people to their
*  face the most ridiculous shit that happened to be true and you know and he was the master at it he
*  was so good at it like on opi and anthony he was the best at calling people out on their bullshit
*  and then having points him and his best was fucking oh he was so but he did fuck around a lot i think
*  like i hear about i hear stories of the seller all the time they're like god we wish he would
*  like try because he would just not try sometimes he just didn't give a shit well it was also that's
*  a lot of the ways those guys would come up with material you know that's a good point like that
*  was damon wayans thing i used to what damon wayans in my opinions i still say this to this day the
*  most underrated of all the greats i think damon wayans is one of the all-time greats yeah he kind
*  of stopped doing it in the height of his have you ever seen this hpro special the last stand he's
*  like murdering to the point of murdering he was so good dude but i used to see him at the store all
*  the time and he would go on stage for an hour and a half with no material and he would murder he
*  films every set he has a tape recorder in the back of the room like a camera that's filming every set
*  and he archives them all so he has like every set that he's ever done since like the 1990s
*  wow and i saw him just a few years back i want to say five six years ago at the improv same thing
*  he was starting to do stand-up again had the camera out on stage fucking around and he that's
*  how he would take a bit and then put words to it and pump it up and change it but he would come up
*  with the initial premise out of nothing yeah like there was no he he was silence it's just talking
*  people who write on stage like that it's to me kind of insane it's insane it's insane he
*  i mean i wonder if his film career made him kind of must have put made him put stand up on hold a
*  bit because i'm in tv remember he had a tv series when you have a tv series for those guys especially
*  that were in the 90s that was the golden carrot that was the thing you get a sitcom and that's
*  what everybody wanted so even if you don't really necessarily think that's the best thing for you
*  like you know you could make money doing stand-up and traveling and doing the road those guys get
*  tired they don't want to do the road anymore and then the the sitcom job is so easy you just show
*  up and you're getting 100 grand a week yeah 100 grand a week just every fucking say words
*  it's not that hard and his and his movies like he's a good actor he was funny at that i mean uh
*  yeah i i remember i did like the letterman show on netflix and he was like baffled by the by the
*  fact that i put out a free special he was like what he's like i don't understand like because
*  he came up in the air in the 80s was like oh i'm looking for a sitcom that was my whole thing so
*  i was like oh no you like we make money touring now that's like how we do it yeah and so he was
*  like huh he was like so intrigued by it yeah well i remember when i was on a sitcom and i heard
*  someone was doing the improv in irvine and they did the whole weekend they made 25 grand i was
*  like what yeah what you can make 25 grand doing this because i was not at that level i wasn't
*  selling any place out so i was never making that kind of money for a weekend but i was like that's
*  what i make on a sitcom like it's the same money but they're doing like stand up and i'm kind of
*  their own boss in this little velvet prison you know where i'm eating craft service and i've got
*  my own dressing room but it's a little weird it's not what i want yeah it's a fun thing to do it's
*  a great gig and that gig was the perfect version of one of those gigs and you were good at it super
*  talented people thank you funny funny fucking human beings great great crew everybody was great
*  the cast in your show was so good amazing super super super one of the funniest dudes of all time
*  i think brilliant dave foley brilliant oh man i love larry yeah mora tierney i mean she's all
*  scandi alexander vicki lewis it's like they were all amazing steven root insane actor so his career
*  is so cool he's so good yeah he's like he's in everything i feel everything i turn something on
*  i'm like oh dude this dude's got more range than like anybody and he was the only guy on the show
*  that was playing a character yeah like he was playing jimmy james like andy dick was basically
*  steroided up andy dick it was like andy dick on steroids you know i was kind of me yeah i was like
*  conspiracy theorists and you know all that stupid shit but i love when they write that shit in
*  yeah well that show was really good at that they were also really good at letting people improvise
*  like dave foley was like a secret producer of that show because he would rewrite entire scenes
*  wow like we would get the script and then we would do our uh we would do a run through right so the
*  way sitcom works is you get a script you do a table read and then after you get the table read
*  uh tom seronis who is the director and the cast we would all go okay let's put it on its legs
*  and so we would start the scene and then you know dave would a lot of times go why is andy coming
*  in this way why don't we have andy like hiding under his desk and andy because we're not supposed
*  to be talking about him or he is not supposed to know we're talking about and then he pops up and
*  oh that's a great idea and then like instead of that how about he says this and like dave you
*  know because he'd come from kids in the hall where they created all these insane sketches there's
*  kids in the hall super underrated show super underrated they were all so fucking good amazing
*  yeah and so dave was so good at producing fargo he's great in it he's great in everything he's
*  an awesome actor he's a ufo nut is he total believer which is hilarious because when we were
*  friends like he was always like why do you care about all this stuff like why do you care like
*  we were on the sitcom together because i was always in the ufos and all kinds of stupid shit
*  and he was like what do you what the fuck are you interested in this for this is all nonsense
*  and then something happened i forgot what it was and then eventually he saw one
*  and he had like a ufo experience he's a full full-on believer now which is fun it's fun for me
*  i'm like oh now you like them this is exciting life's long man yeah people change yeah i've
*  changed it's cool man it's cool you had that experience you've had like a lot of lives in
*  comedy i mean you to do the sitcom and then have your you know your game show and then
*  you're you know you're doing stand-up and you the podcast and it's like wow you can have a lot of
*  lives in this shit the thing is i got super lucky for sure in a lot of these things but also
*  everything i do is something i actually like doing yeah which is which makes it real easy
*  makes it real easy to show up for something like today like i wasn't thinking i gotta talk to sam
*  it was like we're gonna have fun let's go have fun it's not as pumped yeah it's it's uh it's all
*  good it's all a good thing so if you could find a job that you actually enjoy doing you'll probably
*  excel at it and work hard to do it yeah work hard and do your best and next thing you know it's
*  working but it's like all those things you know especially like working for the ufc and doing
*  stand-up and podcasting it's all things that's another thing i like doing you you really ufc is
*  like your number one sport by far right it's the only thing i really know yeah and boxing i but
*  not boxing not as much as ufc but it's the only thing i really really know yeah like i don't
*  really know basketball i don't really know football i kind of understand who's popular i'm friends
*  with aaron rogers i don't fucking even know the rules i hope they do well i'm not a jets fan i'm
*  a giants fan but like i want the jets to thrive like they just jets fans deserve it they do and
*  having him blow his fucking achilles out it was the most beginning of the season or jet shit that
*  has ever happened the fact i'm like because here's the most here's why he was so new york jets because
*  they still won the fucking game somehow and be like you know it's gonna be a bad season like no he i
*  was pumped for the jets when they got him and i saw him at a nix game and i was kind of like
*  oh aaron like it's cool he's in the building because he's a great guy have you ever met him
*  no i've never met him but i was kind of just like wow he's like i mean i love football so i love you
*  know um i always admired him as a quarterback i just thought he was great he's a cool guy
*  yeah i hung out with him in vegas this last trip for the ufc he came to the fights and we all went
*  out to dinner afterwards and he's just a fun guy to hang out with just genuinely cool yeah real real
*  easy down to earth like friendly to everybody easy to talk to yeah cool as shit you know i wonder when
*  he's gonna be 100 because we went to uh my wife's a big football fan and we went to see him uh well
*  she likes a lot of teams but it was she was happy for you know aaron rogers be on the jets she had
*  met aaron too she met aaron when he was on the podcast too and so um we went to see them play
*  uh the dallas cowboys so my first time ever seeing an nfl game it's fun it's amazing yeah and in that
*  stadium they have in dallas the stadium is fucking insane i've never been enormous television
*  screens like there's no bad seat in the house it's fucking great and we were on the 50 yard line it
*  was fucking awesome but aaron wasn't there because he had blown his achilles out so it's a bomber so
*  i was like i'll go to a game with you we'll go to the game we'll see my friend i would love that
*  yeah i love uh i love i mean the only problem with going to games in fucking jersey it's like such a
*  trek to get there like i go to a nix or rangers game it's 20 blocks from me like i'm in and out
*  you know even a yankees game like i love baseball still like i still love like i think baseball
*  still like i know it's had a tough run for the last 20 years or so let him get back on steroids
*  i would love it let those guys get giant and crush that ball let's go what's cool is that shit what
*  kind of nonsense is this keeping baseball players from doing steroids that was two of the biggest
*  problems in baseball was one not letting pete rosen the hall of fame he's the best fucking hitter
*  in what 50 years so he likes to gamble he also gambled on stealing bases what's the next
*  commercial fan duel draft kings and win bet you fucking hypocrites yes yes i mean look i get it
*  you shouldn't gamble on your it's fucked up but also like let let it go you have to set we've
*  talked about this before yeah separate the fucking game from that yeah bonds needs to be bonds is
*  the best hitter ever bonds is the best fucking baseball player i've ever seen
*  personally i mean like he was on the sitcom i was on he was on hardball yeah that was the first
*  short-lived hardball with yeah uh bruce greenwood yeah yeah yeah yeah greenwood and mike star yeah he
*  was on it and uh it was before the steroids he was like normal size barry bonds his head got
*  fucking he got giant dude it's weird when you do so many steroids your head gets everything got big
*  his neck got big his shoulders got big probably gained 100 pounds he was fucking huge it was cool
*  and mark maguire same thing those guys got giant sammy sosa how fucking gross was it watching
*  congress spend like 15 days on baseball the same year as hurricane katrina just because you want
*  to shake hands with rafael palmero you fucking fanboys yeah also like who cares if they do
*  steroids like why is congress involved in this when we're in international conflict it was the
*  crazy because they love baseball that's the thing i just read this joe dimaggio book in every fucking
*  every politician is obsessed with joe dimaggio of course i mean he's an american icon but like
*  they love baseball on another level i feel like it's such a historically american game like i am
*  kind of obsessed with that era of baseball because it's like it was like this is i was reading a
*  lou garrick book and it was like oh shit this was like an immigrants game but it was like white
*  immigrants that's how fucking american this shit was it was like they were like you're letting the
*  irish player it is barry bonds and bruce greenwood oh yeah he's good i like him
*  man look at him he's a different dude yeah that was normal size athlete barry bonds but you know
*  it was such a cool i mean babe the stories of babe ruth are like the coolest shit i've ever heard
*  like you can't like he was the dude he was like i'm gonna drink i'm gonna eat like shit i'm gonna
*  gamble i'm gonna fuck a million women and i'm gonna be the best player in the game but not just the
*  best one in the game the best player the game has ever seen at this point like by a mile he's
*  hitting 60 homers a year batting like 370 and he's just living like a fucking animal yeah
*  and it's like but then he had like this sweet side where like lou garrick's like this kind of you
*  know god bless him was like this square he was like really kind of like he was like a mama's boy
*  he didn't go at him party he was like very shy and babes like ah he's like the he's like one of the
*  best players ever i want to like get to know him he'd like eat at lou garrick's mom's place he's
*  going through a divorce he's fucking everyone he's like i'll take a home cook meal like it's kind of
*  and whenever he'd have a great interview he'd like give him his props he'd be like is anyone
*  touching my record no except maybe this guy like he put him over he was like not just the best
*  player and a fucking animal but he was like class it's so and it was like i love that historical
*  american shit like you know but look at him oh dude he's so cool look like that dude look at him
*  and he was fucking fast look at his face that is a drinker's face boy oh he put him back holy
*  shit oh baseball in this era is kind of cool and then like you got like the demagio like demagio
*  never was cool with mantle which is fucked up because like he just looked at him as a waste he
*  was like you're a drinker you never reach your talent was mean to him till his death till his
*  death like was not cool to him wow because he was so demagio so pure but we're talking about the
*  fucking kennedys earlier blames rfk for killing his fucking marilyn yeah probably did probably
*  probably any any any blames uh you know the sinatra for introducing her to the kennedys like all that
*  fucking italian shit where he's like you fucking traitor yeah he loved marilyn apparently like
*  left flowers on her grave till like the day she died but he left her he left her because she
*  couldn't procreate what italians needed air really yeah she couldn't procreate yeah oh she
*  had something wrong yeah oh i didn't know that so he so he left her but he's like i mean he's like
*  one of the most badass humans ever i mean just like it's crazy these dudes lost their career
*  because they had to serve in the war like isn't that just fucking insane ted williams decorated
*  fighter pilot because in his prime ted williams has to go and he's like killing dudes in the war
*  because he's like one of the best in the air force and meanwhile demagio is doing like he's
*  doing like exhibition games but he still lost his prime because like we're at war and that's
*  what you did back then but like ted williams had like 2010 vision so he's fucking a beast
*  no shit that's just the best hitter ever ted williams is also fucking murdering dudes wow
*  that's crazy well that makes sense why ted williams is so angry all the time too
*  you know because those stories were always they leave that out he was always angry
*  me who fucking had to go to war everyone jd salinger that's right they're all fucking damaged
*  from the war that's right all that whole generation were like they're the greatest
*  generation they're pretty fucked up yeah i mean think about how many of our former presidents
*  served you know canady that's what you did yeah yeah but george w or h hw yeah he got shot down
*  now the other one was cheerleading but uh isn't it funny that we look at him now as like like
*  da i wish our president was like that meanwhile back then he was like this embarrassment i always
*  said that once you start painting shit's gone off the rails well when it's over and you start
*  painting you're just trying to get away the horrible memories of all the people that died
*  unnecessarily because of your decisions i mean if you're george w and you're sitting around your
*  ranch in texas and no one's around you're sitting there sipping sweet tea thinking about a million
*  dead iraqis for some bullshit weapons of mass destruction that didn't even exist yeah
*  whoo we didn't you didn't need to do that no he would be the saddest guy to do mushrooms with
*  if you had to pick all the presidents to do mushrooms with he would be the saddest because
*  he would just start crying because he's got to be sensitive he makes all those great paintings not
*  great paintings makes all those paintings yeah you know he's got to be sensitive he's an artist
*  you know he's trying to he's not he's an artist loosely we're using that term he's not out there
*  shooting pigs out of a helicopter he's you know he's you know doing like sensitive shit so you know
*  he's thinking so he's probably thinking like what did i do what did i let that fucking dick
*  cheney monster talk me into yeah two terms two terms two terms and now we look back and go that
*  was a sensible president you know what even look at those clips of obama and mitt romney debating
*  you're like man that was like 12 years ago and it was so civil not just civil like super friendly
*  they weren't shitting on each other at all they're cordial they were just trying to debate the
*  merits of their approach to the world mccain was the same way when you watch that long i remember
*  that clip where that woman was like he's a muslim and mccain's like no he's you know he's like trying
*  to like yeah it's like that's dead that moment is over it doesn't have to be i wish i think it'll
*  come back at some point i think there's a level there's there's a limit to this shit and it's
*  going to have to swing back to civility at some point yeah i think so too i hope so i hope people
*  realize the damage it's doing to us and it's not helping anybody but the problem is social media
*  the problem is it's like social media and people's ability to constantly berate other people and
*  constantly engage in these squabbles online and try to get people and post bad sound bites yeah
*  dunking on someone's killing i remember when i forgot her name but you'll know she is there's
*  a hewlett-packard woman who was running for president uh you know who i'm talking about right
*  she was she was running uh in it was 2016 for the republican primary and at the debate like she
*  basically said that trump called her ugly and it was like this big like we need a president who
*  doesn't like speak like this no carly furina that's who it was and and i thought there was
*  like this big moment where i'm like yeah you shouldn't talk to women like that that's pretty
*  fucked up and then trump immediately like got everyone but i was like once he destroyed jeb
*  bush it was like yeah the sound bites are working so why are you going to stop doing this like
*  well that's also his entire career was you're fired yeah his entire show business career was
*  you're fired like he was like the heart get out of here you're a loser yeah you're fat you're ugly
*  you're a crook it's very new york it's like kind of like a trashy new york guy where you're like
*  you fucking nobody like that's how you know well it's politics is basically show business and he
*  was a professional showbiz guy yeah so he was way better at show business because politics is
*  basically a popularity contest that was the first guy that was an actual popular person that entered
*  into the popularity contest and actually knew how to manipulate the media and by saying ridiculous
*  shit all the time whether or not it was on purpose or not that's what got all these news organizations
*  to start following him and that just made him more popular they thought they were exposing him like
*  look what he said about the mexicans but nobody cared like this guy's wild this is so much better
*  than what we're used to it's uh the problem is other people were just not used to tv right so
*  they're just sticking to a script and when he goes off script he was more comfortable yeah and
*  he saw how it was like a fucking boxing match they were just like what the fuck's he doing
*  also he's like a comic like when who was it that asked him the question um
*  who was it megan kelly was it megan kelly that asked him the question yeah it was um at the
*  debates you said horrible things about women you've called them fat you called them pigs those only
*  rosie o'donnell the punchline got a big pop it crushes yeah it crushes and you see her just like
*  oh my god like what did i set him up i lobbed one his way he just knocked it into the park all over
*  the fucking over the plate he just crushed it that's his his thing is so different women you don't
*  like fat pigs she thought she thought she had them here and disgusting animals your twitter account
*  only rosie o'donnell
*  no it wasn't he's smiling he was proud of that one they're all clapping and cheering
*  your twitter account come on you gotta hold well what do you what do you expect her to do here
*  thank you for the record hold the laugh well beyond rosie yes i'm sure it was
*  your turn i mean jesus christ yes i'm sure it was is amazing well the guy's a character in a movie
*  yeah you know it doesn't seem real i i hope it's not a steven king movie but you know remember the
*  steven king movie about the guy like he shakes hands with the guy that's dead zone yeah yeah
*  yeah martin martin she wasn't that yeah that's a great movie it's a great movie chris walken
*  yes great yeah that ending that fucking oof oof yeah yeah yeah made some good fucking shit oh my
*  god get him back on coke get him back on coke give him budweiser and a wide range of shit it's like
*  you told me you just got to that shaw shank in misery stand by me stand by me is great great i
*  just watched the other day with my family it was amazing that last line fucked me it always
*  fucks me up when he's like none of us had friends like when we were 12 i'm like fuck you richard
*  yeah this is the thing he holds his hand and he realizes yeah they did a great s&l parody of this
*  yeah he's gonna be this guy's gonna be hitler he's gonna be the one who kills us all yeah
*  pressing the button yeah that's a that's a good movie man that was scary as fuck well that's what
*  they're always trying to scare us about with trump that he's gonna do that and start world war three
*  and kill us all but the problem is this administration looks like they're on the
*  verge of starting us into world war three and when trump was in office that didn't happen and here's
*  the thing that they need to address everybody keeps saying he's going to be a dictator he's
*  gonna do that that would be more sellable if we didn't have four years of him actually being the
*  president and doing none of those things right i mean the thing is you hindsight's everything
*  right like you look back like people said the same thing about like everyone hated eisenhower but then
*  you look back and you're like these weren't bad times you know yeah so with trump with any look
*  we all want to avoid world war three that's i think i would hope at all costs part of me is like maybe
*  trump is such a fucking narcissist that he doesn't want the world to end yeah because he wants to do
*  well while he's in charge yeah yeah that's good maybe i don't know whatever motivation whatever
*  fucking takes you to keep us from killing each other he does terrify me i don't fucking feel like
*  safe with him as a president do you feel safe with biden as a president though of course not
*  the country's in shambles things are fucking bad i don't feel safe with anybody as president but i
*  just i don't buy their narrative when you find out that like they lied about rushegate for fucking
*  six years and like all that was that was the beginning of the end that was like when you're
*  when you're when that's your whole thing like the steel dossier is your whole thing yeah that was
*  really the undoing of a lot of cable news i think they thought they could get away with it because
*  they have gotten away with it before which makes you think how many of the stories other than the
*  ones we know about like the weapons of mass destruction and all the how many of the stories
*  were bullshit yeah how many of the stories that ruined the lives of countless millions of people
*  how many of those stories were bullshit you can't go all in on a bad hand and they did it again and
*  again and again and you gotta make sure you have a fucking royal flush well dude they did it with me
*  with the covet thing with the half emmectan thing they did with a lot of things they did but but the
*  covet one was crazy because they were all coordinated calling it horse dewormer right every
*  news organization was calling it horse dewormer and trying to mock me like hey guys i can talk too
*  like are you fucking stupid yeah like they but their whole game up until social media and up
*  until podcasts was they were the only ones talking so they could set a narrative and no one could do
*  anything about it they could decide that you're this or you're that and then they pushed that out
*  there and that was the end of it then you got labeled as this or that but with podcasts podcasts
*  got bigger than them and they hadn't realized it yet by a lot i mean that's the thing is you know
*  i saw your thing with sanjay gupta and and he seemed apologetic you know but sorta sorta till
*  he left really he left and went and talked to don lemon and don lemon was still saying the same
*  but it is used for horses it is a dewormer for he's my neighbor i see him telling the truth i saw i
*  saw him drunk on the street the other day friendliest guy i mean he goes i just saw mark
*  at the beacon and i was like man you know he was talking to you yeah he said what's up to me on the
*  street yeah and he goes i just saw mark norman at the beacon it was a great show i was like well
*  i'm sure he's probably okay yeah you know he just seemed like a nice guy he was stuck in a bad
*  situation a bad position that corrupts everyone it's bad for everybody everyone on that network
*  was terrible we need they were all propagandists it's weird to think about how fortunate the
*  generations were when like news wasn't constant you got a break right collin quinn's got a great bit
*  now like you go to the bathroom and you're like what did i miss right right i mean but that's
*  fucking bad for the world like yeah i i i miss you know even back in the day like it was on twice a
*  day you know right it was over you got like simpsons reruns and you're like all right shit's
*  peaceful if you really wanted to go crazy you'd read the new york times and you get all the news
*  yeah if you really want but who did that very few people did that yeah but most people that you
*  know weren't terrified of everything weren't reading everything that's going on in fucking
*  sudan and what's going on in asia what's going on here and there and now it's like we're being
*  inundated by all of the bad news because the bad news is the stuff that really gets people
*  captivated so it's all the bad news of the entire world and none of the good news it's like the most
*  distorted version of reality ever i know and then you go out and you talk to people and you're like
*  are we that divided like i i think that's kind of what i feel like just touring the country i feel
*  the interactions i have with people are good and solid but we also have to remember those are comedy
*  fans which are the people that are going to be the most reasonable the people that's looking
*  looking for the humor in things you know not saying there's a trans genocide they're not going to come
*  to your show the trans genocide people are not going to come to your show so it's the people that
*  are they're you know they're kind of realizing like we need humor humor it's an important part
*  of civilization but i don't even mean just comedy like you interact with people like restaurants or
*  or like whoever you see on the street like i you know yeah for the most part i've had like two
*  fights on the road like arguments and like it's fucking quick it's usually like you know over
*  bullshit it's not even we Gary Vito and i are like very uh we're both new yorkers so it's like we
*  can't help but do a confrontation there was a woman being berated at my fucking we were at the
*  gate a morning flight out of columbus and a woman was just yelling at a fucking tsa agent who was
*  just doing her job she had nothing wrong she was just but it was a woman with two kids with her and
*  she goes you're an idiot wow you're so dumb and we're just looking at each other like it's 8 a.m
*  we're barely awake but it's pretty like fucked up right and we're like yeah it's like really mean
*  and she just kept going you're so dumb i hope i'm gonna get you fired and then finally we're just
*  like hey i just go lady enough and gary goes you're a nobody like that's how he's like a new york kid
*  wow and she turns away she goes fuck you you're short to gary and he goes you should see me without
*  my shirt on i was like we had her what are you doing why do you say you see me because he works
*  out oh that's hilarious but i'm like dude we were fucking with comics we could kill this woman what
*  the fuck are you doing should have taken the shirt off should have got down his underwear but but
*  probably would have arrested him for terrorism but that was like the one but we felt fucking we were laughing
*  and the woman was like thank you but i'm like well i'm like ted when do we ever fight with people on
*  the like it's occasionally we do that shit but like most people are so cool that you meet most people
*  are like good people and then like how often do i miss like small towns like like you'll go to like
*  appleton and like they don't talk politics they're like living in like 1994 and they like it's like
*  rude to talk politics yeah you know and you're like we keep that to yourself and i'm like man i almost
*  missed that point in time when it was like you just led with other shit that wasn't your whole like
*  sure we make fun of people sometimes who are like these are my pronouns but isn't it equally kind
*  of annoying with people who lead with their political affiliation just as bad i would say worse
*  or their diet or their exercise routine or yoga or anything like some people they're just always
*  trying to find themselves to you yeah they always want to define themselves in a very
*  a nice way so you're just one thing yeah that's all you are so i look like i do kind of miss
*  those types of people who are like hey let's bond over something else other than the world ending
*  yeah but you know when people don't have any legitimate conflict in our life they manufacture
*  conflict and they have to trauma bond with you god yeah i have ptsd from last four years when
*  trump was in office i can't do this again you have that's all i got ten williams kill people by the
*  way i know exactly not to mention like they're like i'm moving to canada and i'm like you think
*  canada you think canada just wants all of our fucking whiners yeah listen not only that but
*  canada has like ridiculous free speech laws they have hate speech laws they can come down on you
*  for a lot of things they seized up the bank accounts of people that were protesting the
*  truckers oh that was that was a fun time the people that were donating to the truckers they
*  seized their bank accounts like yeah that's not a good place it's not a good place under this
*  administration at least yeah where do you go they went sideways canada was an amazing place 10 years
*  ago you go to canada 10 years ago it was awesome i was always saying that i love canada it's like
*  20 less douchebags what do you what do you like in canada i love montreal montreal's amazing
*  i love toronto i love vancouver i love canada vancouver is one of the most beautiful i don't
*  go to canada anymore but ever no you want to do a gig there not when that guy's president
*  fuck you yeah but whatever he is prime minister fans use they want to see you fuck you get rid
*  of that guy i'll come back i just don't trust any of it up there yeah i just think that they're
*  they're so far into tyranny right now like the laws that they're passing the shit that they're
*  doing their the erosion of people's rights like i don't want to support it i think it's fucking
*  horrible yeah but i think a lot of people there just want to laugh i think people need to laugh
*  oh yeah they definitely need a laugh they're in the middle of a full-blown communist takeover
*  yeah it's a scary spot yeah it's scary but it used to be amazing i used to say that canada's
*  20 less douchebags like the people are 20 nicer than most people that you meet in america they're
*  yeah they're polite that's that's why they get roped into all this shit that's why they get
*  roped into hate speech laws because they want to be kind they want to be good people and they
*  don't realize like compelled speech has a terrible ending it always ends in communism because
*  someone has to compel that speech who does the people with guns and they tell you what to do
*  yeah you have violence that is enforced to get people to follow a doctrine that they may or
*  may not believe in yeah i think you just gotta you just gotta be pro-free speech i mean for all the
*  awful shit people can say you still just have to be pro-free speech that's elon's take on it you
*  know and that's what what they're doing with twitter well the weird thing about twitter now is
*  like for all the shit people will say about elon i think like look at the other social media
*  platforms everything gets anything there's like trigger words they'll be like you said the word
*  nazi i'm like yeah i condemn them in a joke and they're like well it got buried because you said
*  and you're like cool well that feels like some nazi shit yeah i can't i can't use irony i can't
*  be sarcastic that's the that's the evil of like i think when they bury you you are it's it's a
*  different type of censorship but you are you know you are burying certain trigger words that
*  you think might be offensive and hurt ad sales oh cool now posting a joke on instagram is similar
*  to putting together a set for the tonight show it's all fucking uh you know this word's not okay
*  yeah this word's not okay twitter's actually the only place left if you think about it which is
*  really fucking weird you know it's really weird because twitter used to be the worst place for
*  that yeah twitter was the place where the fbi literally like the whole twitter files when elon
*  took over and they had matt tiebie and michael schellenberger and all these guys like the rolling
*  stone guy yeah when they went into it and they're like oh my god the government was literally trying
*  to stop legitimate professors at stanford and people at harvard and mit from talking about their
*  area of expertise they were trying to label them as kooks and get them kicked off of twitter the
*  whole thing was fucking bananas and if we didn't if he didn't buy people used to get their accounts
*  suspended a lot on twitter remember that like that was a big thing but now it's like now it's
*  more like instagram tiktok's ridiculous obviously i mean there's that one is like good luck who the
*  fuck knows but even youtube has kind of changed a little bit i mean youtube is everyone's changing
*  is my thing but youtube is like it's kind of shocking like my issue is like they keep moving
*  the goal post in but there's no guidebook they're not telling any of us what's not okay they're just
*  kind of making up the rules as they go along and they ban people's accounts they don't even tell
*  them why it's kind of your account has violated our terms of service and then that's it and then
*  you have no recourse and you're spending a lot of time and money building up these platforms and
*  they're like sorry yeah well it's pretty fucked up because especially now during the election
*  excuse me during the election time now they're really clamping down on that
*  and there's a lot of people getting shadow banned allegedly and then there was a thing that elon
*  just released where he said that european governments were they were saying that they
*  would be willing to give them money to have certain platforms censor certain political speech
*  and elon was the only one who said no and he talked about it publicly he said these other
*  these other groups these other social media platforms complied and like i'm telling you
*  about this yeah you need to know it's it's pretty weird because they just keep moving the goal post
*  yeah i mean it's gonna keep it's bad i see comics now kind of working toward the algorithm and it
*  is bad for entertainment and for art and stuff like that and i i get annoyed when comics are
*  just like shocking for the sake of being shocking and lazy but i don't think they should be fucking
*  silenced yeah they shouldn't be silenced but you're always gonna have people that try things that
*  don't work out right especially in an open-ended art form like comedy where you're the writer
*  you're the producer you're the editor and you're delivering it so you're everything you're the whole
*  thing and you're fucking around and you're trying to come up with ways and maybe you're desperate
*  so you try to figure out a way to juke the the system and try to figure out a way to get your
*  stuff seen and heard and you say things you might not even mean but you think it's going to be good
*  it'll work it's a little tool for you and you're trying and those guys you know they're not our
*  favorite the guys that do like stupid shit like that but that's also like they should exist yeah
*  they exist but maybe they can get better one day like a lot of us sucked in the beginning and better
*  now and over time learn you keep working at it and it's an open-ended thing you eventually figure
*  it out or not about last night there's guys that it takes them a minute yeah and it should take you
*  a minute this is like i think a lot of the comics like don't hit their strides or they hit like 40
*  right yeah because you actually develop a nuanced take on life you've had a bunch of bad relationships
*  you had a bunch of bad business deals you've been fucked over by that is good for comedy yes your
*  life anytime when bad happens to me i'm like fuck it's a bit here we go isn't it crazy that like
*  it's such a beautiful thing that something horrible can go wrong i remember the first time i did your
*  show i missed like i took me three flights to get through a gig that i missed and i'm like that's
*  like my opener in my new special you know it's like it's like this long story this hell travel
*  day and i'm like this sucks but uh you get you we're very fortunate to have this outlet for that
*  you know yeah and i think just me if i didn't do it if i never did comedy again or if i never had
*  done it i still would love it it's one of my favorite things to watch because it takes you away
*  it puts you in this place and it's like a drug like it makes you feel better you know when someone's
*  on stage killing and you're laughing you're like you feel better it's an amazing feeling to laugh
*  at something and to be able to do that for a living we're the luckiest people alive dude i was just
*  on bert's fully loaded thing it's so fun dude it was such a good group of people and he like
*  turned into an adult summer camp he's bringing like ice plunges he brought a personal trainer
*  we're doing batting practice during the day one day chad daniels and i were fucking hooping dudes
*  i'm like this is fucking fun you know we're surf you know me bert kyle canane are surfing we're
*  hung over i'm like we're gonna puke on a fucking in the in the water but uh i remember one night
*  i'm just like watching david tell on stage i was like oh this is like the best like you just get
*  to like he he's like one that one dude that like brings me back to like forget like oh yeah you
*  it's so pure funny it's like yeah it's not like anything no agenda it's just pure jokes and you're
*  like oh yeah he had that joke about like fucking but me i'm a biden man hunter biden and like
*  that's like a fucking great bait and switch you know like or the joke about like i got hit by a
*  guy on a city bike the other day was my fault i was on the sidewalk and uh they're just like pure
*  silly jokes and you just like transported to like being a kid like i remember seeing him as a kid
*  at caroline's and being like oh this is what it's all about like yeah he's just trying to be silly
*  he's just and he's the best at it and he's another guy that just doesn't he's not a promoter right so
*  he's not as popular as he really should be based on how good he is and it's kind of up to us to
*  let everybody know you know i always feel like obligated to let everybody know like i when he
*  was at the club and i went and i came and watched one of his sets i sat for the whole set which i
*  don't ordinarily do i came in on a night where i wasn't working just to watch it was fucking awesome
*  and after it i just like couldn't wait to do stand-up again i was like i can't wait to go on
*  stage like it's like he's so quick there was one time you know to go through the audience the
*  bathroom at the comedy cellar and three dudes came out at the same time all wearing glasses and he
*  goes what is that a nerd portal to come up with that line off the cuff i'm like god he's fucking
*  good at this yeah he's always fast off the cuff like he does that thing at the end where he brings
*  comics on stage terrifying terrifying because he also because he's obi-wan he's the jedi and on top
*  of that he's loose because he's been killing for 45 minutes yeah and then he brings you on stage
*  you know so it's kind of unfair like you're cold you're in the bag like hey dave grab a mic okay
*  hey hey and they shit's on you if you don't say anything funny and it's yeah yeah he's awesome
*  he's so good yeah he fuck he'll fuck with you it's he's great i love that though that like when you're
*  like few comics were like usually i'm watching it and i'm being like good joke that was i like
*  that that was cool but he's like one of the only dudes that i'm like holy shit i'm just like giggling
*  this is so stupid i feel like a kid it's also all he cares about and all he does he gets up in the
*  morning he reads the paper he smokes cigarettes he writes jokes and he goes and when he goes to a
*  town he always has new jokes about the town and you know i learned that from him he had like the
*  local paper i was like local what are you doing yeah and then we'd like leave a diner at like
*  4 a.m and he'd order a large iced coffee to go i'd be like what are you doing you're out of your
*  fucking mind but uh you know yeah he's just like he's as pure comic it's like we're so lucky to
*  have him in in in new york because he just like and he's so good to the young comics i see the new
*  here there's he'll be like he called me and he was like oh i like following this new guy because
*  he's like he's got good stuff and he's bringing the heat so he's like you know he likes it he's
*  aware of it yeah no he's a he's a national treasure like legitimately and i tell everybody
*  if you get a chance like go to his website if he even has one he has one he doesn't run it i
*  remember we're doing a road gig once and he like as we're driving i was like how do you post this
*  picture he's like oh i don't do that shit like he has someone doing everything you know and it's
*  always like hilarious because it's like he just writes the caption and sends a bunch so it'll be
*  him be like amazing weekend in like you know hartford and he'll just be like this like angry
*  in the photo it like never matches because he sends it to another person but uh you know he's
*  still has a flip phone yeah he has two he is i think he has an iphone that he uses but he only
*  uses the flip phone most of the time when he text you it's like it makes the same he was sitting
*  here texting someone it was like i go what are you doing he sent in morris code and he's i was
*  realizing he was texting i'm like oh my god you still text like that yeah he's old school well
*  he went iphone for a while and then he realized like this i'm too in my head with this he doesn't
