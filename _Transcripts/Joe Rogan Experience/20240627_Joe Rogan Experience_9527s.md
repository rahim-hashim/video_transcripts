# Joe Rogan Experience #1955 - Cliff Gray
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6.0s)]
*  Hello. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=10.0s)]
*  What's up, man? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=11.0s)]
*  Nice to meet you in person. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=14.0s)]
*  You too. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=16.0s)]
*  We've been chatting back and forth online for quite a while now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=17.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=20.0s)]
*  You know, it's funny, I was looking at it, I think it's been like five or six years since [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=21.0s)]
*  our first interaction. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=25.0s)]
*  How did you get involved being a hunting guide? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=28.0s)]
*  What was your, what's your path to that? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=31.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=33.0s)]
*  So it's a, I guess it's a long story. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=34.0s)]
*  You know, I grew up in a rural area. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=36.0s)]
*  My dad, my dad was a cattle rancher and then he did a little outfitting when I was a kid. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=39.0s)]
*  And then it, well, it's kind of a long story, man, because I thought this was normal when [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=44.0s)]
*  I was a kid. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=49.0s)]
*  But when I was, when my dad was an adult, he was a cattle rancher and then he went back [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=50.0s)]
*  to vet school. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=55.0s)]
*  And so he actually left outfitting and cattle ranching and pursued that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=56.0s)]
*  And that was when he was like in his forties, you know? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=60.0s)]
*  And so that was my first exposure to, you know, being an outfitter or guiding was through [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=63.0s)]
*  my father. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=68.0s)]
*  And then honestly, man, like growing up, I hunted all the time. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=69.0s)]
*  I've been, I've been obsessed with, you know, hunting since I was 10, 12 years old. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=73.0s)]
*  And then I went and kind of did a more traditional, I guess, lifestyle. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=78.0s)]
*  I went to school, went to undergrad, went to business school, and then I worked in finance [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=84.0s)]
*  for a few years. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=90.0s)]
*  And we can get deep into like why that didn't last. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=91.0s)]
*  You know, I, I got, maybe you can help us explain why the banks are failing right now. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=96.0s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=101.0s)]
*  It's been so long since I've, I've been in that world. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=102.0s)]
*  What a, what a different contrast though, the contrast between that world and the world [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=106.0s)]
*  that you live in now. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=110.0s)]
*  Dude, it's crazy. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=111.0s)]
*  It's crazy to think about because I still know people that, you know, are finance guys. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=112.0s)]
*  My brother's a finance guy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=116.0s)]
*  Does he live in hell? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=117.0s)]
*  Well, he can't be happy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=118.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he's, he's doing all right because he doesn't, you know, he doesn't, all the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=120.0s)]
*  the investment strategies that he's do for the most part, like hedge type of strategies, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=126.0s)]
*  but, but he's doing okay. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=130.0s)]
*  But yeah, it's a different, it's a different world, man. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=132.0s)]
*  It's definitely a different world. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=135.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=137.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=138.0s)]
*  And I always, I always look back on my path and I think like, well, did I choose, you [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=139.0s)]
*  know, did I choose the right thing? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=143.0s)]
*  I don't know, but I'm happy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=146.0s)]
*  So I guess, you know. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=147.0s)]
*  If you're, if you're happy, you chose the right thing, but no one, there's no right [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=149.0s)]
*  thing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=152.0s)]
*  There's just like life, life and decisions. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=153.0s)]
*  This idea that you're going to like, oh, I wish I could do it differently. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=155.0s)]
*  Well, you definitely can't. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=158.0s)]
*  So don't wish that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=160.0s)]
*  There's no way you can do it differently. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=161.0s)]
*  Unless you have a fucking time machine. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=164.0s)]
*  And even if you have a time machine, you will already have the knowledge of what happens [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=166.0s)]
*  if you do it wrong. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=170.0s)]
*  So if you go back and try to do it right, who knows how you're going to fuck that up? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=172.0s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=176.0s)]
*  Like it's not life. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=177.0s)]
*  That's, imagine living your life, knowing what's going to happen if you do it certain [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=178.0s)]
*  ways. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=182.0s)]
*  Like that would be a terrible way to live. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=183.0s)]
*  Like you'd be just, you would never be in the moment. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=184.0s)]
*  You would be constantly filled with this anxiety of making sure that you don't do the thing [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=187.0s)]
*  that you have already done so that you could live your life in a different way. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=192.0s)]
*  I mean, I can imagine if like, you know, you run a red light and crash into a car and you [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=196.0s)]
*  go, oh my God, how could I stop that from happening again? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=201.0s)]
*  I have to make sure I don't do that again. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=205.0s)]
*  Things like that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=207.0s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=208.0s)]
*  But like a whole life path, like change your whole life. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=209.0s)]
*  I wish I did it a different way. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=213.0s)]
*  Well, you definitely didn't. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=215.0s)]
*  So keep going. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=216.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=218.0s)]
*  Oh man, life's so like life's so path dependent. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=219.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=222.0s)]
*  And that you get, you know, you choose certain things and there's probably like a million [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=223.0s)]
*  different ways it could go. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=227.0s)]
*  And you know, that was like for me, there's a point in my life when I was doing finance, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=228.0s)]
*  I was, I was a trader when I was a young guy. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=232.0s)]
*  And you know, there's just kind of a moment where I'm like, man, do I, I just want to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=235.0s)]
*  do something else. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=240.0s)]
*  And then you start down that path and it just, it leads you in wild places, man. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=241.0s)]
*  Well, literally for you. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=246.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=247.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=248.0s)]
*  Look at me right here where I'm at right now. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=249.0s)]
*  Like you would never, I would have never imagined this in my wildest dreams. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=251.0s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=255.0s)]
*  But I meant wild places like the wild. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=256.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=258.0s)]
*  That too. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=259.0s)]
*  Both things. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=260.0s)]
*  Both things are kind of wild. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=261.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=262.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=263.0s)]
*  So how did you make this choice to like get off the path? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=264.0s)]
*  Because for a lot of people, I think one of the problems with the path is you get married, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=268.0s)]
*  You have kids, you have responsibilities, and then you're stuck because you really can't [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=274.44s)]
*  change careers because you have so many dependents. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=279.28s)]
*  There's so many people depending upon you. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=282.64s)]
*  You have so many responsibilities. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=284.8s)]
*  You have to kind of just suck it up and keep doing this thing that you don't enjoy for [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=286.6s)]
*  your family. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=290.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=291.44s)]
*  So to answer that question, I think I have to be a little humble about it, Joe, because [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=292.44s)]
*  I came from a family and including my wife. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=298.44s)]
*  When I met my wife, man, I was a guy that was well educated and looked like a guy that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=301.76s)]
*  was going to be on a traditional path to great success as a finance guy. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=309.76s)]
*  And that's when I met my wife. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=316.76s)]
*  And then I tricked her, man, because I switched it up on her. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=318.08s)]
*  But she stayed with me the whole time. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=322.32s)]
*  And so I got to give her that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=324.4s)]
*  But also my family too, man. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  You can imagine my parents wanted me to get a great education. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=328.3s)]
*  My family, man, basically lived the American dream. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=334.34000000000003s)]
*  None of them, they didn't grow up wealthy, nor did I, but they kept me comfortable. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=337.26s)]
*  And then they got great success. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=343.54s)]
*  And they got success through hard work. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=346.06s)]
*  And they wanted to see me have a path of go to Wall Street, go be an attorney, go do something [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=349.86s)]
*  like that, because that seemed like the easy path, I think, in their mind and seemed to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  make sense. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=360.36s)]
*  And they were giving me that opportunity. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=361.36s)]
*  But when I decided not to do that, man, not one time have my parents or my brothers for [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=363.6s)]
*  that part said, like, dude, you're being an idiot. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=370.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=373.12s)]
*  Like when I told them, like, hey, I'm going to buy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=374.12s)]
*  So essentially I bought an outfitting business that had been pretty much run into the dirt. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=376.62s)]
*  And it was just federal permitting where I could expand into a bigger guiding business [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=383.68s)]
*  in Colorado. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=388.52s)]
*  When I told them I was going to do that, like I was quitting my job at the time, I had transitioned [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=390.3s)]
*  working for a wealthy family who treated me awesome. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=396.8s)]
*  But when I said, hey, man, I'm going to go be an outfitter, my parents were like, I mean, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=401.08s)]
*  my dad was like, sounds awesome. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=408.08s)]
*  You know, my brother was like, sounds awesome. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=409.92s)]
*  And I don't think that everybody grows up in a family that's that supportive of it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=412.68s)]
*  So I don't want to say that, like, I did it all. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=416.72s)]
*  Like I'm just a guy that just said, hey, I'm going to do something cool and independent. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=421.44s)]
*  It was what I wanted to do. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=425.40000000000003s)]
*  And I had support, man. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=426.76s)]
*  So I can't, I can't. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=428.2s)]
*  That's very fortunate. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=430.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's very fortunate. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=431.12s)]
*  So what, how did you, so if you're in the middle of this world, this financial world, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=432.52s)]
*  how did you make that transition? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=437.44s)]
*  Like what were the steps involved in making the transition? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=439.68s)]
*  Did you just immediately up and quit and just figure out how to get a job as an outfitter [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=442.24s)]
*  or were you already doing some outfitting? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=446.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=448.64s)]
*  So, so I've been in, I mean, all through my childhood and, you know, and then even when [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=449.64s)]
*  I was an undergrad in school, I hunted all the time and I had done a bunch of guiding [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=455.8s)]
*  and I was exposed to. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=460.64s)]
*  And the other thing for my type of outfitting and guiding, I had been exposed to livestock [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=461.64s)]
*  and horses and mules my whole, my whole life. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=467.40000000000003s)]
*  And that's a big part of like wilderness outfitting is you got to be familiar with, you know, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=470.16s)]
*  how to pack mules, how to pack horses, how to ride horses, you know, up in the mountains [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=474.84s)]
*  because that's a huge proportion of what I, what I did just to get into remote areas. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=479.16s)]
*  So you know, not, not to dive like into the depth of my childhood, but I was exposed to [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=484.48s)]
*  that, you know, the first 20 years of my life where, you know, I had that skill set. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=489.52s)]
*  So that's, that's the first part of it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=494.78s)]
*  And then, you know, how I actually mechanically did it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=497.12s)]
*  I mean, so the, just to give you some context, me and my brother start when I was young at [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=501.72s)]
*  a business school, me and my brother started a financial company and it changed, changed [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=508.72s)]
*  in a bunch of different ways and he still operates it. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=513.36s)]
*  But when I was, I think I want to say like 22, 23, I started working for our biggest [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=515.84s)]
*  client and he was a phenomenal guy and I was doing more like family wealth management for [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=520.44s)]
*  him. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=525.72s)]
*  And literally, Joe, I was, I was just kind of struggling day to day with being, I always [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=526.84s)]
*  wanted to be in the outdoors and I wanted to go do something else. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=532.0s)]
*  And I literally just walked into his office and I was like, Bob, like, I love, I love [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=534.8000000000001s)]
*  you man, but I gotta, I gotta go. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=539.48s)]
*  Like I gotta go do something else. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=542.6s)]
*  And I kind of had a plan to get, to go back to Colorado. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=544.6s)]
*  I was born in the area, you know, where, where I did most of my outfit and guiding. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=547.52s)]
*  And it's funny because he looked at me and he kind of, he kind of laughed because I think [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=551.9200000000001s)]
*  he knew it was coming. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=556.28s)]
*  Like he knew, he, he, I mean, he came from a different world. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=557.28s)]
*  Like he'd grown in a grown, you know, grow up in, you know, doing business deals and [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=561.4s)]
*  all that. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=566.3199999999999s)]
*  And I grew up from somewhere else. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=567.3199999999999s)]
*  I think that's why he kind of enjoyed having me around because we would talk about, you [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=568.3199999999999s)]
*  know, our, you know, different backgrounds and stuff. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=571.64s)]
*  But he was just like, well, the first thing he said is like, Cliff, I'm just going to [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=574.3199999999999s)]
*  ask you one time, man, can I give you more money? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=578.12s)]
*  And I'm like, Bob, we shouldn't talk about it, man. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=580.28s)]
*  He's like, all right, dude, go for it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=582.92s)]
*  Well, that's great. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=584.68s)]
*  So literally like a week later, me, me and my wife, we moved to Colorado and I had a [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=586.12s)]
*  supportive wife. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=591.84s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=592.84s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=593.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=594.84s)]
*  I, uh, she's been epic the whole, the whole way. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=595.84s)]
*  So how did you go about starting and getting clients? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=599.2s)]
*  So if you're starting an outfitting business, you're a young guy, you're leaving the financial [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=602.4s)]
*  sector and you're going and starting and getting clients, how do you go about making that happen? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=606.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=612.0s)]
*  So part of the part of how that, how that process worked for me is when I got to Colorado, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=613.24s)]
*  I started doing some packing and guiding. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=619.52s)]
*  This is, I mean, this is after I worked in finance. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=623.08s)]
*  So I took like, you know, kind of a, most people would say a step back in my career, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=625.68s)]
*  you know? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=631.8s)]
*  So one day I was like looking at financial models and trading and that sort of thing. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=632.8s)]
*  And then three weeks later, I was like helping guys pack elk out of the wilderness on meals, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=637.8s)]
*  you know, that sort of thing. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=644.68s)]
*  So, so I started getting exposed to it that way again. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=645.68s)]
*  And then what, what I did was I started just looking for a business to buy. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=650.28s)]
*  And so you have to, there's, when you're operating in the wilderness areas, you've got to have [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=656.0799999999999s)]
*  federal permitting. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=660.62s)]
*  So I got all that figured out. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=661.62s)]
*  I bought a business and then it's just like hand to hand combat, man. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=662.62s)]
*  I mean, the first year that I was guiding and outfitting, I think I had, you know, maybe [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=666.66s)]
*  like a dozen clients or something like that. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=671.02s)]
*  The last year that I, that I outfitted, I had like north of 200 clients. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=673.4s)]
*  So it's just, it's just hand to hand comment. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=680.02s)]
*  And then, you know, as you learn an area and we can get into the nitty gritty details of [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=682.06s)]
*  it, but these wilderness areas, there's no roads in them, man. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=688.26s)]
*  So you're talking about hundreds of thousands of acres and you're talking about elk that [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=692.06s)]
*  are pretty heavily pressured. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=695.86s)]
*  I mean, it takes years just the grind of like learning the area. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=697.46s)]
*  And so over time, just like, just, you know, step by step, man. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=702.66s)]
*  And then I started to get good guides working for me over the years. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=707.62s)]
*  And we, you know, we all just got where we learned the area, you know, along the way. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=711.38s)]
*  And then, I mean, the reality is the last three or four years, it was never, it was [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=718.02s)]
*  never a problem booking people. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=723.1s)]
*  We were always booked, you know, that's how that world, that's how that world is in a [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=724.7s)]
*  lot of ways. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=729.58s)]
*  Like once you get established and you keep people happy and it's like sort of word of [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=730.58s)]
*  mouth. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=733.98s)]
*  Yeah, you stay booked. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=734.98s)]
*  Hey, I went with Cliff. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=735.98s)]
*  It was great. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=736.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=737.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=738.98s)]
*  He knows how to get there. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=739.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=740.98s)]
*  What you do is fascinating to me because it's such a, it's one of the more interesting kinds [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=741.98s)]
*  of hunting where you go really deep in with animals. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=745.9000000000001s)]
*  You know, you bring in mules or horses. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=751.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=753.1800000000001s)]
*  You go very, very deep in to find these animals. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=754.66s)]
*  And you know, I think most people on the outside that think about hunting, they don't really [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=758.06s)]
*  understand how grueling it is, how unbelievably difficult it is to get, you know, 15, 20 miles [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=765.8599999999999s)]
*  in. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=773.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=774.5s)]
*  And then if you do shoot an animal, to get that animal out is an unbelievable struggle. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=775.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=780.8599999999999s)]
*  And if you're talking about public land, it's really one of the best ways to find elk or [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=782.54s)]
*  to find really good elk. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=788.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=789.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=790.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=791.86s)]
*  No, I mean, you have to, in a lot of these areas, I mean, people think about Colorado, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=792.86s)]
*  Joe, and they think, so I hunted what technically would have been the large, they say the White [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=796.74s)]
*  River Elk herd is the largest elk herd in the world, right? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=802.66s)]
*  So you have that perception that, oh, okay, well, you go there, you go into the flat tops [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=808.1s)]
*  or you go into the surrounding forest, you know, forest service property, and you just [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=812.86s)]
*  put your backpack on, get off the road, and there's going to be elk everywhere. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=817.54s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's a ton of habitat. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=820.5s)]
*  And the thing about a lot of that country is all the habitat's good. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=823.98s)]
*  You know, you can go other places and they've got elk, but you know, only 10% of the actual [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=829.66s)]
*  habitat is going to hold elk, right? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=836.58s)]
*  Well, the flat tops are, you know, these big chunks of space in Colorado. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=838.98s)]
*  I mean, it's all good elk habitat. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=843.38s)]
*  You know, until you get massive amount of snow that limits the feed for elk, I mean, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=845.4200000000001s)]
*  elk could be everywhere. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=850.1800000000001s)]
*  So what I'm getting to is they get crazy dispersed. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=851.1800000000001s)]
*  And so the only way to get into a lot of these areas is either backpacking, you know, on [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=855.1s)]
*  your feet hiking, or you know, you've got to pack in with horses and mules. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=861.42s)]
*  Do you guys go in and set up a wall tent? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=866.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=869.18s)]
*  And then are you there for weeks or months at a time? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=870.18s)]
*  Like, how do you do it? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=872.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=873.74s)]
*  So if we're talking, so all the, if we're talking elk, the elk is a species, almost [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=874.74s)]
*  all of that was out of wall tent camps. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=880.62s)]
*  And we pack those in. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=884.38s)]
*  Now, I did a fair amount of sheep and goat guiding too. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=885.38s)]
*  Most of that we did out of backpacks, just because the out, like a lot of the habitat [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=889.22s)]
*  that mountain goats and sheep live in, it's not really conducive to packing with horses, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=894.26s)]
*  just because you end up getting above timberline. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=900.0600000000001s)]
*  There's just some logistical reason a lot of times it's just better to backpack on them. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=902.7s)]
*  But on elk, it's almost always, so you're packing your camp with horses and mules, and [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=907.98s)]
*  then you're coming back in. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=913.46s)]
*  Sometimes you'll hunt off foot. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=914.8199999999999s)]
*  You know, if the camps in a situation where you can cover ground on foot and hunt, then [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=916.62s)]
*  you'll do it that way. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=922.38s)]
*  But a lot of times you'll actually bring horses back in and hunt a horse back too. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=924.38s)]
*  And that's like a whole, people don't, I mean, you know, taking care of horses, you know, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=928.18s)]
*  if you've got 15 horses and mules in camp, like, you know, 12 miles back in the wilderness, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=932.8199999999999s)]
*  like it's, you know, it feels like going back in time, man. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=938.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=940.78s)]
*  That's why, that's why, I mean, honestly, Joe, by the time I sold, so I sold my main [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=941.78s)]
*  business like 18 months ago, by the time I sold it, the majority of my crew was Amish. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=947.74s)]
*  Really? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=953.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=954.26s)]
*  Amish? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=955.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=956.26s)]
*  How did you find these guys? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=957.26s)]
*  Do they just, so I- [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=958.26s)]
*  Because they don't use electricity, right? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=959.26s)]
*  So like- [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=960.54s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=961.54s)]
*  So we can- [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=962.54s)]
*  It's not like you can get them online. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=963.54s)]
*  Can you get them online? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=964.54s)]
*  Do they cheat? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=965.54s)]
*  So yeah, yeah. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=966.54s)]
*  Dude, I got some Amish buddies that I love, man, and I don't, so I don't, I don't want [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=968.3s)]
*  to like, like, Mark, if you're listening, man, and you probably shouldn't be listening [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=973.5s)]
*  because you're Amish, but- [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=978.18s)]
*  But no, so the answer to your question, man, is it just depends on, you know, what church [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=982.9399999999999s)]
*  they're from and the rules, you know, the rules that they have established, you know, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=987.3s)]
*  and what they're doing. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=992.14s)]
*  So if it's for business, a lot of them can use email, they can use a cell phone. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=993.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=997.26s)]
*  Oh, what a hack. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=998.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=999.26s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1000.26s)]
*  Then you're not Amish. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1001.26s)]
*  That's the whole thing. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1002.26s)]
*  You can't use fucking email. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1003.26s)]
*  Well, here's the deal. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1006.26s)]
*  So they, you know, I'm not an expert at them, but I became very good friends with some of [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1007.26s)]
*  them, you know, because I mean, I had some of them work for me for four or five years, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1013.42s)]
*  and man, there's some things about them that are absolutely amazing, you know what I mean? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1017.74s)]
*  Like- [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1023.74s)]
*  Hardworking people. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1024.74s)]
*  That's an understatement, man. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1025.74s)]
*  And the other thing that's wild about them is I had a lot of very young Amish guys come [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1026.74s)]
*  work for me, and we could get into the details of that. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1030.94s)]
*  Technically they hadn't like committed to the Amish church, so they weren't technically [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1035.06s)]
*  Amish yet. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1038.3s)]
*  Oh, was it the Rump Springer thing? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1039.3s)]
*  Yeah, they would be kind of in that process. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1040.9s)]
*  For people who don't know, they have like a time period of an indefinite time period [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1043.18s)]
*  where they're allowed to just run around and party and do drugs and sleep around, and then [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1047.26s)]
*  they have to come back to the church if they want to. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1053.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1056.1000000000001s)]
*  And when they came out to my place, they didn't do any of that stuff other than work, you [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1057.1000000000001s)]
*  know, but- [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1060.98s)]
*  Wink. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1061.98s)]
*  But anyways, they would come out, and what I noticed, man, is if you take an 18-year-old [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1062.98s)]
*  Amish guy and you're just doing stuff around like ranch, because we were outfitting and [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1069.94s)]
*  guiding them a lot of the time, but we also had to manage the livestock and we had kind [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1075.5s)]
*  of a ranch that we had to take care of. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1078.94s)]
*  Those guys at 18, they know a ton, because they've already been working for seven years. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1081.06s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1086.98s)]
*  They know how to frame a door. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1087.98s)]
*  They could show up to my place, Joe, and they're wearing sandals and shorts, and you're thinking [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1091.46s)]
*  like this guy's never been around livestock, and you're like, hey man, go grab that mule [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1098.6599999999999s)]
*  and saddle it. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1103.1399999999999s)]
*  Every single one of them knew how to do it, because they grow up catching horses and putting [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1104.3799999999999s)]
*  them on a buggy every day. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1110.22s)]
*  So it's pretty, it's just wild that they learn all these skill sets that really early on. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1112.94s)]
*  So in some ways, like I don't, you know, from an education standpoint, none of them had [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1119.3400000000001s)]
*  a hard time communicating with me, or we always could get through all that. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1125.14s)]
*  Maybe they didn't have as good a spelling, or they didn't have as good algebra skills [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1130.54s)]
*  or something, because they missed out on some of that education, maybe. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1134.78s)]
*  But I can tell you from a work ethic and like a hands-on skill set, they're amazing, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1137.78s)]
*  man. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1142.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's an education too. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1143.86s)]
*  It's interesting, because we only want to think about education in terms of things you [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1144.86s)]
*  can use in the corporate world or that you can use in the business world, but the reality [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1148.86s)]
*  of education is you're learning things, and they learn so many things, I'm sure, that [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1154.02s)]
*  the average person who works in an office is never going to understand. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1159.94s)]
*  Like an average guy who works over at Google and say, hey man, go put a saddle on that [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1164.22s)]
*  mule. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1169.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1170.5800000000002s)]
*  And they're like, what the fuck are you talking about, right? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1171.5800000000002s)]
*  That's a learned skill, and it's a learned skill that has a diminished value in our world, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1173.74s)]
*  but in your world, in the world of outfitters, it's a very high value. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1179.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1182.66s)]
*  Yeah, and the thing about their education too, it's like the homeschooling, I'm sure [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1183.66s)]
*  it varies wildly. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1187.46s)]
*  Yeah, and that's why I don't mean to make a judgment on them. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1188.46s)]
*  Sure, some of them are really good at homeschooling their kids, and some of them, it's just like [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1191.98s)]
*  regular homeschooling. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1195.8999999999999s)]
*  I've met some homeschooled kids that are phenomenal. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1198.02s)]
*  They're really interesting kids, but the parents did a great job of giving them a very nuanced [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1200.1399999999999s)]
*  education and then also committing them to activities, so they interacted with a lot [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1204.8999999999999s)]
*  of kids on a regular basis. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1209.5s)]
*  They just didn't go to school during the day with kids, and it's like if you have that [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1211.3s)]
*  kind of time and that kind of commitment and maybe you're just not very happy with a regular [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1214.8999999999999s)]
*  school system, it's not... [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1220.26s)]
*  People used to think that it was a bad idea to homeschool your kids, but during COVID, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1223.06s)]
*  I think a lot of people kind of opened their eyes, first of all, A, how difficult it is, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1227.02s)]
*  but also that there's a value to being there while your children are learning things, so [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1231.22s)]
*  you can kind of communicate with them and go through, especially if you have an expertise [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1236.58s)]
*  in something. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1240.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1241.34s)]
*  Like if, like I used to, my youngest daughters used to do martial arts and it was kind of [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1242.34s)]
*  a mixed martial arts class, and I would go with them to mixed martial arts class and [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1248.62s)]
*  sit on the sideline, and then a couple of times some stuff came up, and I said to the [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1254.54s)]
*  instructor, I said, actually, you shouldn't really do it that way. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1260.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1263.46s)]
*  Because they weren't, as a black belt in jujitsu, I'm like, you're actually going to get your [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1264.46s)]
*  back taken if you teach people this path. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1268.78s)]
*  This is a very vulnerable path. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1272.3s)]
*  Let me show you the difference. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1273.62s)]
*  So I'd go on the mat with them and show them the difference. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1275.18s)]
*  And then the next thing I know, I'm doing it with my daughter and I'm having her do [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1276.9s)]
*  it and working with little kids. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1279.46s)]
*  It's really exciting. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1281.02s)]
*  It's fun to be able to teach your kids something. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1282.02s)]
*  They love that you know something that they can learn, and it gives them pride. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1284.22s)]
*  So these people that are learning from their families and from their community, it's a [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1289.5800000000002s)]
*  completely different way of life, but it's probably a more healthy way of life than the [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1297.3400000000001s)]
*  experience is just going to a regular, mundane, sort of, you know, very regimented traditional [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1304.38s)]
*  school system. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1313.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1314.22s)]
*  No, I think that's for sure the case. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1315.22s)]
*  But the electricity thing is ridiculous. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1317.74s)]
*  Well, you know, it's funny. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1320.74s)]
*  I'll tell you about a conversation I had with one guy that I consider a pretty good friend. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1323.98s)]
*  And I'll be honest with you, the Amish, from what my observations, they don't make a real [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1329.38s)]
*  strong effort to have like close relationships with people outside of the community. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1335.66s)]
*  At least I always felt that way. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1340.5800000000002s)]
*  But one individual I would say is a very good friend of mine. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1342.38s)]
*  And I asked him like, well, dude, like what it seems like so it seems like like where [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1345.3400000000001s)]
*  do you where do you stop the technology? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1350.14s)]
*  Where do you start? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1352.22s)]
*  And he actually had a rational rational explanation. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1353.22s)]
*  He said, look, man, like we make these judgments. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1356.34s)]
*  And I think a big part of it is we're just trying to judge like we know the value of [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1359.62s)]
*  having a certain pace of life. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1365.3s)]
*  And these technology judgments are based on that. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1367.94s)]
*  We want to be able to still, you know, succeed, feed our families because they still got to [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1370.7s)]
*  deal with like the realities of, you know, they got to buy land to have their farms, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1375.1399999999999s)]
*  all that stuff. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1379.54s)]
*  But he's like, look, it's all about pace of life for us. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1380.54s)]
*  So if we look at a technology and it's going to change that dynamic, then, you know, certain [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1383.76s)]
*  churches may choose not to do that. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1388.64s)]
*  So I'm with you, man. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1390.48s)]
*  Like there's there's odd things that they do. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1392.0s)]
*  But I kind of get that explanation, too. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1394.56s)]
*  I kind of get it. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1396.4s)]
*  But it's just weird that they have that electricity, like electricity loophole. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1397.4s)]
*  Yeah, loophole. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1400.68s)]
*  What does it say? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1401.68s)]
*  Word processor, a new word processor with more memory and more speed may specifically [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1403.48s)]
*  for the plane people by the plane people. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1408.92s)]
*  Is that what they used to call themselves? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1412.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1413.72s)]
*  This is what it comes up in a few advertisements for this. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1414.72s)]
*  It's called the classic series. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1417.28s)]
*  But is it the advertising is for Amish because it's calling the plane people. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1419.6000000000001s)]
*  It means being sold in rural Pennsylvania. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1423.52s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1426.04s)]
*  Look for Jake or Jonas. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1428.1200000000001s)]
*  Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1429.1200000000001s)]

*  I mean, like what is powering that fucking thing? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1444.68s)]

*  Oh, wow. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1471.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1472.8s)]
*  They have a lot of this kind of stuff where they kind of work around, like kind of work [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1473.8s)]
*  around the limitations that they're. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1476.4399999999998s)]

*  oh Christ. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1491.6s)]
*  I found this and said that their cell phone usage, though, is kind of common. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1492.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1496.6s)]
*  That's a fucking cheating move. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1497.6s)]
*  I think that's. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1499.88s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1500.88s)]
*  For business in particular, man, I think that's pretty much like standard now. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1501.88s)]
*  Well, I guess they'd have to have a phone line. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1506.1200000000001s)]
*  If you're going to have a phone line, why wouldn't you have a Internet line? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1508.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1511.1200000000001s)]
*  Or a cell phone line, rather. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1512.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, my parents used to work in, used to live in Harrisburg. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1513.48s)]
*  So I used to see those folks. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1517.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1519.16s)]
*  When you drive to them. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1520.16s)]
*  You also drive through the fucking, the areas where they raise cattle. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1521.16s)]
*  It was the worst smell. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1526.0400000000002s)]
*  Oh, where the Amish were? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1528.64s)]
*  It only was Amish. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1530.4s)]
*  No, they didn't have anything to do with Amish. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1531.72s)]
*  That was just cattle raising. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1534.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1535.4s)]
*  I think that was like, I don't know whether it was factory farming, what kind of farming. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1536.4s)]
*  It might have been like the I know they they feed a lot of silage, you know, like, like, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1541.1200000000001s)]
*  you know, processed feed feed that's been basically fermenting. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1547.2800000000002s)]
*  And that's what that smell is a lot of time. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1550.8400000000001s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1552.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1553.64s)]
*  That makes sense, because it wouldn't be the cow itself. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1554.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1555.8400000000001s)]
*  You know what silage smells like? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1557.0s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1559.4399999999998s)]
*  So a lot of times when you're driving, you'll see like you'll see like tarps, like they'll [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1560.4399999999998s)]
*  be cattle that you see by dairies a lot of time. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1565.6799999999998s)]
*  There'll be cattle there. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1567.9599999999998s)]
*  And then you'll see like these these tarps laying out. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1568.9599999999998s)]
*  And what that is, is they've got hay underneath it and they ferment it and it's silage and [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1571.8s)]
*  then they feed it to the cattle. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1577.12s)]
*  And is the fermenting on purpose to get more probiotics? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1578.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1582.9599999999998s)]
*  I'm not an expert on it on it, Joe. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1584.84s)]
*  But I think part of it is it just makes it more palatable so they can, I think, just [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1587.6399999999999s)]
*  consume enough calories. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1592.68s)]
*  And then I'm sure there's some nutritional aspect to it, too. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1595.12s)]
*  I just don't know the details of that. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1598.44s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1599.8799999999999s)]
*  That's why it would stink so bad, because I thought it was just death. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1600.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1604.44s)]
*  In the time when I was driving to see my folks, I think it was the 90s. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1605.44s)]
*  Pretty sure it was the 90s. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1611.24s)]
*  So like I wasn't that hip to that stuff anyway. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1612.68s)]
*  I just thought it was just a stinky dead area. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1615.2s)]
*  Sure. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1617.96s)]
*  Where they raised cows. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1618.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1619.96s)]
*  No, I hear you. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1620.96s)]
*  But Christ, it stunk. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1621.96s)]
*  I couldn't imagine living there. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1622.96s)]
*  Because the problem with all factory senses is you only detect changes in smells. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1624.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1629.0800000000002s)]
*  So you just get accustomed to your neighborhood stinking. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1630.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1632.4s)]
*  Which is really weird. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1633.4s)]
*  It's hilarious you say that because you get you like I got so used to the smell of horse [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1634.8s)]
*  shit over when I was outfitting. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1639.2s)]
*  Like you get so used to it, you don't even know it's around, man. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1641.66s)]
*  But if you're in a wall tent camp and you're hunting elk for like seven or eight days and [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1644.5s)]
*  it's like half snow or it's half snow and then it melts. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1649.5400000000002s)]
*  So it's like muddy. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1653.42s)]
*  You got all these horses tied up. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1654.42s)]
*  I mean horse shit's everywhere, man. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1656.0600000000002s)]
*  It's in every lead rope. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1657.7s)]
*  It's in everything. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1659.42s)]
*  And you don't realize you're out there feeding the horses in the dark and then you go into [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1660.42s)]
*  the cook tent and you start eating and you got horse shit on your hands. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1665.74s)]
*  You get used to the smell. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1671.82s)]
*  Well, horse shit's not a scary shit. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1673.22s)]
*  That's not really, yeah. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1675.7s)]
*  It's like it's processed hay. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1676.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1678.26s)]
*  It's just hay that's biologically, you know, it's sort of gone through the system of the [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1679.26s)]
*  horse. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1683.86s)]
*  It's not like dog shit. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1684.86s)]
*  Isn't that funny because all like predator shit is kind of like off-putting. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1685.86s)]
*  Gross. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1689.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1690.5s)]
*  Because it's rotten meat. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1691.5s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1692.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1693.5s)]
*  You see like lion shit or you know. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1694.5s)]
*  Like when you see deer shit, you pick deer shit up. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1695.5s)]
*  Yeah, no big deal. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1697.78s)]
*  It's like little balls. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1698.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1699.78s)]
*  Yeah, like my little boy, if he picks up an elk turd or whatever, it's like, oh, like [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1700.78s)]
*  why that's, you know, that's an elk turd. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1705.94s)]
*  But man, if he tried to pick up like a bear shit or something, I'd be like, ah. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1708.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1711.78s)]
*  We'd also worry about parasites. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1712.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1713.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1714.78s)]
*  I think that might be, I mean, don't you think that's maybe why we're so prone to not like [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1715.78s)]
*  be a little like off-putting, off-put by it more? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1719.62s)]
*  Perhaps, right? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1722.94s)]
*  The smell. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1724.26s)]
*  Because it's interesting how animals approach the smell. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1725.26s)]
*  I have a golden retriever and when he finds, I have a fox that lives in my neighborhood [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1728.5s)]
*  and he comes into my yard. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1733.3400000000001s)]
*  It's pretty cool. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1734.3400000000001s)]
*  I got a video of him barking in my yard. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1735.3400000000001s)]
*  He's such a weird animal. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1737.3400000000001s)]
*  They have such a weird noise. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1738.74s)]
*  And anyway, shits in my yard and my dog finds his shit and rolls in it every time. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1740.3000000000002s)]
*  Like for him, it's fucking perfume. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1746.3000000000002s)]
*  So he gets it like all over his neck and stuff. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1748.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1751.8600000000001s)]
*  Like obviously it's not off-putting for him. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1752.8600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1754.26s)]
*  I don't know what it is that dogs are doing if they're disguising their smell with the [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1756.1s)]
*  shit. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1761.9s)]
*  Like I don't know what they're doing. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1762.9s)]
*  They do the same thing with dead stuff. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1763.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1765.3799999999999s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1766.3799999999999s)]
*  I have no idea, man. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1767.3799999999999s)]
*  I don't know why that is. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1768.3799999999999s)]
*  It's weird because they all do it. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1770.06s)]
*  When they do it, you notice like they're like gleeful when they do it. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1771.5s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1774.42s)]
*  Like, wah, wah, wah. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1775.42s)]
*  Loving it. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1776.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1777.42s)]
*  Loving it. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1778.42s)]
*  He comes in with his shit smeared all over his neck. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1779.42s)]
*  I'm like, dude. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1780.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1781.42s)]
*  So obviously it's not off-putting for them, but humans don't roll around in it. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1782.42s)]
*  Not the average. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1785.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1786.9399999999998s)]
*  That's an enigma, man. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1787.9399999999998s)]
*  You'll have to get an expert on it in that regard. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1789.86s)]
*  I don't even know how they'd figure it out. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1792.5s)]
*  There's no exact known cause of this. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1795.26s)]
*  Wolves do it too. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1798.8999999999999s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1799.8999999999999s)]
*  I think wolves do it to disguise themselves from prey, but that's the best answer I found. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1800.8999999999999s)]
*  Well then it makes sense that dogs do it because dogs are just bitch ass wolves. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1806.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1809.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1810.8999999999999s)]
*  They're trying to get their scent covered or something. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1814.7s)]
*  Yeah, so if an animal's downwind, it's just like, oh, I smell shit. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1818.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1822.9s)]
*  It's not like, oh my god, I smell a wolf. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1823.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, sure. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1825.9s)]
*  It would overwhelm the smell. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1826.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1827.9s)]
*  Well, what do you think about their bringing wolves to Colorado? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1828.9s)]
*  Do you have an opinion on that? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1830.9s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1832.9s)]
*  I got lots of opinions about it. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1833.9s)]
*  I mean, so it's going to happen for sure. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1836.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1839.9s)]
*  Oh, man, we could dive deep into this one. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1841.9s)]
*  It's an interesting thing. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1845.9s)]
*  Yeah, so. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1847.9s)]
*  I feel like as a person who has spent some time in the woods, not nearly as much as you, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1848.9s)]
*  but I've spent enough time that I understand what the woods are. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1853.9s)]
*  I understand what the wild is. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1856.9s)]
*  And I don't think most people do. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1858.9s)]
*  I think people have a very goofy idea of what the wild is. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1860.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1865.9s)]
*  Like animals living in a way that they've lived for thousands of years. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1866.9s)]
*  And you just happen to be there. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1871.9s)]
*  And if you weren't there, it would take place exactly as you witness it. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1873.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1878.9s)]
*  Without you being there. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1879.9s)]
*  It's like you have almost no influence on it. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1880.9s)]
*  They are wild. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1882.9s)]
*  They are living in the woods. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1883.9s)]
*  And wolves are dominant, intelligent, calculating predators. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1884.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1889.9s)]
*  That they eradicated from the West for a reason. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1890.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1893.9s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1895.9s)]
*  So I think you hit on a bunch of things that would like bring me back to my opinion on it. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1896.9s)]
*  And that's that a lot of this stuff when you wouldn't. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1901.9s)]
*  So I know they've basically described two different areas in Colorado where they're going to put the two or the two first sets of transplants. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1905.9s)]
*  And one of them is like right in where you're not. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1915.9s)]
*  You're not. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1918.9s)]
*  I mean, I rode that country with a horse like all over the place in the circle of where they're going to put those wolves is right there. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1919.9s)]
*  So I know where they're going to put those, you know, one of the spots. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1925.9s)]
*  I know the spot intimately. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1928.9s)]
*  I know the wildlife there intimately. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1930.9s)]
*  How many wolves are they going to put in? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1932.9s)]
*  So my understanding is off the bat, the first year, I know and I believe their goal is by December of this year. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1933.9s)]
*  It's going to be like between 15 and 30, I believe is the first bunch. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1944.9s)]
*  And they're going to have them in two different two different spots. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1949.9s)]
*  But in that you're in that veil veil quarter corridor, you know, up to the flat tops in there, you know, so they're probably going to put 15 to 20 wolves in there. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1952.9s)]
*  The thing that you hit on Joe that I think kind of forms my opinion is, I mean, these areas when you go in a man, they seem so wild. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1963.9s)]
*  Right. Like, you know, I could the flat tops, I could get on a horse and I could ride for 15, 15 hours and not see a road, you know, 10 hours and not see a road. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1972.9s)]
*  And they seem so wild, even to me being there. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1982.9s)]
*  But I don't think that people realize how much how much humans have already affected that landscape and how it doesn't matter. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1986.9s)]
*  Like the this myth that putting wolves back in the land, that landscape is going to turn it back to some ecosystem that was here, you know, 300 years ago. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=1996.9s)]
*  I think it's I think it's a figment of their imagination, man. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2008.9s)]
*  And the reason I say that is because I've also spent a fair amount of time in British Columbia that seems so much more wild to me. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2012.9s)]
*  And let me kind of like give you context of why that is. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2021.9s)]
*  You know, you have you ever been to Vail? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2024.9s)]
*  Colorado? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2027.9s)]
*  Colorado? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2028.9s)]
*  No. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2029.9s)]
*  Yeah. OK. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2030.9s)]
*  I have, but not outside. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2031.9s)]
*  OK. So if you look at if you look at the dynamic of that area, there's a huge highway that goes from Highway 70 that goes from Denver on the front range up, you know, past all the ski resorts into Vail, into Eagle. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2033.9s)]
*  And then it kind of goes down through a big canyon, Glenwood Canyon and kicks back into Aspen. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2048.9s)]
*  The all the winter range there is split by this massive highway. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2053.9s)]
*  And then that highway has an eight foot game fence along the whole whole thing. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2058.9s)]
*  And then, you know, along that Vail Valley where they want to put put these or where they are going to put these wolves, you know, there's, you know, fifty thousand full time residents. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2064.9s)]
*  And, you know, there's probably double that in the high season ski season stuff. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2074.9s)]
*  Plus, you've got these huge ski resorts. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2079.9s)]
*  I guess what I'm getting at is when somebody tells me that the low hanging fruit to kind of rewild that areas as wolves, it's just bullshit. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2081.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2091.9s)]
*  How is it getting passed, though? [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2092.9s)]
*  Well, it got passed by a ballot initiative. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2094.9s)]
*  You know that the ballot initiative is how wolves got, you know, got to the situation they are now. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2097.9s)]
*  And basically what the ballot initiative did is it forced the CPW to take on this goal of transplanting the the wolves. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2105.9s)]
*  So it wasn't the CPW's choice. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2115.9s)]
*  And they you know, there's a I don't know the exact laws, Joe, but the CPW and that's the Colorado's part, the Colorado Parks and Wildlife. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2118.9s)]
*  They're in charge of managing the wildlife in Colorado. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2127.9s)]
*  How can they put something like the transplanting of wolves, a very complex biological problem? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2131.9s)]
*  I mean, it's you're dealing with biology and wildlife. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2141.9s)]
*  How can they put that as a ballot initiative? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2145.9s)]
*  How can they put that in the hands of people other than wildlife conservation experts, wildlife biologists? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2147.9s)]
*  Well, I mean, the reality is our laws, our laws allow that. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2156.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? It doesn't make rational sense. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2159.9s)]
*  No, you know, it's a decision that for people that are just like, yeah, that'd be amazing. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2162.9s)]
*  Let's put the wolves out there. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2168.9s)]
*  Like people are going to lose their dogs. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2169.9s)]
*  Like you're going to your dogs are going to get eaten. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2172.9s)]
*  Like it's going to affect anyone who has livestock. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2175.9s)]
*  You have a problem, whether that problems in three years or in five years. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2178.9s)]
*  Those problems are coming. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2182.9s)]
*  Yeah, dogs are 100 percent going to get eaten. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2184.9s)]
*  Right. If you have a cute golden retriever like mine, you leave them outside. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2186.9s)]
*  Like, guess what? That dog's dead. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2190.9s)]
*  They're going to team up on that dog and tear it apart. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2192.9s)]
*  Yeah. And if you're cool with going outside and seeing wolves eat your dog like, well, then you've made the right choice. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2194.9s)]
*  But if you if you're not like if you don't think they're going to go after low hanging fruit, if you don't you don't think they're going to go after it. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2200.9s)]
*  You don't think they're going to go after easy prey. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2204.9s)]
*  You don't understand wolves. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2206.9s)]
*  Talk to people that live in Alaska. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2207.9s)]
*  Like, you know, anybody who lives in like British Columbia, like they have real fucking wolf problems up there. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2209.9s)]
*  Right. And these are wolf problems that we used to have in the West, but they eradicated them. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2215.9s)]
*  Right. I mean, I don't think it's good to eradicate them. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2220.9s)]
*  I'm not saying that what they did was right when they poisoned horses and left dead horses filled with strychnine and, you know, and the wolves all died off. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2223.9s)]
*  But they did it for a fucking reason. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2231.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, and that's the thing that's so crazy about, you know, back to the process of how it happened. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2234.9s)]
*  Everybody who who wants wolves in Colorado and we can get into, you know, the depth they want them because that's not really clear. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2242.9s)]
*  You know, they they just went through this whole, you know, setting up the plan for the CPW and it it became very clear in my mind watching that process that they they don't really want there to be any, you know, management of wolves in Colorado either. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2251.9s)]
*  It's going to ever. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2266.9s)]
*  But no. Yeah. So basically that's crazy. Yeah. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2267.9s)]
*  And so that that I think, you know, anybody rational is going to be like, look, like we got to have like a top to the population. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2270.9s)]
*  There's no management at all. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2278.9s)]
*  Well, so here's the deal is they're not they have a draft plan, you know, for to manage the wolves. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2280.9s)]
*  What happened is when the CPW did that draft plan, it included some discussion of wolves being lethally managed at all different stages. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2288.9s)]
*  You know what I mean, Joe? Like even now, if they you know, a real problem with livestock, you know, could they be lethally managed? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2298.9s)]
*  And down the road, once they had once they had hit certain population objectives, could they be hunted? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2306.9s)]
*  Right. Like that was discussed. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2313.9s)]
*  Well, it turns out the ballot initiative basically says that wolves are a non game species. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2315.9s)]
*  And that was in the language of the ballot initiative. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2321.9s)]
*  So they can't really they can't really now say the CPW can't really say that they're going to someday be a hundred a hundred species in Colorado. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2324.9s)]
*  I personally think and I you know, everything's like 20, 20 hindsight. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2334.9s)]
*  But even when the ballot initiative originally, you know, was out there and I always thought it was going to pass by a landslide. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2338.9s)]
*  That's what's so crazy, because it just barely passed. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2346.9s)]
*  But I always thought like the problem with Colorado is it's different than these other Western states, you know, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2349.9s)]
*  because they're going to they're going to keep the population in line through hunting or other, you know, other methods. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2358.9s)]
*  But in Colorado, I don't think the politics are going to allow that, man. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2365.9s)]
*  I think it's just going to be like, who knows what the top is on how many there is, how much they affect the ungulate population. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2368.9s)]
*  You know, who who knows? You know. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2376.9s)]
*  But what I was going to say is what's crazy about this ballot initiative and the bummer part about it is everybody that's going to deal with the negative consequences. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2378.9s)]
*  There there are people that voted no in but they're in the areas where the wolves are going to be transplanted. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2387.9s)]
*  Everybody that voted for it, they don't have to deal with the downside. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2393.9s)]
*  They live in Boulder. Yeah, dude. And I'm like you, man. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2397.9s)]
*  They're cool. Like I've been around them in Canada. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2399.9s)]
*  They're way cool. But the the problem is, is every person that I've interacted with in British Columbia, you know, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2402.9s)]
*  or even in the Western states that have a fair amount of wolves, every person is just trying to make a living on the landscape. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2413.9s)]
*  You know, he's a guide, an outfitter, a logger, a cattle ranch or whatever. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2418.9s)]
*  Like he's out there living. He or she's out there living with them and dealing with them. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2422.9s)]
*  They're all just like when you ask about wolves, they're like, it's just like, you know what I mean? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2427.9s)]
*  Because they got to deal with the negative consequences all the time. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2432.9s)]
*  They're a totally different kind of animal than any other animal because they act as a pack. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2435.9s)]
*  And they have some sort of intelligent communication. They're badass. They're amazing. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2441.9s)]
*  They're cunning and crafty and they're efficient, ruthless killers. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2447.9s)]
*  And they also surplus kill. You know, they find them like I think it was Wyoming recently, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2451.9s)]
*  but they found just like fucking giant pile of elk that they had trapped in high snow and just tore to pieces. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2456.9s)]
*  Yeah. And I don't know like the stats on how common it is, but you know, other predators do that too. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2462.9s)]
*  Yeah, cats do that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But it's you know, the difference between them is that they act as a group. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2469.9s)]
*  Yeah. They're the only one of those predators that acts as a large group. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2476.9s)]
*  Yeah. No, and they and they're they're effect. I mean, they're they're effective. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2480.9s)]
*  I mean, even when you talk to I know I know a guy in British Columbia that's I mean his whole world is his whole world is focused on trapping them. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2485.9s)]
*  And I've sat and talked to him just about like the details, you know, like boiling his snares, you know, how he goes in and puts his snares in, you know, how he goes in and checks them like all that. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2494.9s)]
*  Well, when the snares leave no scent. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because they just pick up on that that stuff, you know, they're just so smart. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2504.9s)]
*  It's and they know that they're being fucked with too. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2512.9s)]
*  Yeah. Which it's funny because the first thing you said is there a dog in that? I mean, you have dogs. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2516.9s)]
*  You know how it is like they get figured out. Yeah, they know things. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2522.9s)]
*  I mean, I talk to my dog like he understands certain things. Right. I'm like, come on, dude, let's go outside. Yeah. Starts going towards the door. Yeah. Oh, yeah. He knows that means for sure. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2526.9s)]
*  I can I don't have to say it like want to go outside. Yeah. You want to go outside. I can just say, hey, come on, man. Let's go outside. Yeah. He's like, oh, yeah, let's go outside. Yeah. Are you hungry? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2537.9s)]
*  He's like, fuck, I'm hungry. Okay, let's see. Like, he knows what that means. Yeah. Oh, yeah. He knows some aspects of language. Sure. And you know, what he is is like a really tame, docile version of a wolf. Yeah. A wolf is like a like have you ever been around a Belgian Malinois? Yeah, I don't think those are the dogs that use in war and police dogs. Okay. They are fucking scary little meat missiles. I got you. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2548.9s)]
*  And they look at you like this. Yeah, they're always thinking and you can't just keep one of those motherfuckers in your yard. They're too smart. They're working dogs. First of all, they climb fences. Yeah, like a chimpanzee. They just go right up the fence and over it. I mean, have you ever seen like videos of Belgian Malinois working? I don't think I have, Joe. I'm trying to put it's wild. They can do shit where they leap through the air like you can't fucking believe they really can jump that high. Right. Like soaring through the air. I'm talking like two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2577.9s)]
*  12 feet in the air. They run, jump off a guy's back and then leap through the air, like climb over walls that are like 10 feet tall just by running up the wall. Yeah, it's insane. Pretty wild. That's a wolf. Yeah. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2607.9s)]
*  This is a Belgian Malinois. Oh yeah, I've seen a man. Look at this. I mean, that's insane. It is nuts. How's that dog doing that? Look at him running up the fucking wall. He's basically a monkey. Got it figured out. Look, he's running up a fucking tree to get to a mitt and then he's hanging on it. It's crazy. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2622.9s)]
*  Man, you know, the diversity amongst dogs is wild. It is wild. But these dogs in particular are bred and look how smart they are. Look, you can walk across a tightrope. Look at that. And then saying, I mean, that's fucking insane. They're so intelligent, but that's closer to a wolf. Yeah, way closer to look at his ears. I mean, they're basically an athlete wolf. Yeah. You know, have you ever seen these these great people? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2643.9s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen these dogs that they run with the sheep. Yes. Yeah. Well, they're cool in a much different way. Yeah. They basically think they're sheep. Yeah. You know, pull up a great Pyrenees dogs. Yeah, they're interesting. It's so wild that they all came from wolves and that you have so many different styles of like the way they look. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2673.9s)]
*  These dogs. So so there's big, big domestic sheep permits where I used to outfit. So guys running, you know, big bands of sheep periodically in the wilderness areas and they keep these dogs with them. And these dogs are something else to run into, you know, in the night up in the mountains or whatever in there. They just, you know, they just protect those sheep. Just, you know, you see these big bands of sheep like this and. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2693.9s)]
*  See, they keep wolves off of them. Yeah. So so I've heard mixed things in this will be interesting because right where they're going to put some of these wolves in Colorado, there's some pretty big domestic sheep guys that run these Pyrenees dogs. Oh, Jesus. And they actually so. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2715.9s)]
*  So sheep in the wilderness are one of the few animals that are still guarded by humans. You know, they usually have a herder with them. Yeah. And they a lot of them are guys from nowadays. It seems to be that most of them are from Peru, I believe. And I used to run into the guys because they've been out there living with these sheep man for like weeks at a time. So even though there's a language barrier, like when they see you up there, like they want to they want to hang out, you know, say hi, whatever. Just happy to see people. Yeah, they'll have like they'll have a horse with them. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2730.9s)]
*  You know, maybe, I don't know, probably five, six hundred sheep and they'll have a couple of those dogs. Wow. You know, but back to your original question is I've heard mixed things about these dogs ability to to deal with wolves, you know, and it has to do with the fact that there's more than you know, there's a group of wolves. So if they can draw one of these dogs off, you know, the wolves can wolves can kill them. I know I've heard and I'm not an expert at it, but I know that some people [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2760.9s)]
*  in wolf country, what they'll do is on the Great Pyrenees, they'll put they'll put spike collars on them. So the you know, the wolves can't get a hold of them because these dogs are big, like they're a lot bigger than a wolf than most wolves. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2790.9s)]
*  How big are these dogs? These these Great Pyrenees dogs? What are they way about? I'm thinking Jamie might have to look this up, but I think they're yeah. Yeah. One fifty one sixty. I was thinking that's a big dog. Yeah. You know, but I don't know how well they'll do with the wolves. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2801.9s)]
*  And then there's stories of wolves getting into these domestic sheep and killing like a hundred, you know, just you know. Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know how that's all going to work. It's not going to work well. No. I mean, this idea that that it's always good when you reintroduce predators like it says who? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2819.9s)]
*  Yeah. The balance right now is pretty goddamn good. Like, I don't know what they're thinking. They just have this idea that wolves are amazing. Well, guess what? Wolves are eventually making their way into Colorado anyway. Right. I mean, it's a natural thing that's happening. Yeah. And at least the way it's happening, it'll probably be more sustainable than just dropping off a patch of them in an area that has domestic animals. Right. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2841.9s)]
*  Yeah. I, Joe, I don't know why there's I mean, I do understand why there's an obsession with them. They're beautiful and they're cool. Oh, yeah. But I almost feel like are you familiar with the I believe the name of the YouTube video is why wolves change rivers? Yeah. Yeah. I've seen that. Yeah. But that guy, do you know the guy who made that? He's a fan of wilding and he wants to bring like lions to the UK. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2865.9s)]
*  Yeah, like he's fucking insane. Yeah. He's like, like, there's no limit to this logic of this like trophic cascade idea. Yes. Yeah. Well, what's crazy to me, man, is like, so if you watch that, that that video, and it's got like 50 million views on YouTube or something like that, it's narrated by a guy. I mean, it's really well done. Yeah, it's just it's just cool to watch. But you watch it. I mean, if you listen to the first 90 seconds, there's like a, and the reason I bring this video up is [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2895.9s)]
*  because I actually think that this video was the start of what happened in Colorado was a lot of people watch this and they're like, yeah, it makes sense. You get this predator in here. It fixes all the problems, you know, with the rain balances things. Yeah, it brings everything, everything back. But in that video, man, in the first 90 seconds, there's a bald faced lie. They say I don't know what it is. You want to play it? Yeah, yeah, let's let's play it. And I can how wolves change rivers. Yeah. Yeah. It's the guy behind it is is very controversial. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2925.9s)]
*  I mean, I think it's interesting. I think it's interesting that he has such a passion towards these animals. But this guy legitimately thinks that wilding and rewilding is the way to go for everything. Let's play. Right. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2955.9s)]
*  That's how they get you. Yeah, yeah. And plus the guy's accent. You'll see, man, it draws you in. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2971.9s)]
*  They're cool. They're fucking cool. Beautiful. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2979.9s)]
*  One of the most exciting scientific findings of the past half century has been the discovery of widespread trophic cascades. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2986.9s)]
*  A trophic cascade is an ecological process which starts at the top of the food chain and tumbles all the way down to the bottom. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=2995.9s)]
*  And the classic example is what happened in the Yellowstone National Park in the United States when wolves were reintroduced in 1995. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3004.9s)]
*  Now, we we all know that wolves kill various species of animals, but perhaps we're slightly less aware that they give life to many others. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3013.9s)]
*  Before the wolves turned up, they'd been absent for 70 years, that the numbers of deer, because there was nothing to hunt them, had built up and built up in the Yellowstone Park. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3027.9s)]
*  And despite efforts by humans to control them, so they'd managed to reduce. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3036.9s)]
*  So that's the lie right there. Despite efforts to be controlled by humans in Yellowstone. That that is just factually incorrect, Joe. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3041.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's not true at all. No, it's not true at all in Yellowstone. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3050.9s)]
*  So the history of Yellowstone actually, you know, until the until like the 60s, there's two things going on in the park when they had excess elk, which which they which makes sense because what people don't realize, I mean, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3053.9s)]
*  they were killing predators before the 60s in Yellowstone, like they were suppressing lions in addition to the fact that they had already killed the wolves, you know. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3068.9s)]
*  So there was predator suppression going on even in the park before the 60s. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3077.9s)]
*  Well, in the 60s, well, in the in the late 50s and 60s, and I might be roughly off on these dates, but the park was actually capturing elk and they are transporting all the other states that needed elk. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3081.9s)]
*  I think that's where they got them in California, for Tahoe and Ranch. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3095.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that might be man, because most of the all the big transplants in Colorado, Idaho, like outside of the park, they were they were Yellowstone genetics, you know, and I actually even know I know that some of the you know, some of the elk that ended up down on the Indian reservations and stuff. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3098.9s)]
*  They were originally yellow. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3118.9s)]
*  Can I ask you about that before we move on? [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3120.9s)]
*  Someone I was hunting with this guy in Utah and he was telling me there's there's literally two different kinds of elk and the reason why these elk like in the Gila Mountain Range and the elk in Tahoe and Ranch and they're so big is because these are Yellowstone elk and that the Yellowstone elk have wider bases, more mass, they're larger animals. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3122.9s)]
*  He was like, it's like, like, you know, you have a Roosevelt elk, you have a Tule elk, you have a Rocky Mountain elk. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3147.9s)]
*  He's like, you have a Yellowstone elk. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3153.9s)]
*  He's like, it's a different elk. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3155.9s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't know specifically related to Yellowstone elk, but I actually I actually do know some people who had original Yellowstone. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3157.9s)]
*  So they had original Yellowstone genetic elk on their place and it's a it's a big high fence place owned by owned by the natives in in New Mexico. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3168.9s)]
*  And they actually started to bring in genetics out of Alberta and those elk out of Alberta are way bigger than the Yellowstone elk. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3179.9s)]
*  So that's interesting. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3189.9s)]
*  So what you're saying, I imagine is true, Joe. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3191.9s)]
*  I just don't know exactly. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3194.9s)]
*  But what I have seen is there's huge different men like I saw a cow on this particular place I'm talking about and is bigger than any bull I had ever had a client kill in the fight. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3196.9s)]
*  What is that? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3209.9s)]
*  When we were like, it was the cow popped up in the you know, in the brush there probably like 500 yards from us and I didn't I hadn't picked up my binoculars yet. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3211.9s)]
*  There's no way you could have convinced me that was a cow because it was probably you know, it's probably it was probably like a 750 pound cow. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3220.9s)]
*  What? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3227.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3228.9s)]
*  So there's I've never even heard of such a thing. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3229.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. They're physically they're you know, they're physically way bigger. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3231.9s)]
*  But is that normal for I mean, you're saying this is. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3236.9s)]
*  This is Alberta genetics. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3239.9s)]
*  So is that that thing? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3242.9s)]
*  What is that? [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3243.9s)]
*  There's a thing that happens with animals when they're in cold climates where mammals grow larger. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3244.9s)]
*  Yeah, there's it's like the same thing between like southern BC moose and Yukon moose. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3251.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3256.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3257.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3258.9s)]
*  And it's also deer. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3259.9s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3260.9s)]
*  Like, you know, you have Coos deer that a little tiny suckers and then you get all the way to Saskatchewan. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3261.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3265.9s)]
*  And 50 white tails. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3266.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3267.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3268.9s)]
*  Even is that it says it's named after it's the world. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3269.9s)]
*  I think that's a biology established concept called Bergman's rule states creatures tend to be larger to conserve heat. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3272.9s)]
*  The rules name after Carl Bergman, a 19th century biologist who first described the pattern in 1847. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3279.9s)]
*  Yeah, it totally makes sense. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3284.9s)]
*  Like Texas deer are so tiny. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3285.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. It's really interesting. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3288.9s)]
*  Yeah. Like if you compared like a south Texas white tail to like an Alberta white or an Idaho white. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3290.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3294.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3295.9s)]
*  They're fucking giant up there. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3296.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3297.9s)]
*  Or Iowa. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3298.9s)]
*  Yeah. And it's not all feed related part of this. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3299.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3302.9s)]
*  Obviously this. Yeah. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3303.9s)]
*  This this law that makes sense. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3304.9s)]
*  So I've never even heard of a cow elk being that big. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3306.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah, man. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3310.9s)]
*  There there's there's for sure a regional. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3311.9s)]
*  I mean, part of that's probably like genetics, you know, or like, you know, selective breeding of elk too over time, which, you know, that does exist. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3315.9s)]
*  There's an industry that does that. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3322.9s)]
*  So that might be part of it, too. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3324.9s)]
*  It could be that these animal, too, like much like what we're talking about with California, with Tohono Ranch, you have these animals that are used to living in Montana, say with the California to Tohono Ranch. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3326.9s)]
*  And then all of a sudden they're living in, you know, the Tatchpee Mountains and they have no winter to speak of. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3336.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3343.9s)]
*  Where they're deprived of food. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3344.9s)]
*  They have food all year round now. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3345.9s)]
*  And so they have this body that's designed to consume as much food as possible because winter's coming. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3348.9s)]
*  Right. And then winter never comes. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3354.9s)]
*  Yeah. So they just get giant. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3356.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3357.9s)]
*  Yeah. And that would make sense, too. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3358.9s)]
*  I mean, I was you know, Elk are funny. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3360.9s)]
*  John, I'm sure you've heard this story is like you hear people talking about killing wild elk like, oh, I killed a bull. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3362.9s)]
*  He had to weigh like 900 pounds. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3367.9s)]
*  It's like, do I? I mean, I've put a quartered up a ton of bulls in my life in a big wild bull is, you know, six hundred fifty pounds, seven hundred pounds be a big one. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3369.9s)]
*  You know, they don't get as big as people. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3381.9s)]
*  A lot of people say, you know what I mean? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3384.9s)]
*  But if you go to Tohono Ranch, yeah, they probably are. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3386.9s)]
*  Yeah, you're probably right. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3389.9s)]
*  No, I've seen eleven hundred, twelve hundred pound elk. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3390.9s)]
*  Yeah. So that's you know, that's that's 60 percent bigger than the bulls that I was exposed to in Colorado. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3392.9s)]
*  Yeah, they're extraordinarily large. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3398.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3401.9s)]
*  But then you see a moose and you're like, oh, my God. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3402.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3405.9s)]
*  I mean, first time I saw a moose live on the hoof walking around was in B.C. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3406.9s)]
*  Yeah. And it was like that scene in Jurassic Park. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3411.9s)]
*  We pulled over the truck. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3413.9s)]
*  We're driving on the road and we pulled over a truck and I stuck my head out the window like, what? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3414.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3418.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3419.9s)]
*  Fuck was so big. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3420.9s)]
*  Isn't it goofy? [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3422.9s)]
*  Because they're like that whole depiction of them in cartoons like Bullwinkle. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3423.9s)]
*  It kind of it kind of fits them. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3427.9s)]
*  Yeah. Just like they're cool. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3429.9s)]
*  But fucking dangerous. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3432.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3433.9s)]
*  The thing about them that scares me more than any other. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3434.9s)]
*  They'll they'll come for you. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3436.9s)]
*  They'll go after you. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3437.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3438.9s)]
*  Whereas like no other deer species like goes, oh, you want to start some shit. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3439.9s)]
*  They'll come over and stop you. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3443.9s)]
*  Yeah. I remember. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3445.9s)]
*  You know, it's funny, like when you're riding in the mountains with you're riding a horse and maybe you've got like three or four mules with you, a lot of times you'll pick up off of them that they sent something before you see it. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3446.9s)]
*  You know, those because they smell something. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3457.9s)]
*  And usually they'll start like puffing their nostrils. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3459.9s)]
*  And a lot of times it would be moose. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3462.9s)]
*  You know, they start you. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3464.9s)]
*  You can I can hear them huffing those those mules and horses. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3466.9s)]
*  They're what they're trying to do is they're trying to get more scent in so they can they can be like they know exactly what it is. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3469.9s)]
*  Right. And a lot of times, like as you're going around to switch back or something, you can hear them huffing. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3475.9s)]
*  And sure enough, you come around the corner and they'll just be like a bull, you know, bull moose standing there in the trail. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3479.9s)]
*  Nothing give a shit. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3484.9s)]
*  He's like, I mean, what do you want to do? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3485.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3487.9s)]
*  Like, you know, you didn't you seem like you're you know, you'd seem like you'd be kind of like a, you know, you know, a big, you know, intimidating. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3488.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3496.9s)]
*  Yeah. Intimidating. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3497.9s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3498.9s)]
*  And they just like look at you like you're going to have to go around, you know. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3499.9s)]
*  So several moose like I've literally like drug a string of mules like up the hill, like through the aspens and crashing through a bunch of crap just so so the moose can stand there on the trail. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3502.9s)]
*  I've never seen a Yukon moose on the hoof. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3514.9s)]
*  I would love to. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3517.9s)]
*  I haven't either. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3518.9s)]
*  But you see these guys that kill them and holy smokes, man. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3519.9s)]
*  I've watched some of those Jim Shocky videos. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3521.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3523.9s)]
*  He goes up there and they have antlers that are the size of this table. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3524.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3528.9s)]
*  You just see when they glass them up and the paddles on it. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3529.9s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3531.9s)]
*  They're so big. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3533.9s)]
*  It's hard to believe that they're that much bigger. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3534.9s)]
*  But I guess that's that Bergman's rule. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3536.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3538.9s)]
*  Yeah. Sure. Yeah. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3539.9s)]
*  Because it's cool as fuck up there. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3540.9s)]
*  Yeah. And just genetics and everything else. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3541.9s)]
*  But moose like Colorado is starting to get some huge moose, man. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3543.9s)]
*  In my when I. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3546.9s)]
*  Are they Cyrus moves? [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3548.9s)]
*  Yeah, they're Shires. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3549.9s)]
*  But I mean, a 50 inch moose is not uncommon. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3550.9s)]
*  You know, you know. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3553.9s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3554.9s)]
*  In the in the areas that that I was guiding and outfitting in. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3555.9s)]
*  And it was cool, you know, Joe, because early on when I started, [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3558.9s)]
*  we rarely saw moose, man, like almost never. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3561.9s)]
*  Like if you saw a cow moose, that was like major day, you know. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3564.9s)]
*  By the time I, you know, 10 years later, we always saw moose and big ones. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3567.9s)]
*  You know, do you know Adam Green Tree? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3573.9s)]
*  I don't know him personally. I know of them. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3575.9s)]
*  Adam filmed a grizzly bear in the San Juan's. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3577.9s)]
*  Yeah, which is which is possible, man. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3581.9s)]
*  Do you know the history of the last grizzly bear that they that they saw in there? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3584.9s)]
*  No, I don't want to get the dates and stuff messed up, but it was weird. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3588.9s)]
*  And it's just to tie on to your story. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3595.9s)]
*  They said they were extinct. They weren't around. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3599.9s)]
*  And then a bow hunter went in there, I want to say, like 15 years after they said they were extinct. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3601.9s)]
*  And he went in there and he got mauled by one and he came out and he's like, look, I just killed a grizzly bear. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3607.9s)]
*  I mean, I'm telling you, I did. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3614.9s)]
*  And they said, no, no way you didn't. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3616.9s)]
*  And they went back in there with him. And sure enough, he had I got you have to look up the exact story because I'm sure I kind of butchered it. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3618.9s)]
*  Here it is in 1979, Ed Wiseman, a Colorado hunting guide, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3625.9s)]
*  Cross paths, the grizzly bear during an exhibition expedition rather near the headwaters of the Navajo River. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3629.9s)]
*  Wiseman was attacked and mauled. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3636.9s)]
*  What happened? But while he was down, he managed to fake. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3640.9s)]
*  What the fuck is this? Is this like what is up with his website? [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3644.9s)]
*  It's loading a picture. It's changing. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3647.9s)]
*  Oh, I see. It's just a shitty website. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3649.9s)]
*  But while he was down, he managed to fatally wound the bear by hand using an arrow. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3653.9s)]
*  Why? A fucking arrow. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3659.9s)]
*  But look, Matt, so they said they'd been extinct for like 20 or 30 years already. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3663.9s)]
*  How the fuck do they know? Here's the thing. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3668.9s)]
*  Like that kind of talk is so wild. Like, oh, are you are you out there with cameras in every fucking acre of that land? [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3670.9s)]
*  Shut up. You don't know. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3677.9s)]
*  You should really take the word of the people that find these things out there because those people are actually there. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3679.9s)]
*  How deep to the biologists go and how often are they there? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3685.9s)]
*  How many boots on the ground wildlife surveyors do you have that are telling you exactly what you know, how many bears there are? [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3688.9s)]
*  Yeah. How could you know? Yeah. Who knows? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3697.9s)]
*  And I so cocky and like on the on Adams Dillon, the San Juan's. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3699.9s)]
*  I don't I don't know. He filmed it. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3703.9s)]
*  He filmed it. Yeah. And I've seen I've seen the videos and I, you know, personally, I I don't know that I could say 100 percent either way. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3705.9s)]
*  But I do know that people for sure who have seen them in northern Colorado, like across the border or seen tracks, something like that. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3713.9s)]
*  Of course. I mean, the neighboring states, they're next to Wyoming. Yeah. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3720.9s)]
*  Wyoming has them. Yeah, they move. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3725.9s)]
*  The idea that a grizzly is not going to move from Wyoming to Colorado. He knows it's not his turf. Yeah. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3727.9s)]
*  Well, do the thing about him is they can't people understand they can roam. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3733.9s)]
*  There's something that gets in, you know, bears heads where they will not just bears like I mean, yeah, cats, a little bighorn ram who he's just tired of getting the shit beat out of them from this band of rams. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3737.9s)]
*  He's been hanging out all of a sudden. He just starts moving, man. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3750.9s)]
*  He's just going to go find like a new place to live and they'll travel like crazy distances. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3753.9s)]
*  There's a there's a cool bear study. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3759.9s)]
*  And man, I wish I knew knew the gals name that did it where they call it a bunch of bears. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3761.9s)]
*  And it was done, I believe, in New Mexico. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3766.9s)]
*  And it was it's crazy to see how far these bears will move like they'll they'll go to like where they'll go where they're denning and they'll travel. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3769.9s)]
*  I want to say like two, three hundred miles, hit up an elk calving ground and then they'll go another hundred miles, you know, for somewhere else that they like to hang out in the fall to hit acorns or something. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3778.9s)]
*  So this bears doing an insane trip. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3790.9s)]
*  Wow. It's wild. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3793.9s)]
*  So, yeah, it's it's for sure possible. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3795.9s)]
*  Of course. And it's likely it means I mean, I trust Adam. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3797.9s)]
*  He's just he's so yeah, I got you. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3800.9s)]
*  Like he wouldn't say like he would just say, oh, my God, look at that black bear. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3803.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. He would say it was a giant black bear. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3807.9s)]
*  But he's like, that's a fucking grizzly bear. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3809.9s)]
*  He was filming it through his is is is and he's got like that. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3812.9s)]
*  He's got his gun out in the whole deal. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3816.9s)]
*  Right. Oh, that's a different one. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3818.9s)]
*  OK, this is one that he filmed. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3820.9s)]
*  OK, so look at the size of that. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3822.9s)]
*  Look, just look at what it looks like. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3824.9s)]
*  Sure. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3826.9s)]
*  So this is I believe he's got film footage. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3828.9s)]
*  No, it's OK. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3833.9s)]
*  So that is just but just even those photos, that looks exactly like a brown bear. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3834.9s)]
*  I mean, that doesn't look like a black bear to me. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3840.9s)]
*  Yeah, they get that blonde. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3843.9s)]
*  They get that blonde kind of kind of shine to him. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3844.9s)]
*  Yeah, that looks like a fucking brown bear, man. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3847.9s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it could be look, it could be a massive color face bear. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3849.9s)]
*  Right. It could be. Yeah. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3853.9s)]
*  But the odds are not that good. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3854.9s)]
*  Yeah. When they get that go, I can't remember the term that the people use for it, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3856.9s)]
*  but they get that golden kind of like blondness at the end of their at the end of the hair. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3861.9s)]
*  And I've seen it. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3865.9s)]
*  I've seen you know, we used to have a bunch of black bears in my area that have like mohawks. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3866.9s)]
*  You ever seen like red mohawk? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3869.9s)]
*  Yeah. OK, this is no, this is one. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3871.9s)]
*  This is 100 percent a grizzly bear. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3874.9s)]
*  But I believe this was in Idaho. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3877.9s)]
*  Is that where it was? Or Montana? [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3881.9s)]
*  Started in Colorado. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3882.9s)]
*  He's now in Montana. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3884.9s)]
*  That was that was because he was hunting for 28 days straight solo. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3885.9s)]
*  But he actually drove to Montana and then he had an encounter with a fiend. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3890.9s)]
*  By the way, he had it. He he lives in Australia where pistols are. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3895.9s)]
*  You can't even get a pistol. Oh, so someone gave him a pistol to borrow while he was out there. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3902.9s)]
*  What he didn't know is that the rounds were the wrong round for the pistol he had. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3908.9s)]
*  So his gun was not going to work. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3914.9s)]
*  So here he is pointing this gun at this grizzly bear. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3918.9s)]
*  And if you see the video, it's fucking crazy. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3922.9s)]
*  The bear runs up on him. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3925.9s)]
*  He's got a chance. Let's give it some volume. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3926.9s)]
*  I had no mind. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3930.9s)]
*  My life is so I drew my handgun. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3931.9s)]
*  It's something that you carry, especially when you buy yourself. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3934.9s)]
*  How about a handgun that works, bitch? [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3937.9s)]
*  You live in a shitty country. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3939.9s)]
*  It'll teach you about guns over there. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3940.9s)]
*  She turned off at about 20 yards. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3942.9s)]
*  So it was just like a bluff charge. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3944.9s)]
*  I stayed dead still just with the pistol drawn. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3946.9s)]
*  See, look at this gun. See, see. Oh, yeah. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3949.9s)]
*  You see it? Like it's already it's like it's jammed. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3953.9s)]
*  Look how the front is sticking out. Like the slide. Yeah. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3956.9s)]
*  So look at the slide like the entrance of the right hand side. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3960.9s)]
*  That gun is not doing jack shit. Yeah. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3963.9s)]
*  Which is really funny because he doesn't even know he had false. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3965.9s)]
*  He's a bow hunter. That is kind of funny. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3968.9s)]
*  It's funny that he was like he's pointing a magic wand at a grizzly bear. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3970.9s)]
*  Yeah. Begone. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3973.9s)]
*  Well, the thing is, man, is like it's not like I mean, I've been around grizzlies a fair amount. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3976.9s)]
*  I've never had like a threatening type of, you know, interaction with them. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3982.9s)]
*  But I've had I've actually had like a few little things with black bears. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3986.9s)]
*  And every time I guided a black bear hunt, Joe, and like I walked up to a black bear, you know, with a hunter. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3990.9s)]
*  It's not like they're not scary. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3996.9s)]
*  You know, you look at their claws and you're like, well, man, it's like, oh, they're like, it's like, isn't it also true that more black bears attack people to try to eat them than grizzlies? [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=3998.9s)]
*  I think that's like when black bears attack you in general, it's like a predatory thing. Right. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4010.9s)]
*  And where as grizzlies get surprised and there's these scary black bear encounters or black bear things you hear about where the bears are habituated like campgrounds and stuff. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4016.9s)]
*  And they attack people in their tents and somebody and I don't know that is scary. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4025.9s)]
*  I was listening to somebody talk about recently. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4029.9s)]
*  I can't remember who it was, but there's something about when you get attacked in a tent and they think that in general, if it's grizzly or black bear, that is more of like a like predatory. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4032.9s)]
*  I'm going to eat you type of thing. Yes. Maybe because it's at night. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4044.9s)]
*  You know, I mean, like they do some of their hunting at night. Also, I think it's like a burrito. Yeah. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4047.9s)]
*  You're like going to tear it open. Yeah. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4052.9s)]
*  It's like it's a wrap, you know. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4056.9s)]
*  It's like, why? How is this stupid animal stuck inside this cloth bag? Yeah. Perfect for me to just tear through and eat it. Yeah. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4060.9s)]
*  Just for them, the smell must be amazing. It must be like bacon in, you know, like with an open window. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4068.9s)]
*  You know, that's what a camper smells like. Like bacon. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4074.9s)]
*  They probably smelled fantastic. Yeah, I do know that it seems to me that most of the the attacks from black bears had been bears that are habituated. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4078.9s)]
*  You know, I mean, they're used to people. One of the ones that was recently, there was a Montana woman who was mauled, who was killed in her tent. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4089.9s)]
*  She was on a bike trip and she was making her way and she had actually chased this bear off earlier. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4099.9s)]
*  And then she decided, well, he's gone. She went to bed and he's like, no, I'm not. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4105.9s)]
*  And he came and ate her. Yeah, it's scary. Yeah. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4109.9s)]
*  I mean, I've had them, you know, they have you ever have you ever been around black bears when they're when they're they kind of we call it jack in their jaws. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4113.9s)]
*  But they jack their jaws. It's a real it's got you. You can you know, even if you never heard it before, if you hear it, you know exactly what they mean. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4119.9s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, like you need to get get out of here. What's weird is their sound. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4126.9s)]
*  Like they sound like a monkey. They sound like an ape. Yeah. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4130.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4133.9s)]
*  They do that. It's like, wow, that's weird. Yeah. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4135.9s)]
*  Do one. I got to tell you. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4138.9s)]
*  They do that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4141.9s)]
*  Strange. It's wild. You know, it's funny because they also make I mean, the you know, a sow will talk to their cub quite cubs quite a bit too. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4143.9s)]
*  Have you ever heard that? It's kind of like, I don't know what this it's almost like a like a little mewing sound. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4152.9s)]
*  I mean, I call it me like an elk mew, but it's kind of that same tonal structure. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4158.9s)]
*  But it sounds a little bit a little bit different. And I hadn't heard it before. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4162.9s)]
*  But, you know, I'll tell you this story real quick. Just kind of kind of a wild deal. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4166.9s)]
*  I was I was guiding a hunter and we were watching these bears and they were they were in oak brush. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4170.9s)]
*  They're they're basically stripping acorns off this oak brush. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4175.9s)]
*  And a lot of times what these black bears will do, the sows will kick their they'll kick their cubs up in the oak. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4179.9s)]
*  And this oak brush could be as high as this room, man, you know. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4186.9s)]
*  And what will happen is they'll kick their cubs up in the oak brush. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4189.9s)]
*  And when you're glassing the oak brush, you'll be looking in the oak brush and you'll just see the little furry cub and he'll be just hanging in the tree, you know. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4192.9s)]
*  And then you don't see the sow because the canopy of the oak brush is covered, covered. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4201.9s)]
*  So a lot of times when I was guiding bear hunters, I always would look for that, you know, because you can't you know, you know, obviously just from like nobody wants to kill the mom of two little baby cubs. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4207.9s)]
*  But it's also illegal to do that, you know. So you're always looking. You don't want to make a mistake. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4218.9s)]
*  So I would always be glassing the oak brush for for cubs. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4223.9s)]
*  And so we were watching this this hillside and I saw a couple of cubs and then I could see their mom kind of cruising underneath them, you know, every once in a while she'd pop out. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4226.9s)]
*  And then so we were we were kind of paying attention or just they're cool to watch. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4235.9s)]
*  We were watching them. And then a boar black bear came up the hill right in front of us. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4238.9s)]
*  It may have was probably like 200 yard difference or something. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4242.9s)]
*  And we watched him in the hunter wanted to shoot him, but we didn't have a clear shot. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4246.9s)]
*  So we just kind of kept watching them and the bears kind of started mingling together. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4250.9s)]
*  And it was getting maybe the last like 30, 40 minutes of light. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4255.9s)]
*  And finally, this bear got out. And I actually remember because he was he got a hold of like something that had been dead forever. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4259.9s)]
*  Like it was in the ground, like an old winter kill or something. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4265.9s)]
*  This this boar black bear. And he was just trying to tear it up, you know, and he's digging on it. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4268.9s)]
*  But that gave the hunter the shot. And so he shot the bear and I saw the bear start rolling down this canyon. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4272.9s)]
*  And so I was like, all right, you're good to go. Like he goes down and he lands on a tree like, you know, off to his left a little bit. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4279.9s)]
*  Just kind of came down the topography of the mountain. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4285.9s)]
*  I'm like, you're good, but we should get over there while we got light just to maneuver around the canyon. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4288.9s)]
*  So I get over there and we get above the bear and it's pretty steep. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4292.9s)]
*  And I'm looking down, I see him against the tree. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4298.9s)]
*  And then I hear a cub up in the tree, like, you know, up in the canopy. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4300.9s)]
*  And I'm like, what is going on? Like, I know for a fact that that's not, you know, that's how I know that's not a sow. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4305.9s)]
*  And but it but it like made my heart bump like, oh, shit, did we make some sort of like horrible mistake? [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4313.9s)]
*  So I trot down there and I remember grabbing this bear's back leg and I pick his leg up and I see his balls. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4319.9s)]
*  I'm like, fuck, yeah. You know what I mean? [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4325.9s)]
*  Like, you know, because you don't want to make like that. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4327.9s)]
*  I feel shitty. You know, I feel horrible. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4330.9s)]
*  So I'm like, dude, OK, that cub that's up in those trees is is not, you know, this isn't the mom. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4332.9s)]
*  So good deal. But I'm thinking to myself, like, where's this cub? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4338.9s)]
*  So I look, Joe, in the same tree that this bear rolled down into that cub was in it. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4341.9s)]
*  He was in the same tree that this just randomly. Yeah. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4347.9s)]
*  Randomly, man. So the sow was around there somewhere. Yeah, dude. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4351.9s)]
*  So that's the problem. Like immediately when I realized this, I start hearing that just jaws. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4354.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. So she's nearby. She's really vocal and she's trying to call to the cub. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4360.9s)]
*  You know, so what do you do? Do you back out? So I'm thinking we have to. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4365.9s)]
*  Right. Yeah. We got to just back up. So we get we get we back up the hill and we just watch, you know, it's like, well, this is the deal. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4369.9s)]
*  And it was crazy, Joe. Like literally, it's felt like forever, but it couldn't have been more for more than 30 or 40 minutes because it's getting dark. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4377.9s)]
*  But this cub would come down. He'd come down the tree. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4385.9s)]
*  I'd watch him, you know, get down halfway and then he looked down, he'd see the boar and he'd go back up. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4388.9s)]
*  You know, I was like, oh, this is going to last forever. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4394.9s)]
*  And finally, man, I wish I I wish I had the foresight to video it. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4397.9s)]
*  But he just kept working down as his mom was calling to him. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4401.9s)]
*  And then right at the right like right at the end before he came out, he was like maybe three feet above the dead bear at the at the base of the tree. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4404.9s)]
*  And he jumped out of the tree and he landed on the on the dead boar bear. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4412.9s)]
*  And he kind of just like looked around and then he ran off to his mom like awesome. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4417.9s)]
*  But those those kind of situations, man, anytime I got between, you know, near cubs or like where the sow didn't have visual to the cubs, that would that would freak me out regardless of his grizz or black bear, you know. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4421.9s)]
*  Yeah, mama bears don't fuck around. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4434.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's why. Yeah. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4436.9s)]
*  You know, they call mama humans. Yeah, well, they could be it could be like an 80 pound black bear. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4438.9s)]
*  Yeah. And you're still like, man, dude, I don't want to you don't want any of that. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4444.9s)]
*  No. Yeah. My God. An 80 pound dog. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4448.9s)]
*  And that's way scarier than a dog. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4451.9s)]
*  It's funny. He's like black bears. We think of as being sort of innocuous. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4455.9s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? There's a 300 pound wild predator. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4458.9s)]
*  Yeah. Well, dude, you pick up their paws and it's like, you get slapped with it. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4461.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's not good. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4466.9s)]
*  You're not doing well. Yeah. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4468.9s)]
*  Do you still hunt them? Yeah. Yeah. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4470.9s)]
*  I mean, I mean, it's been evident years, but I used to go up to with my friends, John and Jen up in Alberta. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4472.9s)]
*  OK, sure. Cam goes up there every year. Yeah. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4478.9s)]
*  Cam Haynes. It's they have a very bear rich environment up there. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4482.9s)]
*  By the way, up there you get wolf tags over the counter. Yeah. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4487.9s)]
*  I mean, that's how much of a wolf problem they have there. Yeah. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4490.9s)]
*  You go to the gas station to buy a bear tag. You pick up a wolf tag. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4494.9s)]
*  I think it's like forty dollars. Sure. Yeah. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4497.9s)]
*  And you probably haven't met a whole bunch of Canadians up there that are huge, huge wolf fans. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4500.9s)]
*  None. They don't like them at all. I know. It's so interesting. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4506.9s)]
*  Right. Go to Boulder and talk to people about wolves like wolves are amazing. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4510.9s)]
*  That's my spirit animal. Yeah. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4514.9s)]
*  But it's just the difference between like people who have to deal with the negative consequences. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4517.9s)]
*  And I'm like you, man. Like, I don't want them to be like I love them. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4521.9s)]
*  I don't want to be eradicated off off the earth. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4524.9s)]
*  But I do realize that like they have negative consequences for some folks. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4527.9s)]
*  And I mean, you have to be you have to look at it, man. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4532.9s)]
*  It's like, well, everybody, you know, you got all these people have to deal with the problems. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4535.9s)]
*  They don't, you know, other people are voting in for them to basically have to deal with. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4540.9s)]
*  Exactly. Exactly. It's like someone saying defund the police in a city they don't live in. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4545.9s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah. It's like, yeah, defund the police. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4550.9s)]
*  Yeah. And it's like, I don't know why people get value out of out of that. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4554.9s)]
*  It's it's an enigma to me, man. Well, you know, the beautiful thing about this country is that everyone can vote. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4560.9s)]
*  The horrible thing about this country is that everything can vote. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4565.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. It's part of the same thing. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4568.9s)]
*  But it's a fellow like you. You understand what you know, you understand the ecosystem. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4572.9s)]
*  You understand these animals and you spend so much time with them. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4578.9s)]
*  It's like those are the people that really should be making that assessment. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4581.9s)]
*  It's like if you want to vote on certain things and you do not have an understanding of that thing that you're voting on, you really shouldn't vote on it. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4585.9s)]
*  It's like, right. You know, it's like you can't if you don't have an educated perspective on it, then this is crazy. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4593.9s)]
*  Right. Just allowing people to just guess whether or not it'd be good to bring back wolves. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4602.9s)]
*  And of course, these these pro animal animal rights groups that want these animals and look, they love these fucking animals. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4607.9s)]
*  And I get it. And it's not that they're bad people. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4615.9s)]
*  It's just they're also misguided because people who love these animals aren't hunting them. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4617.9s)]
*  They're not out there. You're not you're not entrenched in the day to day existence of what it means to be a wild animal. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4622.9s)]
*  Right. It means to be a predator and a prey. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4630.9s)]
*  What it means to be an undulate, what it means to be a cat. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4632.9s)]
*  You never locked eyes to eyes with a mountain lion in the wild. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4635.9s)]
*  You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4638.9s)]
*  You're just these all these like weird things that you're picking up off of Instagram videos. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4640.9s)]
*  You know, like you have your virtue signaling. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4646.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, and I cut your I cut your episode you did with is Derek Wolf. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4648.9s)]
*  Right. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4653.9s)]
*  That line was huge, man. Fucking huge. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4655.9s)]
*  What they say away. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4657.9s)]
*  One hundred and seventy plus pounds dressed. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4658.9s)]
*  You know, if it weren't for the fact that I don't know that the guy he was with, I don't know him personally. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4661.9s)]
*  But we're you know, we're acquainted. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4668.9s)]
*  We you know, he worked in a different part of Colorado and he has a very good reputation. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4670.9s)]
*  If it weren't for the fact that that I knew that he was with him, I would say that that's that that's bullshit because I never heard of a lion being one hundred and eighty pounds. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4675.9s)]
*  Yeah. His buddy Alex. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4683.9s)]
*  Did I say that? What did I say? [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4686.9s)]
*  You didn't say. Oh, OK. I'm sorry. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4687.9s)]
*  I'm sorry. He just said guide. He was here to hang out with him. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4689.9s)]
*  OK. You met him. Yeah. He's very well respected. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4692.9s)]
*  I some of my guides worked for him. He's on the cover of Bo Hunting magazine. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4695.9s)]
*  Now pull up the photo. It's Derek Wolf's Instagram. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4699.9s)]
*  But he's such a fucking good guy. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4703.9s)]
*  But one hundred and eighty pound lion man like that. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4705.9s)]
*  That's huge. Yeah. Well, he said it was two hundred pounds. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4708.9s)]
*  He said, like, if you take away the guts and the blood. Oh, that's right. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4711.9s)]
*  So it's one hundred and seventy plus. Look at this. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4715.9s)]
*  Now, if you don't know how big Derek is when you're in front of Derek, Derek's a goddamn. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4717.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a Viking. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4722.9s)]
*  I mean, it's like one hundred percent Viking genes. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4723.9s)]
*  He's enormous. Big guy. Enormous. Not big. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4726.9s)]
*  So if you put me holding up that cat, it would be fucking crazy. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4729.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. The cat's bigger than me for sure. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4733.9s)]
*  It's basically weighed what I weigh. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4736.9s)]
*  I weigh 200 pounds. So imagine a fucking mountain lion that's 200 pounds. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4739.9s)]
*  I saw one in in Utah, a big one under a tree. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4744.9s)]
*  But it was, you know, I mean, I guessed like someone's like, how big? [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4751.9s)]
*  I was like, look like 170 pound cat. Yeah. Fucking huge. Yeah. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4755.9s)]
*  It was really big. It was me and my friend Colton. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4759.9s)]
*  We were driving and as we were driving, he stopped. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4762.9s)]
*  It was like at dusk. Yeah. Stops to try to look under that tree. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4766.9s)]
*  It's a fucking cat. And I look and I catch the eyes glowing from the low light. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4770.9s)]
*  You know, you see the light and then I put my binos on him. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4776.9s)]
*  So I'm inside. We're 30 yards away from this cat. I put the binos on him. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4778.9s)]
*  I just see this big pumpkin head. Yeah. Fucking demon cat eyes. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4782.9s)]
*  I'm like, oh, my God, he's so big. Yeah. His forearms were just jacked. Yeah. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4786.9s)]
*  They were so big. It's funny. You say the forearm thing. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4792.9s)]
*  I've skinned a ton of lions and every time I skin one, Joe, when you look at their forearm on a lion, it's not like any other. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4795.9s)]
*  It's like an arm wrestler. Yeah, dude. It's crazy. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4803.9s)]
*  Like, you know how a deer and elk, if you just if you just go with your knife and you just get through the hide, like circle the joint, you know, maybe you nicked the tendons a little bit. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4805.9s)]
*  I got, you know, most guys, if they hit it right, they can just snap it. Right. No way with a lion, man. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4814.9s)]
*  No way. Because they're like the tendons and just the structure right here is just totally different. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4819.9s)]
*  Do you know that one lion that was living in California in the Hollywood Hills? [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4824.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. We have that photo. Yeah. See the forearm. Yeah, that's exactly right. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4829.9s)]
*  We have that photo, that exact photo. We have a giant version of it outside of the studio. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4835.9s)]
*  Yeah, dude. That collar on it. That's so crazy. That's an awesome photo. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4840.9s)]
*  But it shows that forearm thing, dude. So massive. And they have a dewclaw. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4845.9s)]
*  They got a dewclaw down low, you know, like a floating dewclaw. Just something to crab onto when they're wrestling. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4850.9s)]
*  Well, you know what they do with it, because I've seen them swatting at dogs with it and what they want to do, because I used to watch them. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4856.9s)]
*  I'm like, what are they doing? And so what I realized is that they're trying to hook like they want to reach out and hook you hook the dog with that and bring the dog to their mouth. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4862.9s)]
*  Because they want the dog in their mouth. You know, that's how they get a hold of you. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4872.9s)]
*  What I notice about them, just just my observation, so I might be talking to my ass a little bit, but it sure seems like if they can do it, they want to hold stuff with their mouth and they're using their hands to bring it, you know, to bring it to their. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4876.9s)]
*  That picture to me, can you put that picture up again? That picture to me, it I love that picture. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4889.9s)]
*  And one of the reasons why, first of all, it looks like it's staged, but it's just a camera trap. That's way cool. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4895.9s)]
*  And the fact that it's wearing a collar and the fact that it's with the Hollywood sign in the background. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4902.9s)]
*  So this thing is in the middle of. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4909.9s)]
*  Incredibly dense, heavily populated area, and it's just murdering dogs. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4914.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Murdering dogs. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4919.9s)]
*  I mean, you know, I mean, dogs go missing in that area. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4922.9s)]
*  A fuck load. There's no deer. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4925.9s)]
*  You can't find a goddamn deer up there. Good luck. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4928.9s)]
*  Sure. You very rarely see deer in the Hollywood Hills. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4930.9s)]
*  And that's why because you have a monster, you have a hundred and fifty pound monster just cruising around with jacked Popeye for. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4933.9s)]
*  Yeah, they're they're lions are crazy, man. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4940.9s)]
*  The craziest thing about them to me is that if if you're not actively hunting them, you don't realize how how many are around. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4944.9s)]
*  Like in all my years of guiding, man, I think I've glassed up like maybe three or four. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4952.9s)]
*  And then and then all my other experience with them is, you know, hunting them. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4958.9s)]
*  But I can only imagine like the dozens and dozens that have just been sitting up on a rock or something as I cruise by. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4961.9s)]
*  And I never knew about it. They're stealthy. Yeah. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4969.9s)]
*  I saw one in Montecito in Santa Barbara. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4972.9s)]
*  I was driving that one on someone's lawn or someone's fucking porch. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4976.9s)]
*  That's in Los Feliz. Oh, my God. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4981.9s)]
*  Really think it was that one. I'm not sure. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4984.9s)]
*  Well, that that cat was sick by the end of its life. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4986.9s)]
*  They think it had gotten hit by a car. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4989.9s)]
*  And I think they euthanized it. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4991.9s)]
*  That looks terrible. It looks smaller than that. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4994.9s)]
*  It does. But it might be starving. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4996.9s)]
*  Yeah. Not the same day. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=4998.9s)]
*  I think P 22 or whatever it was. Yeah. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5000.9s)]
*  P 22. They call him. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5003.9s)]
*  I think when he died, he was very ill. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5004.9s)]
*  I think they wound up euthanizing. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5007.9s)]
*  I'm pretty sure he got hit by a car. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5009.9s)]
*  Something happened that really fucked him up and kept him from being able to hunt, [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5011.9s)]
*  which is probably why sitting on people's porches. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5016.9s)]
*  Yeah. He's hoping they have a poodle he can eat. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5019.9s)]
*  Figure out something easy. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5021.9s)]
*  They're cool, man. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5023.9s)]
*  I've personally killed a couple of them. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5026.9s)]
*  It's funny, Joe, like I love hunting them, man. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5028.9s)]
*  Like I love like they're really fun to hunt. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5031.9s)]
*  I don't have the urge to ever kill another one, but I would love to go with continue to go with normal people. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5034.9s)]
*  What did they taste like? Derek said they tasted delicious. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5039.9s)]
*  Yeah, dude, they're good. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5043.9s)]
*  They're like lean pork and they look like lean pork. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5044.9s)]
*  That's how I would describe it. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5048.9s)]
*  I bet you if I fed it to you, you'd think like this is like lean pork that maybe is like a little taste like a little overcooked or something. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5049.9s)]
*  Rinella said it's better than pork. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5058.9s)]
*  He said he likes it. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5060.9s)]
*  Yeah. He sent me a photo of some stuff that he cooked. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5061.9s)]
*  How was it? He goes, it was superb. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5065.9s)]
*  Yeah. That's what he said. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5067.9s)]
*  He said really? He goes, it was amazing. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5068.9s)]
*  I I the meat man is it's I'll show it to you because it looks like it looks like pork, too, man. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5070.9s)]
*  No, I've definitely seen it online. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5080.9s)]
*  I never never had a chance to try it, though, in person. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5083.9s)]
*  I got to take a leak, man. Yeah. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5086.9s)]
*  So let's pause for a bit. We'll come back. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5088.9s)]
*  This is new. Hydrated Joe has a real problem. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5090.9s)]
*  I used to be able to go three hours, half an hour longer than the other day. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5092.9s)]
*  The other day was bad, but I've been really amping up my hydration. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5096.9s)]
*  I got blood work. I found out I was dehydrated and now I can water all day. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5102.9s)]
*  But it's a fucking problem. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5106.9s)]
*  Like before I go on stage, I have to make sure I pee before I go on stage. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5108.9s)]
*  I'm on stage for an hour. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5111.9s)]
*  Like I can't have to piss while I'm doing stand up. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5113.9s)]
*  All right. Let's pause for a bit. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5115.9s)]
*  Let's talk about it. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5116.9s)]
*  So why we were being Jamie was Googling the new chat GPT, which just got released. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5120.9s)]
*  Is it four point? Oh, is that what it is? [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5125.9s)]
*  Yeah, I guess. Yeah, because they were on three point five would be the highest. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5128.9s)]
*  I think it was. And is everybody freaking out? [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5131.9s)]
*  Is it scary? Well, they're showing and I can't I mean, let me see if this can skip ahead of something. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5133.9s)]
*  There's literally right now they're doing the demonstration of it live for everybody to see. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5139.9s)]
*  They just showed some of the like, I'll show you the test scores on their website. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5143.9s)]
*  Right after they announced this afternoon, they showed some exam scores. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5148.9s)]
*  They put it up against against like GPT three point five down here. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5151.9s)]
*  It's like passing AP calculus, which I guess the blue would have been GPT three. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5156.9s)]
*  Green is the new one. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5161.9s)]
*  Some of the ones that have passed, I think that was those were not as good, but it did pass like the bar exam, I believe. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5164.9s)]
*  It's translating stuff from into different languages now. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5172.9s)]
*  Wow. Very high rate thing I thought was crazy is it understands memes so it can read this picture. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5175.9s)]
*  It's breaking down that it's in three panels. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5182.9s)]
*  It tells you what's in each panel and then what the humor is about that. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5184.9s)]
*  Wow. And there's different examples of that. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5188.9s)]
*  I don't know exactly what. Let's go back up. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5191.9s)]
*  Scroll back up. It says the humor come from this image comes from the absurdity of plugging a large outdated VGA connector into a small modern smartphone charging port. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5193.9s)]
*  Oh, it's just that. Yeah, I mean, it's not that it's funny on its own, but it's just it can understand that. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5203.9s)]
*  Interesting. And then I'm waiting to find out some of this other stuff that is in it. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5209.9s)]
*  And this is one day, right? It's just one day of chat. GPT. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5214.9s)]
*  I even saw already there's like a Robo call company that's going to make it so that if you get a call from like a scammer, you hit a button on your phone or and I'm not even sure where you hit it. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5217.9s)]
*  It instantly creates a thousand word lawsuit to go against them using what they just called you with. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5228.9s)]
*  Oh, my God. GPT three point five could not do that very well. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5234.9s)]
*  And they're saying four point. I was really good at it already today. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5237.9s)]
*  Oh, my God. And I don't know how far where this goes or what happened. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5240.9s)]
*  We're going to be completely entangled with this world of artificial intelligence. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5245.9s)]
*  You know, it's crazy, man, is I don't want to have anything to do with it. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5250.9s)]
*  You shouldn't. Well, especially considering what you have been doing for all these years as a as a guide and an outfitter. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5253.9s)]
*  It's like the last thing that's like as far removed from that world as possible. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5260.9s)]
*  This may sound like so as nine, Joe, but I just look at I'm like I I already feel like I'm playing the coolest video game. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5265.9s)]
*  Right. And you know, yeah, like the real video game, man. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5273.9s)]
*  Yeah. You know, like there's there's so many different like outdoor stuff, even beyond what I've done. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5277.9s)]
*  Like, you know, I mean, over the last couple of months, I've become obsessed with with tarp and fishing and go fishing with my kids every day. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5282.9s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, there's there's like a million different little like outdoor adventures that I can take. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5288.9s)]
*  And I can learn about the gear and learn about the skill set. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5294.9s)]
*  Like, I don't want to have anything to do with the metaverse, man. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5297.9s)]
*  I've been fishing must be fun. Those things. But you can't eat them. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5300.9s)]
*  You can't eat them. Right. You can't you can't eat them at all. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5304.9s)]
*  There's no. I mean, I think I think you can't smoke them or something. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5307.9s)]
*  I think you can't. Well, so I don't know what they taste like or what the deal is. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5310.9s)]
*  I mean, obviously you could eat them. Let's Google. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5316.9s)]
*  Why can't you eat tarp and the reason the main reason they're not eaten is just because of their like their value as a sports fit. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5318.9s)]
*  Oh, you know, sport fish. That's it. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5327.9s)]
*  But what about Marlin? Because people eat Marlin. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5329.9s)]
*  Yeah. But even even billfish like Marlin, sailfish and stuff, a lot of the times they don't eat them because, you know, they want to re catch them. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5331.9s)]
*  So it says tarp and are rarely eaten because their flesh is filled with small, hard to clean bones. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5339.9s)]
*  The United States, the tarpon usually is caught for sport and then released as a bony, strong smelling saltwater fish. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5344.9s)]
*  It may be more trouble than pleasure to eat. Yeah. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5352.9s)]
*  And I've heard that they they're like very bony. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5355.9s)]
*  Have you ever seen them, Joe? No, not in the flesh. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5358.9s)]
*  They have like a like a prehistoric look, man. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5361.9s)]
*  A tarpon can be harvested only for those anglers that are seeking the state of Florida record for tarpon fishing. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5364.9s)]
*  Is it are they only in Florida? Is it the only state that has them? [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5371.9s)]
*  No, the Caribbean has them lots of places. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5373.9s)]
*  But it be in the United States? And is Florida the only state that has them in the United States? [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5375.9s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5379.9s)]
*  So it says a special stamp must be acquired along with the saltwater fishing license to harvest a tarpon of any size. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5381.9s)]
*  Yeah. Interesting. So if you want to get a trophy, you have to have a stamp in advance. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5389.9s)]
*  Like imagine if you're just tarpon fishing and you get a world record like, hey, I don't have a stamp. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5394.9s)]
*  You have to just let it go. Yeah. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5400.9s)]
*  You know, most a lot of times now with fish like that, you know, when people get mounted, their replicas anyways. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5402.9s)]
*  Yeah, most billfish. That's a weird thing, isn't it? [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5410.9s)]
*  It is kind of I see I went over guys house and he had a real trout and I was like, oh, nice. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5413.9s)]
*  This is a real one. Yeah. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5419.9s)]
*  Because there's so many like for people that don't know, like save a guy catches like one of my neighbors is a big time bass fisherman. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5421.9s)]
*  And he just sent me out. I'll pull it up for you because he's he's pretty hardcore. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5428.9s)]
*  And he just caught this. Shout out to my friend, Alan. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5434.9s)]
*  He just caught this 13 pound bass. Oh, it's huge. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5437.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's pretty nice. Right there. Oh, yeah. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5441.9s)]
*  So what he'll do is he gets all the measurements and the photos of that. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5445.9s)]
*  And then he brings it to a company that basically makes him a plastic fish. Yeah. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5449.9s)]
*  It's like my feeling is I would rather just have that photo of him. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5454.9s)]
*  I just frame the picture. That picture wall, man, because he's catch and release guy. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5459.9s)]
*  So he lets the fish go. Yeah. But like, come on, man. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5463.9s)]
*  Why do you have a plastic fake fish? [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5466.9s)]
*  It's like if you had your kids instead of a photo of your kid, you had a plastic version of your kid with fucking goofy fake eyes. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5469.9s)]
*  That's so stupid. Why would you do that? Yeah, I don't know, man. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5475.9s)]
*  Right. To be honest, I even on, you know, other, you know, the species we're talking about hunting. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5479.9s)]
*  I'm kind of over taxidermy on that, too. I used to. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5486.9s)]
*  Yeah, I see you do. I learned that from Renella. Renella was my first mentor. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5490.9s)]
*  Yeah. And he's like, I just do not like the eyeballs, the whole thing. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5495.9s)]
*  Yeah. The plastic. It's like, yeah, like when I look at a mount, like a shoulder mount, I'm looking at this thing that's like not really the animal. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5500.9s)]
*  Sometimes it's not even the real cape. Someone else's cape. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5509.9s)]
*  Yeah, like because I when I hunt, a lot of people know that I don't use European mounts. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5512.9s)]
*  So they'll say, oh, would you like to donate your cape? [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5518.9s)]
*  I'm like, sure. Let's preserve the cape. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5522.9s)]
*  So if someone needs a cape, because like sometimes a hunter will fuck the cape up or they'll fall down a mountain or something like that. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5525.9s)]
*  Yeah, but I just don't get it. It looks it's a statue. That's not the animal I shot. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5530.9s)]
*  Yeah, I get it. Like where you're you're recreating this image in your mind. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5536.9s)]
*  Like that's what he looked like when he's coming to the trees. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5541.9s)]
*  But don't you have a photo in your head? Yeah, no, I'm with you on it, man. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5544.9s)]
*  And it's crazy because I do like some of these taxidermists are pretty they're so good. Amazing. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5548.9s)]
*  They do. It's an art form. You know, they do a phenomenal job. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5554.9s)]
*  You know, I just don't want to I just don't want to maintain them anymore. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5558.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like maintain them and drag them around when I move. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5563.9s)]
*  Right. And then my kids and they inherit them. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5566.9s)]
*  They're just going to throw them in the, you know, the dump or something. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5568.9s)]
*  Right. Right. Right. That is a weird like some people have trophy rooms. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5572.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Where their entire room is filled with these animals like a sheep that's on fake rock. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5577.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Looking around. Yeah. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5584.9s)]
*  Dude, I'll admit when I when if I go somewhere and somebody has one of those, [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5586.9s)]
*  I like walking around it with them. Yeah. Tell me. Tell me all the stories about all the hunts. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5591.9s)]
*  I just don't want one. I just don't want to. Yeah, I'm not interested in that. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5595.9s)]
*  I'm not interested in that. But I think it's kind of dope. But yeah, it's just like when you're not a hide guy. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5598.9s)]
*  No, you don't know. No bear hides. Yeah. Yeah. They're just not here. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5604.9s)]
*  They're at my house. They're actually at my house in California. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5610.9s)]
*  I if I did ever shoot a brown bear, I'd mount that motherfucker. Oh, yeah. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5613.9s)]
*  Yeah. Especially as a big one like Kodiak bear. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5618.9s)]
*  I would want that mounted because that's like come on. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5621.9s)]
*  My brother's got one in his like financial office, which nowadays is like totally like you're not not politically correct. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5624.9s)]
*  But when you walk in there, they got a big they got a big interior. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5632.9s)]
*  Well, you want to know but fight off the bear market. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5635.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's it's very controversial, but it's you know, it's controversial with people that don't understand it. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5641.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's really what it is. And it's controversial with people that don't understand ecosystems. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5649.9s)]
*  They don't understand. I mean, a lot of me actually meat. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5654.9s)]
*  This is the craziest thing that the people that don't eat meat that don't like hunting or that excuse me that eat meat rather and don't like hunting. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5658.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's that's strange. You know, it is. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5667.9s)]
*  It's very strange to me. And I think a lot of the topics we're talking about, Joe, it's just a reflection of like this distance between the reality of being a human and the distance that we've put in between. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5671.9s)]
*  Yeah, I was having this discussion. You know, you could go. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5684.9s)]
*  If you go behind any any fancy steakhouse, like you go behind Gibson's in Chicago's or in Eris, you need Gibson's in Chicago. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5687.9s)]
*  One of these like fancy steakhouses or somewhere in Manhattan. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5696.9s)]
*  And you went if you went through the dumpster, you know, you would find like a bunch of half steaks, you know, like you find, you know, three quarters of a steak, half a steak. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5699.9s)]
*  And to me, it's like it's crazy to think about that probably a lot of people that are eating in that restaurant, they're they're probably like against hunting, but they're willing to take, you know, half a steak and throw it away. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5709.9s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. To me, that seems so like wild to think because it's like it's just ignorance. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5722.9s)]
*  I mean, they're against hunting, but they don't know what it is. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5731.9s)]
*  They've never experienced it. Yeah. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5734.9s)]
*  Or they have this version of it from movies. Yeah, which is weird because the movie version of hunters is like from the movie Wolverine. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5736.9s)]
*  Like the hunters are always the asshole. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5744.9s)]
*  That's still the case. And like in in any, you know, show that, you know, a kid show, if a hunter shows up, he's like the dick. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5747.9s)]
*  Isn't that weird that that's the case? But it's not the case with fishermen. Yeah. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5756.9s)]
*  When someone's fishing, it's always a happy thing. Hi, fishing, just casting the fish. Isn't it interesting? I don't know why that is, man. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5760.9s)]
*  Especially fly fishing. That's a gentleman. Like you never think of like a fly fisherman being an asshole. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5767.9s)]
*  It's all catch and release. That's their argument, I guess. But it isn't always. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5773.9s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's only catch and release in certain places. Yeah, certain. The catch and release thing is odd. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5777.9s)]
*  I don't really enjoy it. Yeah. I mean, I've done it, but I'm always like, what are we doing? [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5783.9s)]
*  We're just fucking with these fish. We're just fucking with these fish and we're trying to get like this weird little charge. Yeah. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5789.9s)]
*  Out of catching them. You know, it's wild, man, because since I sold my business, Joe, like I've been I literally go fishing with my kids almost every other day. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5797.9s)]
*  So are you retired now? No, well, I don't. I'm taking some time off. I'm working on. Well, I'm taking some time off, but I've actually been trying to crank on the YouTube deal. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5807.9s)]
*  You know, really, really get that. You put up some really good content and very informative. Yeah, no, I appreciate it. It's really good stuff. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5817.9s)]
*  So that's kind of like my focus. And I got some ideas that I'm going to continue to work on on that front. But like coffee. I know I'm good, man. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5824.9s)]
*  I'm good. I'm good. I mean, in fact, I need to work on this a little bit. I'm cold as fuck right now. Well, the thing is, I was my wife actually warned me before. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5832.9s)]
*  Come on here. She said don't drink a bunch of coffee because you talk too fast. Oh, really? Oh, that's funny. She's giving you advice. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5839.9s)]
*  That's so good advice. So I'll take it. I'll take it from her. That's but but anyways, man, I lost my. Oh, yeah. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5846.9s)]
*  I was telling you informative YouTube stuff. Well, yes, I'm the YouTube stuff is one of my focuses. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5853.9s)]
*  But this kind of period of time is giving me some time to, you know, go fishing. I go fishing with my kids like every other morning. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5858.9s)]
*  Where are you living these days? I'm living. Well, so I've been I've been in Puerto Rico the last four or five months. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5865.9s)]
*  I got a brother who lives there. So I've been I've been down there, you know, working on my stuff, but doing Puerto Rico. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5870.9s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. Yeah. I've I know some people that live down there. It's a it's a good place to avoid taxes for some for some folks. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5879.9s)]
*  But it's also, you know, my time spent there, Joe, it actually Puerto Rico is an interesting place. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5889.9s)]
*  Like the whole like legal structure of the place is interesting. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5897.9s)]
*  But actually, from like an outdoorsman perspective, it has like all this to me, at least like all this untapped stuff. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5901.9s)]
*  But the problem is, I'm like I'm like that from that one kids cartoon, like where the dog like sees a squirrel squirrel with outdoor stuff. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5908.9s)]
*  I'm like that man. So I'm like, oh, tarpon fishes die and then spearfish. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5916.9s)]
*  And so I tend to get like, you know, drawn every way. But when I'm there, I'm like, dude, there's so many cool outdoor stuff to go to do there. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5920.9s)]
*  I mean, I have a home there, but we were only going to stay there a couple of months. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5927.9s)]
*  We homeschool our kids and now we've been there for like six months. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5931.9s)]
*  You know, but anyways, back to the fishing part of it, man, I didn't mean to get sidetracked is what's crazy with the catcher and release thing. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5934.9s)]
*  Like my little boy, he he cannot believe that we would release anything like he's right because it's not normal. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5943.9s)]
*  Yeah, he's like he like, yeah, he looks at like your reaction to people's his reaction to like, I mean, a lot of time and we keep a lot of them, you know, little snappers and stuff. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5951.9s)]
*  They cook them. They like to do the whole process. But he cannot believe, man, like I'm like, all right, we got to turn this one back. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5960.9s)]
*  And he's like, why? You know, what are you talking about? [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5967.9s)]
*  And then he tries to negotiate with me and he's like, like right before I put it back, he'll be like, dad, can we use it for bait? [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5970.9s)]
*  That's hilarious. That's hilarious. Well, I think it's just normal human instincts, right? [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5978.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like, well, we're doing this. We're doing is the point. Yeah. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5984.9s)]
*  What are we out here for? You just fucking with these fish, which is basically what fly fishermen are doing. Right. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5988.9s)]
*  The barbless hooks. They're just out there fucking with fish. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5994.9s)]
*  Do they're I've heard you talk about it on this podcast, man. They're all after that feeling. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=5997.9s)]
*  You know, like there's that that like primal primal feeling. Yeah. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6002.9s)]
*  You go from a fish, man. But you can sneak up on people and shoot them with a suction cup. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6006.9s)]
*  People would do it. Yeah. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6011.9s)]
*  If you knew you could just like, I got you, bitch. Yeah. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6013.9s)]
*  No one gets hurt. It's what people like. Do you feel like you get that from that? [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6016.9s)]
*  Like a you think do you feel like the feeling like when a bull comes in when you're archery hunting or you make your archery shot on a bull elk? [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6021.9s)]
*  Do you feel like you get a similar feeling than you do? [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6028.9s)]
*  Like when you're like a related feeling when you're fishing? [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6031.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very minor version of the bull elk feeling when you're fishing. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6034.9s)]
*  Yeah. When you're fishing, you get a who was this night? Oh, I got one. I got one. I got one. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6039.9s)]
*  Got a good one. It's fun. It's very exciting. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6043.9s)]
*  I love fishing with my kids because I love that they can catch something and then they can cook it. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6045.9s)]
*  And, you know, we can we can eat something that they got. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6052.9s)]
*  Like my daughter caught a wahoo when we were in Hawaii. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6055.9s)]
*  It was like one of the first times she ever caught like a really good sized fish. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6059.9s)]
*  She's caught like at the time. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6063.9s)]
*  This was like quite a few years back when she was I guess she was like five or six. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6066.9s)]
*  She had caught like a couple of like little snappers and stuff like that, like deep sea fishing, just dropping a line down way low. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6071.9s)]
*  But this was the first like really good sized fish she caught. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6079.9s)]
*  She was so proud. And so when we were eating, you know, we're like, thank you for catching this. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6082.9s)]
*  You caught our dinner. She's like, all you people are eating because of me. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6087.9s)]
*  It was fun. You know, it's like it's exciting. Yeah, of course. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6090.9s)]
*  You get that little charge out of catching a fish. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6094.9s)]
*  But a bull elk is that times 10 times 100 times a thousand. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6098.9s)]
*  It's it's not even Derek Wolf said it best. He was talking about Sack and Tom Brady. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6104.9s)]
*  He's like, it's not even close. Yeah, it's like Sack and Tom Brady's fun. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6109.9s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. But it's not even close to shooting a bull elk. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6112.9s)]
*  And I'm like, that's I'm so glad he said that because that's how I feel about it. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6116.9s)]
*  People say, you know, they ask me, God, you do so many exciting things. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6120.9s)]
*  You do stand up. You host the UFC, you know, all these different things you've done in your life. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6123.9s)]
*  You used to fight. What's the most exciting? [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6127.9s)]
*  I'm like, bow hunting elk is about as heart pounding. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6130.9s)]
*  Yeah, as exciting as possible. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6134.9s)]
*  When you're hiding behind a tree and you're at full draw and you see the tips of those antlers [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6137.9s)]
*  moving through the brush and you know he's about to make it into the opening. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6142.9s)]
*  Yeah. And you're like, holy shit. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6147.9s)]
*  You're at full draw, just sitting there. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6149.9s)]
*  And then he comes in there and then the arrow releases and you want I use a Lumenok. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6152.9s)]
*  So you see nocturnal. You see that green knock just sending it right through the Golden Triangle. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6157.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's the greatest feeling in the world. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6163.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And knowing that you're going to eat that thing in the smell of the fucking burning wood [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6167.9s)]
*  and the searing mean, I could smell it right now. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6173.9s)]
*  It's the best food in the world, too. I mean, I prefer it over everything. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6178.9s)]
*  I mean, yeah, elk is my favorite. I really like Neil Guy. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6183.9s)]
*  I shot a Neil Guy recently is very good. Very good. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6186.9s)]
*  But elk is the best. I think it's the best. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6190.9s)]
*  Axis is pretty goddamn good, too. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6194.9s)]
*  Axis. Yeah. You had Axis? Yeah. You know, I had it. Oh, the Maui. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6197.9s)]
*  Yeah. They're the guys. They say that to me. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6203.9s)]
*  Was it called Maui Nui? Maui Nui. Yeah. Is that it? [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6205.9s)]
*  Yeah. I think Maui Nui Venison. I'm sorry if I'm butchering it. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6209.9s)]
*  But I actually Peter T is one of the owners that we should probably say the name of it. Right. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6214.9s)]
*  Is that what it's right? Is it Maui Nui? That is it. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6219.9s)]
*  That's a great system that they have. So you can buy wild actual wild game from Maui. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6222.9s)]
*  And it actually helps. There it is. Maui Nui. It actually they've sent me a bunch of it. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6228.9s)]
*  They have really good bone broth, too. But the beautiful thing about it is that it's they need to get rid of these. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6232.9s)]
*  They're an it's an invasive species and they have so many of them. Yeah. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6239.9s)]
*  So it helps. It helps everybody. It helps the environment of Maui. Sure. And it's fantastic food. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6243.9s)]
*  I interviewed I believe his name is Jake, who runs it. I interviewed him on Jay Scott's podcast, actually. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6249.9s)]
*  And, dude, it's amazing to hear the rundown on like the process of how they kill them. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6257.9s)]
*  You know, because they have like they've like I don't mean I don't want to get like the depths of it because I'll butcher it. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6262.9s)]
*  But if I recall, you know, they essentially go in the field and they have a mobile like, you know, USDA approved system that they they put it through. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6268.9s)]
*  It's pretty crazy, man. Like I talked to him about just like the the marksmanship component they went into it because they have to kill them all by hitting them in the skull cap. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6278.9s)]
*  Even though they're wild deer, you know, but part of the whole the whole great arrangement. Yeah. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6288.9s)]
*  Yeah, they have to die instantly. And it's it's pretty amazing what what round they use. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6295.9s)]
*  And I want to say I want to say he said three oh eight. OK. And so they are they shooting them at night. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6299.9s)]
*  Yeah. So they shoot them at night and they use they use thermals. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6306.9s)]
*  But my understanding is they cannot use they can't use suppressors because because of Hawaii gun laws, I believe. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6312.9s)]
*  Oh, that's so dumb, which is like wild. Yeah. It doesn't make any the suppressor thing is so dumb. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6321.9s)]
*  It's like people watch too many James Bond movies. I know because they're I mean, they're great. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6327.9s)]
*  They protect your fucking ears. Yeah. And it's the round still just as lethal. Yeah. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6332.9s)]
*  And as long as you zero it in right, it's still just as accurate. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6336.9s)]
*  I loved him. I loved him as a guy because, you know, muzzle breaks became so popular in the last like 15 years. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6340.9s)]
*  And they do they they take out so much recoil. But but man, dude, if you get if you get a guy, if you don't if you forget one time to have ears, ears covered. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6347.9s)]
*  Yeah. Buddy, my losses hearing because he the hunter threw the rifle up to take an offhand shot and he was up by the muzzle. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6356.9s)]
*  Yeah. He was off to the side of it and he lost his hearing. Yeah. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6364.9s)]
*  His hearing aids. Yeah. It takes one time. Yeah. One. Yeah. It is interesting how it works, though, isn't it? [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6367.9s)]
*  You know that this just having that that compensator at the end of the rifle barrel sure releases all the gases out the sides and all the sound and actually kicks less. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6373.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And it takes a ton. I mean, a lot of these big difference. Yeah. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6384.9s)]
*  Particularly these like light rifles guys are shooting on these in doing these mountain hunts and stuff. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6387.9s)]
*  I mean, you can't hardly you can't hardly shoot them accurately over time unless you suck a bunch of the recoil out of them. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6392.9s)]
*  You just get so people get so you know, they just train themselves so well. Yeah. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6401.9s)]
*  Yeah. But, you know, can you get some of that out with like good training? [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6406.9s)]
*  Yeah. I think like like the guy you talked to Turner. Yeah. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6411.9s)]
*  I think I think guys, if they really embrace that system, right system and go through the nitty gritty of it, they can. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6415.9s)]
*  When you were guiding was like archery hunting, was that like the most sketchy? [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6424.9s)]
*  Like, hey, man, like, let me see you shoot. Yeah. You know, because there's so many people, I think, that pick up their bow like two weeks before elk season and shoot it 20 yards a few times. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6429.9s)]
*  Like, oh, we're good. Yeah. You know, I mean, outside of I don't want to just pick on archery in this respect. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6441.9s)]
*  I mean, I think goes for all hunting is I think if you're not exposed to, you know, I guess, you know, hunting slash like death a lot, you don't realize that how messy it can get. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6448.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? And that goes for guns and and archery equipment. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6459.9s)]
*  And yeah, if I was being honest, I I would rather guide a guy with a gun, you know, just because just because the all the situations over. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6464.9s)]
*  And, you know, I mean, I've guided a lot. I had a lot of guides working for me. So it's a it's a lot of numbers. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6477.9s)]
*  It's not like everyday occurrence. But you get into those situations where something gets hurt. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6482.9s)]
*  And I'm talking like, you know, you can you could be following stuff for days, you know, trying to get it killed. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6487.9s)]
*  And, you know, and it's once you expose that enough, enough, you become like you just you just want it. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6494.9s)]
*  You want everything to be right. You know what I mean? [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6502.9s)]
*  And the reality is, if you've as a hunter, it keeps you from taking sketchy shots. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6504.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6510.9s)]
*  Where people just hope it works out. Yeah. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6511.9s)]
*  It's one thing Joel Turner talks about. It's like you should never hope a shot works out. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6514.9s)]
*  You should be sure. Like when you are releasing that arrow, like he's so precise in his language. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6518.9s)]
*  Right. When you're releasing that arrow, you you absolutely know that arrow is going to hit its mark. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6524.9s)]
*  Yeah. Because you've trained for it. The the thing about all of it is that until you experience it, you really don't know. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6529.9s)]
*  It's it's one of those things where people think they can keep it together. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6539.9s)]
*  I kind of equate it to like a fight because a lot of people think like, oh, man, if I get in a fight, don't worry about me, bro. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6544.9s)]
*  I know how to fight. But the reality is like in an actual physical confrontation, if you don't have any experience in it, [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6552.9s)]
*  you're going to freak out. You're going to your heart rate is going to go through. Your heart rate is going to go through the roof. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6558.9s)]
*  You're going to gas out almost instantly. You're going to full panic. You're going to have tunnel vision. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6562.9s)]
*  It's like you need to experience that just to understand what it is to say that you can be calm in that situation. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6567.9s)]
*  Yeah. And like you were talking about the heart the heart thump in these situations. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6576.9s)]
*  I mean, you'll feel like your heart's going to blow out your chest. Oh, yeah. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6580.9s)]
*  And I've I've guided people who, you know, that, you know, adults, you know, they're you know, they seem like competent, competent guys. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6584.9s)]
*  And there's so much pressure around a shot opportunity or at least they're manifesting it around him. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6593.9s)]
*  Like, you know, you've been in the mountains, you've been, you know, you're on a backpack, you know, sheep hunter, something for six, seven days. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6598.9s)]
*  And if there's a bunch of money involved, a bunch of time involved, and then the guy gets a shot opportunity, it's there's so much pressure. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6605.9s)]
*  And there's like at that moment and then boom, the gun goes off. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6612.9s)]
*  And I always the first question I always ask because it tells me a whole lot about, you know, what probably happened. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6615.9s)]
*  I always ask a hunter, how did it feel? [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6622.9s)]
*  You know, that's my first question to a hunter. Right. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6625.9s)]
*  Because that'll tell me a lot about, you know, what what's going on. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6627.9s)]
*  And I can several times I've had a guy go, I wish I wouldn't have shot. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6630.9s)]
*  And I'm like, why? Like, why did you shoot? [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6635.9s)]
*  And the only thing I can anxiety. Yeah. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6638.9s)]
*  It's just panic. They're over. Yeah. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6641.9s)]
*  And it's crazy. It's like, yeah. Why did you shoot? [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6643.9s)]
*  Well, do you ever have a conversation with them before that about that? [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6646.9s)]
*  And tell them, like, do not shoot unless you're ready. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6649.9s)]
*  There's going to be a thing. Oh, yeah. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6652.9s)]
*  Because because my deal is like and this is a very basic way to look at it. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6655.9s)]
*  And I'm sure Joel would have a more sophisticated way for people have time to go through the process. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6660.9s)]
*  But I always tell guys with rifle hunting, if you don't work the first, [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6665.9s)]
*  the primary thing you have to do is you have to get a good rest in the mount. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6670.9s)]
*  Yeah. You know, with that's like key. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6674.9s)]
*  That's the beauty of rifle hunting over bow hunting. Yeah. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6676.9s)]
*  Is that with a good rest and if you're prone in particular, like, God, I'm reasonably certain I'm going to hit that animal every time. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6679.9s)]
*  Yeah. And that's that's that's what I like in the discussion I have is like, look, [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6688.9s)]
*  first thing we're going to do is going to get a good rest. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6692.9s)]
*  And then if you cannot keep the crosshairs within a defined vital area that we're talking about, [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6695.9s)]
*  don't you tell me and we're going to move your rest to get you a better rest, adjust your rest, [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6701.9s)]
*  maybe go from your pack back to your bipod, something like that, or we're going to get closer. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6705.9s)]
*  But please do not shoot in a lot of some of that's practical. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6711.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yeah. Like I don't want to track my ass around looking for those those rams now that they're hauling ass over. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6714.9s)]
*  You know, you know, to the experience of the person that you're doing it with. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6721.9s)]
*  Right. But it's also but it's also I don't want one to get hurt in it to go, you know, [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6725.9s)]
*  it to become, you know, a negative experience for everybody. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6730.9s)]
*  You know, the animal hunting to me is a fascinating thing because it's these weird rich guys that spend so much money. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6734.9s)]
*  And to people for people that don't know, I was trying to explain this to someone the other day and they they were incredulant. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6742.9s)]
*  They're like, what? I go, it's hundreds of thousands of dollars. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6748.9s)]
*  Yeah, governor tax. They'll go, shut the fuck up. Yeah. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6752.9s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of dollars people spend to go and just hunt a bighorn sheep. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6755.9s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, my take on it, you know, I've guided quite a few of the hunts and it. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6762.9s)]
*  So one thing about is actually fairly it's actually fairly small community like sheep hunters. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6768.9s)]
*  There's actually not that many of them. But the thing about it is as a as a wildlife resource, [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6774.9s)]
*  they're also not all that abundant. So I think if I was being totally honest, I would say that part of the whole, [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6780.9s)]
*  you know, the whole like sheik of the whole thing is just that it's scarce. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6787.9s)]
*  Not everybody can have it. Right. Right. Right. Because, you know, sheep hunt, [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6792.9s)]
*  a Rocky Mountain bighorn hunt is not that different than a high country mule deer hunt in a lot of ways, you know. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6798.9s)]
*  But the and obviously just there's a species difference. Right. Well, the Alaska ones are pretty wild. Yeah. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6804.9s)]
*  Yeah. Like the doll, the doll, doll sheep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6810.9s)]
*  It's like people are literally risking their lives. Oh, yeah. Sure. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6813.9s)]
*  That's the species where people die the most. Right. They fall off cliffs. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6816.9s)]
*  So it might be by volume in terms of my experience. Mountain goat hunting is the worst by far. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6820.9s)]
*  Same kind of a situation. Yeah. But the thing is, you know, Joe, mountain goats, they they were the sheep stop. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6826.9s)]
*  Mountain goats start. You know what I mean? Dude, I cannot tell you how many times I've sat on goats just and been like, [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6833.9s)]
*  we're not there's no way we're going to kill them there because there's no way we'll get them. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6840.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? And then and then in I was actually talking to one of my guides about a week ago about it. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6843.9s)]
*  And he's like, Cliff, you know, there's like there's three times that I felt like there was a chance of me dying. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6850.9s)]
*  In my lifetime. And two of them when I was guiding mountain goats for you. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6855.9s)]
*  It's just they live in the steepest shit you can imagine, man. Yeah. And I love them, dude. They're cool. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6860.9s)]
*  They are cool. They're way cool. The way they can move off on insanely steep edges. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6865.9s)]
*  Oh, blow your mind. Yeah. Like do they they have like flexible hooves? Like, yeah. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6872.9s)]
*  So they have a grip. Yeah. Their foot. It's a it's wider. There you go. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6878.9s)]
*  Look at them. Look at this motherfucker. Yeah. These are these I believe it's not. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6883.9s)]
*  I think that's a type of type of Ibex. Ibex. Yeah. But same stuff. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6888.9s)]
*  Look at that. Yeah. What in the fuck is happening here? [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6893.9s)]
*  Like if I saw a man doing that, I'd be like, dude, get down. Please don't do this. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6896.9s)]
*  Don't fucking do it. Like this thing just knows how to do it. Yeah. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6900.9s)]
*  But why is it not scared of heights? Like what what has genetic? Yeah, there's that's a. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6904.9s)]
*  That's a mountain goat. Mountain goats are beautiful. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6912.9s)]
*  They're stunning. They're so beautiful that that look at that. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6915.9s)]
*  That guy's like holding it with his face. That's so crazy that they do that. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6918.9s)]
*  Yeah. They literally walk up the side of a fucking that looks like a like a dam. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6922.9s)]
*  That one might be. Oh, hi. How are you doing? What's going on? [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6927.9s)]
*  Just chilling over here. See if you can find the white mountain goats. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6932.9s)]
*  Yeah, there's a bunch of pictures there. They're so beautiful, man. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6936.9s)]
*  Look at that. Go back to that photo you just had. Look at that photo. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6939.9s)]
*  That's so beautiful. Oh, yeah. They're way cool, man. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6942.9s)]
*  How delicious are they? They're good. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6945.9s)]
*  They're not my favorite game meat, but they're they're pretty good. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6948.9s)]
*  That's where I'm out. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6951.9s)]
*  I'm only interested in hunting things that I really want to eat. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6954.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. The primary shot of have a Lena recently and I had to convert it into chorizo. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6956.9s)]
*  I was going to try it this morning, but I got up late. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6962.9s)]
*  I never tried it, but I haven't heard great things, man. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6964.9s)]
*  Well, the guys at the at the ranch that I'm at say if you turn it into chorizo, it's actually very good. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6967.9s)]
*  It's pretty good. Yeah. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6972.9s)]
*  We'll say we're going to find out tomorrow because it's supposed to be my breakfast this morning, but I got up late. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6973.9s)]
*  Oh, I got you. Yeah. But no, mountain goats are I mean, they're there. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6979.9s)]
*  I wouldn't I just they're not going to rank up with like elk to me. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6983.9s)]
*  Right. Yeah. So that's why I'm out. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6986.9s)]
*  It's like they run out of elk, which may happen in Colorado. Yeah. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6989.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Who knows? Yeah. Well, Colorado has more more excuse more elk than I think any other state. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=6994.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. By by by quite a bit. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7001.9s)]
*  And in terms of hunting opportunity, you know, because I have so much over the counter stuff, which is starting to change a little bit. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7004.9s)]
*  It's way more than other than other states for now. Yeah, exactly. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7011.9s)]
*  Actually, back to our. Yeah. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7015.9s)]
*  Back to what we were talking about on that man, because I I didn't I I don't think I did a great job of explaining myself the Yellowstone deal in that video. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7018.9s)]
*  What I was getting at, Joe, is that people don't realize that when Yellowstone originally had a problem with the elk, they were sending all these elk out as transplants. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7028.9s)]
*  So that was a way to actually control the population in Yellowstone. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7038.9s)]
*  I see. And then the the Rangers in the 60s, they were actually shooting them to them. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7042.9s)]
*  You know, they were shooting them to suppress the population. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7048.9s)]
*  And they actually what happened in the early 60s, they had like massive controversy on the park. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7051.9s)]
*  And this is all documented. I'm a nerd. So I've read the history of it. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7060.9s)]
*  But they wanted to have a hunt on the park to do exactly what this video claims the Wolfs did in the 90s. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7063.9s)]
*  There was a lot of discussion in the 60s of having, you know, you know, like a draw or whatever and getting a bunch of hunters on the park to solve the range issue. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7072.9s)]
*  You can see what happened was they quit transplanting the elk off of it because everywhere, you know, they didn't need to. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7082.9s)]
*  Nobody wanted the elk. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7087.9s)]
*  So the elk started to to do some damage to the range there. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7089.9s)]
*  So one of the one of the proposals was to have a hunt on in Yellowstone, you know, maybe just a temporary one or whatever to dissipate the elk. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7093.9s)]
*  And one of the main reasons it didn't happen is that the park officials and then I know there's some push from Washington is they didn't want the elk to not be habituated to people. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7102.9s)]
*  They in the 60s, it's documented that one of the reasons they didn't have hunters in there is they wanted the elk to be comfortable with people. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7114.9s)]
*  So to me and people listening may not find this interesting, but to me, it's like a total bastardization of history. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7122.9s)]
*  Right. It's like, look, you're saying that the Wolfs did what they did in Yellowstone. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7130.9s)]
*  And yeah, they probably you know, they did help because there was way too many wolves or way too many elk, particularly in those valleys and stuff. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7135.9s)]
*  And they were hurting the range. But saying that that it was attempted to do with human intervention and it failed is a total lie. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7142.9s)]
*  Well, also, there's there's a lot of value in taking those elk from there and like moving them to Kentucky and Pennsylvania and all those places where they've repopulated elk. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7150.9s)]
*  Because elk used to be in basically every state. Right. Right. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7163.9s)]
*  In the plains. There's a lot of there's a lot. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7168.9s)]
*  What do you think about that American Prairie Reserve situation? [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7170.9s)]
*  I'm not you know, I'm not super familiar with familiar with it. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7173.9s)]
*  But my understanding is it's basically trying to to are they are they directly buying up a bunch of private land? [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7177.9s)]
*  They're doing block management on it. They're they're buying up all this land and they want to convert it into this. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7183.9s)]
*  But they're going to allow hunting on it. Yeah. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7190.9s)]
*  I mean, they're going to turn it to this wild area with bison and, you know, pronghorn and everything. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7192.9s)]
*  And it's like they have this design to sort of rewild that. But in a way with, you know, undulates. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7199.9s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I think all that all that stuff to me is a good idea. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7206.9s)]
*  As long as that we rewild it and it makes sense in a way that, you know, hunters or people can still utilize it. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7210.9s)]
*  Yes. I don't think it's so weird, Joe, because I don't I think sometimes we forget that it's not like we're well, maybe who knows? [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7221.9s)]
*  But it's not like we're aliens. Like we're part of the ecosystem, too, man. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7228.9s)]
*  You know, we are. And we don't think of ourselves as so far removed. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7231.9s)]
*  We're so smart. We want we want to pretend that right. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7235.9s)]
*  We're different. Yeah. Yeah. We shouldn't kill. We want to kill every day. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7238.9s)]
*  Do that. That's exactly. Isn't that the crazy thing? [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7242.9s)]
*  Like the stake in the garbage. Yeah. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7246.9s)]
*  But like everybody thinks that, oh, because Joe Rogan, here's there's a picture of him with a dead elk that somehow that's different than somebody who indirectly still just lives their life and consumes. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7248.9s)]
*  Right. Yeah, it's just ignorance. It's all. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7262.9s)]
*  Yes. It's like I I would tell those people, hey, come hunting with me, but I don't want them to imagine if like you're at full draw and they're like, get away. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7264.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, that's a year worth of meat to me. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7276.9s)]
*  You fucking idiot. Not be good. Yeah. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7282.9s)]
*  But it's it's just a lack of understanding. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7284.9s)]
*  And it's so difficult to truly understand unless you've experienced it. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7287.9s)]
*  You know, I'm very grateful that Steve Rinella took me out the first time. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7291.9s)]
*  You know, I did it with my friend Brian Callan from Meat Eater. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7295.9s)]
*  We went mule deer hunting. Yeah. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7298.9s)]
*  And it was so much harder than I ever thought it was going to be. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7300.9s)]
*  And it was so much more interesting than I thought it was going to be. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7305.9s)]
*  And then the also there's a thing that ignites inside of you, very similar to the fishing thing where you catch a fish like, oh, there's a thing when you're stalking an animal that your your brain goes, oh, yeah, I know what this is. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7307.9s)]
*  We've done this before. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7323.9s)]
*  Like, this is there's like a pathway in the mind that exists for that. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7324.9s)]
*  Like, this is how you acquire meat. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7328.9s)]
*  And there's an excitement to it because you're going to be able to feed your family. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7330.9s)]
*  So when I brought that meat back home and I was cooking it and I fed my family with this deer that I met that I ate. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7334.9s)]
*  Oh, I decided that day. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7340.9s)]
*  Like, I remember I was cooking with Rinella. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7343.9s)]
*  We were eating the mule deer like over the fire. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7347.9s)]
*  And and we were talking about I said, I'm doing this forever. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7349.9s)]
*  Yeah, I'm doing this now. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7353.9s)]
*  Sure. This is my new thing. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7355.9s)]
*  Yeah, I'm like, I'm doing it. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7357.9s)]
*  And he was laughing. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7358.9s)]
*  Yeah, he loved it. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7359.9s)]
*  He loved it that he converted me because Callan never really got converted. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7360.9s)]
*  He kind of he'll hunt with me and hunt occasionally. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7363.9s)]
*  But I fucking block off time. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7366.9s)]
*  Yeah, you got hunting. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7368.9s)]
*  And it's like, that's a primary part of my diet. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7371.9s)]
*  I eat deer meat all the time. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7374.9s)]
*  I did the UFC last weekend when John Jones fought Daniel Cormier, who's my commentator next to me. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7376.9s)]
*  And he's a good friend of mine. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7384.9s)]
*  I always would bring him snacks because I could bring him like there's this company called Carnivore Snacks. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7385.9s)]
*  They make these like delicious. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7393.9s)]
*  OK, so I'll bring them beef jerky. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7395.9s)]
*  And this time I brought him deer sausage. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7397.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7399.9s)]
*  And he's like, man, I can't eat deer because I ate bad deer once. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7400.9s)]
*  I eat deer. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7403.9s)]
*  And I was like a second ago, just try a little piece of the summer sausage. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7404.9s)]
*  Just try. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7407.9s)]
*  Oh, shit, this is good. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7408.9s)]
*  So he started talking about it on the air. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7410.9s)]
*  He's like, Joe's got me deer sausage. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7411.9s)]
*  So in the middle of one of the fights, he's talking about like me feeding a deer sausage. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7413.9s)]
*  Sure. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7420.9s)]
*  Well, dude, I can tell you, in my business, Joe, I mean, I'm sure you know this, but you're talking about your little inner circle. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7421.9s)]
*  You actually created like a like a like a trend within hunting. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7428.9s)]
*  I could. So I would have guys call me, you know, like three, four years ago. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7433.9s)]
*  And it would always be kind of the same story like they're new. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7438.9s)]
*  They're they're 35 years old and they're into, you know, maybe they're Jiu Jitsu guys or something. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7441.9s)]
*  And just talking to them, having a conversation with them, but they want to come do their first elk hunt. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7448.9s)]
*  And I like and I would always ask like, dude, like what got you into it is always you, man. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7452.9s)]
*  Like you started like this mega trend. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7457.9s)]
*  It was kind of like I could almost identify my clients. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7459.9s)]
*  I was like, oh, yeah, like I know that those guys, they probably got like their influence or their motivation from you. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7461.9s)]
*  So it was it's it's pretty wild to see, you know. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7467.9s)]
*  Well, I feel like the more people that get into it, there's a lot of people that don't like that. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7470.9s)]
*  They don't like that the trailheads are full. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7475.9s)]
*  They don't like that there's a lot of people out there wandering around. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7477.9s)]
*  But you can't think like that. You can't think that way. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7480.9s)]
*  Those are allies. You need those people. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7482.9s)]
*  You need more people that understand what it is. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7485.9s)]
*  And to think differently, I think is very selfish and very stupid and foolhardy. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7487.9s)]
*  I think you have to think about the small amount of people that hunt. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7491.9s)]
*  I don't even know what it what is the percentage of Americans who hunt regularly. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7497.9s)]
*  Oh, I know. I guess I want to say it's three percent. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7503.9s)]
*  I don't even think it's three. I'm going to guess it's less than three who hunt regularly. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7507.9s)]
*  I mean, I don't regularly. Yeah, it's probably different metrics that we could apply. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7513.9s)]
*  But it's very small. Yeah. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7516.9s)]
*  And I do understand. What's the saying? [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7519.9s)]
*  Fifteen million licenses. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7522.9s)]
*  Fifteen million hunting licenses were issued. US population that year. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7524.9s)]
*  So four point six percent. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7527.9s)]
*  Yeah, but you're probably right. I bet you that less than half of them really hunt regularly. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7529.9s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, regularly. But that's still OK. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7534.9s)]
*  Four point six percent of the US population was issued a hunting license that year. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7537.9s)]
*  And that's 2020. I think I'm responsible for one percent. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7541.9s)]
*  Yeah, I bet you are, man. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7545.9s)]
*  Now, I can tell you this from individuals that started hunting that are that are older than 25 [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7548.9s)]
*  and didn't have like a father that hunted or a family that hunted. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7556.9s)]
*  You're responsible for way more than one percent of that. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7559.9s)]
*  That's hilarious. But listen, if those people can do it and be successful, they'll experience what I've experienced. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7562.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And you know, there's also the argument like, oh, you know, you're wealthy. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7568.9s)]
*  You can experience things differently. You get to go places other people can go. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7572.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. So I don't know what to tell you. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7575.9s)]
*  Will you not be wealthy? Like, shut the fuck up. Just stop making excuses. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7578.9s)]
*  It's not really relevant. You know what I mean? [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7583.9s)]
*  It's not relevant. And also there's plenty of opportunities for people that aren't wealthy. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7585.9s)]
*  Well, that's the thing, man. If you're in the US from a hunting perspective, [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7589.9s)]
*  regardless of like your economic situation, you got the best opportunities on the hunting front. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7594.9s)]
*  There's nothing like it. There's nothing like it in the rest of the world. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7600.9s)]
*  I mean, the New Zealanders got some some great opportunities, too. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7602.9s)]
*  It's just a little bit different. But here it's like, I mean, it's like you said, [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7606.9s)]
*  like, you know, it's probably the most economical hunting situation I think there is in the world. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7611.9s)]
*  If you're an American, Texas is not the best. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7615.9s)]
*  Texas is it's great if you have money because there's all these private ranches. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7618.9s)]
*  But Texas is like 90 something percent private land. Right. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7623.9s)]
*  And neighborhoods with deer. Yeah. If you're a jackass. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7626.9s)]
*  It's like I keep an eye on the deer in my neighborhood in case shit goes down. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7631.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Because there's so many of them. They're fucking everywhere, man. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7634.9s)]
*  They're everywhere because the mountain lions out here are basically like coyotes. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7637.9s)]
*  You see a mountain lion, you just shoot it. Right. Which is interesting. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7642.9s)]
*  Yeah. It's coming from California where you go to jail. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7645.9s)]
*  Yeah. Different way they different where they manage them. This is better. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7648.9s)]
*  Yeah. Do you have any interest in hunting lions? I do. Yeah. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7651.9s)]
*  I'd like to eat one of them. They're there. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7654.9s)]
*  You know, you talk about like the heart, the heart thump. Oh, yeah. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7656.9s)]
*  Oh, man. Sure. When I got into hunting them, Joe, like when you know, you know, [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7660.9s)]
*  dogs got dogs have one treat or in a cave or something like that and you're and you're making your way up there [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7664.9s)]
*  and you it'll make your heart it'll make your heart blow out. I can imagine. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7670.9s)]
*  And even, you know, I love going and just taking pictures of them. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7674.9s)]
*  Like I got a bunch of pictures on my phone of just me, me like selfies, [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7678.9s)]
*  just me being a jackass with a lion up here in the tree, you know, or whatever. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7682.9s)]
*  The the thing that's interesting to me is also the pushback on the dogs. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7686.9s)]
*  And I get that. I really do get that, especially as someone who loves dogs, because sometimes the dogs die. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7690.9s)]
*  Yeah. But the fairness aspect of it is which is interesting. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7695.9s)]
*  And that's where I think education is very important and people understanding, [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7702.9s)]
*  especially from someone who's being honest and objective about it. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7707.9s)]
*  Like I could absolutely understand why someone would say it is not fair to hunt mount lines with dogs. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7710.9s)]
*  But I will tell you that if you want to shoot a mount line, you're not going to unless you use dogs. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7718.9s)]
*  Yeah. Or unless you hunt over a dead animal that they've killed. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7724.9s)]
*  You could find it and locate it. If you think you're going to stalk a mount line, [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7728.9s)]
*  you're going to go find them and stalk them. Your odds of success are so low. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7734.9s)]
*  Right. Like you could do it for years and never see one. Right. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7739.9s)]
*  Yeah. No, that's that. I mean, it's just an effectiveness thing. Right. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7743.9s)]
*  The dogs are the in terms of managing them. Yes. You have to have you have to have dogs. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7748.9s)]
*  Now, I have known a few people and I actually would love to try it one day. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7753.9s)]
*  And I have tried a few times with without effectiveness. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7758.9s)]
*  There are a few people that will walk tracks, walk tracks out the lions like in the snow. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7761.9s)]
*  You know, they'll they'll they'll they'll they're just trying to find really fresh tracks and then they'll walk them out. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7767.9s)]
*  And I know a couple of guys who have killed lions that way. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7772.9s)]
*  But, you know, you're talking that this is a very small subset of. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7775.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's not the best way to manage their population. Right. Yeah. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7779.9s)]
*  Well, that's what's bizarre about California is they don't manage their populations with hunters. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7784.9s)]
*  They bring in mercenaries. Yeah. So greatly. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7789.9s)]
*  People don't understand. Like they kill the same amount of lions every year. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7792.9s)]
*  You know, it's so foolish. It's a it's a wild thing. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7795.9s)]
*  It seems like such a waste. Well, first of all, people let's let's explain it to people because of the Pittman Robertson Act. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7798.9s)]
*  You there's a certain percentage of hunting licenses, ammunition, all that stuff is what is it? [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7804.9s)]
*  What percentage of is it? Ten percent? I can't remember what the tax is. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7811.9s)]
*  It goes to wildlife conservation, goes to habitat preservation, goes to taking care like rangers. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7815.9s)]
*  It's like it takes care of. It's a beautiful situation. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7821.9s)]
*  It's one of the best situations in terms of like the way it's managed. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7824.9s)]
*  It's really beautiful. If you have a state like California that doesn't allow mountain lion hunting, you go, oh, well, that's good. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7828.9s)]
*  We need to preserve the mountain lion population. Incorrect. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7835.9s)]
*  They kill the same amount of mountain lions. Right. They kill them, though, with mercenaries. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7838.9s)]
*  So they bring in some guy who's a mountain lion hunter and he uses dogs and he finds these mountain lions that are troubled mountain lions. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7842.9s)]
*  And they wind up killing the same number of them. Yeah. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7849.9s)]
*  But now the state pays this guy to go do it instead of you paying the state. Right. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7852.9s)]
*  So instead of the Pittman Robertson Act applying where, you know, all this money now where all these people apply for tags, all these people get tags. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7859.9s)]
*  They go mountain lion hunting. Yeah. And that all that goes towards conservation. Yeah. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7867.9s)]
*  So you're talking about the direct tag revenue in Pittman. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7872.9s)]
*  Pittman Robertson is the tax on like guns. Yeah. Guns and stuff like that. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7875.9s)]
*  But all that stuff. Yeah. All that stuff goes in. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7879.9s)]
*  And that's in it. And it's crazy. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7881.9s)]
*  Like, and the thing is, this has come up in this wolf thing in Colorado a ton. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7884.9s)]
*  Like, I've seen public comment, public comments. Well, well, we don't we need to have if there is ever lethal control, it needs to be done by like professionals. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7887.9s)]
*  Right. It's like, what are you talking about? Who are these professionals? Are you going to know? Yeah. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7898.9s)]
*  By the way, are there any? Yeah. Well, where have they been doing all these years? [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7904.9s)]
*  He's pro wolf hunters. We can't hunt wolves. That's the thing that's so funny. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7908.9s)]
*  I guarantee you that the guys doing the lion, the lion, you know, dealing with, you know, lions that are trouble in California, they're hounds guys. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7912.9s)]
*  They're just they're guys that grew up lion hunting. Yeah. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7921.9s)]
*  And they're like, well, I'm just obsessed with this. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7924.9s)]
*  The only way I can do it is if I'm working for the state. Yes, I know a guy does it. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7927.9s)]
*  Yeah. And I'm sure he's a he's just like in the line. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7931.9s)]
*  And here's the fucked up part when there was a recent thing in the Bay Area where they did an analysis of the contents of their stomach. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7933.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's 50 percent domestic pets. Yeah. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7943.9s)]
*  It doesn't surprise me once they figured out half of their diet is your dog. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7945.9s)]
*  I talked to you know, I talked to a guy. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7950.9s)]
*  Well, his I talked to a guy's son who was involved in a very long term study of lions and what he and he was a hounds man. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7953.9s)]
*  And he followed like the same Tom's year after year. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7961.9s)]
*  Tom's just a male the term for a male lion. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7964.9s)]
*  And what they found is that what what he found and observed is whatever that lion's mom taught him to kill is usually what they would focus on. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7967.9s)]
*  So in it, which is wild to think about. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7977.9s)]
*  And I think some of these, you know, when lions are pushed up against human populations, their moms start to it's like passed down generationally. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7979.9s)]
*  Like we're going to kill pets or whatever. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7987.9s)]
*  But as it applies to more normal situations, he told me that that he would follow a Tom that they treat and call their like year after year. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7989.9s)]
*  And that Tom would only kill bull elk. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=7998.9s)]
*  He would walk through, you know, tons of mule deer and only kill bull elk. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8002.9s)]
*  Like just kill after kill, you know, for years would just be a bull elk and he might, you know, whatever. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8007.9s)]
*  And then there'd be weird ones. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8012.9s)]
*  He said like they'd be following lions and they'd find a, you know, a cat that only killed coyotes. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8014.9s)]
*  You know, you know, and maybe maybe made some exceptions sometimes, but generally knew how to kill it. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8021.9s)]
*  And, you know, they figured that out. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8026.9s)]
*  Kind of makes sense, though. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8028.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8029.9s)]
*  And I think that their mom just shows them the deal because, man, their moms, I mean, I have pictures from outfitting from cameras and stuff like that where you'd see these female lions with two kittens. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8030.9s)]
*  And if I showed them to you, you're like, dude, that's not, that's not, those aren't baby lions. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8042.9s)]
*  It's like a pride of mountain lions because they keep them with them. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8046.9s)]
*  You know, they keep their kittens with them for a couple of years sometimes where they're big. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8050.9s)]
*  Wow. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8054.9s)]
*  So I think they learn from their mom or whatever. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8055.9s)]
*  But, dude, they're fascinating. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8057.9s)]
*  Freaking cool. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8059.9s)]
*  Man, I feel the same way I feel about wolves. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8060.9s)]
*  I'm so glad they exist. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8062.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8064.9s)]
*  But I don't want to be surrounded by them. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8065.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8066.9s)]
*  Well, dude, and the thing is, is like I get what a lot of people are going to say about the wolves thing. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8068.9s)]
*  They're like, well, Cliff, Joe, you guys are being dicks because really what you want is you just want more animals to hunt and you want to suppress the wolf population because of that. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8073.9s)]
*  And yeah, part of it is that, at least, talk, speaking for myself, part of it is. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8083.9s)]
*  Yeah, every hunter would say that. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8087.9s)]
*  Part of it is that. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8088.9s)]
*  You want more opportunities. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8089.9s)]
*  You know? [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8090.9s)]
*  But there's the other point, the other point, too, man, that you said, Joe, with just if you're being rational about the economics and you just and you assume like take Colorado, you just assume, hey, this ecosystem, there's a lot of people living here. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8091.9s)]
*  There's a lot of, you know, other activities that affect the ecosystem. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8103.9s)]
*  We have to have a rational, you know, economic approach of how we're going to take care of these animals and manage them. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8106.9s)]
*  Like I just did the rough math in my brain and you take a wolf and a wolf's going to kill 10 to I think it's like I think the estimates like 12 to 18 elk per wolf per year. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8114.9s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8126.9s)]
*  And so I was doing the math like you're elk hunting in Colorado is basically the success rate on most of the units is, you know, 10 to 15 percent. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8127.9s)]
*  It's fairly low. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8136.9s)]
*  It's tough hunting. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8137.9s)]
*  You know, in these in there, I call them over the counter units and just so your listeners know that just means you can go buy a tag. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8138.9s)]
*  You don't have to put. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8144.9s)]
*  You just go to a good store. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8145.9s)]
*  It's not ration just put in tech. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8147.9s)]
*  So anyways, you got 15. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8149.9s)]
*  You got 15 percent success rate. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8151.9s)]
*  So that means if one wolf just what he eats per year, he's going to kill 15 elk. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8153.9s)]
*  That takes 100 tags that they can't sell. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8160.9s)]
*  Right. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8163.9s)]
*  Because if you if you calculate in the success rate. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8164.9s)]
*  Right. So 100 tags, I mean, I'm guessing roughly, you know, Joe, like the the the state's getting probably 300 bucks a tag. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8167.9s)]
*  Right. Between like, you know, nonresidents pay more than residents, whatever. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8176.9s)]
*  But it's like 300 bucks a tag. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8179.9s)]
*  That means that that wolf is eating 30 grand a year worth of state worth of C.P.W. revenue. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8181.9s)]
*  One wolf. One wolf. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8189.9s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and that is wild, man. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8190.9s)]
*  It's why I think about it that way about revenue. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8193.9s)]
*  You know, but it's also to think the thing that gets me more than that even is the domestic animals is cattle, sheep, all the livestock. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8195.9s)]
*  These these people that are that are running livestock, like they're fucked. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8207.9s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you're going to you're going to have to deal with a whole new situation. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8211.9s)]
*  Yeah. It's going to be a massive pain in their ass. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8215.9s)]
*  Now, they are they are going to get compensated. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8218.9s)]
*  You know, they will get compensated to the extent that they can prove it. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8221.9s)]
*  And there's a whole system that's being worked out. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8225.9s)]
*  So they'll get compensated for, you know, livestock that is killed by wolves. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8227.9s)]
*  I have a photo. Jamie, see if you can find that photo that I put up on Instagram when I was hunting with my friend, Mike Hawkridge and Ben O'Brien up in B.C. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8232.9s)]
*  Where are these wolves? We had found this moose calf right after these wolves had torn it to shreds. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8246.9s)]
*  Yeah. And it was it was amazing because there was hair everywhere. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8254.9s)]
*  That was the thing that I didn't anticipate. I was like, oh, wow. This is weird. Yeah. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8260.9s)]
*  It's fucking hair everywhere. I thought you just see like bones and they would chew the meat. Oh, yeah. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8265.9s)]
*  I was like, oh, I didn't think about the hair. They tear like tufts of it off. Yeah. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8270.9s)]
*  And it's just like just hair scattered everywhere. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8275.9s)]
*  And then these bones that were just stripped down by these wolves. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8278.9s)]
*  And we had gotten there just very shortly after it had happened. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8284.9s)]
*  Maybe, you know, maybe it happened the morning of or the night before. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8287.9s)]
*  Yeah. And they just get after it and just clean it. And they do that every fucking day. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8292.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah, man. Every day. They're constantly doing and they love it. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8297.9s)]
*  Yeah. And it's exciting. And they're fucking mean to each other, too. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8301.9s)]
*  That's the other thing. All you tree huggers, you have to know. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8304.9s)]
*  You need to watch what they do to the beta males. Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8307.9s)]
*  They tear them apart. A rough, rough existence. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8311.9s)]
*  Yeah. A guy down the totem pole a little bit. And one of those packs. Yeah. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8314.9s)]
*  You're starving plus getting that your ass kicked every day. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8318.9s)]
*  They're fucking tearing apart your hamstrings. Yeah. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8321.9s)]
*  It's like they're ruthless animals, man. That's a literal dog eat dog world. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8324.9s)]
*  Survivors, man. But imagine how good they get at it. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8329.9s)]
*  And, you know, they have all these they have these tactics and stuff. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8332.9s)]
*  I don't know how much how much of it's true or proven. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8335.9s)]
*  But I've been with guys in British Columbia. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8338.9s)]
*  Do they say they use the roads? The wolves use the roads to kill moose. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8340.9s)]
*  You know, like they'll fit because, you know, you get in areas in British Columbia [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8344.9s)]
*  that used to be real remote and then they put in logging and then logging. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8348.9s)]
*  You know, there's a bunch of logging infrastructure. Yeah. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8352.9s)]
*  And in the snow, no, can't find it. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8355.9s)]
*  I want to say it's from who else was it? [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8357.9s)]
*  Were you with? Sorry, Mike? Well, it's Mike Hawkeridge is outfitting. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8360.9s)]
*  Shout out to Mike in British Columbia. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8365.9s)]
*  That was the first time and actually the only time I ever hunted moose. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8368.9s)]
*  That's a that's a cool picture. Yeah. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8371.9s)]
*  Yeah. Eat what you kill. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8375.9s)]
*  I found the moose. Yeah. Oh, yeah. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8378.9s)]
*  That's the moose. Yeah. That's that's. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8382.9s)]
*  But there is a an image of the that was on my Instagram of the the moose calf [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8385.9s)]
*  that we found just covered in hair. It's pretty fucking cool. Yeah. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8394.9s)]
*  I could probably find it on my phone if we can't find it. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8397.9s)]
*  But it's I know what you're talking about, though, where they get the it. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8400.9s)]
*  I like the tufts of hair everywhere. It's just you just don't until you see it. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8404.9s)]
*  You're like, oh, this is happening constantly. Yeah. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8410.9s)]
*  Like, they're just a cleanup crew just burning through the forest, trying to find these animals like scanning. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8413.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. There's one. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8418.9s)]
*  Let's move circle around. Yeah. You guys get in front. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8420.9s)]
*  We'll get to the side. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's what I was talking about. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8423.9s)]
*  So and I don't know for sure this is proven or true or whatever, [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8426.9s)]
*  but the guys say that the tracks are like this. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8429.9s)]
*  These wolves will get on the logging road and like the main pack will work the logging road [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8431.9s)]
*  because it's easier in the snow. You know, there's no downfall and stuff. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8436.9s)]
*  So they'll work the road and then they'll basically cycle a couple of wolves off the road, you know, [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8441.9s)]
*  off into, you know, they'll go out into the trees and try to pick up, you know, moose or whatever out there. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8447.9s)]
*  And then and then that wolf will get tired and he'll come back to the logging road [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8453.9s)]
*  and then another one will go out. You know, pretty wild, huh? [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8456.9s)]
*  I wonder how they coordinate that. And I wonder how they pick who does what. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8460.9s)]
*  Yeah, probably instinct or I, you know, I don't know, like because they're dogs. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8464.9s)]
*  They're not like, you know, they're not capable of like communicating with each other. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8469.9s)]
*  I wonder if they're communicating with pheromones or something. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8472.9s)]
*  Maybe there's some way that we don't understand or they just it could be just instincts [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8475.9s)]
*  bred off of doing that so many times. Yeah. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8480.9s)]
*  It's just an unspoken language. What's crazy is that fish do it too. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8483.9s)]
*  Like you're talking about tarpon. You know, they do the same thing. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8487.9s)]
*  Like you'll see them, they'll they'll get around mullet and they hurt them up, you know, into into a baitball. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8490.9s)]
*  And I even notice in like marinas and stuff, they'll they'll they'll herd bait like back in a corner, you know. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8496.9s)]
*  I see them in marinas, which is crazy. These. Yeah. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8503.9s)]
*  You ever seen the there's videos of people dunking their hand in the water with a hot dog and a tarpon. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8506.9s)]
*  They get they get habituated to feeding. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8512.9s)]
*  So so they'll come they'll come to like filet tables where they're fed or, you know, places where they where they get they get fed. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8515.9s)]
*  That's so crazy. Yeah. But huge tarpon. Oh, yeah. By people's arms. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8523.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Pretty wild. It's nuts, man. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8528.9s)]
*  But they do the same thing like those those tactics. And you know what I've learned to do? [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8531.9s)]
*  Yeah. I'm going to sound like a total dork here, but I've gotten really into throwing a cast net to catch bait. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8535.9s)]
*  OK. You know, like this is like I get this cool. I get infatuated with these things. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8542.9s)]
*  So me and my little boy, like every morning at sunrise, like we're going to go catch bait to go fishing, you know. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8546.9s)]
*  So what you realize is you I get up at I call them like my little glass and points, but they're literally like my house is in a country club there, dude. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8552.9s)]
*  So I'm like cruising down on my golf cart with my cast net. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8561.9s)]
*  Like I'm the only guy in the country club that does this kind of shit, you know. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8563.9s)]
*  But anyways, we go to my little like little glass spots where we can look down the marina. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8567.9s)]
*  We can we can look on the ocean for birds or whatever work in bait. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8573.9s)]
*  But a lot of times how we find the bait is you can see the tarpon like kind of pushing them around, you know. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8577.9s)]
*  Really? Yeah. Well, then they'll get them again. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8582.9s)]
*  See, they'll get that bait like over on the side somewhere where I can throw a net on it. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8584.9s)]
*  Yeah. You know, because if it's out there and dispersed like I'm it's hard for me to net it. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8589.9s)]
*  But I went fishing in Mexico once and there was I think there were Jack Crow Valley that were they had like this swarm of them. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8594.9s)]
*  Yeah, that were attacking bait fish. And I'm telling you, it was like half a football field. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8602.9s)]
*  Yeah. He just cast into there and immediately. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8607.9s)]
*  Yeah. But they had the bait like balled up. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8610.9s)]
*  Yeah. And then they think they ball the bait up and they just whack, whack, whack, whack. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8613.9s)]
*  Yeah, they just whack them. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8617.9s)]
*  You just cast into that chaos. Oh, yeah. And you're pulling fish out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8619.9s)]
*  No, it is. It's cool how I guess I didn't mean to get off track, Joe, but I don't know how are they communicating? [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8624.9s)]
*  Right. How do they coordinate that? Yeah. Yeah. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8631.9s)]
*  You know, but maybe it has to you see the you know, the bait fish do that too. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8634.9s)]
*  Like they're somehow known to turn. Yeah. Well, that's like birds. Yeah. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8638.9s)]
*  How are they doing that? We don't we don't really understand how they don't slam into each other. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8643.9s)]
*  Yeah. People bumping each other in the street. Right. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8647.9s)]
*  Like how the birds flying in the sky. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8650.9s)]
*  Without any verbal communication. It's amazing. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8653.9s)]
*  I don't know. It's so fascinating. It's like what we don't know about nature could fill volumes. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8656.9s)]
*  Yeah. That's that's why that's why I have no interest in the metaverse. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8662.9s)]
*  Well, you're not alone apparently. It's dim really sell. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8667.9s)]
*  I thought that was an interesting moment in, you know, technological history because, you know, [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8673.9s)]
*  when you got a guy who's as influential as Mark Zuckerberg and with a giant company like Facebook, [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8679.9s)]
*  they literally changed their name to Metta. Yeah. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8684.9s)]
*  And then pump these Oculus headsets out and like this is the next level thing. Yeah. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8687.9s)]
*  And, you know, Mark came here and he gave us a demonstration of this stuff. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8693.9s)]
*  We did some things like we did a fencing game and the other amazing. Amazing. Yeah. Amazing. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8697.9s)]
*  You know, what's the most incredible dude is the boxing game. OK. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8703.9s)]
*  Boxing games are so fun. It's a great workout. Yeah. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8707.9s)]
*  Because you put the headphones on and you know that the headset rather than the headset is wireless. Right. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8710.9s)]
*  So it's just the thing that sets up to your head. And then you have these things in your hand. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8715.9s)]
*  This is the Oculus. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8719.9s)]
*  So you start the game and you you're you're in there with a guy and you hit him and you see his face snaps back. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8721.9s)]
*  Sure. And he hits you and you see like a white flash. It's crazy. And it's a really good workout. Oh, yeah. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8728.9s)]
*  It's really good workout and you could actually work on your skills. You could actually. Oh, it applies. Yeah. OK. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8733.9s)]
*  I mean, you're not hitting anything. So it's not like hitting a bag or hitting a mitts. Yeah. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8739.9s)]
*  But it's you're bobbing and weaving. You're seeing punches coming your way. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8743.9s)]
*  You're shifting and then countering. There's all this stuff that you do. Yeah. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8748.9s)]
*  That is fantastic for cardio. It's a really and it's fun. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8753.9s)]
*  It's like you're playing a game. But like we had it at the old studio and I did a couple of rounds like, [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8757.9s)]
*  I'm exhausted. And more importantly, like my feet hurt. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8762.9s)]
*  It was like, oh, yeah, you know, you're moving around. Sure. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8767.9s)]
*  Because you're like flexing your toes in a weird way because we were doing it on concrete. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8769.9s)]
*  Sure. This is why this is a great workout. I've played the the climbing game. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8775.9s)]
*  Have you played it? No. Dude, the climbing game when you fall. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8780.9s)]
*  So you're you're doing all these crazy like Yosemite climbs or whatever with the thing. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8783.9s)]
*  My brother has that game. When you fall, when you fall, it's like, oh, oh, my God. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8789.9s)]
*  Fuck that. You should do it, man. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8794.9s)]
*  Take your breath away. Like, oh, well, they had one that we did where you're walking across a balance beam. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8797.9s)]
*  Oh, OK. Two buildings. Probably similar. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8802.9s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, but yeah, the regular wild is way more interesting. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8806.9s)]
*  Yeah, man. There's just as much adventure out there. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8811.9s)]
*  But you have to be willing to actually go there, whereas you can just fucking put that on. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8815.9s)]
*  And all of a sudden you're on a mountain. What do you think? [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8820.9s)]
*  What do you think? I always contemplate this, man. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8822.9s)]
*  Like, what do you think stops people from from doing it? [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8824.9s)]
*  Like just go. Time. Yeah. Time. Lack of understanding. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8827.9s)]
*  No mentors. You know, just don't have the opportunity. Sure. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8832.9s)]
*  Then I think I think hunting in particular is like that, too, man. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8837.9s)]
*  Like the the learning curve is I don't think steep is like the right term. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8840.9s)]
*  It's just intimidating, you know, with all the regulations and all that stuff. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8844.9s)]
*  It's hard for I think it's deep. Yeah. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8849.9s)]
*  I think it's deep. And then there's also like understanding the wind. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8851.9s)]
*  Like, oh, yeah. There's so many things that aren't intuitive. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8855.9s)]
*  Like, where do you start in terms of like buying glass? [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8859.9s)]
*  Yeah. Like you mean, how many fucking podcasts are there? [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8863.9s)]
*  Like Aaron Snyder has like five of them. Yeah. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8867.9s)]
*  We're just breaking down the difference in glass quality and binos edge to edge detection and like, fuck. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8869.9s)]
*  Sure. Man, dude, in the in the technology and hunting in like just the whole the whole gear component [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8875.9s)]
*  of hunting has grown so much in a positive way in the sense that, you know, [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8882.9s)]
*  gear to go out and do a backpack hunt or something like that and, you know, [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8887.9s)]
*  pretty rough conditions where it's cold at night and all that so much easier now. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8892.9s)]
*  There's lightweight tents. Oh, yeah. There's great layers like this stuff's phenomenal. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8896.9s)]
*  Phenomenal. But at the same time, there's part of me and I and I guess for some reason [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8900.9s)]
*  this kind of theme has come out in my YouTube channel. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8906.9s)]
*  I think the whole gear infatuation about it, it kind of it intimidates people and it shouldn't. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8908.9s)]
*  Like, I hate that to be a barrier. Right. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8915.9s)]
*  Like, you don't need to spend thousands of dollars, you know, or, you know, [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8917.9s)]
*  or more than that to go on your first elk hunt. Right. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8922.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? Right. You can go do it. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8925.9s)]
*  It might not be quite as comfortable or whatever, but you don't have to have all this stuff. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8927.9s)]
*  I think what's one of the most intimidating thing is getting into archery. Oh, yeah. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8933.9s)]
*  Because like you can't just buy a bow and practice. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8937.9s)]
*  You have to go get it sized. You have to put the peep in the right place. Right. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8941.9s)]
*  You have to get arrows that match the bow. You have to get a scale that matches the rest. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8944.9s)]
*  That matches the sight. Like all of that is crazy. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8949.9s)]
*  Like how do you do that on your own? Oh, just run archers advantage software. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8953.9s)]
*  Like what? Yeah. What are you talking about? Like how many grains are your arrows? [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8957.9s)]
*  I don't fucking know. Yeah. Like imagine the average person just with zero help. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8960.9s)]
*  Yeah. And not everywhere. Not everywhere has a like a like here in Texas. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8966.9s)]
*  You guys are spoiled because you got good archery shots. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8970.9s)]
*  Oh, we have a great one in Austin. Shout out to archery country. It's fucking phenomenal. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8973.9s)]
*  Like guy like folks in there that know what they're doing. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8977.9s)]
*  I used to send my shit up to the bow rack. OK. You know, in Oregon, Springfield, Oregon. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8980.9s)]
*  Yeah. Because it's like such a good place. And that's where cams from. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8986.9s)]
*  I was like, well, they'll just send my bow there and they'll send it to me. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8990.9s)]
*  That was easy. And they get you set up. Yeah. Or Dudley. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8993.9s)]
*  I would send it to Dudley and Dudley would take care of stuff. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8995.9s)]
*  It's like for the average person, like that's not an option. So what do you do? [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=8998.9s)]
*  It's like you have to go somewhere. They have to measure your draw length. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9002.9s)]
*  You have to find out what the peep height is, you know, and then you have to practice. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9005.9s)]
*  And so you need a place to practice. And a lot of people live in apartments. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9010.9s)]
*  So how the fuck am I going to practice? Right. Yeah. Where do you go? [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9014.9s)]
*  There's a lot. A lot. Yeah. I mean, I guess that's and that answers the question. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9017.9s)]
*  Joe is like it's you almost have to in a lot of ways, if you get really into it, [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9022.9s)]
*  you must have to like shift your lifestyle. Yeah. You know what I mean? [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9026.9s)]
*  Well, I most certainly changed my lifestyle when I got into it. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9029.9s)]
*  I just decided like that was going to be something I'm doing every year. Yeah. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9033.9s)]
*  So, OK, now I have this new thing that is. But for me, it's an amazing reset. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9037.9s)]
*  Like there's my life is filled with so much pressure and stress of a different variety. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9044.9s)]
*  That's odd that that's the most pressure, the most stress, but it's also the most relaxing. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9051.9s)]
*  Yeah. And the most it's like just being in the woods, no cell phone service, [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9056.9s)]
*  no nothing, just stalking and just hiking the mountains. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9061.9s)]
*  And also knowing that I have to be an amazing cardio shape. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9065.9s)]
*  Sure. Like when I'm working out in fucking February, [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9069.9s)]
*  I'm literally thinking while I'm working out in February, [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9074.9s)]
*  the more I push, the less tired I'm going to be in September. Yeah. Sure. It's crazy. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9077.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's cool, man. I mean, it's cool. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9081.9s)]
*  And like, you know, a hobby basically can change change somebody's life. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9084.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yeah. Obsessed with it. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9088.9s)]
*  And there's other things that do that. I think it enriches your life. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9091.9s)]
*  I really do, because I think complex, difficult things that are very rewarding [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9095.9s)]
*  and I don't think I don't think there's very many things that are as rewarding as hunting [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9101.9s)]
*  because you're actually getting food from it and actually feed family and friends. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9105.9s)]
*  And you feed yourself and it's so nutritious and so much better for you than any other kind of food. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9110.9s)]
*  But I think that it's it's one of the most rewarding, difficult things. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9115.9s)]
*  And I think the more difficult things that a person does on purpose that are rewarding, [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9121.9s)]
*  you know, I'm not talking about like life struggle. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9126.9s)]
*  I'm talking like choosing to do things, whether it's workouts or tasks [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9128.9s)]
*  or problems you're trying to solve on purpose. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9132.9s)]
*  Those are very valuable to your overall resiliency as a person. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9135.9s)]
*  Right. And I think that that is something that I've really gotten from hunting. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9140.9s)]
*  Sure. Like every time you do another one, it becomes easier to take. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9144.9s)]
*  Yes. And there's lessons that I learn from each individual hunt. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9148.9s)]
*  You know, there's things like this. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9153.9s)]
*  I went hunting with Ronella a couple of months ago. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9155.9s)]
*  It was the first time that I'd ever rattled in bucks, which was wild. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9157.9s)]
*  We were in South Texas and literally we would set up and he would start clackity clack, clackity clack. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9162.9s)]
*  And all of a sudden you hear some sound and you got to get the full draw like right away [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9168.9s)]
*  because these fuckers are just running in. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9172.9s)]
*  Yeah, because you're rattling in thick cover. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9175.9s)]
*  Yes. South Texas. Yeah, I got you. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9177.9s)]
*  Yeah. So it was very exciting. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9180.9s)]
*  I've never done it, but I've I know some folks that have really got into rattling. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9183.9s)]
*  Oh my God. But more in open country, like, you know, where they can see a little bit [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9189.9s)]
*  and you see like whitetail coming from, you know, way far away from the guy's rifle. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9193.9s)]
*  It's crazy how well it works at the right time. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9198.9s)]
*  Like when they're down to fuck, it's like it's going down. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9202.9s)]
*  Like that's you're just catching them when they think that there's a brawl going down over some ladies. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9206.9s)]
*  So like, oh, it must be some hot ladies in that area. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9212.9s)]
*  So they just start running. Isn't it funny? [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9214.9s)]
*  I don't know why this is, but I don't think I'm the anomaly here. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9216.9s)]
*  Isn't it funny how there's like there's kind of an there's kind of enjoyment in manipulating them? [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9219.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. I don't like with elk. It's the same way. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9224.9s)]
*  It's the best. You know, I mean, I used to do a fair amount. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9227.9s)]
*  That's it. You found it. Oh, yeah. He found it. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9229.9s)]
*  Fourteen. OK. Yeah, that makes sense. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9232.9s)]
*  Yeah. So that was back when I was still rifle hunting. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9235.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Look at that. Look at all the hair. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9240.9s)]
*  All that stuff on the ground is hair, which for people at home, this is November 11th, 2014. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9242.9s)]
*  And it was just hair everywhere. And that was a moose calf that they got. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9252.9s)]
*  And they just tear it up. You know, look at that. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9257.9s)]
*  Like everything's gone. The tongue's gone. The esophagus is gone. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9260.9s)]
*  All the organs are gone. The rib cage still stands. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9263.9s)]
*  But all the organs have been eaten out of it. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9266.9s)]
*  I mean, all the skin off of all the the the hindquarters is gone, except for the lower lower parts. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9269.9s)]
*  It's funny, man, because they're they're kind of a shout out to Mike Hawkeridge. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9276.9s)]
*  Yeah, my man. Dogs are you know, coyotes are kind of like that, too. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9281.9s)]
*  They're kind of dirty eaters. But but lions, man, they're like tidy, you know, because they they don't you know, they they'll store their kills. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9286.9s)]
*  You know, it's kind of why. Have you ever seen a lion kill when one's got piled up or whatever? [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9294.9s)]
*  I'm sure I got some pictures on my phone, but it's pretty it's pretty neat like how they'll cover it up and it'll be tidy and they'll come back, you know, come back and they'll peel it back. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9298.9s)]
*  And, you know, I don't think hunting's for everybody, but I think it's for a lot of people. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9308.9s)]
*  You know, I just think they don't know it. Yeah, dude, I agree. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9314.9s)]
*  But believe me, one of the things about Texas, there's a lot of opportunities for invasive pigs. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FezipID12Rs&t=9320.9s)]
