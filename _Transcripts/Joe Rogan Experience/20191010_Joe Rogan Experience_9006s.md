# Joe Rogan Experience #1365 - Cameron Hanes
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 10, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEcWyjJ20k0)
*  Three, two, one. Cameron Haynes, ladies and gentlemen.
*  Hey, what's up? Nice shirt, buddy. That's a ridiculous shirt.
*  That's you and me in Utah and it says, must be nice.
*  Yeah. Everybody says, they look at somebody and they'll be like, man, must be nice to whatever.
*  To be able to have that or to get this, be able to go there.
*  Yeah. So it's like, we obviously have a great elk hunt. I see a couple of comments and it's
*  people saying, must be nice, which it is. It's amazing. But yeah.
*  So just kind of. I think you read too many comments.
*  That's what I'm saying. I think you read some comments too.
*  Why do you think I read them? You've only said that.
*  I think you do. You never catch me reading them though, do you?
*  You've mentioned comments before too many. I catch them if they're in the top.
*  You sent me a comment the other day and it said, I always wanted-
*  Oh, that was because my wife sent it to me. It was hilarious.
*  Oh, yeah. That was after the video
*  of you and I were celebrating and you go, I love this man. I'm like, I love this man.
*  Someone said, I always wonder what it would look like if Cameron Haynes and Joe Rogan had a baby
*  and we almost found out. That was a good one. Every once in a while you get a gym.
*  Yeah. The internet is filled with funny fucking people, man.
*  Oh my God. It's hilarious.
*  There's a lot of frustrated comedians out there.
*  There is. That get to express themselves occasionally in comments.
*  Yeah. I sometimes answer because I feel like I'm let off the hook a little bit because it's not
*  like I'm making a post calling somebody a dipshit, but I can send a comment and it sneaks through.
*  But why do you want to? Or just be funny.
*  You're so busy. That's what I don't understand. How do you have the time?
*  With a full-time job, it's normal that you run a marathon in a day.
*  How the fuck do you have the time to be commenting?
*  We're waiting out here right now on the plane. I don't know.
*  Times of boredom.
*  I guess so. Yeah. It's all good. It's fun.
*  Hey man, I know a lot of people that read their comments. Eric Weinstein was making an argument
*  that you probably should read some of them. He's a genius. He was saying you don't want to be cut
*  off completely from feedback. So you have to find that sweet spot between reading some.
*  And I'm like, I feel like other people read them. I'll get them. They'll come to me.
*  Yeah. No, the good ones people share with you.
*  Yeah. But I know some people who go crazy. They read their comments and then they become obsessed
*  and then they read them all day long. Then they have these little Twitter wars with people back
*  and forth and they just argue all the time. Yeah. There's sometimes where I mean, like I
*  posted a couple of times yesterday and I don't think I read any till maybe this morning.
*  So it's like, I don't post and then just like totally check them every second, refresh, refresh.
*  But every now and then there's something nice. I saw this dude that we were talking about in
*  the last podcast. I reached out to him. He lost, how much weight did that guy lose, Jamie?
*  200 and something. He went from like 417 to 190.
*  So I sent him a DM. I'm like, I'm sending this guy a DM. That's fucking amazing, man.
*  It is.
*  It's amazing. Congratulations.
*  You do see people because like when you reach, okay, you're going to reach millions of people.
*  There's going to be a few dipshits, but there's also going to be a few like that. Or it's just
*  like, oh my God, this is, I mean, how impactful is that? That's like, it affects your life.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, because it's so positive.
*  Well, one of the things that you do online that I think is super important is you provide
*  inspiration. You know, we were talking yesterday when I had Dakota Meyer on,
*  we were talking about Goggins and Jaco and you do the same thing. It's like you provide
*  something where people, they can see you working hard and they see you smiling and getting after it.
*  And it makes people want to do things. And when they know that you're doing these hundred mile
*  races and all this crazy shit that you do, they, it gives them like, they're just enough of a push
*  to get off the couch and get going. And sometimes that's all someone needs to change their whole
*  life. You need a day, a good day, a good day where you get moving and you get your legs pumping and
*  you, you know, you, you get huffing and puffing and you get your heart rate up and you sweat.
*  And then afterwards you feel great and you go, okay, tomorrow I'm going to do it again.
*  Yeah.
*  And the next thing you know, you got 15 days in a row and the next thing you know,
*  you're down 10 pounds. The next thing you know, you're cutting off on the booze and you're eating
*  good. And now you're, you're joining a gym and you're starting to do chin ups and shit and you're
*  getting in shape and you look way better and you feel better. You make better choices.
*  Life moves smoother.
*  Yeah. I mean, it's, it builds that momentum and it, you know, the journey of a thousand miles
*  begins with one step and that one step is one day or maybe the first, first step on your first run.
*  But, you know, I see that all the time too, because I genuinely enjoy working hard. And so I am
*  smiling and, and it's like, people say, okay, enough's enough. I'm going to, I've been watching
*  you for whatever. I'm going to do it. And so it's like, I don't know if you beat them into
*  submission finally, but whatever the case is, whatever re for whatever reason people get out
*  there, they do. And then it starts that journey. Like, like you said, towards a different life,
*  essentially.
*  I joke around about it on stage about accidentally influencing dudes and I apologize to the
*  girlfriends, but there is a certain amount of responsibility that you have to assume when that
*  starts happening. When you do have a positive impact on people and you realize like, Hey,
*  you know, this, this show, having people like you and Jaco and Andy Stumpf and all kinds of
*  interesting, fascinating people on directly influences people's lives for the better and
*  changes the way they view things for the better, gives them a positive outlook. And it also gives
*  them the opportunity to hear from people, the way people think that maybe they would never
*  get to meet these people in real life.
*  Right.
*  They would never get to know these people, but they feel like they know you or them or who,
*  you know, that's the one thing I love about Jaco too, is, you know, just the shot of his
*  watch every day. I mean, you know, he's up at 4 30 and he's getting it done. No excuses.
*  None. Yeah. And he's done. And that's, I think that accountability is probably accountability
*  for him, but also it's like the people know, okay, Hey, this is what we need to expect of ourselves.
*  Yeah. Someone, a guy said, I don't like following Jaco because all it does is take pictures of his
*  watch. I'm like, you're missing the point, man. That's a new picture. It's a new picture every
*  goddamn day of a new day with his fucking watch getting up and getting after it. And then afterwards
*  is a puddle of sweat in the ground. And he's doing it every day. And that's good for you.
*  It's impressive. It's like, and that was, I'd never met him until our, our Elk Hunt Utah.
*  And man, people ask, Hey, so how is Jaco? And I'm like, exactly like what you'd expect. I mean,
*  what he says and how he portrays himself. That's how he is. That's how he is. And he's like,
*  you know, they had that day, they were expecting a long day of, of blood trailing or just covering
*  miles in the mountains. And he's like, he couldn't wait. Yeah. He was looking forward to it. Couldn't
*  wait. He ate three plates of meatloaf. He did. He carved load. I mean, he's like, Hey, I'm going to
*  need these, but yeah, big old, big old plates of food. But he said, and I remember this specifically,
*  he said, what sucks is when it doesn't suck. He wants the challenge. If something without a
*  challenge, it's like, what's the point? Yeah. He's turned his mind into this like challenge seeking
*  missile. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's why I love the fact that he, you know, at 45 years of age or
*  46, whatever he is, decided to get into bow hunting hardcore. And a year in he's taking on
*  this crazy elk hunt in Utah. I mean, it's awesome. It was amazing. It's awesome. I love when people
*  are not scared to take on new challenges, you know, like something that's completely outside
*  their wheelhouse. Like when he started shooting and he got together with Dudley and Dudley started
*  giving us some instruction, I got pumped because I knew I'm like, this guy's going to dive into this
*  head first. Right. You know? Yeah. It's that discipline. I think guys like you and him,
*  it's just easy transition because you've had the like, and I always say this bow hunting has done
*  this for me. It gave me discipline or structure when I didn't have any. And I think, you know,
*  jujitsu did that for you too at that or no, it wasn't jujitsu then. Tai kwon do started out
*  kickboxing, a lot of different martial arts. But yeah, so it's the same, it's different,
*  but it's the same type of discipline for young. I mean, I guess it was young for us, but it's a,
*  it's a transition to people who have that mindset. And they're like, no, that I'm going to have to
*  punch this time clock every day for a while before I get to a high level. And it's just like that a
*  certain type of personality or people don't, they don't shy away from that. They like, they gravitate
*  towards it. Well, it's also being able to pull it together in the moment, which to me, I've always
*  sought challenges where the, like it requires you to maintain your mental state, like whether it's
*  standup comedy or fighting. And to me, archery might be the ultimate bow hunting is the ultimate,
*  because in these moments where like that bull is going to be in between those two trees for five
*  seconds and you got to draw back and make that shot. These are crazy moments that you have to,
*  you have to have practiced. You have to put in the time. There's no substitution.
*  I don't think people who haven't done it realize how difficult it is. And then I think people who've
*  done it, they definitely know how hard it is. That is one of the, as you mentioned, one of the
*  hardest things to do, but that's why that, that's why that video of you and Utah, 67 yards, and it
*  was just like, we had been in on bulls, like had opportunity. From the moment, the beginning of the
*  morning, real close, it was a rough day, but these opportunities were like right there. Oh, you could
*  almost grab them and they would, they were gone and it didn't happen. And then that one just enough
*  time, but he's like, you had to do it all. You know, like the clock's ticking. Like it's not,
*  you don't have unlimited time. That bull takes a step. It's over. And for you to make that shot
*  so perfect in crunch time, that was such a beautiful thing. He's like, that's why it elicited
*  the orgy type response. Well, that's also why I said afterwards, practice is so important.
*  It's always thinking. Yeah. That's what you said. You said, you said practice, something about
*  practice and it's like, that's what it goes down. So that's the building block. Yeah. And it's just
*  those reps. Cause you can't, I guess you could get, make a lucky shot, but the chances of screwing
*  that up are very high unless you got the reps. Yeah. My, my thought process when I was making
*  that shot was exactly the thought process that I go through when I'm practicing. And that's why,
*  and when I executed and I saw that arrow hit exactly where I was aiming, it was, I was,
*  that's the first thought that came into my mind. Practice is so important. Well, and then I was
*  impressed because you actually made notes to yourself on your phone. So what tell me, walk me
*  through your, your, your procedure, your process. I have, uh, I even added to it. Oh, you did. Yeah,
*  because there's a certain way I like to grip the, uh, the, um, the release that I didn't put in.
*  Yeah. So, uh, uh, back straight, strong posture, drawback, elbow high, light pressure on the nose,
*  center of the peep level the bubble. Now this is the new one that I added connect the fuck you
*  finger to the thumb. Cause there's this finger has to connect to the thumb on the release as I pull
*  back. Yeah. Cause I use that silverback release. Yeah. I pull back with the index trigger,
*  pick a spot, pull with the scapula. And then the last one be the arrow, right? You know,
*  Tommy that Warren. So what does that mean? Remi Warren said, well, the whole thing, no, no, no,
*  the B the arrow like B I'm not hoping that it hits in that spot. I'm aiming. I'm going, I'm, I want,
*  I'm concentrating 100% on that arrow going to that spot. Remi Warren said that to me one time. He
*  goes, he goes, this sounds crazy, but someone gave me this advice. And it's like the best advice
*  anybody ever gave me said, be the arrow. He goes like, I don't know what that means, but like,
*  I use that different things to different people. But to you, it means, yeah, you're in, you're so
*  in the moment. Yes. You're the arrow. I'm a hundred percent foot when that arrow is released, I,
*  I'm, I'm a part of it as it's going towards that L right. Be the arrow like, don't just, oh, I hope
*  it works. Like I got that from Joel Turner as well. You know, Joel Turner has that shot IQ website
*  and he goes over and he helped me a lot because he goes over the difference between a closed loop
*  and an open loop process. I always forget which one is which, but one of them is automatic,
*  you know, like, like a ball comes at you, you swing a bat, but you can't stop in the process.
*  And the other one is you're in control of it every step of the way. And that's where a shot routine
*  helps me because you think I'm thinking, I'm making sure that all my things are checked off.
*  So there's no, there's no chance I'm doing anything wacky. Right. There's no chance you're
*  spazzing out in the moment. Yeah. And so that those two things, and then what Remy said,
*  be the arrow. Like that sounds like to someone who's never shot an arrow, that doesn't make any sense.
*  But when there's a thing that you do, when you release an arrow, where you're so focused,
*  your technique is on point, everything's, everything's lined up, but you're so focused
*  as you're releasing that arrow, you never break that focus. Right. The only thing, the only way
*  I could break it was when I heard the arrow whack and I saw it hit right in the sweet spot. I was
*  like, now I can relax. Yeah. Well, and I remember that I said this at that time, but I remember
*  your follow through. It was just like, so I remember that arm coming back and it was just,
*  I don't know. It's, you know, and I think that's where a lot of people make mistakes is
*  if you're new in it and there's so much pressure in the moment, in that moment,
*  you've thought about it for so long that it's just like the pin goes on the animal and they
*  pull it, punch the trigger because they want it. They wanted, they want to be there before they've
*  went through the process. And so that's where people screw up. And all that whole thing,
*  you making that a, a, a actual process, each step, but I think, I don't know, do you do it or
*  is it subconscious? You know, do you think about all those steps? I was thinking about all those
*  steps while I was walking. Okay. Like while I'm going through the woods, I'm thinking about those.
*  But on the shot. On the shot it was almost automatic. Yeah, subconscious. But that's why
*  I said practice is so important because it's like I had practiced it so many times that I just looked
*  at that elk like it was a target. I knew what to do and just, but it was only because of the reps,
*  reps, reps, reps, reps, reps, reps. That moment was so crazy because, you know, we had that bull
*  and I don't know if it was that bull, but it was a big bull, but we were stuck over more to the left
*  and we could see him up there. He had these little smaller satellite bulls kind of in the way we were
*  in the sun, which was driving me crazy. So we ended up having a circle all the way back around
*  and get back up there. Had a line of spruce we could sneak up. But it was, you know, those bulls,
*  the bull you shot went and fought with another bull for a brief time and we were switching back
*  and forth which one to shoot because they were both big bulls. And it's just like, just to be able
*  to slow that down and make such a perfect shot in a moment like that. Oh my God, it's so hard.
*  It was so awesome though. Yeah, it was so amazing, but it's so hard.
*  Oh, this is it? Yeah. He just got done fighting with a bull.
*  Nice shot. Oh my God. So he runs, you can't see it in this film. He runs up this ridge right here
*  and boom, he's down right there. I mean, couple seconds later, but this is everything that you
*  hope for as a bow hunter. Yeah. You know? It was amazing. I see a lot of people who haven't
*  hunted, they're under the impression that maybe as soon as the arrow hits the animal, how come it
*  didn't go down? You know what I mean? Because they just don't know. So that bull was alive
*  for seconds after that, essentially. He ran up, probably went about a hundred yards.
*  He ran until there was no more air. His both of his lungs were gone. He just sprinted. He never knew
*  what happened. He probably thought he got jabbed by another bull or something.
*  Yeah. Cause he was just fighting with that other bull. And they have, take tines to the shoulder
*  and everything. Oh, he had holes in them. All the time. He was beat up. He was beat up. But they,
*  a lot of times bulls get shot with an arrow and they don't even realize it. All of a sudden,
*  their blood pressure drops because it's hemorrhaging and then they essentially pass out,
*  but then they die. Well, the bull that I shot last year in California, that's what happened to him.
*  He walked four yards. He just walked four yards and tipped over. Boom. And he dropped right there.
*  I mean, it was the closest to shooting an animal where he died that I've ever seen.
*  He just died immediately. I hit him right in the heart.
*  Yeah. And I think it's a, you know, people may, might be more familiar with
*  rifle kills and maybe they think that they, but even with a rifle, they don't go right down.
*  And I think it's like a rifle is even, can be, you know, they hear the sound, a rifle will kill by
*  shock instead of hemorrhage. So it's, you know, she's getting blown apart. I think an air, a
*  well-placed arrow is about as beautiful death as an animal is going to get.
*  Yeah. I mean, these aren't animals that are living in a controlled environment where they're going to
*  die of old age. They're going to get torn apart by animals. And in fact, John Dudley, while he was
*  there, it was 20 yards away from a mountain lion that was stalking the same bull he was, which is
*  crazy. Do you see that lion footage I put up? So there's lions all over there. And chances are
*  it's going to be death by a lion or, or, and that usually will happen once they get weak because
*  they can't fend off, they get injured. Maybe they're too old to get the feed they need the winter.
*  And then they're lying food. And they also get jacked because they're, they're blowing out all
*  their energy while they're in the rut. And they don't eat, they're just humping up a storm. And
*  then when it's over, they're just like, Oh Jesus. And then the winter comes. Oh, I know. It's a
*  perfect storm. Yeah. It's, it's rough. It's a rough life out there, but that's why I say it's like
*  death by a well-placed arrow is, you know, people say, well, people have the impression that these
*  things aren't going to die ever, or they're going to live like we live or. Well, they also don't
*  understand that all the money that's spent on this elk hunt, all of it goes to ensure the healthy
*  populations of these animals. Yeah. Most of it. And most of it goes to wildlife preservation. It
*  goes to keeping the, the habitat strong, the numbers strong. And this is what pays for what the,
*  if people love animals, you should love hunters because hunters pay for most of the wildlife
*  conservation in this country. Yeah. You know, and that message is, of course that's, you know,
*  we've talked about that numerous times, but that message is, is getting out. The, the groomer today
*  that I had, she, she was- You had a groomer? My dog Marshall goes to a groomer. Right. Yeah. So
*  similar, but she doesn't hunt, but she wants to hunt because she wants to be, you know,
*  self-sufficient essentially. But she was talking about, she doesn't know, but she knows that
*  doesn't hunting pay for protection of the animals? And, and I'm like, you know, I'll explain what you
*  just said. And so it's, people are figuring it out. Yeah. I mean, we're getting the message out. So
*  that's good. Yeah. I mean, this, there's so many different messages that you hear stats, you know,
*  about meat consumption and food and like what's bad for the environment, what's good for the
*  environment. There's so many like small little sound bites that people like to rally off. Yeah.
*  And that's, this is something that's this, without a doubt, it's the best way you could
*  ever get your meat. Yeah. There's nothing even close, it's not even a close second. No. It's
*  the best way is the animals, by the time you get into in the rut, they're already breeding.
*  And the ones we're getting, there's, you know, eight, nine years old, they've already had multiple
*  breeding seasons. Yeah. In the prime. Yeah. Their genes are passed on. Yeah. And you're getting an
*  animal that's just out there eating grass and living a wild life. It's meat. So good. Oh,
*  it's the best meat ever. I had it last night. It's sensational. It's so good. I've been eating all
*  week. Yeah. Yeah. That's why I feel, you know, I got into hunting. I don't know if meat was up on
*  the high on the list. I was just a young kid. I just wanted to hunt, wanted to get my buck. Hey,
*  you get your buck. That's all I wanted to do is get my buck. And then, but now the meat is, man,
*  it's as much as the antlers for sure. Yeah. You know, just getting that meat, hundreds of pounds
*  of meat, bringing it home, eating it, fuels us for everything we do. And it's like, to me, I mean,
*  at our age, we're the same age now, but not long ago, our age was old. We were dead. Yeah. I don't,
*  I don't feel, I feel better than I've ever felt. And I'm just like, if I was 25, I didn't feel as
*  good as I feel right now. And maybe that's wild game meat. I guarantee you it has something to do
*  with it. I guarantee you. And don't, how, I mean, how do you feel? I feel fucking fantastic. 52.
*  I had a hard run this morning right before my podcast. Yeah. Yeah, man. I think it's the most
*  nutrient dense food that you can ever get. Yeah. I mean, you just look at it. When you look at a,
*  like a backstrap from an elk, it's like a dark red. It looks like it's filled with nutrition. It
*  tastes so good. Like when you're eating it, I feel like energy. Yeah. You know, like it's,
*  it's hard to describe, but it's just a way better meat. It's just way better. I was watching,
*  I took video of Colton pulling out the tenderloin of your bowl because people don't understand how
*  you can get without gutting it. You can get the tenderloins out, which are under the spine.
*  And that, when he pulls that out, it's just like, I mean, if, I mean, if a sound bite could have
*  came in or something and does like, it's like beautiful. It's like there should have been
*  does flying around because that piece of meat looked so perfect. And it's just like, like you
*  say, when you eat it, it's like, I don't know. It's like energy injection. Well, they've done
*  studies on game meat versus domestic beef. They've also done studies on domestic beef. It's raised on
*  grain versus domestic beef. It's raised on grass. Domestic beat. That's raised on grain is probably
*  like the least nutritious. And then domestic beef that's raised on grass is far superior,
*  much healthier. But then you go with wild game meat. I mean, it's another a hundred percent
*  more nutritious. It's way more protein. Like the difference between a piece of beef and a piece of
*  pull up the difference between like a one pound of beef versus one pound of elk. I think it's more
*  than double the amount of protein. Really? Yeah. And then there's also insane amounts of amino acids
*  and essential fatty acids. Like, oh, you're getting all the grass fed. This animal is eating
*  wild grasses. This animal is eating the same diet it would have eaten 4,000 years ago.
*  Yeah. It's I remember when I used to hunt elk in the Eagle Cap wilderness, I remember I used to
*  think those elk were like high octane, like because they were so fast compared to the bulls I hunted
*  over in Western Oregon. And I always thought that it was just that feed must be, I don't know,
*  it seemed like the elk were different and quicker. And so I'm thinking, well, if I'm eating
*  those bulls and those bulls are elite athletes for bulls, it's like, this can't, I mean, it's got to
*  be amazing. It's got to be amazing for me. Well, it makes sense because the Eagle Cap wilderness
*  is like rich, dense forest. Yeah. Right. It's so green up there. Yeah. It's, it's, they call it
*  the little Alps. I mean, that's, it's rugged and it's, it's steep. It's, but there is good feed up
*  there too for the animals. Yeah. And it's like, man, those bulls there, they're studs. Amazing.
*  Yeah, they are. Yeah. It's rough country though. Yeah. It's rough country. Well, I mean, that's
*  where they live. You know, what's interesting is before people came around, elk were like prairie
*  animals. Yeah, they were, right. They moved to the mountains because of humans. Yeah. And then wolves
*  and all these other animals. But when the pioneers first came here, there's, elks were just roaming the
*  fields. Yeah. Which is kind of crazy. Yeah, that is. Yeah. But they, but they wised up like, look,
*  we got to make it harder on these assholes. They got into the, to the rocks for sure up in the
*  mountains. What do you got, Jamie? I don't know. Varying information. That's a problem. Yeah.
*  Varying information. Anyway, super good for you. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't say it's bad for anything.
*  No. Yeah. Well, that's the thing about, you know, there's, there's like not one standard website,
*  what's good for nutrition and figuring out what the stuff is. But yeah, I know you can, you can
*  pretty much have anything validated you want validated on the, on the internet. Well, you know,
*  it's interesting. I was listening to Ronella talk recently about this horrendous trip that they had
*  in the back country because there were so many hunters during muzzleloader and archery season.
*  This year? Yeah. In Colorado. Yeah. And I wonder like, I wonder how much us talking about it all
*  the time is affecting the numbers of people that actually go out and try it. Cause you just stop
*  and think about the, the numbers of people listening to this podcast. It's a bananas number.
*  It's, you know, millions and millions of people. Well, the feedback I see is like there's, you know,
*  and they say, cause I just had this, this talk with my buddy, Wayne Indica, you know, Wayne,
*  I was out at his place shooting the other day. And, you know, it says we've lost since 2016,
*  2 million licensed hunters. And I told him, I said, I don't know where, where we lost them from,
*  but bow hunting has got to be, cause he owns the bow rack and bow, bow hunting is skyrocketing.
*  Cause I see, I mean, I see the following and people talking about it, like you mentioned,
*  and he said he was in Colorado too, looking for elk and ran into like 10 different guys back there.
*  Yeah. So yeah, there is, yeah, I don't really,
*  I think people are looking at it more as like a pursuit, like a difficult pursuit, not just hunting
*  for meat. No, it's different now. It's like, it's, yeah, it's changed. Yeah. I wonder if that's
*  because of us talking about it. It's had to have some sort of an impact. I think it's, I think it's
*  had an impact for sure. And then I'm, so I'm trying to think, I don't want to, you know,
*  but then on the other hand, so in the Eagle cap wilderness, my buddy was back there and said,
*  he said, you need to come back here and hunt again. And I'm like, yeah, I know I, you know,
*  the thing with, with the wilderness is you, I, as a commercial, that if you do a commercial activity,
*  you can't even share the photos because they won't give a permit for it. That's why I had to,
*  I had to quit filming back there. They made it illegal to film and release it as a commercial
*  property. Well, even me with my following now, I couldn't even put up a photo from back there
*  because it would be commercial just commercial. You have sponsors. Yeah. And they're,
*  they're making it seem like you're back there shooting a full length feature film, you know,
*  right? It's like they don't differentiate between your iPhone, shooting a movie or an iPhone.
*  And so, so like what we shot it in Utah, you couldn't have done. No, wow. That's not in the
*  wilderness, not in the national forest. Yeah. Wilderness, they won't allow filming permits.
*  So, but anyway, he said, I go, I go, man, I said, I've got so many good elk hunts on tap. I said,
*  you know, he knows I love that country. And he goes, well, he goes, just for, for old times sake,
*  he goes, because I'm looking at a 360 and a 340 bull screaming elk everywhere and not
*  truck at the trailhead. Wow. So, but it's a long way back. It's rugged country. So I think,
*  I mean, there's still, there's spots. Yeah. There's still spots that are going to be hard
*  to get to, right? Those are the spots that discourage people where you know that you're
*  going to have to hike in 12 miles. And then you have to get the animal out. So if you're hiking
*  in and you're off horse, you know, it's a places that are off horse pack trails that don't get the
*  because you have to, if you kill a bull, it's coming out on your back. Yeah. That's a bunch
*  of trips. That's a lot of trips. If you're going 12 miles out, or even if you have to pack it to a,
*  to a, where horses can get, it's a lot of work. Well, green tree, when he shot his bull and when
*  he was on that crazy 28 day hunt, didn't it take him like seven days to get his bull out? Yeah.
*  By himself on his back. Yeah. So I think somebody went up and helped him, but still, I mean, tons
*  of work, but he had snow, I think. And he was like nine or 10 miles in, right? Something like that.
*  Yeah. So he's walking out nine or 10 miles with a hundred plus pounds on his back each trip.
*  It's a lot of work. It's amazing. I mean, you know how much work it is breaking down a bull
*  because, because we've done it, but then you go from there to, okay, now I got to
*  walk it out 10 miles. Then you got to preserve the meat. So you got to hang it and make sure
*  it's getting cool. And I mean, my friend, Ryan Callahan shot a bull. He got a tag in New Mexico
*  and he wrote a whole article about it because he lost the bull. I read that. Very disheartening.
*  Yeah, it was. Huge bull. Yeah. That was, I mean, it's, that was a nice six point. It was, yeah,
*  he was, yeah. I mean, it's real. And I mean, I think it's important to share those honest experiences.
*  But also it's like, man, you don't want people who don't get it to get the wrong impression.
*  Yeah. That's always the- Right, right, right. With a wounded animal in particular, right?
*  Yeah. When you see an animal get- And he even mentioned that in the article. He said,
*  he realizes about the, I don't know, about the, what people might think about bull hunters.
*  Yeah, the stigma. The stigma. Yeah, that's it. And he, I mean, I don't know. It was- I think
*  he shoots with a stick bow too, which is really weird. He shoots with a long bow. Did he? Yeah.
*  He shot that bull with that. He shot his last bull with a long bow. I think that's what he hunts with.
*  Yeah. I think, yeah. Which, you know, I get it. People like doing that. I get it. But like, come on,
*  man. It's hard. It's hard. And people ask me about that all the time. Compound bow is hard enough.
*  When are you going to do that? And I'm like, God, I'm not that good with a compound bow. So
*  I don't really, I'm not really ready to make it harder. Well, our friend Aaron Snyder,
*  he's completely committed to a recurve. It's all he shoots with. I just saw him the other day,
*  like a post yesterday, I think, and he had a compound. Oh, did he? Yeah. Maybe he's given
*  up on it. No, I don't think he's given up. It goes back and forth? Yeah, maybe. Maybe he's
*  just practicing. Unless it was somebody else's bow. I don't know, but he, it's a crazy video of
*  him shooting a mountain goat with a compound. Yeah. Did you see that? No, no, no, with a recurve.
*  It was a recurve. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was on top of a cliff and shot down. I know. That was pretty
*  sweet. It was pretty sweet. Yeah. It was amazing video. And I think he said he hurt his shoulder.
*  But like before, he didn't know if he's going to be able to shoot it with a bow. Oh, really? Yeah.
*  Because he had done something to his shoulder. So I think I read it's like he was going to have to
*  get, try to do half draw or as far back as he could get. And he ended up hitting it through the heart.
*  Oh, is that, his shoulders that fucked up? I guess so. I don't know what happened.
*  That's the one thing that freaks me out about you. How do you not get injured as much as you do?
*  Like, I just don't understand how you don't get injured. Kind of weirds me out.
*  Weirds you out? Yeah, yeah. Because as much as you lift weights, as much as you run,
*  I'm like waiting for you to get injured. I'm always getting injured. Are you rooting for me to get
*  injured? Never. So you're like, good. No, I'm like, this is crazy. I'm stunned. I'm like,
*  you're made out of something different. Because all the running that you do and all the weight
*  lifting you do, especially because you do high reps, you're doing all these reps, reps, reps,
*  reps, reps. I'm like, no tendonitis, nothing. Nope. Everything's fine. Like, what the fuck?
*  Well, part of it is I'm not going to ever say I'm hurt. So I mean, I hurt. I mean, I'm, you know,
*  I'm not young. Sore. But not injured? Yeah. I don't say I'm injured, but not sore. But I mean-
*  I remember the one time we had to go to Vegas where I was going to get a stem cell shot.
*  You have Roddy McGee check out one of your feet. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Your foot was kind of fucked
*  up. Yeah. I mean- Do you have a stress fracture or something? Yeah. And I get, you know, you can't,
*  you just can't do that and not get, there's going to be some repercussions to put on all those miles.
*  But I just, that's just part of the, part of the deal. So I just work through it. Just, you know,
*  I'm never going to, you know, I mean, even my wife today, because it's like, haven't been sleeping
*  that I had that whole thing this morning with GQ and then this and she's, and then I, whatever.
*  She's like, well, how are you feeling? I said, I have no choice, but to feel a hundred percent.
*  I said, so that's all I'm focusing on. So that's how I do. I mean, I don't, even if I'm down or
*  don't feel good or haven't got sleep or I'm hobbled, I'm only thinking about I'm a hundred percent.
*  I don't have to, I can't, I don't, I can't afford to think about, oh, maybe I shouldn't do this or
*  maybe I'm not going to be as good as I could be. Just don't even think about it.
*  That's ridiculous. So I don't accept it. Don't get one of these whoops drops. It'll tell you,
*  listen, why you need to get some sleep. Oh yeah. It'll tell you, you need to recover. I could tell
*  you I could not like, I could not sleep last night because I was thinking about that whole
*  thing today. Then turn, I was thinking, God, what if that goes long? And then traffic, you know,
*  traffic in LA, then I'm late getting over here. So you've got all these things to worry about.
*  This is, I know, but I'm still thinking about it. So instead of sleeping, that keeps you up.
*  Really? Yeah. Stupid shit like that. That's stupid. Yeah. But that's first world problems.
*  Oh my God. I have a GQ shoot today. What if it runs late and I can't do the podcast until three?
*  Yeah, I know. Could you imagine? Crazy. I know. See, now you know what real struggle is.
*  The real struggle. Yeah. Yeah. I don't have any real struggle anymore. My struggles are all fake.
*  You have to manufacture. Yeah. I make my own bullshit. I make my own struggles. Yeah.
*  Workouts and training and all that shit. Yeah. But like I always say, because like,
*  so I could be a must be nice guy. So, Oh, because I'm still punching the time clock nine to five.
*  Yeah. That's what's ridiculous. So I'm like, Oh, it must be nice to be Joe Rogan.
*  It is nice. I'll tell you. It's fucking sweet. But what I always like to tell people,
*  because I was arguing with, why I was arguing with somebody on somewhere, but
*  God, where was it? Anyways, about the El Con, like you, Oh yeah. Yeah. I want to see you and Joe do
*  a public land El Con. Joe's got to earn his way or whatever. I'm like, I said, trust me,
*  Joe's earned where he's at. I mean, what, because you have a different version of earn it in this
*  one small aspect of life, hunting. I said, Joe's earned his whole, everything he has. So it was like
*  all the way from, so it's like people who say must be nice to be you. Holy shit. You've been
*  through the fire for years, decades and you're reaping the rewards. Yeah. But they don't see
*  that. I know that's irritating. Yeah. It doesn't bother me. It bothers me. I understand what they
*  say. And people say like, Oh, public land is harder. It is harder, but here's the problem
*  with that. You're dealing with a pressured animal. I don't want to deal with pressured animals. I
*  know that you deal, I know it's harder. It's harder to have success in public land, but I don't think
*  it's better because dealing with all those people that are going after the same animals and those
*  like, like Renella was talking about elk that were silently bugling, like they're opening up
*  their mouth and they're not bugling because they don't want to get called to, they don't want to
*  get chased down because they're so fucking pressured. And wolves have, have the elk don't
*  call around wolves either because the wolves come. So like what I've found is cause I've done it,
*  you know, I've public, I was only on public land for 20 years, you know, I couldn't afford anything
*  else. So I haven't found that, that, that killing an elk is any easier or harder. It's just, they're
*  bigger because they're older. So I can still, I've always killed bulls, but they're, they're going to
*  be like a three year old bull, a five point. Right now I'm going to kill a 10 year old bull.
*  It's still a bull, but it's just different. They just on public land, there's not as many that are
*  getting to that age class because every other hunter out there is going to shoot the first bull
*  they see. So that's the difference. It's not the hunting doesn't seem harder or easier to me or
*  different. It's still killing a bull with an arrow, but it's just that, that size. When you go to
*  private land, you have more opportunities, there's more animals, but to me they're acting wild.
*  They're acting like wild animals because they're not pressured because there's not that many people
*  out there. So it's rare that they encounter people and you know, and when you're in a place like we
*  were at, which is 270,000 acres in Utah, they're all just living in the mountains like they've been
*  living in the mountains for thousands of years. That's to me, it's a pure experience. And I know
*  it's not available to everybody. I know you have to pay money to do it. And I get that.
*  I get that it's not available to the average working man. I get it, but it's definitely harder
*  to do public land without a doubt, but I don't think it's as good. The reason why I don't think
*  it's as good is because those animals are acting like animals that are being hunted all the time.
*  They're pressured. I've been, I've been on public land hunts. I get the difference.
*  And it's definitely more satisfying when you're successful because it's more difficult.
*  And I know how people can take pride in that, but I think a lot of the pride they're taking in it,
*  they're taking the, because they don't have the option. Like if you could say to these people
*  that are talking shit, like you say, Hey, would you like a free hunt at the Deseret in Utah?
*  They'd be like, yeah, of course they would say yes. They didn't want to experience what we
*  experienced that day, which was a pure wild rut fest, a pure wild experience where these animals
*  just going off. I mean, we're deep, deep, deep into the mountains. They're by themselves.
*  They're all bedded down up there. There's a hot cow and they're all going crazy and fighting each
*  other. I mean, just the sounds that we were hearing was so epic. That video that you got of us
*  walking and you just hear brrrrr just all day, all day they were going off. It was amazing.
*  We hit the perfect spot. That spot, that day, that time. Yeah, that was it. And I've, I've,
*  I've been in a rut fest on public land. You know, I mean, they, they, that's how they act.
*  And that's in the wilderness deep where they're not getting, so it's like you always, I've always
*  looked for places my whole career, hunting career, where the animal, I'm not, I'm not competing
*  against Tom, Dick and Harry and the elk. Right. You know, so to me, that was always like, well,
*  the way I can do that is go further than anybody wants to go. So I'd go to the wilderness to hunt
*  those. So it's essentially that without having to go 12 miles deep. Right, right, right. You know,
*  and it's, it's those elk are, they're acting natural. And you know, I've been on the other
*  side though, too. I get what the guys are saying. I get it. When I couldn't hunt,
*  my goal has always been to go on the best elk hunts I could. Right. Sometimes that was instead
*  of hunting the Oregon coast that was going to Eastern Oregon. Then I went from Eastern Oregon
*  to Wyoming. I'm like, Oh my God, this is so much better than Oregon. It was better. Then I went
*  from Wyoming to Colorado, Colorado. That's right. Eastman's had me go in 2005. I killed a seven by
*  six in Wyoming. Then they said the next year, and that was a public land hunt day nine. And then
*  it's like, Hey, 2005, we want to film you on this hunt. And I'm like, well, if it's better than
*  Wyoming, I'll go to Colorado. That's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to get a better hunt.
*  And so it's just been that. And so now it's been the places that I go, I spend my month of September,
*  they're the very best places I can find in the United States. And it's just an extension of that
*  process, 30 years of it. That's it. That's all anybody's trying to do. You don't try to go on
*  worse elk hunts. Some people do though. I don't know. Some people really love the grind. I never
*  did. Some people just love the grind. They also love bragging rights. I get the grind, but it's still,
*  they don't want to go on a worse elk hunt though. But they want the bragging rights of public land,
*  but they'll definitely take a public land, limited entry draw tag if they get it, which is essentially
*  like being on a private land. Because nobody can hunt there. No. And that's what like back home,
*  it's the Winaha unit. They give 20 tags. 20. 20. And it's a huge area. This is one area.
*  It's a one-hour unit. Do out of state people apply for it as well? Yeah. I don't think they get,
*  Oregon's terrible for out of state, for non-residents, but I know residents get 20.
*  So huge area, 20 tags. That's not that much different than paying a landowner
*  to have this area for yourself. So I put in for Winaha. If I draw it, I'm hunting there.
*  It's kind of the same thing. I understand where people are coming from. And whenever someone's
*  got something that you can't afford, you get that. Must be nice. Yeah. Yeah. The problem that I have
*  with it is that the animals, when they're pressured, they're not acting natural. And
*  you're dealing with too many people. It definitely gives you better bragging rights. If you shoot a
*  giant bull on public land, it's like, wow, that's another level of accomplishment. It's a big deal.
*  That's the real grind. What we're doing is, what I'm doing, first of all, is the easiest way to the
*  road because I've got some of my best friends or the best hunters on earth. I mean, having you as
*  a great friend and Dudley and being able to take instruction from you guys and learning how to bow
*  hunt and just having you that day with me. First of all, what a wake up call about endurance.
*  Here I am fucking running hills every goddamn day, trying to keep up with you is such a fucking
*  bummer, man. It's still like, it's so annoying, Jamie. He gets to the top of the hill. He's not
*  even out of breath. I'm soaked with sweat. I'm heaving and hoeing. I'm like, what if I didn't run?
*  Like, what if I wasn't doing all this goddamn hill running?
*  Well, that one little burst we had because the wind, to get the wind right and then that bull
*  coming over, I didn't know if the bull was coming. That was a kind of a-
*  It was a hustle.
*  It was a hustle. We had to straight up out of the creek.
*  Straight up. Thank God I do that all the time.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And I recovered quick.
*  You got up there. Yeah, you did. And that's bow hunting. To be able to think you're going
*  to make an accurate shot after pushing yourself like that, that's rough.
*  Very rough. That's what I think people need to understand about the reason why you condition
*  yourself. And I know you've taken a lot of shit from lazy hunters that think it's unnecessary
*  to work out as hard as you do. Come with us, bitch. Come with us. That day, just do what we
*  did that day. God damn it. As much as I run, I was still struggling to keep up. It's fucking hard.
*  And then the whole thing is whether or not you can recover. So even though you're heaving and hoeing,
*  you know, heaving and hoeing? What's the word? What do you say? Heave ho?
*  You're fucking heaving. Gasping.
*  Gasping for air at the top. Your heart rate drops down if you're in shape.
*  So even though you've done the sprint, within a minute, everything's dropping back down and
*  then you're cool again. And then you can make the shot.
*  The biggest thing I see is not only that recovery, but making good decisions.
*  Because it's still hunting. You still have to outwit. So what happens is when people get gassed,
*  they take shortcuts. You know, they get gassed from going up the hill, hard trying to get this.
*  And then they're like, God, do I really have to circle around to keep the wind right?
*  Maybe I can just get away with here. So it's like you take shortcuts and you can't take shortcuts.
*  So the more fatigued you are, the more inclined you are to take shortcuts, the better shaped you
*  are, you're going to do it right. And you're going to make good decisions.
*  The first bull that we got into in the early morning, that bull was at, was like 52 yards.
*  I was at full draw and he caught a whiff of us. And he was right, he was walking right into the path.
*  Right into the path. He would have been broadside. I mean, that would have been 17 yards closer than
*  the bull I shot or close to it. And he just, fuck this.
*  He was gone. Yeah. That wind will get you.
*  Their sense of smell and their understanding of their environment is so humbling.
*  It's so amazing to watch them like peek their head up and catch your wind for a second and
*  then just start running. Oh, I know. And you see, I thought,
*  I don't know, you see them and they'll like kind of, they'll put their nose up and they'll be like,
*  what is that? Yeah. Yeah. Smell cologne.
*  I don't know about cologne. I smell some old spice.
*  Yeah. I did want to say one thing about the whole must be nice type thing is I don't,
*  a big pet peeve of mine is not so much the public and private and all that, but it's just like,
*  hunters are small group anyway. Why the hell are we trying to rip each other apart, judge,
*  cannibalize the small group, which we're fighting for our space in this world anyway?
*  Right. Come on. I mean, like when I say,
*  I was defending at one time you and Jaco, I think maybe it was on Andy's page, but whatever.
*  Must be nice. Yeah. And it's like, guys,
*  they're out hunting, celebrating our lifestyle. I mean, cause they'll be like, well, I don't have
*  a problem with you because you, you've been doing it for 30 years. I'm like, who cares? They're
*  hunters. They're talking about it. They're doing it. This is a win, a win. What are we doing?
*  I mean, cause you, cause they haven't been out there for 30 years and couldn't afford an elk tag.
*  They shouldn't do it. I mean, come on. Yes. People get short-sighted and selfish.
*  Yeah, that's it. That's, but that's in comedy. That's in everything, man. That's in everything.
*  There's always going to be people that think that way.
*  But comedy is not something that, that the public can vote out. The public can vote out hunting.
*  Right. So we start cannibalizing ourselves. That's true. I mean, you know, we could,
*  I'm not going to say we got some momentum going now, but we could lose it.
*  Yeah, it's possible. There's enough people that are ignorant to what hunting really is.
*  And enough people that actually eat meat that are ignorant to what hunting really is.
*  Exactly. I mean, it's like 96% of the people are eating meat, but I think if we explain what,
*  how hunting works and, and, and, but we have to have all hunters on that same page,
*  supporting each other. My wife was at dinner with some friends and one of her friends' husbands
*  was asking where, what I do. And she said, well, he's actually on an elk hunt right now.
*  And the guy was eating a steak and he goes, well, that's a Borant.
*  He's eating a steak. And she's laughing at him. She goes, you're eating a steak.
*  Yeah. Do you understand that you're eating a steak? It's crazy. And he, you know, he's from England.
*  The disconnect. They don't like over there, they don't hunt. So they get super confused.
*  Ricky. No, it wasn't Ricky with your face. It's not, but Ricky has no problem with people
*  hunting for food. Yeah. He has a problem with trophy hunting. Yeah. But I think he also has
*  a distorted understanding of what that is too. But people also lump it all on together. Yes,
*  they do. So especially over in Europe, I mean in England or wherever, but it's just like,
*  so that's what I say. Let's just, first of all, let's for all hunters be on the same team. We
*  certainly should be. Yes. And then get that message out correctly. That's all I've tried to do. Well,
*  one of the things that I try to do as much as possible is put those images of my cooking.
*  Yeah. You know, like, look, look at that fucking wild dark meat that I'm cooking and I'm eating
*  all the time, all the goddamn time. Well, and what I also try to do too, and I put one up today,
*  and I think, and I think you could even speak to this because we shared that emotion with your
*  bull, but there is, you know, I've said it before and maybe some hunters think I'm full of shit or,
*  or I don't know, I don't know, over emphasizing, but the feeling of,
*  I'm not happy when I kill. I mean, the killing of the animal is not like fun. So I know an animal's
*  dying. I've worked very hard to make that shot like you made the shot. But then when we got to
*  the animal and there were some, he was done, but it takes a while for the life to get all.
*  He was still moving a little bit and I shot him a second time while he was, I mean, he was dead.
*  He was gasping for air and the correct thing to do is to give him another shot.
*  But that moment was heavy. Yeah, it's heavy. It's heavy. It's heavy. And, you know,
*  at the end, we all took our hats off and we, we all like, we praised him and we,
*  we said like a little prayer when all the hunters got together. We all said, you know, thank you.
*  Thank you to the elk. We all took our hats off and bowed our heads. And the guides took some of
*  the grasses that these elk eat and they've been doing this as a tradition. They rolled it up
*  into like a bundle, like a meal, and they placed it on the remnants of the carcass. So like a.
*  The bull's last meal. Yeah. Like a thank you. A sign of that. And yeah. But even before that,
*  when we just approached your bull, it was, I mean, it was intense and real and
*  it wasn't, I mean, it wasn't happy. It's not happy. It was like. But it's happy when you make the
*  shot. It is. But people don't understand that that's because it's a relief because it's so,
*  it's so much tension and it's so difficult. Worked so hard to do that. Yeah. To make that. We talked
*  about what it takes to make that shot. I would like people to experience that because it's so
*  hard to put into words to be into that moment and to be that person that draws that bow back
*  and makes that shot. Yeah. It's so hard to put that into words. I don't even think the video
*  does it justice. It's so hard for a person on the outside to get it. I know you'll, you do have to
*  be there and you have to watch an animal die. And, uh, it's, I don't know. I mean, it's a heavy
*  moment, but so when I put up that, like me with my bowl and my hand on it, that's not contrived.
*  That's real. That's real. I'm, I feel real emotion and I respect and honor and love the journey of
*  that hunt. And the fact I took the animal's life is part of it, but that doesn't, it's not lost on
*  the fact that I know I took it and it means it's, that's a big deal. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
*  we did that to the, that elk as he was passing to same thing. Um, and I think about it every time
*  I eat it. Yeah. You know, and that's, I think that's the special bond hunters have with their
*  food, their meat. I mean, specifically that, that the guy who is aberrant,
*  his comment, yeah. It's like, what are you talking about? I mean, literally carving into a steak
*  while we were saying that. Right. So hunters have that connection. And I saw this video today.
*  This is what drives me crazy. And I don't, I don't want to go back, rehash everything we've ever
*  talked about, but I saw this video today. Who had it up? Um, anyway, these vegans were set up
*  in front of this, I guess we get hamburgers. Oh, that big guy burst through the line. Yeah. Yeah.
*  So when do hunters ever like get confrontational and violent with people who don't want to eat meat?
*  Right. When does that happen? Well, they think somehow or another by blocking this burger stand
*  that they're changing the world. They're just trying to be activists. You know, they're trying
*  to get a message out and most of them were quit. They're going to quit veganism and they're going
*  to start eating meat again because of their health. Yeah. That's the truth. It's some ridiculous
*  number. Google this. What number, I think they said the number of vegans and vegetarians that
*  eat meat when they're drunk is something outrageous. It's like close to 90%. Yeah. Well, how many,
*  how many vegans wind up quitting and eating meat? I wonder if they've ever done a study on that.
*  This is like a big thing because you know, there's been a movement, sort of a movement and
*  people have different success rates with being a vegan, but Cam Newton, who is a quarterback of the
*  Carolina Panthers, big dude, 6'6", 250, 260, he went vegan and he cannot get healthy. He cannot,
*  he's been injured. He's, I mean, the face of the franchise, probably a hundred million dollar contract,
*  I mean, made it to the Superbowl, but since just been on a decline and it's like almost
*  hand in hand with the change into vegan. Well, you know that guy, Dr. Sean Baker, he's the advocate
*  of the carnivore diet. He marks all these people that were originally in that Game Changers
*  documentary that James Cameron put out. A shit ton of them quit before the movie came out and they
*  had to pull them out of the movie because they were vegan and because of health reasons, they
*  had to quit. It's an indoctrination movie and it's also, it's extremely biased and it's not focusing on
*  all of the various problems that people have. It's only focused on the positive aspects of it
*  and distorting the reality of those positive issues, particularly like the strong man who's
*  on a fuckload of steroids. They forget that part. And then all these other athletes, like these,
*  you're not talking, and even the strong men, he's not like an elite strong man. You're not talking
*  about some, like when I had Robert Oberst in here, he's like, everybody eats the same shit. He's like
*  meat and rice. Like they eat meat. All those strong men eat the same thing, the real strongmen,
*  the ones who actually win the competitions. What do you got, Jamie?
*  Jamie Boudreau It's a very controversial research that came out, but it's a very repeated number of
*  84% of vegans and vegetarians end up going back to eating meat at some level.
*  Right before they die.
*  Jamie Boudreau Folks, we're omnivores. We're omnivores. We exist better. We are more healthy
*  on an animal and vegetable diet. And if you don't want to kill animals, please eat eggs,
*  eat oysters, eat shrimp and lobsters. They're fucking heartless, soulless little monsters
*  that live at the bottom of the ocean. But if you want to be healthy, just eating only vegetables is
*  a fucking hard road. It's a hard road. And this idea that you're going to save the world, listen,
*  large scale agriculture is fucking terrible for the environment. It's terrible. You want to like,
*  all of our agriculture, when they talk about greenhouse gases, we talked about this the other
*  day, 9% of all greenhouse gases is because of agriculture. Less than half of that is because
*  of meat. Less than half of that is because of beef. Elk? How much is that? It's fucking zero.
*  You have way, if you just eat elk, you have way less impact on the greenhouse gases than you do
*  if you're a vegetarian. And that's a fact. If you're eating grain, not only that, you're eating
*  grain, man, you're responsible for a fuckload of death, whether you like it or not. Those
*  monstrous combines, those indiscriminate-
*  Ravids, deer fawns, mice-
*  Jamie Boudreau Forget about insects.
*  Jamie Boudreau Birds.
*  Jamie Boudreau Yeah.
*  Jamie Boudreau And then the pesticides, the displacement of wildlife. You're not supposed
*  to have enormous fields filled with fucking corn and grain, wheat and all that shit. That's not
*  normal. That's not healthy. Ravids, deer fawns, mice-
*  Jamie Boudreau Yeah. There's definitely animals dying from that. But for us to live, animals are
*  going to die. No matter how you want to look at it, at some point, whether it was to build your
*  house or build the road you used to get to work, or the fields that you eat your salad and corn and
*  wheat from, animals dying for us to live. That's just how it works. You cannot live on this earth
*  and not have animals die because of that. Jamie Boudreau
*  And I like that these people that are vegans are doing this and they think this way because they
*  care, because they don't want suffering. They want these animals to live. Look, I don't want factory
*  farming. I think it's terrible. None of that appeals to me at all. When I see chickens stuffed
*  into cages like that, I don't want to have anything to do with that. I want a boy cat.
*  Every step of the way, when I see pigs stuffed into those cages next to each other,
*  shitting on the floor, I don't want to have any part of that. I want to boycott all of that.
*  Same thing with beef, same thing with anything that's factory farmed. But that's not what we're
*  doing. Jamie Boudreau
*  No, no. There are some good cattle ranchers that have good operations. That's not the factory farm.
*  They're doing it right. It's like more people are more in tune with that. One of my sons works at a
*  meat shop at a grocery store. He said people ask all the time, where's this meat from?
*  How was it raised? So people are getting, and it's like supporting ethical cattle ranching.
*  I'm all for that. That's awesome. Jamie Boudreau
*  That's one of the great things about one of my sponsors is ButcherBox. And ButcherBox has a total
*  commitment to humanely raised animals, 100% grass fed, grass finished beef, no antibiotics,
*  no hormones ever. So they have these relationships with cattle ranchers and they use sustainable
*  ranching and sustainable farming. So when you're buying meat from a good source like that,
*  you're cutting out all the stuff that I hate about farming, about factory farming.
*  Jamie Boudreau Me too. Yeah, they're a good outfit.
*  One thing I did also see is, because I killed three bulls this year. And it's weird because
*  people will say, well, there's no way you can eat all that. So I said, well, how good are you at
*  math? So I go through, I got five people in my family, average person eats 220 pounds of meat a
*  year. My family eats more than that, but just say for that. So that's 1,100 pounds of meat.
*  As we know, say a big bull elk, you might get 300 pounds. So if I killed three, that's 900 pounds
*  of meat. That's still less than I'm going to eat. So it's like people would be like, it'd be better
*  if you killed maybe just one bull. And if you bought the rest, then I wouldn't have a problem
*  with it. That seems weird. It doesn't make any sense. They also don't understand you have freezers,
*  you keep everything. I also share it with friends. Every time I kill a bull, I have a ton of friends
*  that are lined up. There's nothing I love more than giving away meat. I love it. I've always said as a
*  hunter, we are providers. That's how it's always been. So there's a certain sense of satisfaction.
*  And I don't know if it's honoring the animal. I don't know what it feels like, but it feels like
*  to me, it feels right to give me and have somebody say, man, that elk you gave me,
*  that was the best meat I've ever had. I just bought a ton of freezer bags so I can give away
*  to friends. I get elk sausage made and when in Utah, the butcher that handles the meat out there
*  makes great jerky. So I get a bunch of jerky made out and hand that out to people. It's awesome.
*  I love it. It makes me happy. When I get text messages from people, dude, we made elk meatballs
*  and look at the roast I made. My friend, Tom Papa, he makes bread and he makes his own handmade
*  sourdough bread. It's amazing. It's delicious. And he brings bread, I give him meat.
*  Perfect.
*  Yeah. We share pictures and shit. It makes me really happy when one of my friends sends me a meal
*  and I know that they're eating an animal that I harvested myself.
*  Oh man.
*  It's awesome.
*  Yeah. It's amazing. And it's high octane. It might screw up your sober October because it's
*  so powerful.
*  Well, you know, Ian Edwards is going to eat elk.
*  Is he?
*  Yes.
*  He needs to.
*  Ian, who's been a vegan forever, he said that he-
*  He's falling asleep.
*  He falls asleep. If you just look at him funny, he falls asleep. But he said that he'll eat a
*  piece of my elk because I killed it myself. So we're trying to figure out a time we can
*  come over the house. I want to cook it perfectly.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I want to have it all set up for when I'm going to rock his world. I'm going to film it too.
*  Yeah.
*  Because it'd be the first meat he's eaten. Well, you said that you did that with your pastor.
*  Yeah.
*  But you have to make sure you don't give him too much though, right?
*  Right. Right. Yeah. He came over. He'd been a vegan for about 13 years and yeah, he ate,
*  I don't know how he felt the next day, but it's like giving- if you gave your dog
*  too- I mean, you can't mix up the food like have it, I don't know, it can be too rich.
*  Yes.
*  Basically. Because people aren't used to that much richness in their meat.
*  Right. Especially the guys who's eating carrots.
*  Yeah.
*  Who's eating yams and shit.
*  It's going to be like the polar opposite.
*  Yeah. I want to put in a kitchen here. I want to figure out how to put a kitchen in here and then
*  cook for people. I mean, I think like have something where I have a Traeger set up with
*  a pipe that goes through the roof so the smoke can go through the roof.
*  Perfect.
*  Fuck yeah. I would love to do that and have a stove top where I could sear steaks.
*  Oh God. It's so good.
*  Just cook for people. Just let them know this is what it's like.
*  Yeah. They'll be going down shooting a bow before you know it.
*  It's a long road though.
*  Oh my God.
*  What's interesting, it's like the road from you coming over my house or you coming into the studio
*  the first time many, many years ago and getting me that Hoyt and then showing me how to shoot
*  and then taking me bear hunting and taking me elk hunting and all these reps and years and years
*  and years of practice that leads to like two weeks ago. That's what's crazy about it.
*  Yeah. You had a shortened journey.
*  Oh yeah. Way shortened.
*  Because you had, like you said, you had so many encounters. You had almost a lifetime of encounters
*  in one hunt for some people.
*  Particularly Lanai. I think Lanai helps you a lot.
*  It does. It does.
*  Because you're shooting at these little ninjas. They're fast as shit. They're so delicious and
*  they must know it.
*  They're so fast.
*  And they're so pressured. They're the most pressured animals on earth.
*  And you get so many stalks and so many hunts in when you're there. I mean, those hunts that we
*  do every year in Lanai, that to me, I feel like that's my like training camp.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Tightens up.
*  It's still, I mean, tell me what you thought about like when you're elk hunting.
*  Because they're still like, when do you move fast? When do you slow down? What you can get away with?
*  That's still, Lanai helps that. But it's almost like I've noticed each species is different as
*  far as what you can get away with. And elk are, they're noisy. So you can make a little bit of
*  noise. They're big animals. They're herd animals. So it's almost like each species has its own
*  specialty.
*  Yeah. Lanai, you can't get away with shit. You can't get away with shit. Most of what me and Dudley
*  did before I shot my deer this year is crawl. It took forever to get to where we were going.
*  It took like an hour and a half for just crawling. Just slowly crawling, creeping and crawling.
*  Because those animals evolved around tigers. So they're all just like completely wild.
*  And then you add on top of that the fact they're incredibly pressured because they have to hunt
*  them. They think there's this close to 30,000 of them on that island, which is just bananas.
*  So they've got people, it's great for the people that live there because they get fresh, delicious,
*  organic, wild meat all the time. I mean, everybody on that island is eating axis deer
*  left and right. I mean, it must be some of the fucking healthiest people on earth.
*  Even the Four Seasons serves it.
*  Yes. Those burgers, man, those axis deer burgers are sensational.
*  Do we have those sliders?
*  Oh, so good.
*  God.
*  But where else on earth can you hunt in this incredible tropical paradise and then stay at
*  the Four Seasons?
*  And run a mountain.
*  Yeah. And run the mountain, right? Well, you ran more than you bargained.
*  Yeah, that was far. I mean, I asked the guys there, I said,
*  hey, how far is it if I go from here to here? And they're like, oh, seven miles.
*  No, it was like 15. It was a grind and humid. Oh my God.
*  Well, luckily you're accustomed to that.
*  Yeah, yeah. No, it was good.
*  It was good.
*  Well, I was talking to a friend of mine and I was saying, well, you know, Cam, when he first
*  started running, he had a hard time running a mile. And they were like, what?
*  Like, yeah, that's how it works.
*  Yeah. It was, yeah. And I was, when I first started, I mean, I was okay in high school
*  because I did all the sports and we'd do maybe a 10K during the summer.
*  But then after high school, then I was just like, I thought it was really cool. I could buy beer.
*  So it was like 21. I'd swing by the Riverview Market on the way home and buy a six pack of
*  tall boys. And, you know, I thought that was cool. I could pound some, you know, Coors Light.
*  And I'm like, oh, I'm a stud now. And then I started, you know, to get fat. And I'm like,
*  I didn't, nobody cared. It was like, I didn't have, I wasn't living up to any expectation.
*  I was actually living down to expectations. And so I went through a phase there where
*  I was just like, not healthy. I was still hunting, but no real sense of, I don't know. I didn't have,
*  I wasn't accountable for anything or to anybody. Didn't have any high expectations. So Mike,
*  whatever. And I remember I signed up for the Butte to Butte 10K and I got there to Fifth Street
*  Public Market. It's about five miles. I had another mile left and I quit. And I'm just like,
*  this sucks. And so that was, I think from there, I'm like, nobody feels good. You know, you don't
*  feel good when you're in that place. So it was a slow grind, but I got to where I just kept doing
*  more and more and more than I did my first marathon, like in 2002. When you quit the next day,
*  how shitty did you feel? I felt shitty all the time. So it wasn't like, I mean, it wasn't,
*  you know, I was living with four guys and we'd just drink beer all the time. And, you know,
*  I remember this one guy got DUI, like two DUIs in three weeks. I think both in my truck,
*  at least I wasn't driving. I would never drive, you know, I mean, I never got caught, but it was
*  just like, just stupid. So it was just like another disappointment. It wasn't, didn't stand out.
*  It was just, there was no success. No, no, it was just, I don't know. I didn't have anything going.
*  It's like, that's where my life was. So it's just like, what changed?
*  I don't know. Well, something must've changed because now you're running 240 miles.
*  You're probably the most successful bow hunter on the planet earth. I mean, that's, that's a giant,
*  I mean, you have 800,000 Instagram followers, something fucking changed. Like what changed,
*  how did it go from you being this guy who quit after five miles and you drinking beer all the
*  time and you hanging out with a bunch of near dwells. And then all of a sudden you are an
*  inspiration to millions of people. Like how does, what's the shift? I think having kids,
*  you know? So, um, got married and then Tanner was born in 93.
*  And then it's like, man, it's not cool being a loser dad. I mean, that's not that, that it's,
*  it's one thing being a loser, being a loser dad, cause now I'm affecting other people's lives.
*  And so I'm like, I thought I gotta, I gotta be an example. You know, I gotta, I want my kids,
*  every parent wants their kids to, to have more than they had and had a better life than they had.
*  And so, you know, my dad wasn't around and, uh, you know, I always remember wanting him around and
*  just, you know, wanting to see him. So I'm like, maybe that. And then it was, I think I wanted my
*  kids, I wanted to challenge them. Um, so I remember my first marathon, I also made Tanner, he was seven
*  and yes, it was 2002. I think early he would have been no, must. Yeah. I don't know. Anyway,
*  he was young. I think he just turned eight actually. And I made him do the half marathon.
*  So I ran the marathon. He did the half marathon at eight at eight. She's good. Got like two Oh two,
*  which is a good half marathon for, especially for an eight year old. So then I started introducing
*  my kids to these challenges. Cause I'm like, you know, I remember my life growing up and it,
*  it wasn't comfortable, but not, not in a positive way. And I'm like, well, I think these kids,
*  if they don't have challenges introduced, they're going to be soft. They're going to have it too
*  easy. So I would, you know, that's why they've, they've run marathons and they've done these
*  things is cause that's kind of how they grew up. So I think it was kind of a combination of being
*  a parent wanting my kids to, to have a successful path. And then just saying, I didn't want to be a
*  loser dad. So just kind of evolved from there. Didn't Truett run a hundred miles with you ran
*  what'd he get to 80, 85, 90, Jesus Christ. Yeah. His knee blew up. No, no, his will broke.
*  Yeah. I thought he had a knee issue. Probably. I mean, but yeah,
*  all sorts of shit happens. I mean, you hurt, but no, he, God, it was like, that was just this past
*  summer. And, you know, cause running a hundred miles in 24 hours is that's something. I mean,
*  I could never do that at, at he's 22, I think there's no way I could have done that then. I mean,
*  it takes mental usually don't have that mental strength until you're older. You've been through
*  life and you've been beat down and disappointed and, and had your heart broke. And that's when
*  you get like, Hey, this pain is just temporary. This is for one day. I can get through anything
*  for a day. Well, when you're 22, it's life's point of reference. No, it's great. It's been gravy the
*  whole time, but to run a hundred miles in 24 hours is you can tell that to anybody and it'd be like,
*  God dang, congratulations. You know, so he wanted to do that. That was his goal. So I said, all right,
*  I go, if you get to 60 miles in 12 hours, you can grind out 40 in the second 12.
*  And I said, that would be good. So he got to 60 miles in 12 hours on, on pace. Everything was good.
*  And it's just too pain. He's like, I think he got 31 miles, maybe, or almost 31. I think it was 90
*  points something just, you know, he ended up take trying to take a couple of naps was in the truck
*  for a while. And I remember I'd be like, so what are we doing? I'd go by the truck because I'd never
*  stopped. And so it's a course. It's a, it's a loop. 1.1 mile loop. Oh my God. And you do it a
*  hundred times. Right. You do it for 24 hours. And so I'd come by and I'd be, I gave him a little bit,
*  little while to chill out. And, but then I'd be like, what are we doing here? And whatever, for
*  whatever reason he got 90, which is still 90 miles is a long ass way. That's like San Diego,
*  but it's not a hundred. So I'm like, so we, we joke around too, cause I am, you know, I'm supportive,
*  but also, I mean, I, I am how I am. So I'm like, I go, God, you couldn't have got 10 more miles,
*  10 more miles. And you would have been in the a hundred mile club. Cause he, he, I got this
*  little wood chip. It's like the, it's like the smallest little token you could get. It's not
*  even like Goggins coin right here, but it's half the size of the wood chip. And it says, uh, 100
*  miles. I'm like, Hey, do you have a chip like that? Oh no, no, no, no. You only got 90. They don't
*  make 90 mile chips. And so like we said, it's like, God, the worst part about that is to get
*  those last 10, you got to get the first 90 and that hurts. So I think he's going to hit his big
*  goal was to get a hundred miles in 24 hours, 24 hours, which he didn't get. And then also qualify
*  for Boston, which he did. So I think we're going to, um, what do you have to do to qualify for
*  Boston? Um, for his age age group, he had to run under three hours in a marathon. So he ran the
*  Eugene marathon in two 57. Wow. So he qualified. That's amazing. Yeah. That's a good, that's fast.
*  Yeah. Jamie's shaking his head. Yes. Yeah. He ran that would have been, that's like six 44.
*  That's fast. Miles for 26. That's fucking fast. Yeah. So the world record, they're trying to get
*  under two, right? Under two. Yeah. And they use like special shoes and shit. And those guys are
*  amazing. Yeah. They're, they're so, I bought these souls, these insoles that are supposed to be like
*  springy insoles, you know, those things. I don't think they do a goddamn thing. I really don't.
*  I tried them and then I took them out and I'm like, these fucking things, they're just hard.
*  Yeah. They're just hard. It's, are they supposed to do anything? Springy insults. I don't, I don't.
*  The end of the day, you have to run. You got to grind. You just got to keep going. That's,
*  you got to grind it out. Especially when you're going up hills. I don't think they do a goddamn
*  thing. Cause you're on your toes, your toes the whole way anyway. Yeah. It's, yeah, I don't know.
*  What I found is nothing really helps. I mean, it running is just running. I mean, the better shape
*  you're in, probably the more enjoyable it is, the more, if you can, I usually 99% of the time I'm by
*  myself. So I'm, it's like, it's, I heard you talking with Red Ben about yoga and it's, it's
*  sort of like that. It's a meditation. It's like you're out and it's just like, I feel, I feel good.
*  I feel healthy. I feel centered. If I can run with somebody like Courtney, then that's just a, like
*  Christmas, you know? You're also running out there when you run Mount Pixel, you're, you're running up
*  there and the clean air and beautiful view. It's like you're getting it just a beautiful dose of
*  nature. Yeah. It's healthy all the way around. And it's, so I just look at it as like, Hey, I'm doing
*  this. If I get to run with anybody else and it's, it's a distraction, that's just kind of, you know,
*  the exception rather than the rule. How many days a week you run in these days? Every day.
*  Every day. Sunday too. Every day. Every day. Jesus Christ. Yeah. I always say rest days are for
*  pussies. Well, the thing is you're doing the same thing every day too. You don't even mix it up.
*  Yeah. I mix it up. Yeah. You know, like I'll do kickboxing one day, yoga the next day. I, for me,
*  I have to mix it up. If I don't mix it up, I just, I feel crazy. The way I've found it,
*  because I used to bike, I used to do all these things, but nothing, nothing compares to running.
*  If you just want to get not only just, just for fitness, but discipline, running, running sucks
*  for everyone. So it's like, just to be able to get out there and get in a groove, that's discipline.
*  And that's, I've used that discipline for the rest of my life. So, but it's, you know, the building
*  block is, and it makes shooting a bow. So we talked about shooting a bow as discipline.
*  That's fun. Yeah. If you can't get out and shoot a bow, it's like, come on.
*  Yeah. It's, it's way more fun than running. Yeah. Right. So that's, that's why I look at it. It's
*  like, you know, cause I always say run, lift, shoot, lifting. You get a good pump, whatever.
*  You got some music going, you can get kind of jacked up. Shooting is just fun. It's running.
*  That's the key to the discipline. So, um, yeah, it's, you're doing something to your mind.
*  You're forcing your mind to, to, to, it strengthens that ability to get in that groove. And yeah,
*  yeah. You know, sometimes I hear my breath when I'm running and, uh, you know, when I'm really
*  pushing it, when I'm going up a hill and it's, it's so satisfying that you could keep up the pace.
*  Yeah. You know, there's something about keeping up that pace. It's so satisfying and me, I always
*  run with the dog, you know, so it's like, I got my buddy, he comes running back to me. I'm so happy.
*  He's so happy, man. I had a film how he jumps out of the truck. Cause when I bring him to the
*  trail and he jumps out of the truck, his whole body shaking. And then I opened the gate and he
*  just jumps. He leaves. If you could have that energy. Oh my God. That would be, that's how,
*  that's how cash is too. It's like, no matter where you go, he wants to, if you're going outside,
*  he wants to be first outside. If you're going inside, he wants to be first back inside.
*  How happy is he? Yeah. When you see this dog, he's so happy. Oh, Marshall is,
*  I mean, I tried, I told you, I tried to take his stuff animal and he's like, yeah, go ahead. Just
*  let me know when you're done. He's just like sitting there with his mouth closed, just looking
*  at me. I had it in my mouth. Like my dog would be like- Did you put it in your mouth? That disgusting
*  stuffed animal? Yeah. Just, just the teeth. Just my, just my teeth. Dude, you're going to get a disease.
*  A disease for Marshall. That's how they say, don't they say a dog's mouth? How can a dog's mouth-
*  It's cleaner than a person. Yeah. They lick their balls. I don't know how that works.
*  Oh, that's Cam and- Oh, there he is. Right. See that little thing. Marshall is so nice.
*  I've been taking him to work with me because otherwise, you know, when we run, we run in the
*  morning and then he's just bored all day, waiting for everybody to come home. So he comes here and
*  hangs out with everybody. Oh, he's so, but yeah. So I took that thing from him and he's like,
*  not possessive. He's like, yeah, just let me know when you're done. I never had a dog with him before.
*  No. He's so sweet. So nice. I'm so used to pit bulls and I had Mastiffs and all these
*  big scary dogs. And he's just a different thing, man. I have to remind myself.
*  He's a big sweetie. A special dog. I don't know if all, are all retrievers like that?
*  Supposedly, Goldens are all like that. They're all just like Commander David Fravor, who was on the
*  other day. He said he's had five Goldens. He said, I wouldn't get another dog. They're the best dogs.
*  He just loves them. I mean, I get it now. I mean, I never had a dog like him. He's so nice to
*  everybody. Everybody is his best friend. He just runs from one person to the next.
*  The only thing he does that I don't like is he jumps on people still. I'm trying to get him to
*  stop doing that, but it's just because he loves them. Yeah. Yeah. He's not, it's not malicious
*  for anything like that. But yeah, I've always thought that if I could have the same attitude as
*  my dog running, I mean, yeah, I mean, so happy he gets tired after maybe five or six and then he'll
*  be like lagging back. But up until then, it's like, man, he's loving it. So I want it trots
*  with you for about five or six miles. And then he's like, this motherfucker is ridiculous. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hey dad, when are we going home? Right. He doesn't have the, the, I mean,
*  do you get him water? Do you bring water with him? No, but we go to the river. Oh yeah. Yeah. No,
*  but for them, is it clean? Yeah. Their stomachs are not like our side. I know. Obviously. Yeah.
*  Licking their balls and shit. When Marsha and I run, sometimes we run in the heat. Like sometimes,
*  you know, around here it gets hot as fuck. So I have one of those collapsible dog bowls and I just
*  put it in a backpack and I'll bring a hydro flask, a 64 ounce hydro flask. And a couple of times
*  during the run, I'll pull out that collapsible dog bowl and pour him some water and he'll drink it.
*  And you know, that makes a big difference. And then I pour some on his head, rub it on his head,
*  cool him off. Just cool him down. Yeah. Yeah. Cause we'll run it's a hundred degrees outside.
*  He's got a lot of hair. Oh God. He's so thick. Yeah. You can get them shaved like a lion. Yeah.
*  Like a poodle does like they do with poodles. Yeah. When I brush them, it's ridiculous. I have,
*  well, I have a brush that I brush them with, but I also have these gloves. They're like brush
*  gloves and you're petting them. And then it's just like you have hair mitts, you know, it just comes
*  off. Man, if it was up to me, I'd have fucking a hundred dogs. Yeah. I love them. Me too. So,
*  and that's another thing that anti-hunters don't understand. Right. They say, well,
*  how come you don't kill, kill your dog? Mike, it's my fucking dog. What are you talking about?
*  My dog's a squirrel murderer, by the way, that's sweet Marshall. He'll murk a squirrel. Really?
*  Fucking heartbeat. Yeah. We had to keep him from murking my daughter's rabbit.
*  He's, uh, he's got real issues. Yeah. Look at that. See, that's just a hunting instinct.
*  His lovable's Marshall is. Is that the one that says, uh, every day after calm the demons within?
*  What is it? What is it? The, uh, it's the circle of life. Yeah. But there's another one. Go to the,
*  there's another one. Did you see the lion back behind him? Yeah. Did you do that on purpose?
*  No, no, that's a, it's a painting I bought in Utah. I know, but like, see, that's a hunter,
*  like different levels of hunting. Keep that one right there. Click on that one. Scroll down so
*  you could see the, uh, the caption. Every day I must tame the demon within me.
*  He looks so guilty. He looks so guilty. He's like, please, please just open up the door
*  or his mark. This fucking stupid rabbit. Yeah. Oh my God. That's so cute. I mean,
*  but what's interesting is like those retrievers, they have what they call soft mouths. Yeah. They
*  don't tear things apart. They hold things gently and bring them to you. Yeah. Like even squirrels
*  when he's killed a squirrel, he'll bring me a squirrel. It's not even fucked up. Really? Yeah.
*  Yeah. No, that's their genetics. I mean, like Johnny cash, my, my mastiff, when he was alive,
*  he got into my chicken coop one day, he tore a hole through the chicken coop. So the, you know,
*  the chicken wire fence, he tore it apart so he could get his body in there and went in there and
*  he murked eight chickens, eight or nine. By the time I got to him, my wife is screaming,
*  why is Johnny in the chicken coop? I'm like, Johnny's in the chicken coop. That's not good.
*  He tore a hole through the chicken coop. So that was a totally different experience. Yeah.
*  There was no soft mouth going on there. It was just carnage. You see, we just have a
*  bad old time killing chickens. What's up? Oh, Jesus. Jesus. Soft mouth. You reminded me.
*  What is this asshole doing? He's playing with this tiger. Oh, it's his tiger. And it doesn't,
*  it looks like it's about to fuck him up. And it does. Oh, so where is this at? I don't know.
*  It's just some gif I saw going around. I mean, I guess if you are nice to these things and train
*  them, you can get away with this for a little bit. Yeah. But what happens is then that lion
*  will probably kill that guy. I mean, that's what always happens. I mean, cause they're still,
*  just like Marshall, they still, I don't know, maybe not, maybe he's whatever, but you always
*  hear this, that they had this pet, whatever. And well, Marshall with a rabbit for sure. Yeah.
*  That's how that lion is. Like if I've like let Marshall play with the rabbit, oh, Marshall,
*  the rabbit's your friend. Then I go and take a shit and come back to see blood and rabbit hair.
*  And then that guilty look on Marshall. I couldn't take it dad. He was taunting me.
*  It's genetics. Yeah. It's, uh, I don't know why people think it's cute to wrestle with lions
*  and do all that crazy shit. It seems so silly to me. I mean, they're kind of cool. I mean,
*  that would be fun. I guess. I mean, it would, it's like animals are amazing, but don't be surprised
*  when it can rip your juggler out. Well, when we were in Thailand, you can go to these tiger
*  sanctuaries and, um, you can pet these tigers. And what's interesting is, uh, you would go there
*  and we would pet the little baby ones and they would be like really calm and, and tame and playful,
*  you know, because they're little babies, but they're super energetic, but they don't, they're not
*  trying to hurt you. They're just, they're just playing with each other and rolling around and
*  they're like kittens. But then you go to the ones that are just a little older, like maybe a year
*  old and they're a little sketchy. They're just looking around and then there's a guy with a
*  stick and they're, they're keeping you at a distance with them. Like they don't want you
*  getting too close to them. They worry about, they might Jack you. Then when you get to the older
*  lions, like the, or the older tigers, the full grown tigers, they're all drugged. And it's a real
*  bummer, man. They're all lying there like, like half out of it and people take pictures with them
*  and these things are on heroin, man. They're just laying there completely, 100% drug. Like there's
*  no if, ands or buts about it. They barely keep their head up and people are smiling and putting
*  their hands on it and taking selfies. I don't like that. It's weird, man. I don't like that.
*  It's weird. I like, I like animals, wild animals be wild. Yeah, me too. That's, I mean, that's,
*  that's what's cool about them. Like, I mean, we've, we've both experienced bears in the wild and I've
*  never seen a mountain lion in the wild, but I did see one in Montecito and Santa, Santa Barbara. So
*  I want on the street. But I mean, if I did see one, I would think it's fucking cool to be in the woods,
*  like hunting and like Dudley was 20 yards away from one, stumble across one. It's cool that
*  they're out there. Yeah. You know, I love the fact that they're a real thing, but I don't want to pet
*  them. Yeah. Now you gotta respect them. I don't want to have nothing to do with petting those
*  things are killers. Those things are killers. You see that picture we have outside now with the
*  Hollywood sign. Yeah, it is. That motherfucker's living in Griffiths park, a big ass cat with
*  giant forearms. See his forearms. Things are killing machines. Yeah. And he's just out there
*  keeping, keeping the coyotes in check. Yeah. Merking all those deer. So a few have died recently
*  because of rat poison. Yeah. What lions? Yeah. Yeah. Mountain lions. Yeah. Yeah. It's a bummer,
*  man. There's a lot of lions here in California. A lot. They get ahold of the rat poison because
*  people poison the rats and then they eat the rats or the coyotes eat the rats and then they eat the
*  coyotes and they get that rat poison in them and they want up dying. And another one got killed
*  recently. Um, trying to cross the street. He was trying to cross the highway and they think he
*  might've been getting chased by another cat and the cat chased him right into traffic and bam.
*  They're territorial. That's what, that's what, that's why they have to keep spreading out so
*  much is because they won't overlap. So those males will get a certain territory and then the younger
*  ones have to go usually further into town. Do you hear what happened about the woman who had a farm?
*  She has a, um, an alpaca farm in Malibu and a mountain lion just decided to start merking her
*  alpacas, killed a shit load of them. And yeah, killed like eight of them or something crazy
*  like that. And a goat killed a goat too. Didn't even eat them. Just went on a killing spree.
*  Nothing's going to eat a goat. Goats are terrible. Are they really? Yeah. I tried to,
*  that one time back in the early nineties, Ted Nugent was playing in Eugene and he was with
*  the damn Yankees and we're like, we had this place that had these feral goats down by Roseburg. And
*  so we're like, they wanted him killed. And so we asked Wayne asked Ted somehow got a hold of them.
*  Oh no, he's going to come to the Bo rack because he's been bow hunting forever. It's like, Hey,
*  you want to go bow hunting goats with us? So long story short, we went down there, killed a bunch of
*  goats. He had a concert that night, but I had a truck full of dead goats, a little Toyota two-wheel
*  drive, little blue thunder, we called it. And I tried to use those goats. This is before 94. So
*  you could bear bait still in Oregon. Try to use them as bear bait. The bears were like,
*  we're not eating that shit. Bears didn't want the goat. It would not eat the goats. What? No,
*  no. So goats. Yeah. It doesn't surprise me that lion won't eat the goats either. So goat meat,
*  not the best, but they say that goats, like some, some cultures love goat. Yeah, I think so. Yeah.
*  That's probably the ones that won't eat cows. I don't know. I think they just cook it. They
*  have ways of cooking it. Yeah. You know, I've never had, well, I know I've had goat before at
*  a Mexican restaurant. I had like goat tacos. Yeah. And it was good. Really? Yeah. But I think if you
*  braise it, slow cook it with spices, yeah. You Traeger it to like, you know, put it on like 165
*  degrees for eight hours or something like that with the right spices. Yeah. You can make anything
*  taste pretty damn good. That's what Jen, she cooked something up in bear camp this year. It was bear.
*  I think it was loin maybe. I don't know, but anyway, cooked it for 12 or 20 hours, something
*  crazy. God, it was so good. Yeah. Follow up the back ham maybe. Oh yeah. That's right. I remember
*  that. Yeah. She was talking about that. So good. Yeah. Yeah. She marinated it. Yeah. People say,
*  I'd like to see people who say, well, do you eat bear have a plate of, of Jen Rivet's bear meat?
*  My God. That's all they want. What, um, Ronella was talking about on his podcast. And when the
*  pioneers came out West, they were shooting deers for their skins and bears for the meat. Really?
*  Yeah. Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah. They were shooting bears for meat, black bears. Yeah.
*  That they preferred black bears for their meat. It's a delicious animal. People don't know. No,
*  they don't know. And they think you're lying for some reason that you can't eat bear. You don't
*  want to eat bear. Like you don't know what you're talking about. If Jen Rivet cooks you some bear,
*  I defy you. I defy you. If you like to eat meat, her stir fry, you'd have to be a bear stir fry.
*  That is fantastic. You'd have to be a pathological liar to say it wasn't good. If you don't like meat,
*  maybe you won't like it. But if you do like meat, you'd be like, wow, this is good. I say it tastes
*  like, like a, it's almost like a cow fucked up deer. It's like a combination of like venison and
*  beef. Yeah. Yeah. It's yeah. I mean, the way she cooks it is, you know, I think there's a typical
*  taste of bear or does like people always say who, who have a hat like that. They say it's greasy
*  because it's more like porkish kind of, I, there's some fat in it. It's like, it's just different,
*  but the way she does it in the trailer or stir fry, it's incredible. It's incredible. Yeah.
*  It's a really delicious animal that speaking to that hunt. That's what I, I want to get Goggins on
*  his first hunt, just like I took you on your first bow hunt. So that's, that's, that's where you can
*  take them to John Jen's place. That'd be perfect. Try to get a bear. Good, good first bow kill.
*  Has he shot a bow at all? Yeah, I got him a bow. Has he been shooting? I don't know if he had,
*  he shot one. He came and worked out with me. He's got the best fucking Instagram stories ever.
*  Oh my God. Those videos. I know. I love it. Nothing ever gets done by being a bitch.
*  I was, I was reading one of his text messages he sent me yesterday. He just sends the most ridiculous
*  check. You showed me the one, you showed me one like not too long ago is every couple of months.
*  I got a new one. Yeah. Yeah. I love it. I love it. They wake you up too, man. I wake me up. I
*  start doing chin ups as soon as I get those messages. I love his attitude. There's a few
*  people who, um, I love them as people, like, you know, just they're good people, just hardworking,
*  but I'm in love with their spirit. It's like his spirit, Choco spirit, Courtney spirit, their spirit.
*  It's like, it's, it's amazing. Yeah. It's, it's, and he's like one of those guys that
*  it's never going to waver. Right. You know what you're going to get.
*  You get inspiration from it. I do. I get fuel from it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just, even having the
*  chance to train with them, it's like, man, just feel lucky to, to see him in action and see
*  him change from David to Goggins. Right. And it happens. It becomes the Hulk. Oh my God. It
*  happened. I watched it and it's like, I thought, well, maybe this is just kind of like a,
*  whatever, maybe just a thing, but it was real. It's like when, when shit got hard,
*  he got into this different zone and it was like, he got better. He got better, got tougher. Yeah,
*  he did. It was like, so what'd you guys do? You ran like 30 miles. Yeah. 35,
*  35 miles. Yeah. And then you went back and lifted. Yep. And, and we shot bows too, but all that same
*  day. But during that race, it was kind of cold and, and snowy. I think it was spitting snow,
*  but rainy, it was soaking wet. And he, I remember like a mile 22, he, something was happening with
*  his feet and he had to take his shoes off and untie his shoes. And it's like, normally that's
*  not a good sign. I mean, if people are messing with their shoes 22 miles into 30, it's like,
*  God, this is not, you know, cause you know, your feet are going to get torn up. Right. So it's like,
*  you just kind of your feet, they could be bleeding torn up. It's like, yeah, this is what happens.
*  And he's done a lot. So, so I'm like, man, I don't know. I said, well, I said, I'm just going to kind
*  of keep, keep chugging along and you know, get it figured out and, and catch up and we'll go from
*  there. And I thought, man, there's a chance that maybe I won't see him again, but no sure as shit.
*  Here he comes. He catches back up. Me and my brother were up there and he, he went from 22.
*  He got in this different groove. And then I actually, my calf on this race kind of locked up
*  and it's like going up this last grade, we had to do one more summit and I couldn't run it.
*  And I'm like, he took off. I was just kind of power hiking it. And I get up there and had a
*  cameraman up there. And David was like, he was in his Goggins mode by that time. This was towards
*  the end of the race. We had like two miles left. It's like 33 miles in. And he, I asked a cameraman
*  up there. I'm like, Hey, I said, how did Goggins look? And he's like, uh, well, he had his shirt
*  off and he was, and it was cold right. He's had his shirt off and he was saying, they don't
*  fucking know me. I'm like, who is he? He's like, they don't, they don't know me son and doing,
*  saying all this stuff. I said, who was he saying that to? And he's like, there's nobody up here.
*  So he has like imaginary enemies that he's fighting against.
*  And that's, but that's, that's real. And so he did, and he got better and he freaking
*  just crushed the second half of that race and same thing happened lifting. He like, the more reps we
*  did, the better he got. And like at the end, when we had done so many reps and like we did this one
*  last thing of doing, yeah, we did like 95 reps of, or no, a hundred reps of right there on that
*  incline bench is only 95 pounds, but we had done 600 reps before he ended up on the last set,
*  did more than he did on the first set. That's insane. Yeah. And that's when he's saying he
*  starts yelling right here somewhere and it makes some volume. Shut that muscle down 16. Come on,
*  get it. 17. They don't know me son.
*  18. They don't know me son. Get it. 19. They don't know me son. Yeah. 21. Yeah. Get it again.
*  Come on. We want to see it. Good. 22. Who's going to carry the boats and the logs? That's you buddy.
*  Come on 23. Come on 24. One more David. What the fuck? One more to carry the boats.
*  You're going to do it. You're going to do it. You're going to do it. Oh my God. You did it. Yeah.
*  This is at international fitness, just a regular gym and people were like, what the hell?
*  What is this guy? But he got into that zone and it's like, so whatever he says about his David,
*  that he was Goggins, when he gets to Goggins, dude, look out. It's like a whole, it's a different
*  person that's unstoppable. It's real. Yeah. It's real. It's real. I saw it and he's like,
*  it's amazing. Well, that's how he broke the world chin up record. Yeah. I mean,
*  you have to be a complete psychopath to be able to do chin ups for 24 hours a day.
*  And then, so we went after that and we went and watched UFC, got pizza and it was getting
*  late by that time. So we'd run 35 miles. We shot bows. We lifted weights, pretty full day.
*  Ate pizza, had a couple of chocolate chip cookies, watched UFC, pretty good night.
*  And then, so he's like, yeah, he goes, I got to get back to my hotel. I still got to stretch,
*  a couple of hours of stretching. And my wife goes, oh, you're not going to stretch. You can
*  miss stretching tonight. It's like, what are you talking about? Have David Goggins miss stretching?
*  Take the night off? No. He does some hardcore stretching.
*  And he does for hours. And then that's just kind of his routine. And then he got up the next day
*  and from his hotel ran 15 miles. So people can say whatever they want. The dude is as real as they
*  get and a complete savage. A hundred percent. It's like, you can say whatever you want because on
*  Instagram, you never know if what you see is what you get. He's amazing. Yeah, he's real. There's no
*  way he could be doing it as long as he's doing it without, someone would expose him. He would
*  expose himself. That's the real deal. And that's why it's so special. That's why it's so inspirational.
*  Is because that's all mental strength and he's all super honest about how he used to be. He's like,
*  my brain was soft. I was soft. It's helped me because I've thought that I'm like, when I get
*  tired, I mean, I take inspiration from a lot of people, but it's like, I'm like, God, I need to
*  have that little piece of Goggins to beat, to get in that. It's got to be mental. It's like he just
*  puts himself there and he struggles, but then gets to this next level and it's like, how?
*  He just makes himself go there. He also has figured out now how to maintain his body,
*  which is very important. That's why he's into that stretching because he's had some pretty
*  significant muscle issues in the past. It's so lost muscle, like locked up on him. But now he
*  realizes there's a maintenance involved too. You've got to treat that thing like a vehicle. You've
*  got to take care of that vehicle. Yeah, he does. And he's, I mean, it was like, I'll never forget
*  sharing that day with him. Never. I mean, it changed my life. I swear to God. David Goggins,
*  people follow him and they're just like, I feel like it's another blessing I don't really deserve
*  just to be able to, who wouldn't want to work out with Goggins? You always talk like that,
*  it drives me crazy. All this, I don't deserve shit. I don't. That's the one thing I hate about you.
*  Drives me nuts. I don't. You always say, we were talking about that, you always feel like you don't
*  even deserve to be at these camps with all these great hunters. I always say, I think somebody
*  eventually is going to say, what the fuck, what is this guy doing here? And I'll be like, well,
*  they figured it out. It was a good run. That's called imposter syndrome. I don't know. I just
*  don't feel like, I mean, I see you guys, I see you, you Goggins, Jaco, and I see those guys and that's
*  who everybody, you know, it's like, you can change people's lives. And I feel like pretty soon they're
*  going to go, why is this guy here? Yeah. Yeah. But that's how I feel about everything. But I just
*  don't, I don't express it. But you don't hate yourself for that? No, I don't hate myself for
*  that. But you hate me. Well, you say it too much. Drives me nuts because I admire what you do. So
*  it drives me crazy because you've taught me so much about bow hunting. I feel the same. I used
*  to feel the same about everything. Like it's called imposter syndrome. What's that mean? And
*  when people have very high standards, when people work hard and they have very high standards and
*  then they become successful, they feel like an imposter. They feel like there's no way because
*  you're always wanting better and more. And like, as I've become famous and become friends with
*  other famous people, like when I meet them, like I was out at a restaurant the other night and me
*  and my wife were having dinner and Jamie Foxx came in and he comes up to me and gives me a big hug.
*  And I'm always like, how is he? Why does he like me? Like, he's not supposed to like me.
*  Weards me out that he even knows who I am. He's like, you gotta meet my friend. He's a huge fan
*  of yours. I'm like, what? I don't have any fans. Like, what are you talking about? You're Jamie
*  Foxx. Like, this is nuts just talking to you. And then he brings me over to his friend. I always
*  feel like an imposter. I feel like an imposter. When we did that show in Portland, when you came
*  to the show, I was about to go on stage. Just a fucking sold out arena. People are still feel
*  like an imposter as they're bringing me up. I'm like, this is so crazy. It's amazing. Okay. So
*  you get it. I get it. Yeah. But it's just because I have a very high standard and I work really hard
*  and I, I, I'm never satisfied. Yeah. So even though I know that I can do it, I do it every night.
*  Yeah. You stand up every night. Right. I know. I know I practice hard. I work hard. I write hard.
*  I constantly do sets. Even though I still, I'm like, what in the fuck is this? Yeah. Oh, this is
*  ridiculous. Still to this day. Wow. You know, I, I, I get it. I, all the, I mean, just today,
*  people sent me a text. Hey, I sent this to, so Joe must have changed his number. Can you see if he
*  get me on the podcast? And it's just like, so I hear like that and I hear like, so what's Joe like?
*  So what's, what's it like to do? And it's just like, I don't know. However, I don't know how
*  other famous people are, but how you are is like, all I ever say is like, he's the most
*  generous supportive person I've ever met. So however you're doing it, you've been a good,
*  it's just a, somebody good to emulate, I think. Well, I would say the same about you, man. It
*  means a lot to me to be a friend and to, to learn bow hunting from you. It's been, to me, it's like,
*  you know, there's, if you want to learn something, you know, you want to learn something, what you
*  want to learn is from someone who really understands it and really hasn't mastered it and
*  spent a lifetime doing it. So for me, like you've cut probably decades off my learning curve of
*  learning bow hunting and to be able to learn, I mean, all those different things that we did to
*  get close to those different bulls was all because of your years and years of experience. And of
*  course, Colton helped us as well. He's a great guide and very knowledgeable hunter, but you know,
*  even he defers to you because you've got so much experience. So to me that it's, it's just,
*  to have a guy like you out there that's such a great role model that does it all the right way
*  and works so hard, I mean, to, to learn from you has been gigantic. There's no, you go out to that
*  wall out there and see all those elk heads, that's all because of you, man. I mean, it would have
*  never happened. I would have never been able to do it. I definitely wouldn't have been able to be
*  this successful this early, you know? Well, yeah. I mean, you've been, whatever position you've been
*  put in, you've made the most of it. That's what I say. So a lot of people have been put in
*  fortuitous situations that screw it up or don't make the most, but because of your work,
*  work ethic, you've made that 67 yard shot, which isn't easy for anybody in crunch time. You made
*  that to perfection. So that's, that's you. I mean, getting there, maybe whatever could have played
*  a role in that, but executing God, it was so beautiful. That was like, it was like seeing
*  you kill that bull was definitely better. Like when I kill, I'm just like, well, just did what I
*  did what I do. This is what I'm supposed to do. So I'm like, you have to be controlled. And like,
*  you were even pretty controlled. I wasn't controlled in that moment. I was so happy and so,
*  I don't know what just caught up in the moment. It was, it was beautiful to see. I said it was
*  one of the most beautiful shots I've ever seen. And that's true, but it's just like, just to see
*  that and have you be successful. It's like, God, it means everything. It was amazing.
*  It means everything to me too, man. It does. And to be able to do it with you,
*  like I said in the video, it does, it means the world to me that I could do that, you know,
*  with being your, your student and being able to learn from you and then to be able to execute
*  like that in crunch time. Oh, it was perfect. Yeah. And I mean, and now we fucked up and a
*  lot of people are going to be in the woods bow hunting now, but I don't say get something out
*  of it, man. I really, I really hope people feel what we feel and get that experience. And then
*  when you're eating it, you'll get that feeling that it's completely incomparable.
*  It's just nothing like it in terms of like eating a meal, eating a meal from an animal
*  that you track down and hunted yourself and shot yourself. It's just nothing like it.
*  Yeah. No, it's amazing. Hey, did you, you were at the comedy store last night.
*  Yeah. Are you there tonight?
*  Yep. Yeah. You are?
*  Yeah. Yeah. I get to go.
*  Yeah. Hell yeah. Yeah. I set up a show just because I knew you were going to be here.
*  I thought I saw you there last or saw those. You were there last night. I'm like, oh shit. I wonder
*  if that was it. No, no, no, no, no. I'm there multiple nights, but I was there too. I had two
*  shows there last night and then I had a show at the improv too. Oh, nice. So yeah. The beautiful
*  thing about being in LA is I can grind it out. I could do multiple shows a night, you know,
*  do different plays. I'll do like two shows to the store and then I'll do two shows of the improv.
*  I do it all the time. Yeah. That's awesome. Oh, it's amazing. Like LA for comedy, it's like the
*  desert of comedy. Was Chris and Callan there last night? What was that?
*  Chris and Callan, yeah, they were at the store. And then I left them and I went over to the improv.
*  Did you see that video? And then Ian Edwards. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ridiculous.
*  Callan was roaring like a dragon. Yes. Oh my God. Those guys are so silly.
*  It was hilarious. Yeah. It was hilarious. The comedy store you've never been, right?
*  No, I've never been. That's Mecca. You're going to come to Mecca tonight. Oh, I can't wait.
*  That's comedy Mecca. There's no place like it on earth. And tonight it'll be mob. Joey Diaz
*  will probably be down there tonight. It'll be incredible. This day has been like, I figure if
*  I can die after today, I'm good. Because it's like everything has happened. Then I get to go to the
*  store. It's like, man. Now, what is this GQ thing you did today? It was just, so they had me breaking
*  down archery and movies. So I did Hunger Games and they filmed my reaction and got me talking
*  about if it's realistic. So I did Jeremy Renner. I did Robert De Niro. He was in, God, some terrible
*  movie. And I don't even think he, I was kind of surprised he was actually hunting with a bow in
*  the movie. What movie was that? Was that a movie with him and John Travolta? Yes. Yes. And they had
*  a fight. Yeah. John Travolta played like a Russian. Yeah. And he shot, John Travolta shot an arrow at
*  him. So Robert De Niro was in a tree stand. John Travolta shot and it stuck in the tree. Robert
*  De Niro jumped, fell out of the tree and broke his bow. And so then he started crawling towards
*  John Travolta for some reason. Anyway, they had me, but Robert De Niro actually had a pretty good
*  anchor. I mean, he looked pretty good with the bow. Really? He had a whisker biscuit on there,
*  which wasn't good for the rest, but he was going to shoot this bull. Like this five point bull came
*  out and he couldn't do it. He like, I don't know what happened. He like had, he hesitated,
*  then he felt bad. Something like that. I don't know what happened. Let me see this Jamie.
*  Do you have it? Killing season. Yes. It's pretty intense. That's not bad. No, that's not it. I don't
*  like that grip. He had a compound bow. Oh, it's a different one. Yeah. Right there. Yes. He looks
*  like a, look at him. I know. Yeah. So he's wearing flannel too. He went old school.
*  His radio went off and it spooked the bull, but he jumped out and broke that bow.
*  Yeah. So I, I did that. So him and John Travolta were shooting arrows at each other. Yeah. How dumb
*  was the movie? Did you get a chance? It was terrible. Apparently the new Rambo is unbelievably bad.
*  Yeah, we did Rambo too. Cause I said, I go, we have to do Rambo. I want to talk about when he,
*  do you remember when he had the exploding tip and he shot the guy? Yes. Yes. That was awesome.
*  He got caught in a trap. Look at John Travolta's beard. Oh Jesus. It's he's Russian. Yeah. How bad
*  is his accent? I don't know. Oh, is it atrocious? I'm sure killing season. What is it? Get a rotten
*  tomatoes. A cold-derived tomatoes. I want to see a three. What does it get? Please tell me it's like
*  13. 10. That's impressive. That's pretty low. That's, that's pretty high. Well, yeah. It should be a lot lower than that.
*  Look at him. Hey, what happened? Oh, oh no. Let me get up. He's trying to get up. What is he doing?
*  Oh, oh, I heard his ankle. I took one to the calf. Oh, did he? Yeah. Looks like arrow. I think. I don't
*  know. I hear his voice. Oh boy. It's hilarious. Yeah. Yeah. There's very few movies that depict
*  bow hunting correctly. Yeah. I didn't see any. What is this? He's holding him. He's got the arrow there.
*  You, you attack him before he draws. Just shoot me. Just shoot me. Come on. You hear the listen to the
*  Russian. Shoot the sheet. Oh boy. Oh my God. Hold this. Stop that right now. I am not, I cannot.
*  I can't do this. That's, that's, no, no, no, no. The, the best form I saw in any of the movies that I,
*  that I reviewed for him today was, I think it's called Brave. It was an animated movie. Oh yeah.
*  And the redheaded girl. Yeah. The re, not bad. She actually had perfect form. Really? Yeah. Oh,
*  let me see that. Is there a movie though, where someone bow hunts correctly?
*  I mean, is there one moving right here? Let me see her. I watch her form when she.
*  Oh, here they're teaching her how to shoot. Yeah, I think so.
*  Yeah. But you'll see her, she steps up the end. It's a confidence. Oh, the confidence,
*  so you know, she's going to put, put it on the X. Yeah. Watch this confidence and the attitude.
*  See that she's pretty bossy. My kids did not like this movie. They watch it for some weird movie.
*  For some weird reason. It's her, she needs that. Her dress is too tight.
*  See that. Uh huh. Back son. Watch this on the move. That's pretty good. I know, but watch this last
*  one. This one's. Uh huh. Yeah. Right here. Look at this. Watch this form. And this is with a broadhead
*  with distractions. She's so focused. The feather cut her face a little for some reason.
*  Oh, I like how the arrows. I know. Like a real arrow. I know, but watch this.
*  Oh, look at this. She Robin hoods it. I know. Pretty damn impressive. See that. That's so,
*  that's what I say. The, all the ones that I reviewed today, that's the best. That's the best.
*  Yeah. Look at her, her release. I know. See that follow through. Yeah. Follow through is excellent.
*  Very sweet. But there's no movie where bow hunting now accurately depicted. No movie.
*  Now I'm thinking, I'm trying to think of a movie that even involves bow hunting.
*  Can you think of one? No, not, not hunt, not bow hunting. No, I mean, there's deliverance
*  where he winds up hunting people. Remember? Yeah. I wanted to do that one, but they didn't have that
*  today. They had walking dead. They had that's ridiculous that they call that a bow. That's a
*  shitty gun. That's what I said. I said, I don't, I'm not down with the crossbow and, and you got a
*  rotten, a rotten corpse head and a stop in an arrow. It's not a pass through. Excuse me. Yeah.
*  It's outrageous. Yeah. Sticks in their head. I don't know how we missed this, but Samuel Jackson
*  plays in a movie called big game where I think he might've been secret service protecting the
*  president either way, the plane crashes or something. He ends up with a kid and learning
*  how to bow hunt to survive. Oh, really? Really? It came out three or four years ago. Oh, this shit
*  must have went straight to V. Yeah. It doesn't look never heard of it. I want to say they bow
*  hunt to survive. I mean, oh, and it's now he's getting in a fight. Yeah. I typed in bow hunting
*  movies and this was the most recent one. I think. Oh, that's hilarious. He jumps on a helicopter.
*  I don't know. I mean, there's one, there's one for you. Stop, stop that before I get brain damaged.
*  Yeah. Isn't it interesting? Like you would think that there would be a way to, to make a movie that
*  involves bow hunting. That would be interesting. You'd think so. Yeah. Like the movie, like there's
*  only a couple good pool movies. It's like the hustler with Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason,
*  and then the color money with Paul Newman and Tom Cruise. Those are the big ones. Yeah. The, the
*  color money changed pool. Like when that movie came out in 1986, it just literally pool exploded.
*  The same as in the 1960s when the hustler came out, the pool exploded. Yeah. So pool had two like
*  giant explosions where people really started going to pool halls. They wanted to learn how
*  to play pool. Good. And then with the hunger games, apparently a lot of people got into archery
*  because of Jennifer Lawrence. We got a beautiful woman shooting a bow. That's what I said. I go,
*  you didn't like a bad ass. You yeah. Yeah. The confidence is a key, but you know, and she's hot.
*  She's hot. And then she's got a bow. It's like 10 times hotter. Both those things are good. Yeah.
*  So yeah, she, and she, what was good with her was she could go from having the bow to grabbing an
*  arrow to putting it on the string to shooting in like half a second. Yeah. And just over. Wow.
*  I go, that's not easy to do. Well, she must've had some serious training just to be able to
*  pull that off on film. Yeah. I think she'd, and I think she shot a Hoyt and I think she took
*  lessons from a Hoyt shooter. And same thing with even Rambo's old bow, I believe was a Hoyt.
*  Really? Yeah. That's hilarious. I know. But yeah, he, he had the exploding tip and the guy,
*  the bad guy was shooting, ran out of bullets with his gun, threw it down, pulled his pistol out and
*  was shooting a Rambo and Rambo just stood up there. It's like, you're not going to hit me. Oh, here
*  she is. Yeah. I'm going to shoot. Right. That's not her. I guess that's her coach teaching the
*  reporter. Oh, oh, so this is the woman who coached Jennifer Lawrence. Yeah. Oh, okay. I want to see
*  Jennifer Lawrence. I don't even know this chick. I thought it was. Fuck out of here with this. Yeah.
*  But it's, that did get a lot of people involved in archery. It did. Girls especially. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Young girls. Apparently, what is her name? Gina Davis? Yeah. Gina Davis is a big time archer.
*  She loves her. She shoots. Yeah. She shoots like competitions, right? Doesn't she? I think so.
*  Yeah. She's done some target competitions. Yeah. And Ivanka Trump. Does she? I saw her with a bow
*  before. Well, obviously Donald Jr. is the biggest one in the family. Yeah. And Donald Jr. is a legit
*  bow hunter. Yeah. He shot a giant bull in Colorado this year. Did he? Yeah. Oh, I didn't even know
*  that. Yeah. Yeah. He sent it to Dudley. He sent a picture of it to Dudley. Oh, man. He showed it to
*  me on his phone. Really? Big ass bull. Yeah. God, I didn't see that. Yeah. He shot it. It's a great
*  bull. Yeah. Wow. Huh? Yeah. He's a legit bow hunter. I mean, that guy loves bow hunting. He hunts a lot.
*  Yeah. No, he's definitely avid outdoorsman. I mean, he's always putting up stuff. And
*  with his kids especially. He learned a lot from Dudley too. Did he? Yeah. Dudley taught him quite
*  a bit. Gave him quite a bit of training. Yeah. Yeah. But there's not a single movie where someone
*  goes bow hunting. Like you would think that that could be, I mean, that could be a good movie.
*  Is that Gina Davis? She tried out for the Olympic team. Oh, shit. Oh, she's shooting an Olympic
*  recurve. Yeah. She tried out for the Olympic team? Yeah. Finished 24th out of 300 women. Not bad.
*  Yeah. Those in the Olympics, you know, it's no compound. It's bows just like that. Wow. At seven,
*  I think it's 70 meters. They put them in there. Wow. But you didn't find any of- Look at her.
*  She looks fucking super legit. Look at her form. I know. Her grip hand, everything. Yeah. They're
*  such good shooters. It's amazing how good they get. Yeah. With tabs. I mean, it's crazy. Like
*  you're shooting off your fingers. Yeah. And you're shooting really accurately. Is she still doing it?
*  That's what I was looking up. They made a video with her on Funny or Die. Let me see that video.
*  Archery Tricks. Is this it? It's a joke. You said I don't know how much of it is real.
*  Or it's for Funny or Die. So I don't know what the context was a couple years old. She's got a gun
*  too. Look at her. So it's just- Oh, so you don't actually get to see. Oh, okay. Just being silly.
*  So you- Look at her form. There's her form. Yeah. Look at that.
*  We never saw Jennifer Lawrence practicing. That's that video. She practiced in hiding.
*  I know. I want to see it. Yeah. I mean, she obviously has got to have a lot of training,
*  the way she executes. Yeah. It seems- Cause like, you know, when you see Keanu Reeves
*  in John Wick, you're like, okay, that guy had some fucking training. Yeah. Shooting. 100%.
*  Yeah. There's no doubt about it. Yeah. You know? Like I just started doing that recently
*  at the same place where he learned. Oh, right. It's fucking hard as shit. I saw that.
*  It's hard, man. Really? Yeah. It's another thing that you're going to get obsessed with
*  because it's just so technical. There's so much technique involved in it.
*  Was that part of your sober October? Yeah. We're doing a bunch of different classes,
*  all sorts of different shit. That's cool. It's fun, man.
*  Well, speaking of famous people hunting, how about Scott Eastwood on his bowl?
*  How about Scott Eastwood? First ever bowl. I know. Yeah. I know. Like first day in camp,
*  he was the first guy to kill. Yeah. I know. Made a hell of a shot. 55 yards.
*  He's a great guy too. Yeah. I know. I mean, when we did that podcast with him,
*  we got to know him and he's just a sweetheart of a guy. That's how he is all the time.
*  Yeah. I know. Super friendly guy. Yeah. Boy, was he beaming. He came back to camp,
*  first guy to kill, big smile on his face. So the rest of the days he was at camp,
*  he was just smiling. I know. Just so happy. I know. He got his bowl and a nice bowl too.
*  Oh, heck yeah. That was a big bowl. Yeah, that was awesome. I mean, we've hunted with Chris Pratt,
*  Jocko, Andy Stump. I mean, we've had a- Incredible.
*  We've had some great times. I can't, and Andy's bowl, you see that video?
*  Yeah. It's amazing. Came in to three or four yards or whatever.
*  Luckily, they got to stop at 18 or 20, whatever it was.
*  Another crunch time, coming through in crunch time.
*  Last day. I know. I know it.
*  He had very few opportunities. He just, bow hunting is hard. I mean, I always have,
*  the last three years I've scheduled two bow hunts a year, two elk hunts a year, because
*  I keep thinking I'm not going to be successful. I'm going to come up short.
*  Odds are, yeah. And then I'll at least get
*  two opportunities for the second hunt and I'll be able to get a second bowl.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, you've made the most of it.
*  Lucky as shit. I know. Now you got one next week.
*  Yeah, I'm very excited. Yeah.
*  It's an interesting thing, the camaraderie in camp too, because those kinds of camps,
*  we had two weeks ago in Utah, it's like we got a group of some of the best people I know.
*  Everyone's hanging out and just some of the nicest, friendliest people and especially early
*  in the week, everybody's on the grind. I know.
*  Everybody's on the grind. Yeah, it's all business.
*  Yeah, it's serious, serious fucking business. Yeah.
*  I had to leave an elk hunt to come there. That's right.
*  And it was still worth it. It was like, it was so fun. I'm like, there's no way I'm going to miss
*  this camp. It was cool to meet Levi Morgan too.
*  Yeah. He's a really nice guy.
*  I've watched his television show before and he's another one, just an elite world champion archer.
*  Yeah. It's just like anytime I always feel lucky to be able to rub elbows with people like that
*  at that level and just feel like, I don't know, and just talk with them. It was just like,
*  man, that was amazing. To be able to show Levi Morgan that shot
*  that you filmed, that was fucking beautiful too. Yeah, that was fun.
*  It's just so cool to be in that camp because everybody in that group is, they all get it.
*  Everybody's obsessed with the same thing. Everybody's obsessed with success and bow hunting.
*  And here we are, the one week that everybody looks forward to most on earth.
*  Yeah. All year long, you look forward to this one
*  week on earth. This is the rut in Utah during elk season when there was no moon, so they're going off.
*  Couldn't have been better. Couldn't have been better.
*  They were fucking, Dudley's into that moon shit, man. He'll tell you about moon phases and this
*  and that and he writes articles about it. Yeah.
*  So he was like, this week is going to be amazing. And it was.
*  Oh my God. Oh my God.
*  Those bulls went crazy. I was watching that clip the other day. Like I said, I watched when Colton
*  pulled out that tenderloin, but I also watched that first, I thought the bull was going to be dead.
*  55 yards were under that spruce tree. Oh yeah.
*  And that was a big bull standing out there. Oh, it was so close.
*  So close. So close.
*  When I drew back, he was looking right at me and he was like, fuck this.
*  I know. I just, but reliving those moments, I'm so thankful we have the phones and the video.
*  And it's just like. It's crazy how good the video is too.
*  I know. It's just amazing.
*  A phone, this fricking phone filming your kill shot.
*  Yeah. And it's like clear as day.
*  Crystal clear 4K. Perfect. Yeah.
*  Yeah. It's. I can almost watch it too much.
*  I can almost watch it too much. I mean, I got to stay in the moment.
*  Yeah. You know?
*  No, it's a, it's pretty special to be able to see it though.
*  Yeah. Well, that one we did for you for under armor.
*  Yeah. I've watched that video at least a hundred times.
*  Have you? Oh, fuck. Yeah.
*  Yeah. That's shot through the trees.
*  Great video. Yeah.
*  This one, this one I liked just because you can actually see that arrow kind of tracking.
*  It comes in and it tracks and just hits money.
*  Yeah. No, that's better for sure.
*  Yeah. That was better.
*  The other one was like, I was shooting through a hole.
*  Yeah. I had a, I had to like thread the needle.
*  Yeah. And punch it through that hole.
*  And you did. Yeah.
*  Being able to execute during crunch time. It's so fucking satisfying.
*  That's what it gets me up and makes me practice hours and hours.
*  And it's just like, you feel you did what you were supposed to do.
*  And it's just like, there's pressure because there's pressure.
*  Like you're like carrying this pressure and then it's gone.
*  It's gone. It's gone for a second.
*  For a second. And then the pressure is you got to be able to do it again next time.
*  So you can't rest on your laurels. Because it never gets easier.
*  Never gets easier.
*  It's like, you know, success is fleeting. You got to keep grinding.
*  And it's like one failure seemingly wipes out years of success.
*  You know what I mean? You screw up one time and you're just like, oh my God,
*  it's devastating. Like I said, it's like, it can be soul crushing.
*  Well, you're only as good as your last execution of whatever you're trying to do,
*  whether it's your last comedy show, your last bow hunt, your last arrow you released.
*  You're only as good as that. If you release a bad arrow and you hit a deer in the ass,
*  you're like, fuck. And then your head is like, that's what I do. I shoot deers in the ass.
*  And then they run away and you forget everything else.
*  Yeah. You can't. But that's also what makes me practice so much.
*  It's like, I don't ever want to feel that.
*  It's like one of those things you have to be obsessed.
*  You're going to be mediocre unless you're obsessed.
*  Yeah. I think bow hunting is a very strange thing because it's not just hunting.
*  It's an athletic pursuit. It's a discipline and it requires so much. When I was at Tarrant
*  Tactical the other day, I was shooting rifles and I didn't miss once. It was like clink,
*  clink, clink. It's just, I'm on a bench, just trigger discipline, pull, pull, pull,
*  let a surprise release go off. Hunting like that is difficult, but it's not comparable.
*  There's nothing like bow hunting. It's the most difficult, but also the most satisfying.
*  It's, I hate to use the term because it's such an overused term, but it's a spiritual pursuit.
*  It is.
*  There's something very spiritual about bow hunting. And when that shot landed,
*  and that's one of the things that happens, like our spirits are uplifted. Like,
*  we did it. The grind is over for this one day, for this one moment, we did it.
*  And it always feels the same thing to me. After it's over and after the animal's down
*  and after we're thankful, it never feels real. It's like, is this real? Did this really happen?
*  Yeah. Did I really shoot this thing? Never feels real. It always feels like that.
*  Last year when I shot that giant one at Tahoe and Ranch, same thing, didn't feel real. I'm
*  like standing over that thing. It's like, this real? It doesn't feel real. It just feels strange.
*  Is it? I wonder why that is.
*  I don't know. I'm crazy probably. It's like, I just, I don't ever like,
*  like, even when things go well for me, there's a part of my brain, and I think this is because
*  I've been obsessed with so many different things and I've kind of, I kind of understand
*  my own pitfalls and the only traps that I can fall into. So anytime anything happens,
*  that's great. Even if it's fucking amazing, like, ah, it feels good for a little bit.
*  And then almost immediately afterwards, I think you better get back to work, bitch.
*  Better get back to work because you can't start thinking you're awesome there.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  You can't get confused. Right.
*  You know, I mean, that's why I always say, like, you know, someone asked me once, like,
*  what's the secret to your success? One of the big secrets is I'm not a fan of me.
*  Right. I'm not like, I don't think I'm awesome.
*  Yeah. I'm not that impressed with me.
*  Right. So I know what I need to do to be successful. And then I'm the guy who's telling me,
*  get out, get up, go, go, go, do it, do it, do it. So anytime anything happens, it's great. I'm like,
*  settle down, bitch. That's exactly how I feel. I think you have to feel like that.
*  Exactly how I feel. Alexander Gustafson was talking about that once. And he was talking about
*  the mindset that you have to be to be an elite professional athlete. Like you can never,
*  you're never satisfied. There's no way. Yeah.
*  And I think anything that's difficult, difficult pursuits, whether it's standup comedy or whether
*  it's bow hunting or even ultra marathon running, it's like, no matter what you do, that's hard to
*  do. Once it's over, you better not enjoy it for too long. You better get back to work.
*  Back to work. You have to.
*  Get back on that horse. I know.
*  You're going to always feel that good feeling if you think about it at all. Like I always have
*  that video. I always feel that good feeling. If I want to feel good, I'll watch that shot.
*  Yeah.
*  But don't think about it too much.
*  No.
*  You better get back to work.
*  Yeah. That's exactly how I feel. It's like, it's so hard to get and it's just, then it's gone.
*  And because you can, I mean, you got to prove it every time.
*  But the real fun is in the struggle and that's what's hard for people to get their head around.
*  It's the struggle, but then not winning, but succeeding.
*  Succeeding.
*  Yeah. And that's what you see in that video.
*  Yeah.
*  Because the struggle has been, is so evident and then the success and it's just like,
*  oh my God, this feels like almost surreal and just amazing. But then it's like, God,
*  I want to feel that again, but I got to earn it.
*  You got to earn it. It doesn't give a fuck who you are. I mean, it's one of the things that I love
*  about archery is the same thing I like about pool. It's the same thing I like about a lot of things
*  that are absolute. Like when pool, the ball either goes in the hole or it doesn't. That ball doesn't
*  give a fuck who you are. It doesn't give a shit. The same thing with arrows being released. If you
*  don't hit it right, you don't release it right. You don't aim perfect.
*  You can be the best in the world.
*  And fuck up.
*  You screw up a shot.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  Yeah. And the animals don't, they're not cutting anybody a break.
*  They're wild animals in the mounds and you just got to, I mean, it's tough, but it is.
*  When you mentioned spiritual endeavor, I remember when I was in San Carlos this year,
*  this is, you know, native land and it's very special for me to hunt there with the Apache
*  tribe there. And I remember I was standing on top of this ridge and the wind was coming through there
*  and it felt like, I told the guys there this too, that it felt like the wind was moaning.
*  Like there's so much, I don't know if it's emotion. I don't know if there's
*  life in there, but it felt different. And it's like, when are you ever going to be in a situation
*  where you're going to be so in tune where it feels like that? And that's what the bow in,
*  I don't know.
*  Well, I think something about San Carlos too, when you know that this is Indian land,
*  that it's got like a special, like a special feeling connected to it.
*  For me it did. Yeah. It was like, and I come to find out that in that canyon there,
*  there's these caves down there that there's a mummified body in there, apparently.
*  And there's three different levels to the cave. There's arrows in there.
*  There's-
*  To this day?
*  Right now. Right. Yeah. That was the story I told about a mile down from where I said it felt like
*  it sounded like the wind was moaning.
*  Fuck, why didn't you go there?
*  Apparently they have a barred up now because there's people who steal artifacts.
*  Oh.
*  We're getting in there.
*  So I want to look at this.
*  I know. Amazing. I mean, but the history of that land. So-
*  I've seen an old arrow. You find an arrow with a broadhead on the ground from hundreds of years
*  ago.
*  Oh, wouldn't that be, that'd be incredible.
*  Fuck.
*  It'd be incredible.
*  I found a broadhead, a little Flint broadhead in Nevada.
*  Yeah.
*  But I've, I mean, I don't know of anybody that's ever found one with an arrow.
*  Yeah. Apparently there's 25 or 27 arrows in there.
*  Whoa.
*  I know. Incredible. So it's like-
*  I think I should take a picture.
*  There is definitely a connection and then it just feels different to me there. And it's like,
*  I feel so much, I feel honored to hunt there with the Apache, the guys from the reservation.
*  That's also a place where very few people get to be. So you know that when you're there,
*  you're sharing the land with very few people. So you got to feel like super lucky.
*  I do. Yeah.
*  I never thought I'd ever be, I mean, everybody knows there's giant bulls there. How could I ever
*  be the guy who gets shot there? It's like never, never thought that would happen.
*  But that's-
*  That's a bull you shot there this year is insane.
*  Yeah.
*  They're so big.
*  It's a big old bull. Like the hardest part with that hunt is like you could go there,
*  you could kill a bull. If you just wanted to kill a bull, you could make it happen. But killing
*  a big old bull is hard.
*  That's the hardest.
*  That's hard anywhere. But there it's- and then if you're killing an old bull there,
*  it's going to be giant. I mean, they're just special animals. Incredible.
*  Now this is because there's supposed to be two different kinds of elk, right? That there was a
*  Rocky Mountain elk and the Yellowstone elk. That's what I've heard.
*  Was that gentleman's name that he hunts at the Deseret and he also hunts down there?
*  Oh, Steve Johnson.
*  Yeah. He was explaining this to me. That there is the Yellowstone elk was a larger breed of elk.
*  It makes sense. They're giant.
*  They had larger antlers and you see them in the Gila. You see them in New Mexico. And that area
*  in particular in San Carlos has a bunch of those elk. They also think that that's what's in Tajon
*  Ranch. Oh really?
*  Yeah. That's why they're so big.
*  Well, those are giant too.
*  Yeah. It's also, they don't have a winter like they do in the mountains of Utah or Colorado
*  or something like that.
*  Yeah. Where they got to survive the winter months.
*  I'm going to take my wife and kids next year. I want them just to experience the rut. I want
*  them to come with me- To hear the bulls?
*  Just to hear it. Just because it's so- and just see them.
*  Where?
*  I don't know. I mean, maybe I'll take them with me to Utah and I'll take a day off hunting.
*  Yeah.
*  And just go with me. Just come with me. I just want you guys to experience it.
*  It's like when we were heading into that timber, like where that first bull was in the shadows,
*  I mean, that's where I did the video. It sounded like monsters down there.
*  Demons. Yeah. Well, we were saying, imagine being the pioneers and you got there maybe in
*  fucking June or something like that and everything's quiet. Then all of a sudden,
*  a couple of months later here, what the fuck is that? It must've taken a while before they
*  realized it was the elk that were doing that.
*  It must. It was, I mean, and it sounded like they were so loud. It sounded like we should've seen
*  them way before we did. Do you remember that?
*  Yeah. They were so far away.
*  I mean, it sounds like they're right there, but it's just because it's so loud.
*  They echo through the canyons.
*  Oh God, it was so fun.
*  I would give anything to seeing what it must've been like to have crossed America back in the
*  Lewis and Clark days when it was totally undeveloped and you just run into the tribes of Native
*  Americans. I would just love to see what it was actually like when the wildlife was undisturbed
*  and you have these massive herds of buffalo and deer were everywhere and elk were everywhere.
*  They said when those expeditions came across America, they could hunt anything, animals
*  everywhere. It was just a plethora. And the market hunting is what killed that.
*  Yeah. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. That's where we've come back from now.
*  And now, as they say, there's more big game animals now than there was 100 years ago,
*  which would be after that. Yeah. Yeah. It would've been amazing to see
*  what it looked like though. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's why you go over the next ridge
*  every time. Yeah. Let's keep going. That morning, oh no, it's the morning I killed.
*  But yeah, it's like over the next ridge kept us going, kept us going. It sounded like there's
*  bulls going crazy over the next ridge. Well, that shot that you guys got too
*  of that bull coming up to you and coming screaming up the hill, that big old bull.
*  Oh, so beautiful. Yeah. 10 yards.
*  That's so crazy. Stopped him.
*  That close is such an enormous animal too. Yeah. Yeah. Rihanna did a great job filming that.
*  She really did. Yeah. She did.
*  And then her video that she showed us of that giant bull that she shot, and that was a public
*  one-eyed bull. Yeah. That's a big bull, man. I know. Big old giant thing.
*  Yeah. And the footage where she's on her knees and this thing is coming by her,
*  looked like it was 15, 16 yards. It was really close, right?
*  Yeah. And she shot mid-bugle. Whack. Oh, just so happy for her because like I told her,
*  there's not many women I know of that have went on public land and killed bulls like that with a bow.
*  I mean, that just doesn't happen. I mean, it was an amazing accomplishment.
*  Yeah. It's like another degree harder than it is for men because just the physical difficulty,
*  the strength that you have to have to be able to maneuver your way through the woods like that,
*  especially her. With a pack.
*  I mean, she packed it out too. So she's got a hundred pounds on her back. A lot of guys can't
*  do that. Yeah. And then she's worked up to build a shoot 60 pounds with her bow.
*  That's very impressive for a girl. Yeah. Yeah. She's strong. She works hard.
*  She's got a great attitude and man, I love seeing her be successful.
*  Yeah. No, it's cool to see someone who's legitimately dedicated to it because,
*  you know, we've talked about this before, there's things that are happening right now where people
*  are getting into certain activities when you're a woman because it gets you a lot of attention.
*  Because if you're a hot woman and you shoot a gun in a bikini, a lot of people are going to pay
*  attention to you. If you're a hot woman and you go bow hunting, a lot of people are going to pay
*  attention to you. But it doesn't mean that they're not legit. And in her case, she's a hundred percent
*  legit. It's cool to see. I know. It's nice to see it be all real.
*  No, I know. I told her, she makes these cooking videos. I'm like, God, if you just want some views,
*  just do that in a bikini. Do the same thing. It's like, what are you trying to do here?
*  She's like, no, I'm going to do it the right way. So yeah, she, I, I, I give her a bad time,
*  but I totally respect her. Cause if I was a girl, I'd be a whore. I would have a, like a,
*  a fucking glittery bikini on everywhere. You've been walking around camp in your panties.
*  A hundred percent, a hundred percent. I'd be doing my toes at the table with everybody.
*  I'd be a hoe. If I was a girl, camp full of a hundred dudes, it'd be like, yeah, what's up boys?
*  Time to get some attention.
*  Yeah. It's hard, you know, for women because like they, they want a certain amount of attention,
*  but you got to be careful on how you get it. Cause then people don't respect you.
*  I know. And that's a different game. She's done a great job with that.
*  It's a different game though than with men. I know. You know, men don't have that,
*  that struggle, the balance struggle of people respecting you, but also being attracted to you.
*  It's like for girls, like they have to, they even have to be careful with how they dress.
*  You know, you dress a certain way, you look great. Certain way you look hot,
*  more over the edge. Now you're a whore. I know. You know, it's like, you got,
*  there's like a cutoff where it's a sweet spot. There's a sweet spot with ladies.
*  It's hard to find that sweet spot, man. Yeah. Tiffany killed a good bull there this year too.
*  Yeah, she did. Before we got there.
*  Yeah. And a good buck.
*  Yeah. He's another one. Tiffany and Lee, they're great people. It's also cool to have met them.
*  You know, I feel just really fortunate to be able to be friends with all these people that I know
*  are these like really world renowned experienced hunters. You know, I can learn so much. Like I
*  said, it's like just being friends with you and Dudley, it's cut down my learning curve by decades.
*  You know, just it's, there's no, I mean, the comparison would be like learning basketball
*  from Michael Jordan or something like that. If you wanted to learn, like he's not going to show
*  you how to play basketball. The beautiful thing about hunting is, and one of the coolest things
*  about you guys is everyone's so open about information. It's not thought of as a competition.
*  So everybody's looking to get, and hunters are so maligned and sort of like misunderstood by society
*  that a lot of people that are hunters are really excited for any new person to get into it.
*  And look at it correctly.
*  No, it's huge. It's big. I mean, I used to not tell anybody anything like that. Like even my buddy
*  used to say he'd give me a bad time because I wouldn't tell anybody where I hunted. I wouldn't,
*  I was like so protective. He'd be like, he called me Mac because he's like, you don't even want to
*  go by your real name. It's your name backwards as your code name. And so he'd call me Mac because
*  I was so secretive on everything. So I've been where I'm not helping. Nobody helped me. I'm not
*  helping anyone. I've been there. So it's like, but it's, it feels good to, like I said, when
*  seeing you successful is everything. That's an interesting thing with a lot of public land
*  hunters, right? They don't want to tell anybody their spots. No, cause you work hard to find those.
*  You work hard to find them. And it's like, it can take years, like especially elk hunting.
*  There's not good elk hunting spots everywhere. I mean, you got to bust your ass to find good elk
*  hunting. And then when you find it, you're like, I'm not going to screw this up. Cause you tell
*  one person and nobody just keeps something to themselves. So then they say, well, do you mind
*  if I go there? No, you can go there and then be like, well, I went there, but then my brother had
*  to come or my buddy had to come. Well, then they couldn't go by themselves. So then next time they
*  ended up pretty soon, there's, you know, if you have a good spot, like in the wilderness,
*  it can be ruined by two other guys. Yep. They tell two people and so on. So it's like, it's
*  really hard. Public land is, it's, it's, you won't, you got to protect it. I love that show,
*  the Western Hunter with Nate Simmons. And this is one of the things that he documents on the show
*  all the time is the grind of public land hunting. He's always getting, he's always running into guys
*  on horseback that run off the animals. And deep, deep, deep into the back country, still find
*  guys, the wall tent like, fuck, like it's a grind. He's a great hunter. He's a, he's a,
*  he's the very first person to film me in the wilderness. Oh, wow. Nate was, it was like,
*  he had never, he wanted to hunt the wilderness, had never done it. He knew I had done it.
*  Actually, maybe it was Shay Mann who filmed first, but then I can't remember, maybe Nate was first.
*  They were both right around 2002, but Nate, I saw him at the Bo rack and he's like, man, I've always
*  wanted to hunt the wilderness. And I'm like, well, do you want to film me? Yeah, I'd love to. So he
*  didn't know how to run a camera, but his sister was getting married on a Friday opening day with
*  Saturday. I said, if you go to the wedding, you drive to the trailhead after the reception,
*  you get to the trailhead at one in the morning, you walk all night, 12 miles. You can be in there
*  by first light opening day and I'll tell you where to go. And it's like on these maps and all this,
*  you know, I thought there's no way this kid's ever going to make it. So this was how many years,
*  17 years ago, he's not old now. So 17 years ago. So he's probably like 20 back then,
*  early twenties. And I got up opening morning and I went up to the saddle way deep in the wilderness.
*  And I'm like, look where I told Nate to come from. First light comes and I look over there
*  and here's this guy walking and it's him. And he made it all the way in there, drove all night,
*  packed in all in the dark, made it in there and filmed me. It took day six. Day six, I killed a
*  buck. He filmed, did a great job. Day seven, I killed a bull. And he, that was his first ever
*  with the camera. First ever time. And now you see what he's doing on Western Hunter, just amazing
*  work. But it's one of the best shows that it really depicts. He gets it. Yes, he gets it. And
*  he gets the, the, the grind, as you said, and the emotion tied to it. And he, I think his first bull
*  with the bow was when he was 13. Wow. And all he's ever done is bow hunt. Wow. His whole life. So
*  that he's one of the most, I mean, I respect him as much as anybody. He's just, and it was just,
*  I saw 17 years ago, he had it, he had it then, and he wanted to learn and he wanted to experience it.
*  And then he's went from there to making one of the best shows on TV. Such a great lesson in that,
*  that there's the opportunity. It's not easy. You're going to a wedding at one in the morning.
*  You're going to have to hike in. Yeah. It's a 12 mile hike. It should take you about five or six
*  hours. But if you want to do it, there it is. And a lot of people are like, fuck. No, all sorts
*  of excuses. Not to welcome in. I'll be there, you know, that night, Saturday night. No, I said,
*  I need you there opening morning. That's a giant part of life is those opportunities, capitalizing
*  on those opportunities. Cause a person could easily have blown that off. Maybe another time,
*  maybe I'll hunt with you next year. Maybe I'll hunt with you. And then nothing ever happens.
*  And then you don't get that momentum. Who knows. And then maybe there's no Western hunter. Yeah.
*  Who knows? I mean, it's, it's, but as a human being, those opportunities, like that's how you
*  build, you build on the capitalizing on those opportunities and making it happen. And then
*  you keep going. That's the whole thing. It's like these uncomfortable moments, pushing through them,
*  having discipline and drive, getting it done when you don't want to. And then you go, oh,
*  I know how to do that. I can do that. I can grind through this. I can get through it. And then
*  that's how you build in life. You just step by step by step, you keep doing it.
*  And that's when, when that happens, I mean, it's happened to me in my life where I've
*  decided to do something and it was really difficult. But when I got through it, I go,
*  oh, I can do it. I can push through things. I can make things happen.
*  It's such an important lesson. I mean, it's probably one of the most important lessons.
*  Taking advantage. It did. Did you see the, the, he did a show on Roy on like a tribute.
*  Did you ever see that? I did not see that. Nate did. Is it on the Western Hunter? He did it. It
*  was. Yeah. I did not see that. I'll find it. Cause he went with Wayne to, um, where Roy used to hunt
*  on Kodiak Island for deer. And, but at the beginning of the show he had, he made, he filmed one of the
*  coolest things is, uh, Roy and I went to the back country and hunted brown bear on snow, off snow
*  machines and Roy had a cabin back there and Nate went back there and filmed it. Oh, you told me
*  that story. It was crazy. And doing back country fixes on busted snow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So Nate
*  was there for that, that whole thing. And he said, he's never felt like he was going to die more
*  times than he did. I mean, it was so much was going, but it's just like a normal back country
*  in Alaska. It's like, it's different up there than it is here because there's so many, you can die
*  so easily. And, uh, down here it's pretty tame, you know, in comparison, but he, anyway, he got it on
*  film. So I have that whole film and he took, he took clips of that and made a tribute to Roy. And,
*  um, it was pretty special. That's awesome. I should look it up. That's awesome. I will cam.
*  Let's wrap this up. Yeah. It's great to see you brother as always. Oh, thank you so much. And I'm
*  bringing you to the comedy store tonight. I can't wait. Bring it to comedy Mecca. I can't wait.
*  All right. That's it everybody. Thank you. Thanks brother. Thank you.
