*  Nice. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=55.0s)]

*  Really? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=59.0s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. The director got nominated for such a great episode. And so we see what we can repeat this year. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=60.0s)]
*  Who's that gentleman that you brought with me last time? Your executive producer? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=67.0s)]
*  Ah, yeah. He created the show with me. Jordan Cooper. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=70.0s)]
*  Jordan Cooper is a genius. That young man. How old is he? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=73.0s)]
*  I think he's 27 now. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=77.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=79.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=80.0s)]
*  I've never met anybody that knows more about TV. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=81.0s)]
*  When he was telling us about the history of like how Lucy and Desi Arnaz controlled that show [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=83.0s)]
*  and how they took it and took it on tour and then made it into a television show. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=89.0s)]
*  Like I didn't know all that shit. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=94.0s)]
*  He loves TV. We just, we did a whole Lucy and F of me and Tammy Roman because people love us together. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=95.0s)]
*  He brought her into, you know, he casted her before he dang near casted me. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=102.0s)]
*  And he put us together and he said, I'm telling you, y'all are going to be like Lucy and Arthur. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=108.0s)]
*  And that's what the world think we are now. And they love us together. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=112.0s)]
*  Shout out to Tammy Roman. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=116.0s)]
*  Shout out to Tammy Roman. I'm so glad your show is caught steam because that genre for comedians is kind of a dying genre. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=117.0s)]
*  You don't really see sitcoms much anymore. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=126.0s)]
*  Not with comedians. Thank God I had a million and one stories. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=129.0s)]
*  And, you know, thank God that, you know, we on BET Plus because they let us push the envelope. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=133.0s)]
*  They don't, you know, they don't want to wrap it up in a bowl. They let us wrap it up to Miss Patway. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=138.0s)]
*  So we talked about everything the last three seasons from, you know, from me having a gay daughter, the gay experience, you know, being in jail, being a teenage mama, hating my mother, being molested. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=142.0s)]
*  We just did a black hair. We just did an episode on me being molested by my mama boyfriend, which was very funny, but also very touching. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=154.0s)]
*  And I did the episode to let people know that you can't change the past. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=164.0s)]
*  All you can do is look for what's in front of you. So don't whine about it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=169.0s)]
*  Find a way to laugh about it. And it was a very serious episode that hit home for a lot of the people who watched the Miss Pat show, but they was able to laugh at it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=173.0s)]
*  That's a complicated subject to try to make funny. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=181.0s)]
*  I try to make everything funny, Jerome. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=184.0s)]
*  I know you do. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=186.0s)]
*  But, you know, I tell people it's my story. So I got the right to react to it the way I want to. I could be somewhere crying. For what? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=187.0s)]
*  I found the funny in it. We wrote it into an episode and people was like, thank you, Miss Pat. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=197.0s)]
*  You make me realize that I don't have to cry about what happened to me 10 years ago or 20 years ago. Forgive them and move the hell on. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=203.0s)]
*  My mom and boyfriend is dead. Other people molest me is dead. Look at me now. Even my kid's father. I talked about him many times to you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=210.0s)]
*  I mean, he's working at Jiffy Looz and he don't have like faux heart attacks. I wish him well. I'm OK. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=217.0s)]
*  And that's what it's all about. It's about me. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=224.0s)]
*  That's a great attitude to have to go through life, because you really can't change the past. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=227.0s)]
*  No, you cannot. But I control. I can control what's happening to me now. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=232.0s)]
*  What I love about your show is your show is doing things that like some of the great old sitcoms did. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=237.0s)]
*  It's it's you know, people thought that that multi-camera shoot we do in front of a live audience, people thought you weren't doing that anymore, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=243.0s)]
*  which is kind of crazy because that used to be the thing that everybody wanted to do, you know, all the way back to, you know, before Seinfeld, Sanford and Sond. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=253.0s)]
*  I mean, all in the family, they did all those shows with an audience. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=264.0s)]
*  Well, they went to can laughter, you know, which which was much easier. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=269.0s)]
*  You know, if you ain't wrote nothing, it's not funny and you ain't got nobody sitting there. You can just drop in the laughter. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=274.0s)]
*  What shows used only can I think, you know, I saw a clip of the Big Bang Theory and it was a Big Bang Theory. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=279.0s)]
*  But without the laughs like they removed the laughs so you could see like what what the show actually is. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=288.0s)]
*  And like, why are people laughing at this? This is strange. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=294.0s)]
*  I don't know if that was a retake because you know, it is sometimes you have to do retakes and sometimes you do when the crowds aren't there. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=298.0s)]
*  Well, last time I talked about Big Bang Theory, I got in trouble from little white girls. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=305.0s)]
*  They was down my throat. They were sending me death threats like they were all going to clone themselves together and what my ass because I didn't recognize the star of the Big Bang Theory. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=309.0s)]
*  But I mean, I've never watched the Big Bang Theory. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=317.0s)]
*  So but I'm quite sure a lot of sitcom tape that away without a lot of studio audience. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=321.0s)]
*  And you can you can even look at sitcoms now who do use can laughter. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=326.0s)]
*  The laughter is when they go on the steps or when they call me. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=330.0s)]
*  They have you like who the fuck added this shit? Right. This ain't right. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=333.0s)]
*  This ain't funny. They're just trying to make it too funny. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=336.0s)]
*  What else? We just he wanted that that loose and loosey feel. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=339.0s)]
*  He wanted the old school feel. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=345.0s)]
*  And we taped in front of a lot of studio audience in Atlanta. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=347.0s)]
*  Joe had never been done for a sitcom, a multi camp. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=350.0s)]
*  So when we got there, the people, the camera people had never did it before in Atlanta. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=354.0s)]
*  So it was a teaching moment for first season. Oh, wow. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=358.0s)]
*  So now they got the hook up. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=361.0s)]
*  That means, you know, everybody know what they're doing. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=363.0s)]
*  Now we're turning away audience member. The third season, we was turning people away. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=365.0s)]
*  That's great. So they're loving it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=370.0s)]
*  And it's like a party. It's like a it's like a family reunion. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=372.0s)]
*  People come from everywhere to come see Miss Pat show in Atlanta. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=375.0s)]
*  Well, what he did, what everyone did is capture the essence of your stand up and of you on podcasts. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=378.0s)]
*  Yes. Why people love you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=386.0s)]
*  And to put that into a sitcom and not make it corny like I told you last time I saw it before I saw it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=388.0s)]
*  I was like, I was skeptical. I love you. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=395.0s)]
*  I think you're hilarious. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=398.0s)]
*  The last thing I want to see is you in some mediocre version of the Miss Pat life. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=399.0s)]
*  But they nailed it. Yeah, that's hard to do. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=404.0s)]
*  It's very complicated because you're telling a story. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=407.0s)]
*  You have all these characters interacting with each other and you got to wrap it up within a certain time frame because of streaming. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=410.0s)]
*  Do you do you have a specific number of minutes you have to do or do you have more flexibility? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=416.0s)]
*  A little bit. They might give you 33, but no more than 35. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=421.0s)]
*  They be screaming, cut it and Jordan be saying, no, you're going to mess up the whole part of the other show. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=425.0s)]
*  Don't don't cut it. So we fight a lot about a little longer episodes and B.T. is pretty much open minded with it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=431.0s)]
*  I mean, if it if it if we ask them if we begged them not to cut it because it's going to mess it up, sometime they'll let it go. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=437.0s)]
*  But the good part about it, they'll move it over to linear and then, you know, they'll cut a lot of stuff out. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=445.0s)]
*  I'm like, hey, y'all, the show is a lot better if you just go back over to B.T. Plus. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=449.0s)]
*  Yeah, that sucks that they have to do it that way because that has to be 22 minutes. Is that what it is? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=453.0s)]
*  Yeah. And they take the monologue out and I hated the monologue and people love the monologue. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=457.0s)]
*  And the monologue is kind of like when Seinfeld did a Joker from a mine is more where I tell you how I'm feeling and what you about to get in the show. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=464.0s)]
*  So every episode and I hated them because I had to learn them like I have to learn the strip and sometimes the day before. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=473.0s)]
*  But you just hate them because they're hard to do. But do you love the final product like how it looks on the show? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=480.0s)]
*  I do love the final product. And, you know, I have a lot of control with this show. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=485.0s)]
*  So I'm thankful for that. That's amazing. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=489.0s)]
*  Because I've heard horror stories where you don't get a lot of control. Yeah. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=491.0s)]
*  You know, and they'll have people writing you the way that you're not. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=495.0s)]
*  But so foolish, too, because of the person like you, it's so clear that you know what you're doing. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=498.0s)]
*  Like you've been doing it a long time. Just let her do it in the sense of a sitcom. Just get the pieces in play. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=502.0s)]
*  And that's what I did. That's what I always tell him. I say, you know, one thing I know, Joe, is I know funny. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=509.0s)]
*  I know me and I know the type of funny that I'm trying to put out. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=514.0s)]
*  And that's all I ask them to move out the way and give me the space. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=517.0s)]
*  You know, I don't I don't want to explain every joke to you. It might not be for you. Right. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=520.0s)]
*  So, you know, that's one of the reasons why I'm really glad we had B.T. plus two because we can be black as hell. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=526.0s)]
*  I'm not in a room with a whole bunch of white execs who scared to say nappy. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=534.0s)]
*  Are you allowed to swear? Can you say basically anything? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=538.0s)]
*  We say everything, bitch, ho, motherfucker, nigga. We say everything. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=541.0s)]
*  We talk like Miss Pat talked for real. Like families talk for real. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=544.0s)]
*  Now, I would say this. Black folks do come out and say she don't represent the black family. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=549.0s)]
*  No, I don't represent you. I represent me. I'm not out here trying to recreate your family. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=553.0s)]
*  What I did was put my family on TV. And if your family can relate or if you can relate, then come on and get on this train, baby. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=558.0s)]
*  Who couldn't relate? You guys do an amazing job of setting it up. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=567.0s)]
*  Well, you know, it's a great show. Thank you. It's you know, and it's not a black show. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=570.0s)]
*  It's a it's a show about that relates to everybody. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=577.0s)]
*  You know, from I have people from all walks of life walk up to me, tell me I download B.T. plus just for you. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=580.0s)]
*  I believe that it's a very unique show. And it is. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=586.0s)]
*  I mean, it's about you. It's about the experience that I went through in life that relates to everybody. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=589.0s)]
*  And it's the coolest thing when I see an old white dude and a young, hip black dude. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=595.0s)]
*  They got shit in common, but they both like Miss Pat. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=600.0s)]
*  And when I go to the club and I perform, they both come up and say, I love your show. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=603.0s)]
*  And that's what I know. I said, oh, this shit ain't black. This shit for everybody. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=608.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's beautiful. I love when old ladies come up to me like an airport, tell me they love the podcast. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=612.0s)]
*  Old ladies. I had these old ladies. They were like in their 80s. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=620.0s)]
*  You'd be surprised. I have white young white guys have a thing for me. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=624.0s)]
*  I don't know if they want a nanny or some old black pussy. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=629.0s)]
*  I don't know what. Maybe both. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=632.0s)]
*  Maybe both at the same time. They don't want my own shave on a regular. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=638.0s)]
*  I can't get into this new ball here vagina shit. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=644.0s)]
*  No, I got a garage on top of my vagina. I got time pulling this shit back once a week to kiss no hair. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=647.0s)]
*  It's crazy how the go the pubic hair thing just vanished. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=656.0s)]
*  Like these everybody's had pubic hair. Watch the old porn's. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=660.0s)]
*  Well, for all of history, people had pubic hair. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=664.0s)]
*  But back in the day, it made you look like you had a fat cat. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=666.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, you put your underwear on your thick down there. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=669.0s)]
*  You put your underwear on it's sticking to the vagina. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=672.0s)]
*  I'm like, where'd men get into ball head pussy? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=675.0s)]
*  It is weird because I experienced it through high school. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=678.0s)]
*  When I was in high school, that's when porn first came out. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=681.0s)]
*  When I was in high school was the first time VHS tapes came out. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=685.0s)]
*  So people could rent porn. And that's when the pubic hair thing changed. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=690.0s)]
*  It changed first in porn and it changed in everybody else. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=694.0s)]
*  Well, I think what the problem was is black women, we have such beautiful black afros down there. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=698.0s)]
*  So you couldn't get the whole vision. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=703.0s)]
*  So some white man went down there and got vagina hair stuck in his throat, which I call nappy gripping. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=705.0s)]
*  He thought the pussy was going to kill him. So it was a new rule. You got all pussies must be shaved. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=712.0s)]
*  That's just my thought, y'all. I don't know how true that is. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=720.0s)]
*  I did this girl in high school and she was kind of wild. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=722.0s)]
*  She was dating this guy and she broke up with the guy and her and I hooked up. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=725.0s)]
*  She said, I'm embarrassed. I can't let you see me. I go, why? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=730.0s)]
*  She goes, he made me shave my pussy. I just started laughing. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=735.0s)]
*  It was the funniest thing to me. When I was 16 years old, it was hilarious that someone was ashamed that they had a shaved pussy. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=738.0s)]
*  I only do it when they get caught in the side of my underwear. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=746.0s)]
*  I've been with the same man 31 years. He didn't give a fuck if mine fall off and be on my kneecap. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=751.0s)]
*  Baby, did you cook today? Or have you ordered Uber Eats? What show you want to watch? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=756.0s)]
*  That's why I don't cheat. I keep the same one I got so I ain't got to get no new rules. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=762.0s)]
*  No new problems. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=767.0s)]
*  No new problems. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=768.0s)]
*  Some people love problems. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=769.0s)]
*  Some people do love problems. I don't like problems. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=771.0s)]
*  I'm not a fan. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=773.0s)]
*  I just ask people to leave me the fuck alone, Joe. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=775.0s)]
*  Let me be me. People always say, what do you think about the council culture? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=778.0s)]
*  I said, shit, American Express been counseling me. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=782.0s)]
*  The rest of you motherfuckers don't matter. They don't lower my limits. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=788.0s)]
*  So, hey, it is what it is. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=791.0s)]
*  Do you think that a show like yours, could it... [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=795.0s)]
*  It's like in this day and age, it seems so hard to put one of those things together. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=799.0s)]
*  Like I don't know what used to be every night on all the major networks, it was mostly sitcoms. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=804.0s)]
*  It was Friends and Seinfeld and I was on one news radio. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=811.0s)]
*  There was all these shows, Wings. There was all these shows and there's fucking none of them now. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=816.0s)]
*  There's so few. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=821.0s)]
*  So when I see a show like yours come around and do it in a new way, successfully and really get you. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=823.0s)]
*  I'm like, this can be done. This can be done. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=831.0s)]
*  And no comics are like trying to get sitcoms anymore. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=834.0s)]
*  It used to be when I was in the 90s when I was out here, there was pilot season. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=837.0s)]
*  And everybody was just scrambling to get a sitcom. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=843.0s)]
*  It was like the Holy Grails. We were all out here for the lottery. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=846.0s)]
*  Like everybody was ready. We'd come out here for pilot season. Everybody would go to Hollywood. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=849.0s)]
*  Now, no one knows. It's fucking gone. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=853.0s)]
*  Well, you don't need it anymore. You have stuff like podcasts. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=856.0s)]
*  You can create your own stuff with no rules that will blow you the fuck up. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=859.0s)]
*  But when I see someone doing something like you're doing, I go, there's still room for that funny sitcom. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=864.0s)]
*  It can still be done. It's still a great thing to watch. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=870.0s)]
*  One of the things that I tell you that I ran into with building a sitcom is like writers. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=874.0s)]
*  So you deal with the writers that have been in Hollywood so long and they're stuck in this box. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=880.0s)]
*  I literally had writers say, they're never going to let you do that. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=884.0s)]
*  And I'm like, they're going to let me do me. They hired me. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=888.0s)]
*  You knew what the fuck you was getting when you gave me that first deposit. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=890.0s)]
*  And I told you I ain't get hit with no pie and I ain't chasing no dick like they say fat girls do. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=893.0s)]
*  I've been having six in sixth grade. Two things I told Hollywood. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=898.0s)]
*  You can never give me as much money as I can steal from you. Now, let's make this show. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=901.0s)]
*  So a lot of I think a lot of writers are just stuck inside the box and they just recycle the same fucking joke. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=905.0s)]
*  If I heard it, I don't want it. If it's close to what I've heard before in the barbershop on another show, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=915.0s)]
*  I'm like, get that shit out of here. Let's go back to the drawing board. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=921.0s)]
*  And that's one of the things we write on the floor. A joke. I mean, like, I heard that shit. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=924.0s)]
*  I'm a comedian. You can't give me nothing I ain't heard. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=928.0s)]
*  I don't heard it from the white side to the black side to any other side because I play both sides of the ring. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=931.0s)]
*  So you can't pull that shit off on me. And a lot of times I'm like, no, I'm not doing that wacky shit. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=936.0s)]
*  We ain't doing that. I think a lot of them lose their passion. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=941.0s)]
*  You know, I think they do it so long and it becomes a job like they're a plumber now or, you know, hanging a wallboard. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=945.0s)]
*  They're just doing a job. And Hollywood would drain you to all those nodes. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=952.0s)]
*  And you have people up there that are making decisions that don't know shit about don't know really don't know shit about TV. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=956.0s)]
*  Some of them. What is that movie that came out? A crazy movie with the he was like a superhero. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=962.0s)]
*  And that movie was it was on the shelf for a couple of years. What's Ben Affleck in it? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=968.0s)]
*  What movie? He had on a mask. It's a crazy ass movie. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=977.0s)]
*  It was a hit. And I think they're making a third one. Not Deadpool. Deadpool. Deadpool. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=981.0s)]
*  Well, you know, that. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=988.0s)]
*  That's right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=992.0s)]
*  Because I got my white guys missed. I'm sorry. I get him with some of the other Ryan. What's the other one? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=995.0s)]
*  Gosselin. Yeah. I never know who the fuck's who that guy who wrote that. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=999.0s)]
*  I heard he said her and know many times. And when somebody finally said, yeah, it was a fucking hit. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1003.0s)]
*  It was a fucking hit. So just think about had that guy had that the writer heard that first note. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1009.0s)]
*  He threw his shit in the trash can. Yeah. Look, we would have thrown away. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1014.0s)]
*  So that tells you somebody didn't know what the fuck they was doing. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1019.0s)]
*  Well, a lot of these executives, they don't create. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1023.0s)]
*  So they're not really artists. But yet they're in control of what gets created. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1026.0s)]
*  And the problem with that is they start to think of themselves like artists. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1030.0s)]
*  They start to think that they're smart and they know the system. They buy what they like, not what the people like. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1033.0s)]
*  Well, they just think they know what they're doing. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1038.0s)]
*  But I feel like it's like and certain writers I feel like this way, too, especially comedy writers. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1041.0s)]
*  I feel like if you're not doing stand up, your sense of what is actually funny and not actually funny is just not that good. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1045.0s)]
*  Sometimes they're hilarious. Sometimes they're perfect. And sometimes it just misses. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1052.0s)]
*  And I think we're a comic would go like that one that you can do that one. That one's not going to fly. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1057.0s)]
*  And but a writer would be like, I think this will work. Yeah. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1062.0s)]
*  And you're like, no, no, no, this is definitely not going to work. Shit ain't funny. This is not funny to me. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1066.0s)]
*  It's not fun. This is like it doesn't work. It doesn't work in my head. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1069.0s)]
*  I can't imagine this is funny. Well, it's a lot of it. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1073.0s)]
*  It's a lot of force it on you. You can't be honest. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1078.0s)]
*  Like, you know, I went in, I think I told you this last time the first time I had a right. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1082.0s)]
*  I was like, that's shit. Wait, that's just horrible. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1086.0s)]
*  They was like, you can't say that. I'm like, I can't tell my fucking name funny. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1088.0s)]
*  So we is coming. You be like, that motherfucker suck. Right. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1094.0s)]
*  But no, I had to go to council and say, can we try again? Is there a better way? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1098.0s)]
*  They counseled you? Yes. They got me a whole person to reprogram me. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1103.0s)]
*  To say I had to sell corporate. I couldn't say, you know, that that that shit booty is garbage. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1112.0s)]
*  You know, kill yourself. That's what we say. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1117.0s)]
*  Yeah, you have to be able to say that. That's it sucks. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1120.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can't you can't say that when you're in the writer room, especially. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1123.0s)]
*  And I had to tell one writer, I said, why you stop fucking laughing at yourself? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1127.0s)]
*  Only you think this shit is funny. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1131.0s)]
*  Nobody else think this shit is funny. But you and he used to be cracking up. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1133.0s)]
*  And then the person he brought with him be cracking up. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1137.0s)]
*  And I'm like, you're literally sucking each other's dick. Stop laughing. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1139.0s)]
*  That's that fake producer laugh. When you do a run through and they know the jokes. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1142.0s)]
*  They have a fake laugh. It's so distracting. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1146.0s)]
*  I tell you. So when I was shooting my sitcom, another somebody else was shooting the sitcom. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1149.0s)]
*  So we will go watch. And this is when I learned that they hire laughters. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1153.0s)]
*  So all of these people sitting over in the bench, me and Jordan over there, we looking around. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1158.0s)]
*  And so at a certain point, they all start laughing. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1162.0s)]
*  I said, this shit don't sound right. Why they why they in sync? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1165.0s)]
*  Why they laughing like a group? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1168.0s)]
*  And so somebody on the set said, oh, those people are just laughing at you. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1170.0s)]
*  So somebody on the set said, oh, those are hard laughters. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1174.0s)]
*  I was like, what? Those are higher laughters. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1177.0s)]
*  Then the producer was laughing. I said, one thing we're not going to do, Jordan, we're going to fucking hire laughters. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1181.0s)]
*  We're not going to do that. If they don't laugh, then we're going to go back and rewrite. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1185.0s)]
*  So spending it shooting a pilot in L.A. taught me a lot. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1189.0s)]
*  I was so glad we could move that show to Atlanta because Atlanta going to let you know. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1192.0s)]
*  Black folk ain't going to fucking spend their money on no chicken and wings and not fucking get no good laugh. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1197.0s)]
*  They'll throw that shit at you. Black folk going to let you know. That shit ain't funny, man. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1203.0s)]
*  White people are nice. At least you tried. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1207.0s)]
*  Paid laughter. That's crazy. Yeah, they have paid laughter. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1211.0s)]
*  That's so confusing. Very. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1217.0s)]
*  I guess that makes sense, though, with a lot of sitcoms, because some of them, it just doesn't make sense. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1220.0s)]
*  I'm like, I don't understand what everyone's laughing at. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1225.0s)]
*  It's like they just keep you just slack jaw, just paying attention. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1227.0s)]
*  Just enough, just enough to get you through the commercial, just to keep you on. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1231.0s)]
*  That's all they have to do. I mean, it's all they're doing is just trying to keep you there. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1236.0s)]
*  Say advertisement. That's what they're trying to do. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1239.0s)]
*  You can get you through to the tie commercial. You might like the tie commercial better. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1242.0s)]
*  We'll sell you some Prozac. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1246.0s)]
*  That's what it is. It's just they're just biding time. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1252.0s)]
*  I don't watch a lot of TV. I'm busy these days, but I do watch The Blacklist. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1256.0s)]
*  That's about it. Which one's The Blacklist? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1261.0s)]
*  NBC. James Spader. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1264.0s)]
*  Oh, that's that one. That shit's been on forever. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1267.0s)]
*  Nine Seasons. That's crazy. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1271.0s)]
*  I like Handmaid's Tale, too. That's a good show? The Blacklist is a good show? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1273.0s)]
*  Yeah, very. Really? It's a very good show. I love that. I like Handmaid's Tales, too. On Hulu. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1277.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I couldn't watch that. That bothered me. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1285.0s)]
*  Why? I don't know. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1287.0s)]
*  It reminds me of the Republican Party. Trying to lock the pussy down. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1289.0s)]
*  I say, this is what we heading to, ladies. They trying to control all cliques. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1296.0s)]
*  What do you think that's about? These little political moves. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1301.0s)]
*  I think there's always more to it when people do things like try to ban abortion or try to do something to incite people in one way or another. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1304.0s)]
*  I feel like more of it is just to keep us out of each other's throats than it is anything. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1313.0s)]
*  I think if you let America vote, way more people are going to vote that women should have the right to choose. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1319.0s)]
*  This is my pussy. Way more. This is my pussy. And I say this all the time. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1325.0s)]
*  I think you'd probably be like, what's the national, do they have a polling, an estimation of how people feel about a woman's right to choose? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1328.0s)]
*  Women feel like you can't tell us what to do, Joe. If I want to stick firecrackers in it and blow it up, it ain't your business. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1338.0s)]
*  I'm not telling you not to smoke your joints, so why are you going to tell me what to do? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1345.0s)]
*  And I know that your viewers are going to say, oh, it's not the fucking thing. It's my body. I've had an abortion. I've had a few. It's my choice. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1349.0s)]
*  You can't tell people what they can and can't do. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1355.0s)]
*  They don't ever do anything to control y'all dicks, Joe. They don't tell y'all y'all can't get circumcised. They don't do none of that good stuff. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1358.0s)]
*  Sixty one percent of Americans say abortion should be legal. That's kind of interesting because I thought it'd be higher. I thought it'd be like 70 percent. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1367.0s)]
*  And if you don't have a womb, you shouldn't be voting. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1375.0s)]
*  Yeah, it gets to be a religious thing. It's a very religious thing. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1378.0s)]
*  This guy that I had on was telling me that he believes it's at the moment of conception. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1382.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. So you're saying that if someone gets raped and they get pregnant and they it's conception, the moment of conception has arrived and you give them a morning after pill, you think that's wrong. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1387.0s)]
*  You think like that child should carry this rapist baby. If you could stop it right after right after conception. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1401.0s)]
*  Don't ask a man shit. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1410.0s)]
*  We're not talking about a nine month old fetus. We're talking about like the very moment. Nope. Two wrongs don't make a right. Like this is crazy talk. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1411.0s)]
*  You're going to ruin a child's life because they've they've been I mean the whole thing is just it's maddening. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1420.0s)]
*  But it's one of those things where it gets to be like late term abortions. You're like Jesus Christ, what is that? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1428.0s)]
*  Yeah, that freaks me out. Now I can't see nobody killing them. Some are a baby six, seven, eight months. That's a damn baby. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1433.0s)]
*  Yeah, I knew a dude in New York and his girlfriend had a late term abortion. They were fighting over it. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1440.0s)]
*  Like she wanted to have the baby and he didn't. And it was it was pretty late. She was showing. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1444.0s)]
*  I don't know how they did it. I don't know what the story was, but it was weird. It was like that's kind of killing a baby. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1449.0s)]
*  It is. It is. I mean, but so is you shooting off in a sock. No, it's not. No shooting up in the socks. Just get rid of loads. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1457.0s)]
*  If you heated it up, it would grow into something. If it had an egg to connect. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1464.0s)]
*  How many of those babies shot out your balls trying to make it and then you put it in a fucking sock instead of a wound? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1470.0s)]
*  Well, I'm not really a sock guy. Well, you let me guess. You put it in your weed, you roll it in a glove. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1476.0s)]
*  Who the fuck you put your sperm at, Joe? I hope at this age you ain't shooting off. You got a wife. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1482.0s)]
*  But hey, some days you don't want to do the hard work. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1489.0s)]
*  I know what my husband smile. I say, did you have fun by yourself? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1492.0s)]
*  He's like, I didn't have to hold up your big ass legs today. Oh, Jesus Christ. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1498.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. Yeah, it's I mean, it's not it's not a thing that you if you make it like a national mandate like that, you can't do or a national law that you can't do it. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1503.0s)]
*  People are just going to find other ways to get abortions. They're going to do it illegally. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1516.0s)]
*  You're going to create you're going to create criminals out of people that just want control of their body. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1519.0s)]
*  And it's your draw. But the thing that drives me crazy about these issues is it seems like there's certain things like gay marriage is one of them. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1524.0s)]
*  That's another one. It's like almost like people want people to fight over these things because they're so people are so opposed to it one way or another. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1531.0s)]
*  And they never get resolved. Gay marriage has been bouncing around since I was a kid. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1540.0s)]
*  I remember when I lived in San Francisco, we lived in a gay neighborhood and who cares? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1545.0s)]
*  Back then it was like and I was like, well, hopefully they'll sort this out. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1550.0s)]
*  They never got sorted out. It's 2023. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1554.0s)]
*  Not with these Jesus freaks. There's still people that say that they should stop gay marriage. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1556.0s)]
*  I think people should mind their fucking business. If you mind your fucking business and worry about your own relationship, this will be a better country. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1560.0s)]
*  If you start worrying about gay people doing anything, I guarantee you gay people is having way more fun than straight people. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1567.0s)]
*  So you stop being jealous because you're miserable. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1574.0s)]
*  Your husband dicks don't work or your dick don't work or you got to go to church every day and you got to continue to bake pies that you don't want to bake. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1577.0s)]
*  Mind your fucking business and we will be happy. My daughter is gay. I don't give a fuck about these hoes. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1584.0s)]
*  She be fucking Joe. Isn't it always men that worry about gay men? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1589.0s)]
*  Yeah, because they ended up being gay. They end up being gay. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1594.0s)]
*  You catch them somewhere at a fucking house picking up little boys and shit. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1597.0s)]
*  But wait a minute, Congressman, wasn't you just fighting to say you can't be doing this shit, but you're in the bathroom tapping your feet in Atlanta, huh? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1600.0s)]
*  Yeah. How many women are out there trying to stop gay marriage? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1608.0s)]
*  None. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1611.0s)]
*  They don't give a fuck. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1613.0s)]
*  Because you know why? Because who can please us better? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1614.0s)]
*  Women know what women want. Men know what men want. That's why they get with each other. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1618.0s)]
*  So leave people the fuck alone. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1622.0s)]
*  Leave people the fuck alone. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1624.0s)]
*  I guarantee you my daughter can eat pussy better than you, Joe Rogan. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1625.0s)]
*  Wow. Strong statement. I'll have to take you on your word. She probably knows some things I don't know. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1628.0s)]
*  I guarantee you she do. She keeps her dick in her purse and she do what she do. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1636.0s)]
*  I believe it. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1641.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1642.0s)]
*  What infuriates me is this idea that people are not supposed to be gay. Like clearly they're just gay. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1643.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1649.0s)]
*  They're born. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1650.0s)]
*  They're born that way. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1651.0s)]
*  I have a gay daughter. And I knew when my daughter was real young that she had some gay tendency. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1652.0s)]
*  I told you this story before. My mother-in-law said, this girl, you need to pray over her. She got some, she gay. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1660.0s)]
*  And I was like, mind your fucking business, old hoe. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1667.0s)]
*  My daughter was like five. You're going to put that spirit on? But she told me my daughter had, she said she had a click-licking spirit. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1670.0s)]
*  A click-licking spirit at five. I told you this before. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1679.0s)]
*  But how funny is this? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1683.0s)]
*  In the kindergarten. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1686.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was a spirit. And she still have it to this day. And my mother-in-law was right. And I truly do believe that people are born gay. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1687.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1695.0s)]
*  And people should leave mind your fucking business. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1696.0s)]
*  They should embrace those people. Let them be free. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1698.0s)]
*  I let my daughter be free. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1701.0s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense to me. I just don't understand it. And it infuriates me. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1702.0s)]
*  Because it's just, it's one of the stupidest things to care about someone's sexual orientation or any other aspect of them that they can't control. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1706.0s)]
*  Like, leave them the fuck alone. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1714.0s)]
*  It's usually people who dicks don't work anymore, who miserable in a relationship, whose shit ain't going right in their lives. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1716.0s)]
*  And it's a lot of people that want people to follow rules. They want people to follow very certain rules. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1722.0s)]
*  And if they can attach those rules to God, then it makes them very righteous in their enforcement of those rules. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1728.0s)]
*  And them the same people you'll see in hell while you're on your way to heaven. Go to hell. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1733.0s)]
*  That's what I say. Get the fuck out my face with that. People be like, oh my God, you curse too much. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1738.0s)]
*  I say, well, turn the channel, bitch. Turn the channel. Because I'm going to curse. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1744.0s)]
*  I hear you. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1748.0s)]
*  I saw a lady today say, this is a good show, but you use N-words too much. I said, well, turn the fucking channel. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1749.0s)]
*  You know there's other shit out there you can watch. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1755.0s)]
*  Don't come to my page. When you come to my page talking to me, I tell them, bitch, I'm not Beyonce. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1757.0s)]

*  Get a phone to my assistant so she can correct it and put the peers and the question marks in the right place. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1767.0s)]
*  And I'm going to tear your ass up. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1772.0s)]
*  Don't come fucking with me. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1775.0s)]
*  You can have it with people in the comments. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1776.0s)]
*  What? What, Joe? Don't fuck with me. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1778.0s)]
*  That was how you fat. I said, I can lose this weight, but can you lose your fucking ugly face? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1783.0s)]

*  Wow. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1791.0s)]
*  That's what I tell them. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1792.0s)]
*  That's not wasted energy? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1793.0s)]
*  Some days. If I'm laying in bed doing nothing and my titties just rested, I'll cut your ass out. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1795.0s)]
*  If I'm busy. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1800.0s)]
*  Some people get really locked into those social media comments. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1804.0s)]
*  You know, I used to, because, you know, when I first started, you want people to like what you do, then I just took on my street man. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1807.0s)]

*  You were telling me that somebody used your, that crack baby form as like a scam. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1860.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, Joe. So I don't go in it a lot because I've been busy. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1865.0s)]
*  So my, my, my beautician, the girl who does my hair, she was like, I think you need to take a look at this. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1869.0s)]
*  So kind of found out one of the fans was telling the other fans, let's do something nice for Miss Pat. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1874.0s)]
*  So I started this party in Atlanta called the Miss Pat crack baby. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1878.0s)]
*  Oh, Miss Pat's fan celebration just to give back because I love my fan because there's some ride or die ones out there. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1882.0s)]
*  And right now I can do it. I know you can't do it, but I can do it. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1888.0s)]
*  So I threw a party for him in Atlanta, invited 600 people down VIP. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1891.0s)]
*  All you had to do was get there and I took care of you. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1895.0s)]
*  And it was a great celebration. So I invited the wrong person and they decided to say, let's do something good for Miss Pat. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1898.0s)]
*  Let's buy a Gucci purse. Let's do this. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1904.0s)]
*  And just was taking all the fans money. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1906.0s)]
*  I didn't even notice when I finally noticed she was a couple thousand dollars in. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1908.0s)]
*  And I was like, you bitch. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1913.0s)]
*  One lady sent me some lotion. The bitch kept the lotion, Joe. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1915.0s)]
*  She didn't even send me the lotion. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1918.0s)]
*  So we kicked out the group and I asked her what she did with the money. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1920.0s)]
*  I use it for myself. Get your silly ass out my group. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1923.0s)]

*  I use it for myself. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1928.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1930.0s)]

*  Yeah, she told me the truth. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1932.0s)]
*  And then this lady, this same fan was coming to three and four shows, following me all around, calling me mama. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=1933.0s)]

*  I know, but they're still six months old. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2385.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're about six, seven months. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2386.0s)]
*  When they get to be like two years old, that's a terrifying animal. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2389.0s)]
*  That's a muscular, just an attack machine. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2393.0s)]
*  I mean that's essentially what they're bred for. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2397.0s)]
*  Yeah, English Bulldog and three Bull Mastiffs. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2399.0s)]
*  Okay, different Mastiffs. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2401.0s)]
*  Oh, they were big ones. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2403.0s)]
*  Two weighing 200 pounds. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2404.0s)]
*  Yeah, one of mine is weighing 100. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2406.0s)]
*  This is the one who killed the delivery driver? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2408.0s)]
*  This says that the coroner said the bites didn't kill him. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2410.0s)]
*  So he died from a medical emergency of some kind. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2413.0s)]
*  Probably had a fucking heart attack. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2416.0s)]
*  God blame it on the dogs. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2418.0s)]
*  He got attacked by a dog. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2420.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2422.0s)]
*  Well, I tried, you know, my husband said it was for protection, so we're gonna see. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2424.0s)]
*  Well, they're good protection dogs. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2428.0s)]
*  It's just that they... [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2430.0s)]
*  They cost a lot. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2431.0s)]
*  They're a responsibility. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2432.0s)]
*  Like they got healthcare. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2433.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2434.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, because I do, I do a radio show. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2435.0s)]

*  I like doing it. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2442.0s)]
*  I really like doing it. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2444.0s)]
*  You know, I didn't know what to expect, you know, getting up that early in the morning. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2445.0s)]
*  Does that fuck with your stand up? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2450.0s)]
*  No. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2452.0s)]
*  No? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2453.0s)]
*  No, it's in the contract. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2454.0s)]
*  You're not gonna fuck with my stand up because that's what I own. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2455.0s)]
*  But I mean getting up in the morning. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2457.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2459.0s)]
*  I'm an early morning person anyway. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2460.0s)]
*  You know, no matter where I'm at in the world, I will call my husband at four o'clock when [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2462.0s)]
*  he was working at General Motors, and I had to talk to him all the way to work. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2466.0s)]
*  So now I get on his fucking nerve because he retired, but I still call him at four o'clock [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2469.0s)]
*  in the morning. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2473.0s)]
*  He don't want to say fuck off because he retired and I'm out there working. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2477.0s)]
*  But when I'm home, he'd be like, don't you want to go to the radio today? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2483.0s)]
*  So I know he's trying to fucking get rid of me. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2486.0s)]
*  But I'm having a blast at V103 in Atlanta. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2488.0s)]
*  You know, I'm a co-host, so it's different. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2491.0s)]
*  It's different. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2494.0s)]

*  No? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2506.0s)]
*  I only curse when you pay me to. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2507.0s)]
*  I wish you cursed though. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2508.0s)]
*  I just wanted you to be free. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2510.0s)]
*  That's what I worry about you on like a radio show. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2511.0s)]
*  Well, it's a morning show. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2514.0s)]
*  I gotta hold back. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2515.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, who knows? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2516.0s)]
*  XM might come knocking. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2518.0s)]
*  You know, the thing that I really want to do, I'm a DIY type person, so I love DIY. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2519.0s)]
*  So that's what I really want to do. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2526.0s)]
*  You want to do like a do-it-yourself show? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2528.0s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2530.0s)]
*  What kind of things? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2531.0s)]
*  Houses. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2532.0s)]
*  Building houses? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2533.0s)]
*  I'm building a house now. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2534.0s)]
*  All by myself. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2535.0s)]
*  Well, I didn't do it all by myself, but I'm the GC. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2536.0s)]
*  So. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2539.0s)]
*  You're a general contractor? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2540.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2542.0s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2543.0s)]
*  So. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2544.0s)]
*  That's an undertaking. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2545.0s)]
*  That's a lot of work, right? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2546.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2548.0s)]
*  A lot of organization. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2549.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2550.0s)]
*  What I did is I bought Seven Acres and I wanted a big house, but I didn't want no big mortgage [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2551.0s)]
*  because you don't know when this shit go, you know, you don't know what's going to happen. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2558.0s)]
*  You say the wrong thing and you can't pay your bills in two days. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2561.0s)]
*  So I said, well, I've got to keep my mortgage at a certain amount so I can go to Walmart [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2564.0s)]
*  if this shit don't work out. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2568.0s)]
*  So I bought a house, I tore it down. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2569.0s)]
*  I hired an architect and it's 17,000 square feet. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2571.0s)]
*  And I built my own little podcast studio so I can get my podcast right. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2575.0s)]
*  And I built a 13-bedroom house for me and my family. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2579.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2584.0s)]
*  What is this like for your husband who knew you before the success? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2585.0s)]
*  Is it wild for him? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2589.0s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2591.0s)]
*  I think it is because, you know, my husband spent 22 years at General Motors and for me, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2592.0s)]
*  I was at General Motors too and for me to quit and say, hey, is there something in this comedy? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2598.0s)]
*  He's like, oh, fuck, Peck, can you just keep a job? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2602.0s)]
*  And when I tell him, I said, you know, in the beginning you didn't believe in me. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2605.0s)]
*  He said, you telling the damn lie? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2608.0s)]
*  He said, nobody's going to listen to the fucking chicken house jokes you got. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2610.0s)]
*  So, but he's very supportive. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2616.0s)]
*  He take you out of home. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2619.0s)]
*  And, you know, he didn't, he don't come see me a lot, but in the beginning, Joe, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2620.0s)]
*  it was his credit card and his paycheck that allowed me to go out and make $100 a night. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2625.0s)]
*  You know, so many times I maxed out that man's credit card. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2631.0s)]
*  So many times I fucked up his credit. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2634.0s)]
*  But it's my dream. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2636.0s)]
*  He should have been left my ass. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2639.0s)]
*  But for you to make that dream while you had a husband and a family and children, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2640.0s)]
*  it's so difficult to do when you're a 21-year-old kid just, you know, just going to open mic nights. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2645.0s)]
*  For you to be able to do that and to chase it down and make it successful, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2651.0s)]
*  that's a real American success story because it's a hard thing to do while you have a family, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2655.0s)]
*  to just get out to the clubs every night because you've got to start at open mic nights. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2660.0s)]
*  You've got to get that stage time. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2664.0s)]
*  You know, it's sacrifice. I sacrificed a lot. And so did my family. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2666.0s)]
*  You know, one thing my daughter, because I have custody of my niece's four kids now. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2670.0s)]
*  I've had them for 10 years. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2674.0s)]
*  And my career started to get a little bit of buzz while I was in Indiana. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2675.0s)]
*  And my daughter was going to go to Howard University, which is a HBCU. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2679.0s)]
*  And but she instead was like, I'm not going to leave my father here with these four kids that, you know, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2684.0s)]
*  because my niece left him, she was on drugs. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2690.0s)]
*  So she chose to go to Indiana State. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2692.0s)]
*  And so sacrifices like that went all through my family. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2694.0s)]
*  My son decided to go to college locally because he didn't want to leave my husband there with all the kids. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2698.0s)]
*  You know, at the time the baby was 15 months old when the mama left. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2704.0s)]
*  She's nine now. She's 10 now. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2709.0s)]
*  So, you know, I just thank my family for even being there and my husband for putting up with bullshit. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2712.0s)]
*  He's like, that's all you made was $50, $200, $300. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2718.0s)]
*  Shit, the plane ticket was $600. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2722.0s)]
*  Well, I made $400 of all dollars back. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2724.0s)]
*  Pat, you're losing. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2726.0s)]
*  I said, but it's something here. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2727.0s)]
*  You just got to be patient. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2729.0s)]
*  Wow. When did he come around? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2731.0s)]
*  When did he realize? [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2733.0s)]
*  I'll tell you when he realized. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2735.0s)]
*  When Cat Williams, the first time Cat Williams called me for to go on his tour. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2736.0s)]
*  And he said, this bitch might be funny. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2742.0s)]
*  How did Cat Williams see you? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2746.0s)]
*  He was at an agency. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2748.0s)]
*  I can't remember the agency, but this guy called and said, I had just signed with that agent. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2750.0s)]
*  And he was looking for a black woman. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2755.0s)]
*  And I sent over a little clip and they picked me. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2757.0s)]
*  I was blown away. I was on tour with Cat Williams. I made it. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2761.0s)]
*  So what year was this? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2764.0s)]
*  When he did the tape Catapultist, right after all of that other stuff. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2765.0s)]
*  When he was like at the height. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2770.0s)]
*  So I did the next DVD called Catapultist. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2771.0s)]
*  I don't remember what year, early 2006, maybe seven. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2774.0s)]
*  When he was doing the Pimp Chronicles. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2777.0s)]
*  It was at the Pimp Chronicles. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2779.0s)]
*  That Cat Williams, he's one of the best comics ever. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2781.0s)]
*  Yes he is. The nicest. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2784.0s)]
*  During that time period, especially when he was coming out hot. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2786.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2790.0s)]
*  That New Year's show that he did with Steve Harvey. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2791.0s)]
*  Did you ever see that show where he went out after Steve Harvey and shit all over him? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2793.0s)]
*  He does that. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2796.0s)]
*  He mimics him sliding across the floor and kicking him in the balls. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2797.0s)]
*  He goes, I'm a little motherfucker. I fight dirty. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2801.0s)]
*  Crazy shit. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2805.0s)]
*  It was funny, man. Oh my God. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2808.0s)]
*  He still is. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2811.0s)]
*  Very funny. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2812.0s)]
*  But like when he came out, he was so unique. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2813.0s)]
*  Like his delivery method is so unique. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2816.0s)]
*  The way he dresses and. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2818.0s)]
*  Nobody was doing with Cat Williams. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2820.0s)]
*  Nobody was doing with Cat Williams. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2822.0s)]
*  Nobody was doing with Cat Williams. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2823.0s)]
*  Not everybody's trying to do. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2825.0s)]
*  Yeah. But he's a. That's really him. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2826.0s)]
*  That is really him. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2829.0s)]
*  Very intelligent. I'm quite sure you've talked to him. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2830.0s)]
*  I was like, God damn this man's smart. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2833.0s)]
*  There's a couple things that I took from him. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2835.0s)]
*  I saw an interview from him once. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2838.0s)]
*  And one of the things that he said, he said, I never eat before a show. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2840.0s)]
*  He goes, you never want to have a show with a full stomach. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2844.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2846.0s)]
*  Because he really. It takes away resources. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2847.0s)]
*  Because if your body's digesting food, you have less energy. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2850.0s)]
*  It's just that's real. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2853.0s)]
*  That's like fighters. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2854.0s)]
*  Fighters don't go into the ring with a full stomach. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2855.0s)]
*  The one I'm sleeping at eight o'clock. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2857.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2859.0s)]
*  So I was like, that's smart. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2860.0s)]
*  Because sometimes I'm just hungry and I eat. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2862.0s)]
*  But now I'm like, no, I need like a lot of time to digest food. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2864.0s)]
*  And then he also said he has a music playlist that he listens to before shows. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2867.0s)]
*  That it just gets in the mood. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2873.0s)]
*  I go, that's smart. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2875.0s)]
*  Because a lot of times I want to hear music, but I don't. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2876.0s)]
*  I haven't brought anything with me. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2879.0s)]
*  And then when I started doing shows with Chappelle, Dave always brings his music. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2881.0s)]
*  He always brings like a big Bluetooth. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2886.0s)]
*  He has these big JBL boombox Bluetooth. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2889.0s)]
*  These fucking they look like cannons. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2892.0s)]
*  He takes those. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2895.0s)]
*  We had two of them and he would sync them up, put them on either side of the room. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2896.0s)]
*  And they sync together. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2899.0s)]
*  I was like, that's the way to do it. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2901.0s)]
*  So I took that from him too, because he had an approach to like how we prepare for a show. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2902.0s)]
*  He's like, I'll have one drink. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2907.0s)]
*  I'll get loosened up. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2908.0s)]
*  I'll have this playlist I listen to. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2910.0s)]
*  But I thought about it after listening to an interview. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2912.0s)]
*  I'm like, I don't have like a thought process behind like preparing for a show. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2914.0s)]
*  And now I do. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2918.0s)]
*  Now I have a playlist we listen to in the green room before the show. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2919.0s)]
*  What you listen to? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2923.0s)]
*  Oh, everything. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2924.0s)]
*  I got a lot of 90s hip hop in there. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2926.0s)]
*  I like for some reason like angry 90s like cool G rap gets me going before a show. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2928.0s)]
*  A lot of Wu Tang's in there. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2934.0s)]

*  Given is Given. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2951.0s)]
*  That's what I come out to. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2953.0s)]
*  So she really gets me in the mood. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2954.0s)]
*  And I like Carly B. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2956.0s)]

*  A little Fantasia. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=2965.0s)]

*  It's a different world. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3021.0s)]
*  Well, one of my kids does. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3022.0s)]

*  She gets on these kicks of like older music. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3026.0s)]

*  See, the thing is like most people, where are they getting their music from? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3041.0s)]
*  Are they getting it from like Spotify recommends or Apple Music recommends? [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3045.0s)]
*  Because like the amount of people that are getting their music from the radio is less than probably ever before. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3050.0s)]
*  Probably just hip shit. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3056.0s)]
*  YouTube probably just hip shit that comes out all the time. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3058.0s)]
*  Every time somebody drop an album. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3061.0s)]

*  Just cheering you up. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3082.0s)]
*  Oh, don't commit suicide. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3084.0s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck is going on? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3086.0s)]
*  iPhone, stop listening to me. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3087.0s)]
*  I wasn't thinking of suicide. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3089.0s)]
*  I was just looking at a motivational fucking thing. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3091.0s)]
*  And I got like 1200 of them. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3094.0s)]
*  Just every time I stroll, it's motivational, motivational. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3096.0s)]
*  You can do it. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3099.0s)]
*  I'm like, get the, I say phone, leave me the fuck alone. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3100.0s)]
*  There should be a way that you could talk to the algorithm and go, that's enough. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3104.0s)]
*  It should be, but it was just too much today. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3108.0s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, I'm going to see Joe Rogan. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3112.0s)]
*  He's got to smoke weed, a good conversation. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3113.0s)]
*  I don't need this bullshit in my life. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3116.0s)]
*  The motivational things on YouTube and on Instagram, it's like, it's weird that there's such a market for that. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3118.0s)]
*  And they all say the same shit. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3125.0s)]
*  They say the shit your mom and daddy said, but you'd rather go buy it on the album. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3127.0s)]
*  It's the same shit they say at church. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3131.0s)]
*  It's the same shit your school teacher try to tell you. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3133.0s)]
*  It's just in a different voice, high voice, low voice, screaming at you, shaking at you. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3135.0s)]
*  It's the same shit. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3139.0s)]
*  What I think what really works is people. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3141.0s)]
*  I don't think the motivational stuff works as much as people that are like motivational people. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3144.0s)]
*  I think that's the real, like you can get a little bit out of words. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3149.0s)]
*  You can get a little bit out of a video or a little bit out of like a little clip or something. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3153.0s)]
*  But like what, like David Goggins, like someone like him, like just his, you know, he is? [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3157.0s)]
*  No. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3162.0s)]
*  He's a Navy SEAL who's run like some insane amount of ultra marathons. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3163.0s)]
*  He's just known for being this like insanely tough endurance athlete. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3167.0s)]
*  Like he's got no knees. His knees are destroyed. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3173.0s)]
*  The cartilage is all fucked up in his knees and he still runs on them. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3175.0s)]
*  Like the doctor looked at his knee and said, I don't understand how you can walk on this knee. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3178.0s)]
*  Forget about run thousands of miles. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3181.0s)]
*  Like his knee was like distorting because the bone was growing because it was bone on bone for so long. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3184.0s)]
*  No cartilage. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3189.0s)]
*  No meniscus. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3191.0s)]
*  Just pounding bone on bone every day. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3192.0s)]
*  Just dealing with pain. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3195.0s)]
*  And when that fucking dude talks, you listen. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3196.0s)]
*  And when people listen to that guy talk and he talks about overcoming you demons, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3199.0s)]
*  when he talks about like forcing your body to do what your mind wants it to do, like that shit works. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3202.0s)]
*  Like that kind of motivation. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3209.0s)]
*  Like when you see a person like that, you want to go out and do something extraordinary. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3210.0s)]
*  You want to go out and you want to go out. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3214.0s)]
*  You got energy. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3217.0s)]
*  People give you energy. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3218.0s)]
*  But most of those little like motivational clips, it's just noise. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3219.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think the things that people do in life when people feel like you overcame something and they're going through. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3224.0s)]
*  Because I get that all the time. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3229.0s)]
*  Oh, you're such an inspiration. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3230.0s)]
*  I'm like, I used to say how? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3232.0s)]
*  I used to say how? [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3234.0s)]
*  How am I an inspiration, y'all? [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3235.0s)]
*  You know, I didn't look at my life at the time the way other people saw me. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3237.0s)]
*  You know, it was just where I came from. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3243.0s)]
*  I mean, it was life. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3245.0s)]
*  I didn't know the world was different until I got in the comedy game and everybody started saying, what? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3246.0s)]
*  You overcame that? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3251.0s)]
*  I'm like, you didn't go through that shit? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3252.0s)]
*  Then I realized the world. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3254.0s)]
*  Everybody didn't experience what I experienced. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3257.0s)]
*  But where I was from, it was it was the norm. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3259.0s)]
*  So now when I tell my story, everybody's like, oh, my God, you're such an inspiration. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3262.0s)]
*  And at first I was like, no, I'm just somebody who went through some shit. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3267.0s)]
*  But then I realized there's a lot of people out there that need me to tell my story. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3271.0s)]
*  And it's healing for them to see me win because it let them know that they can win. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3275.0s)]
*  Yes. And to see you laugh about it. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3280.0s)]
*  Yes. That you're so resilient. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3283.0s)]
*  That gives people hope. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3285.0s)]
*  So that kind of motivation works. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3287.0s)]
*  Like someone can see what you've accomplished with your life. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3289.0s)]
*  And for people who don't know your story, your story is fucking crazy. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3292.0s)]
*  I mean, it's so crazy from from the time you were young, from like like what year were you pregnant? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3295.0s)]
*  How old were you the first time? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3302.0s)]
*  I got pregnant at 13. I met at 12. He was 22. I was 12. He was married. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3304.0s)]
*  I got pregnant at 13, gave birth at 14. They had another baby at 15 by then I prayed it again at 16. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3309.0s)]
*  And a caseworker showed me how to get an abortion. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3316.0s)]
*  And think about all that. And then you combine it with selling crack. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3319.0s)]
*  Yeah, you combine being shot, you combine with all those prison. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3324.0s)]
*  The idea that it would lead you to 2023 with your own sitcom, building a 17000 square foot house on a giant plot of land, making your own podcast studio on it. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3329.0s)]
*  You're the one who handles all the bills. You take care of everything. Everything has to go through you. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3340.0s)]
*  You're the boss lady. That's wild. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3344.0s)]
*  That's an amazing inspiration story because you were in a terrible place. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3347.0s)]
*  If you think about a child like someone getting pregnant at 13 years old, say what chances that child have for a happy, healthy, successful life. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3351.0s)]
*  It's very, very, very low. So for you to get through all that and to maintain your family and to have developed a successful career. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3361.0s)]
*  This is amazing. It's an amazing inspirational story. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3371.0s)]
*  That's way better than some bullshit that some fucking con man is just saying on Instagram. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3375.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, it is amazing. It's amazing. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3380.0s)]
*  You know, I also had something in a little for I had two kids by the time I was 15. I didn't want them to go through what I went through. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3384.0s)]
*  I've said this a million times and it was the first time I ever felt like I was loved. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3390.0s)]
*  So to have that love for my daughter, my very first child that I never experienced in a household before, you know, it gave me hope. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3394.0s)]
*  I didn't know I was going to end up with all of this in the future. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3401.0s)]
*  All I wanted it. All I ever wanted, Joe, was a family. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3404.0s)]
*  Fuck everything else. All I wanted was a family. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3409.0s)]
*  And I got it. Nothing else meant anything to me. The materialistic shit, the fame. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3413.0s)]
*  All I ever wanted to do was open that door, walk in the house to people that loves me. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3418.0s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3424.0s)]
*  And I do walk. I do go home. Even with the kids that I'm raising that my niece left. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3425.0s)]
*  I get home. Oh, mama is home. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3430.0s)]
*  And I get your goddamn hands off me. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3432.0s)]
*  My husband's like, she's back. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3436.0s)]
*  But I know they love me and they love me. It's nothing fake. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3439.0s)]
*  I can walk into their house, drop my wig on the floor. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3443.0s)]
*  I don't have to be Miss Pat. Even my daughter who hardly comes downstairs, Garriana. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3447.0s)]
*  She'll look over the bounds like, all right, mama, you're back. Love you. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3451.0s)]
*  Go back in the room. I don't see you for fucking weeks. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3454.0s)]
*  You know, that's what I tell you, stay upstairs all the time. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3458.0s)]
*  As you don't get no man, I'm going to take a pussy and use it. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3460.0s)]
*  Because mine be leaking like a 64 Chevy. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3463.0s)]

*  Give it to me so I can use it. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3470.0s)]
*  The beautiful thing is a family is what you all you wanted and you have that. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3472.0s)]
*  But then the other things that you're doing, I know that's for you, like your career and everything. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3476.0s)]
*  But it's also for everyone else. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3481.0s)]
*  You're doing this. You provide happiness to so many people like that as an extended family. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3484.0s)]
*  It is. My fans are an extended family. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3490.0s)]
*  And you know, it's so many times I look at my inbox and people that I don't even know who genuinely say they're proud of me. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3493.0s)]
*  Even my kids, you know, like when the show was nominated for an Emmy. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3499.0s)]
*  And my daughter writes on the show. She writes on the show. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3503.0s)]
*  And she literally had tears on her eyes because she know I dropped out of school in eighth grade. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3506.0s)]
*  She know what I've been through. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3511.0s)]
*  And she told me when I was going to the Emmys, she said, I'm so proud of you. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3513.0s)]
*  And it wasn't even about winning. I didn't win Ted Lasso once. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3518.0s)]
*  What such a great show. I told my husband, that's why I couldn't fucking win on Emmy because you always watching Ted Lasso. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3522.0s)]
*  He's like, that's a good fucking show. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3527.0s)]
*  But they were so proud to see something they mama had created, you know, got nominated for an Emmy. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3530.0s)]
*  And even the fans, you know, I remember after I didn't win, I didn't even feel no way. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3538.0s)]
*  I didn't go there to win. I went there to say, just look around and say, oh, this is what this shit is like. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3543.0s)]
*  OK. You know, it wasn't even about the win. I had already won. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3549.0s)]
*  Just by being there. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3554.0s)]
*  By being alive, I've already won with all the bullshit I've been through in life. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3555.0s)]
*  Can't no trophy that you stick on, no dresser that catches dust ever make me feel the way I feel about just surviving the shit that I've been through in life. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3558.0s)]
*  Yeah, I call them dust collectors. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3567.0s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you got nominated, but those things don't mean anything to me. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3570.0s)]
*  No, this show is a people channel. Emmy doesn't keep this show on BET+. The people keep this show on BET+. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3573.0s)]
*  And as long as I will make it for them, as long as they'll watch it. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3580.0s)]
*  Yeah, being in the Emmys or even winning an Emmy would get you a little more attention. That's OK. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3584.0s)]
*  I don't care about no awards. You know how many times I lost a spell in being schooled? [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3589.0s)]
*  I can't spell with shit. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3593.0s)]
*  Every time I went up, I remember being in it. Back in the I'm 51. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3596.0s)]
*  So back in the day, I'm thankful they don't do this shit anymore. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3601.0s)]
*  But they had an A and B group on a C and D group in the F. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3604.0s)]
*  So the smart kids and the dumb kids, the classroom divided like that. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3608.0s)]
*  They didn't have like special classes for people like us. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3611.0s)]
*  And I used to see all the people in a group joke. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3614.0s)]
*  And I wanted to be in that a group so bad. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3617.0s)]
*  And I'll never get the book was impression and on court. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3619.0s)]
*  Those are the kids that could read and you know, just those was a smart case. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3622.0s)]
*  I want to be in this group. I want to be in this group because that's how I am. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3625.0s)]
*  I want to be number one. And one day I get in the clay. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3629.0s)]
*  I get the teachers like, please, let me just try. Let me just try. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3631.0s)]
*  Now I'm in a C.D. group. Dumb as fuck. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3634.0s)]
*  And so and I beg the teacher, she finally put me in a group. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3637.0s)]
*  Couldn't read what shit I look at. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3640.0s)]
*  Everybody stared at me like, what the fuck are you doing? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3642.0s)]
*  And I remember the teachers say, at least you try. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3647.0s)]
*  And I said, I don't do shit. I'm going to get in this group. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3650.0s)]
*  Never got in it because, you know, back in those days, they that's just how they divided you. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3653.0s)]
*  But it was a teacher that came along. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3659.0s)]
*  I've told this story a hundred times. It's true. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3661.0s)]
*  Who taught me how to read and who believed in me. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3662.0s)]
*  And I'm 51 and she's dead and gone. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3665.0s)]
*  And I thank her each and every day for instilling things in me that my mother could never instill in me. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3667.0s)]
*  It's great if you can get a good teacher. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3673.0s)]
*  I have a few good teachers that I remember that inspired me. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3675.0s)]
*  And you know what's so crazy with the shit going on in this world with these teachers? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3680.0s)]
*  I just how you let these kids disrespect them and all of this bullshit going on in these schools. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3684.0s)]
*  Just a disrespect. Look at the girl who broke the teacher leg. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3690.0s)]
*  Look at the teacher who just got the fight. What the fuck? [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3693.0s)]
*  They should hold to me. They should hold parents accountable. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3696.0s)]
*  Because I'm here to tell you, if my child ever tried that shit, I will beat the black off Ramon. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3699.0s)]

*  And that's how it used to be when I was coming up. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3709.0s)]
*  Everybody whooped your ass in the neighborhood. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3711.0s)]
*  Now these kids like, oh my God, you got to respect me. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3713.0s)]
*  Bitch, you don't even pay no bills. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3715.0s)]

*  Yeah. So why am I respecting you when you don't pay for shit? Huh? [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3730.0s)]
*  Kids, there's a different feeling that kids have today. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3735.0s)]
*  There's a different feeling that society gave kids. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3739.0s)]
*  If you been abused, what's abuse? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3742.0s)]
*  I tell you, so here I got these custody kids and they called me, the teacher called me and I said, I'm going to beat her ass. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=3744.0s)]

*  It does. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4195.0s)]
*  I think it would mean because I thought I took the shot. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4196.0s)]
*  Oh I can eat now. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4199.0s)]
*  It didn't curb your appetite. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4200.0s)]
*  It did but it didn't get to my brains. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4206.0s)]
*  I don't think the shot got to my brain. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4208.0s)]
*  That's the problem with food right. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4210.0s)]
*  Part of it's pleasure. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4211.0s)]
*  It's not just you're hungry. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4213.0s)]
*  Yeah yeah but I don't know. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4214.0s)]
*  I'm good. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4217.0s)]
*  Nothing has happened so I don't have any medical issues. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4218.0s)]
*  Thank God but I would like to lose a little bottom stone. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4221.0s)]
*  Why don't you just get like a trainer. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4225.0s)]
*  Get a trainer and a meal prep person. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4227.0s)]

*  Yeah do that because it be easy. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4232.0s)]

*  I'm just going to send a meal prep person and a trainer to my house. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4238.0s)]
*  Yeah I'll do it. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4241.0s)]
*  I will I'll do it. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4244.0s)]
*  If that's what you want I'll find someone for you. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4246.0s)]
*  Okay I'm in Atlanta. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4248.0s)]
*  I'm quite sure there's a bunch of meal preppers down there. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4249.0s)]
*  Yeah I just want something that tastes good though. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4252.0s)]
*  You want to make that's the thing. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4254.0s)]
*  It's like this meal prep they give you like a fucking chicken breast and a piece of broccoli. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4255.0s)]
*  Like I'm not going to last. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4259.0s)]
*  No. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4260.0s)]
*  I'm not going to make it. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4261.0s)]
*  I'll tell you something that I stop. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4262.0s)]
*  I don't eat till 12. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4263.0s)]
*  Till 12 in the evening. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4265.0s)]
*  I stop at 6. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4266.0s)]
*  And I love the kale salads at Chick-fil-A. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4267.0s)]
*  I don't know if they're healthy but they're pretty fucking good. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4272.0s)]
*  I bet they're if you want to investigate their dressing. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4274.0s)]
*  I guarantee you it's filled with seed oils. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4278.0s)]
*  Half of the time it's dry as fuck. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4281.0s)]
*  So a lot of time at my Chick-fil-A I think they forget to put the dressing on it. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4284.0s)]
*  And I'm like what a fucking dressing. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4288.0s)]
*  I'm just eating kale. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4290.0s)]
*  Chick-fil-A is a funny place. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4293.0s)]
*  It's like the funny thing is they close on Sunday. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4295.0s)]
*  They Christians. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4297.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4299.0s)]
*  They're missing out on so much money just because they don't care. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4300.0s)]
*  God has blessed them through the week. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4303.0s)]
*  Have you not seen them lines? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4305.0s)]
*  Just get them big fucking lines at Chick-fil-A. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4306.0s)]
*  It's amazing that nobody figured out that chicken sandwiches were like a big deal before Chick-fil-A. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4308.0s)]
*  So I had a friend one time. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4313.0s)]
*  I knew this guy who would take Chick-fil-A chicken to the store. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4315.0s)]
*  So he would always stop by my house and give me a couple cases. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4318.0s)]
*  And they're in there. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4322.0s)]
*  They pre-wrapped in this marinade sauce. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4323.0s)]
*  Oh, that was the best stolen chicken we ever had. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4325.0s)]
*  He used to give us like four or five boxes because he delivered their chicken. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4330.0s)]
*  He ain't give a fuck. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4334.0s)]
*  Chick-fil-A is weird too because they've got some very interesting views on gay people too. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4335.0s)]
*  Yeah, but all Christians do. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4342.0s)]
*  You know, my daddy was very religious. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4344.0s)]
*  And my daughter, Bar, is called one time. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4350.0s)]
*  And my daddy didn't know she was gay, but she was short with these LeBron James looking chicks. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4353.0s)]
*  So my daddy called me along. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4365.0s)]
*  My daughter is called one day. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4366.0s)]
*  This is my favorite story about my daddy, Russ and Pete. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4367.0s)]
*  He said, Pat, I said, what daddy said? [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4369.0s)]
*  Oh, no, if you know this. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4371.0s)]
*  I said, what daddy said? [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4373.0s)]
*  But I think your daughter is a bull goddamn daigle. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4374.0s)]
*  I told my daughter, I said, take your granddaughter to your car back. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4379.0s)]
*  He don't figure you out, bitch. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4384.0s)]
*  He said, you a bull goddamn daigle. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4386.0s)]
*  We laughed for about two hours because the way he said it, nobody says like that. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4389.0s)]
*  And it's a word you shouldn't even say that according to my daughter. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4394.0s)]
*  But that was the funniest shit I can remember about my daddy saying. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4397.0s)]
*  When he discovered my daughter was gay, she keep bringing these big bitches around. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4400.0s)]
*  You know, like they used to play ball. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4404.0s)]
*  Oh, that's hilarious. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4406.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what he's saying. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4407.0s)]
*  He's like, we got to pray for. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4409.0s)]
*  I said, what we praying for? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4411.0s)]
*  We got to pray that shit out of not me. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4412.0s)]
*  I'm not wasting my time. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4415.0s)]
*  That spirit is strong and I'm trying to get to heaven. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4416.0s)]
*  You can't pray nobody out of eating pussy. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4419.0s)]
*  I said, daddy, you did it. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4423.0s)]
*  She's just doing it with titties. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4425.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4427.0s)]
*  Good point. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4429.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4430.0s)]
*  So I said, I'm not going to pray for you. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4431.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4433.0s)]
*  Good point. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4434.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4435.0s)]
*  So I'm not fucking with her sexuality. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4436.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can't. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4437.0s)]
*  You're just going to make someone hate you. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4438.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4440.0s)]
*  So she's happy. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4441.0s)]
*  So, but it was interesting seeing my Christian daddy accept my gay daughter. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4442.0s)]
*  A lot of those people in the old school, they had a hard time with that. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4446.0s)]
*  They did. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4449.0s)]
*  They did. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4450.0s)]
*  Especially religious folks. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4451.0s)]
*  My mother-in-law was like that, even the one who told me she was gay. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4452.0s)]
*  But that's just life. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4455.0s)]
*  Who gives a fuck? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4456.0s)]
*  You know, those people are lonely. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4457.0s)]
*  When you worried about other people being like I said earlier, you're just lonely, Joe. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4459.0s)]
*  I have no time to be worried about what's going on with people. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4462.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4465.0s)]
*  I got my own household. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4466.0s)]
*  I'm building a house. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4467.0s)]
*  I'm doing TV. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4468.0s)]
*  You know, I got an overall deal with Viacom. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4469.0s)]
*  I'm trying to create some shit. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4472.0s)]
*  Beautiful. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4474.0s)]
*  I'm trying to work. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4475.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a positive attitude. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4476.0s)]
*  You're right, though, about people that are too concerned about other people. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4478.0s)]
*  It's just, it's wasted energy. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4481.0s)]
*  You know, people try... [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4482.0s)]
*  You're wasting your life. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4483.0s)]
*  You know, the biggest thing that I hope that don't happen, and I don't even want to really [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4484.0s)]
*  get into it. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4489.0s)]
*  DeSanto, please don't fuck up Disney. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4490.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4492.0s)]
*  You ain't gonna fuck up Disney? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4493.0s)]
*  I don't know, but they suing each other. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4494.0s)]
*  I'm like, can you leave Mickey Mouse alone? [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4497.0s)]
*  It'll be fine. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4500.0s)]
*  Please. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4501.0s)]
*  I hope so. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4502.0s)]
*  You can't close the happiest place on earth. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4503.0s)]
*  They're not gonna close. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4505.0s)]
*  They didn't close during the pandemic. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4506.0s)]
*  They're not gonna close. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4508.0s)]
*  Did I go during the pandemic? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4509.0s)]
*  I went right after the pandemic with my family. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4511.0s)]
*  We went to Universal. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4513.0s)]
*  We went to VIP. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4514.0s)]
*  I'm quite sure you've been VIP. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4516.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4518.0s)]

*  If y'all go to Disney and don't go VIP, you're missing out. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4522.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're cutting all the lines. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4526.0s)]
*  You're going through the back door. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4528.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4529.0s)]
*  It ain't cutting the line, because they got a pass you can cut the line. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4530.0s)]
*  Everybody else had to wait. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4532.0s)]
*  And I remember, I heard people, because all of us, big and black, and they was like, are [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4533.0s)]
*  they athletes? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4536.0s)]
*  And we're like, no bitch, just a mama comedian. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4537.0s)]
*  It was the best experience. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4540.0s)]
*  My kids, we really enjoyed it. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4543.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4546.0s)]
*  You know, when my kids were little, Disneyland, we went there constantly. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4547.0s)]
*  And when it was shut down during the pandemic, I was really worried that it wasn't gonna [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4550.0s)]
*  be able to come back. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4554.0s)]
*  Because when you hear about how much money they were losing, they were losing some insane [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4555.0s)]
*  amount of money every day, and California wouldn't let them open up. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4558.0s)]
*  It didn't make any sense. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4561.0s)]
*  I like the one in Florida. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4562.0s)]
*  I don't care for the one in California. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4563.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4565.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4566.0s)]
*  The one in Florida has the best ride ever. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4567.0s)]
*  The Jurassic, not Jurassic part, Avatar rides. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4568.0s)]
*  Flights of Passage. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4573.0s)]
*  Have you been on that one? [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4574.0s)]
*  I don't get on no fucking roller coaster. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4575.0s)]
*  It's not that. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4577.0s)]
*  It's virtual reality. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4578.0s)]
*  You sit on what looks like a motorcycle. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4579.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4581.0s)]
*  You put on virtual reality headsets, and you're flying through, but you're not moving. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4582.0s)]
*  My panty liner can't take that stress. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4586.0s)]
*  No? [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4588.0s)]
*  No. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4589.0s)]
*  My kids enjoy it. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4590.0s)]
*  I done walked out of that bitch pissy. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4591.0s)]
*  But it doesn't move much. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4593.0s)]
*  It's mostly in your head. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4595.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you think you move it. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4597.0s)]
*  It makes you feel like you're moving. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4598.0s)]
*  Also, with that Harry Potter ride. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4600.0s)]
*  That fucker. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4602.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4603.0s)]
*  I can't do that. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4604.0s)]
*  But I saw my family. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4605.0s)]
*  That's a fun ride. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4606.0s)]
*  You got on it? [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4607.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4608.0s)]
*  Yeah, one of my daughters was very into Harry Potter. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4609.0s)]
*  She read all the novels, and I had to take her a bunch of times. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4610.72s)]
*  I've been on that ride multiple times. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4613.0s)]
*  No, I don't get on any rides. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4614.0s)]
*  I just like, I can rent a scooter, an old people scooter, ride through the park. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4615.0s)]
*  I wonder what it's like at the Harry Potter world now, because everybody hates J.K. Rowling [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4618.6s)]
*  because of her stance on trans women. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4623.0s)]
*  There's so many people that hate her. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4626.0s)]
*  I wonder if they've rebelled against Harry Potter world. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4627.5s)]
*  Probably have. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4630.0s)]
*  What did she say? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4631.0s)]
*  I don't think it was that unreasonable. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4632.0s)]
*  It was something about biological men never being women. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4634.0s)]
*  It was something to the total of trying to preserve the idea of being a woman. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4639.0s)]
*  What did she say that was so questionable? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4644.0s)]
*  Was that the whole thing when trans people, men was talking about being, they need to [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4646.0s)]
*  get rid of the song Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4650.0s)]
*  You seen that whole thing? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4654.0s)]
*  I have seen that stupid shit. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4655.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4657.0s)]
*  There's a lot of stupid shit going on with that. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4658.0s)]
*  Because what it is, is like men, biological men behaving like men in women's spaces. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4659.0s)]
*  So they want to take over things. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4664.0s)]
*  That's what you see. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4667.0s)]
*  I don't agree with them being in sports. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4668.0s)]
*  No fucking way. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4670.0s)]
*  I mean, no matter what, you're weak and I support you 100%. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4671.0s)]
*  So what did she say? [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4674.0s)]
*  Okay, people who menstruate, in quotes. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4676.0s)]
*  I'm sure there used to be a word for these people. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4678.0s)]
*  Someone help me out. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4681.0s)]
*  One been womaned opinion, creating a more equal post COVID-19 world for people who menstruate. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4682.0s)]
*  So what she's trying to say is that saying things like people who menstruate, like you [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4688.0s)]
*  are eliminating the idea of being a woman, because now you're saying that anybody could [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4692.0s)]
*  be a woman. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4697.0s)]
*  And so she says here, if sex isn't real, there's no same sex attraction. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4698.0s)]
*  If sex isn't real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4702.0s)]
*  I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4706.0s)]
*  many to meaningfully discuss their lives. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4711.0s)]
*  It isn't hate to speak the truth. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4713.0s)]
*  See, what she's saying is not unreasonable. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4715.0s)]
*  The idea that women like me, who've been empathetic to trans people for decades, feeling kinship [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4718.0s)]
*  because they're vulnerable in the same way as women, i.e. to male violence, hate trans [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4724.0s)]
*  people because they think sex is real, that have lived and has lived consequences is a [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4731.0s)]
*  nonsense. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4736.0s)]
*  So she's not saying anything that's that outrageous. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4738.0s)]
*  She's being rational about something that seems like very much cult-like behavior. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4742.0s)]
*  You're trying to eliminate the term woman. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4747.0s)]
*  She says, I've never felt shouted at, ignored and targeted as a lesbian within our supposed [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4750.0s)]
*  GLBT community as I have over the past couple of years, anonymous letter from a terrified [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4757.0s)]
*  lesbian. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4762.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4763.0s)]
*  Well, so they're trying to say that she's a turf, which is a trans, exclusively trans [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4765.0s)]
*  trans, exclusionary, radical feminist. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4771.0s)]
*  So a radical feminist who doesn't want trans people to be in feminist spaces. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4773.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of women that think that women's spaces should be for biological women [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4779.0s)]
*  and that when you let biological males into women's spaces, even if they say they identify [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4785.0s)]
*  as being a woman, oftentimes they have, first of all, they're not biological women. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4790.0s)]
*  Like the one who was in prison and got the women pregnant. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4796.0s)]
*  Yeah, two women pregnant or these fucking athletes that are breaking records, which [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4799.0s)]
*  is just insanity. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4804.0s)]
*  Wasn't they boxing? [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4805.0s)]
*  Wasn't the trans women boxing in the women lead also? [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4806.0s)]
*  There was one MMA fighter. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4810.0s)]
*  It was an MMA fighter that fought two women, two biological women before anyone beat the [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4812.0s)]
*  fucking shit out of them before people knew that she was a biological male. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4818.0s)]
*  She didn't tell anybody. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4823.0s)]
*  So she fought two fights with these biological women, with these women not knowing that she [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4824.0s)]
*  used to be a man for 30 years and even fathered a child. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4829.0s)]
*  It's cult thinking. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4833.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4834.0s)]
*  The trans fighter fathered a child. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4835.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4837.0s)]
*  So who the fuck told on them? [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4838.0s)]
*  I don't know what happened, how it got revealed. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4840.0s)]
*  But then it was just a giant outrage. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4842.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4845.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to fight you, Joe, because you put on a fucking wig. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4846.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's ridiculous. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4849.0s)]
*  I still got a wound. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4850.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4851.0s)]
*  It's wrong in every shape. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4852.0s)]
*  I'm a man. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4853.0s)]
*  Yeah, especially not. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4854.0s)]
*  Look, if someone knows that that person's a trans woman and you still want to fight [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4855.0s)]
*  them, it's up to you. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4860.0s)]
*  That's different. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4861.0s)]
*  But not knowing and saying that there's no difference between a trans woman and a biological [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4862.0s)]
*  woman, that's horseshit. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4867.0s)]
*  Excuse me. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4868.0s)]
*  I can pull off my panties and prove to you it's a different Joe. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4869.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4873.0s)]
*  There's differences in so many ways. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4874.0s)]
*  I mean, it's very different. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4875.0s)]
*  Yeah, my shit come off sticky. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4877.0s)]
*  I like how you said, like you did the laundry before. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4879.0s)]
*  So that's what they're mad at. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4886.0s)]
*  That led to this giant backlash. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4888.0s)]
*  But it became a thing where people can just say, J.K. Rawlings is transphobic, and they [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4890.0s)]
*  probably don't even know the quotes, and they just attack her online. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4895.0s)]
*  So she's always defending herself and they're always attacking her. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4898.0s)]
*  But I'm quite sure they still support her. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4901.0s)]

*  I don't know. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4920.0s)]
*  I wonder if they're going to woke-ify it. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4921.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4922.0s)]
*  They're going to fuck it up. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4923.0s)]
*  They're not going to fuck it up. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4924.0s)]

*  What happened to Bud Light? [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4940.0s)]
*  Bud Light had this trans woman who was like this TikTok famous person named Dorn Boulay. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4941.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4947.0s)]
*  I heard about her. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4948.0s)]
*  They sent her cans of Bud Light with her face on it, and everybody went crazy because she [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4949.0s)]
*  did all these, you know, this thing online about it, and everybody was like, fuck Bud [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4955.0s)]
*  Light. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4959.48s)]
*  Now, like all these right-wing people are boycotting Bud Light. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4960.48s)]
*  They don't want to drink their beer and look down at those trans person, huh? [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4963.72s)]
*  Well, it was that, and it was also the person who was running the campaign said something [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4967.12s)]
*  about fratty senses of humor, that the beer was out of touch, and that they wanted to [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4971.12s)]
*  be more inclusive. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4976.96s)]
*  So they were basically shitting on all their old fans of Bud Light, all the people who [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4977.96s)]
*  were their customers. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4984.04s)]
*  They were talking down to them. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4985.52s)]
*  She was saying, well, we need to bring in, the brand is dying. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4987.72s)]
*  It's not inclusive. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4991.360000000001s)]
*  We need to make it more inclusive. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4992.64s)]
*  And by inclusive, they decided to go with this trans person who's an attention whore. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4993.92s)]
*  This is like, look, day 365 of womanhood. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=4999.200000000001s)]

*  Yeah, real recent. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5011.200000000001s)]
*  And Bud Light put him on a can? [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5012.200000000001s)]
*  Not only that, like other companies have done stuff with her, him, they, I don't know how [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5016.240000000001s)]
*  they represent themselves, but like I think it was Maybelline did something. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5021.88s)]
*  Now people want to boycott Maybelline. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5027.8s)]
*  God damn. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5029.64s)]
*  Is it Maybelline? [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5030.64s)]
*  No idea. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5031.64s)]
*  Hey world, could I just say something to y'all? [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5032.64s)]
*  Trans people gotta eat too. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5034.76s)]

*  Trans people gotta eat too. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5037.56s)]
*  But it's also, it's like these companies don't really, they're just doing it because they [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5038.56s)]
*  think that's the hip thing to do. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5042.400000000001s)]
*  They're doing it because they think that somehow or another it's going to connect. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5044.2s)]
*  Like people can go, yeah, we're going to support Bud Light now. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5046.400000000001s)]

*  I don't know, I'm asking. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5162.68s)]
*  But I think that looked bad. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5164.12s)]
*  It was like facelifts. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5165.68s)]
*  I think what they do now, like if you look at what the nip and tucks today, like they're [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5166.72s)]

*  Oh yeah, do you remember back in the day they had to cut you and pull your face all the [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5171.76s)]

*  I would do it too far sometimes. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5176.64s)]
*  You look like Biden. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5178.28s)]
*  Let me say this. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5179.28s)]
*  Biden is such a fucking liar. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5180.28s)]
*  I mean, I'm a Democrat, but all those times he said he had COVID, we knew he wouldn't [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5185.28s)]
*  got his eyes redone. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5192.16s)]
*  Those fucking eyes are at least five years old. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5195.4s)]
*  I mean, they're smoother than a baby's ass, but his cheeks is 88. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5198.5199999999995s)]
*  So I'm like, it doesn't match. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5202.5599999999995s)]
*  His whole face looks weird. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5205.76s)]
*  Because he only get eye lifts. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5207.68s)]
*  But he's doing something. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5208.96s)]
*  It looks like he's got Botox too. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5210.44s)]
*  Yeah, right up under the eyes. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5211.92s)]
*  Look at the bags. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5213.92s)]
*  Now look at the recent picture. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5216.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's got, look, no, those are bags. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5218.599999999999s)]
*  He's got so much eye work done. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5221.84s)]
*  Yeah, that seems weird to me. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5224.12s)]
*  Yeah, to the point, you can't even, he almost can't open his eyes anymore. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5226.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it looks very different, that's for sure. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5230.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5234.16s)]
*  Poor president. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5235.16s)]
*  Poor president. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5236.16s)]

*  I just can't believe that. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5238.52s)]
*  What, he's running again? [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5239.76s)]
*  Yeah, I just can't believe that. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5240.76s)]
*  I can't believe they let him. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5242.360000000001s)]
*  Doesn't make any sense. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5244.4800000000005s)]
*  They can't talk. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5245.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, they let Trump run several times. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5246.4800000000005s)]
*  Trump can at least form a sentence. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5249.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5251.919999999999s)]
*  Like Biden. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5252.919999999999s)]
*  Trump forms a lot of the wrong sentences. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5253.919999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of that. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5256.2s)]
*  Biden does too. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5258.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5259.96s)]
*  All of them a bunch of liars. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5260.96s)]
*  They're all a bunch of liars. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5262.96s)]
*  All they want us to do is fight. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5263.96s)]
*  We fight amongst ourselves while they spend our money. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5265.5199999999995s)]
*  That's why I worry about things like the abortion issue and I worry about some other issues. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5267.919999999999s)]
*  I think that sometimes those things, they're just designed to keep everybody at each other's [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5272.08s)]
*  throats. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5277.36s)]
*  Why they go off and do dumb shit? [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5278.5199999999995s)]
*  Why they go off and make dumb decisions while we're not paying attention? [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5280.639999999999s)]
*  They put small things for us to fight about. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5283.32s)]
*  Then behind the door, they fucking up all kinds of other big shit. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5285.48s)]
*  Then when it finally comes to the light, you're like, what the hell? [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5289.28s)]
*  Where did this come from? [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5291.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5292.5599999999995s)]
*  So, you know. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5293.5599999999995s)]
*  They get us upset about things. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5294.5599999999995s)]
*  Next thing is going to be climate change. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5296.0s)]
*  That's what people are going to be fighting off. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5297.92s)]
*  Just like they were fighting over COVID. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5299.48s)]
*  Race, everything else. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5301.08s)]

*  My friend was telling me, immigrants. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5309.76s)]
*  My friend was telling me the other day that somebody just passed a law where if you got [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5312.4400000000005s)]
*  a good credit score, you get a higher interest rate. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5317.0s)]
*  Biden just did that. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5319.76s)]
*  If you got a bad credit score, you get a, what the fuck is going on? [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5321.160000000001s)]
*  So all of these years, you work to have good credit. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5326.160000000001s)]
*  You paid your bill on time. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5330.120000000001s)]
*  So you're going to punish me by doing the right thing, but the person with the lower [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5332.320000000001s)]
*  credit score who probably can't even afford the damn house can get the house at a better [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5336.16s)]
*  rate? [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5340.28s)]
*  Yes. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5341.28s)]
*  A person who's been bad at paying their bills gets a better rate. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5342.28s)]
*  They get a better insurance rate, which is insane. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5345.0s)]
*  If you want to have it equal, you want to have people not penalized because they have [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5347.32s)]
*  bad credit, that's fine. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5350.5599999999995s)]
*  If you want to do that, okay. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5352.5199999999995s)]
*  You want to make it so you don't incentivize people to have good credit, that's what you [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5354.2s)]
*  want to do. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5358.12s)]
*  But to penalize people who've done the right thing is just un-American. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5359.12s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5362.48s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5363.48s)]
*  Doesn't make any sense. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5364.48s)]
*  I was telling my friends, I worked my ass off to get my credit score right. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5365.879999999999s)]
*  Now you're telling me I could get a better interest rate with my 400 I had? [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5368.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's not saying that some people aren't cast into very difficult situations, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5373.48s)]
*  but what it is saying is that some people have been as responsible as they can and they [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5377.5599999999995s)]
*  should be rewarded for it. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5381.919999999999s)]
*  And other people have been as irresponsible as they can and they shouldn't be rewarded [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5384.2s)]
*  for it. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5387.719999999999s)]
*  I agree. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5388.719999999999s)]
*  It's like... [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5389.719999999999s)]
*  And they say it's a law now. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5390.719999999999s)]
*  Is that real? [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5392.719999999999s)]
*  Was that 100%? [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5393.719999999999s)]
*  I was trying to find... [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5394.96s)]
*  I had read that this... [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5395.96s)]
*  I saw the meme online for sure going around, but I had read an explanation that it wasn't [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5398.88s)]
*  accurate. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5403.64s)]
*  Thank God. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5404.64s)]
*  Because somebody commented... [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5405.64s)]
*  Wasn't that it? [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5406.64s)]
*  That it's not... [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5407.64s)]
*  They get a 1% credit. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5408.64s)]
*  It's just like 1% less than it was or something like that. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5412.08s)]
*  It was like... [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5414.88s)]
*  I thought there was a different rate. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5415.88s)]
*  I thought the law was that it's like one... [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5417.92s)]
*  I don't know what the number difference was, but it was a considerable difference in the [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5421.12s)]
*  rate. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5424.96s)]
*  Because if you got good credit and you're applying for some, you could probably get [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5425.96s)]
*  the 2% that they're advertising. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5428.84s)]
*  But somebody with bad credit might get 8% or 7%. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5430.32s)]
*  So I told... [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5436.04s)]
*  I said, I haven't read anything on it, so I don't know. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5437.04s)]
*  I said, but that's the craziest shit I've heard. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5438.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5440.96s)]
*  It's like they're taking a risk. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5441.96s)]
*  So they want you to pay more because they're taking a risk. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5443.4800000000005s)]
*  So the idea is that enough people are going to default on it that they will still make [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5445.64s)]
*  their money. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5449.24s)]
*  Because they got insurance on it. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5450.5599999999995s)]

*  Like that's. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5693.28s)]
*  Proof. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5694.28s)]
*  It's pretty much proof. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5695.28s)]
*  You're trying to get a boy to French kiss you. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5697.28s)]

*  You know what that is. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5707.04s)]
*  Yeah pedophilia. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5708.04s)]
*  There's two things I was going to add before. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5709.68s)]
*  Tongue greeting in Tibetan culture. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5712.12s)]
*  The video was edited slightly. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5713.48s)]
*  How so? [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5715.84s)]
*  It's a longer video than the clip that went viral. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5716.84s)]
*  And it has there's context that I think was edited out. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5720.76s)]
*  Not that we're going to understand it probably. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5724.6s)]
*  See this is see Tibetan culture. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5727.28s)]
*  So sticking out your tongue according to a 2014 BBC article sticking out your tongue [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5730.48s)]
*  can be considered as rude. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5735.5599999999995s)]
*  But in Tibet it's a way of greeting. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5737.5199999999995s)]
*  That's just sticking your tongue out. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5739.879999999999s)]
*  That's not sucking on someone's tongue. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5742.839999999999s)]
*  That's a very different thing. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5745.44s)]
*  It says it has a tradition followed by the Tibetan people since the ninth century when [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5746.44s)]
*  the region was ruled by long drama who is known for a fat for a black tongue. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5750.32s)]
*  Oh so he had a black tongue. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5755.919999999999s)]
*  So that was why sticking out the tongue became like a greeting because this guy had a crazy [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5757.879999999999s)]
*  tongue you want to show everybody. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5762.04s)]
*  His tongue was black. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5764.04s)]
*  What was he saying? [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5765.6s)]
*  Guy had a black tongue. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5766.6s)]
*  After the death of the king, locals started showing their tongues when asked to confirm [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5767.6s)]
*  they are not like him or his reincarnation. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5771.36s)]
*  Oh interesting. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5774.16s)]
*  Yeah but that has nothing to do with sucking on a tongue. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5775.16s)]
*  If he said that stick your tongue out and the other guy went ah. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5779.5199999999995s)]
*  It was funny. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5782.08s)]
*  That's funny. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5783.08s)]
*  To a guy and a kid sticking your tongue up. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5784.08s)]
*  Being silly. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5787.16s)]
*  But suck my tongue? [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5788.16s)]
*  That's a totally different enterprise. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5789.56s)]
*  How would you have reacted? [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5791.16s)]
*  I would have beat the fuck out of him. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5792.16s)]
*  I would have certainly screamed at him. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5794.12s)]
*  I would have certainly been like what the fuck are you doing? [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5796.28s)]
*  When this story first hit. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5799.6s)]
*  So you know everything on Translate, I'm a little slow sometimes. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5801.04s)]
*  I thought it was like when they said Dalai Lama, I thought it was like one of them big [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5804.5199999999995s)]
*  ass llama. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5807.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5808.44s)]
*  Them things on talk. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5810.44s)]
*  I'm sorry that's the dumbness in me. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5817.44s)]
*  And I was like wait a minute. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5819.44s)]
*  That's what I was thinking about. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5821.799999999999s)]
*  One of them llama things. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5823.799999999999s)]
*  I was like hold on. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5824.799999999999s)]
*  He talking about. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5825.799999999999s)]
*  I was like I would have beat his ass. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5826.799999999999s)]
*  He's a very bizarre religious figure because he was chosen when he was a small child that [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5828.799999999999s)]
*  he was the Dalai Lama. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5834.44s)]
*  So he's been the Dalai Lama his whole life. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5835.759999999999s)]
*  So it's not like a position he earned through being this incredible person that everybody [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5837.98s)]
*  realizes like the reincarnation of some holy person. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5844.04s)]
*  So who's that to him? [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5847.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5849.2s)]
*  I don't know what they do. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5850.2s)]
*  I think they pick one. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5851.96s)]
*  I don't know how they do. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5852.96s)]
*  I don't know what the tradition is. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5853.96s)]
*  But I believe he was picked. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5854.96s)]
*  See if you can find out how they've picked the Dalai Lama. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5855.96s)]
*  But he's been the Dalai Lama like his whole life. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5859.639999999999s)]
*  So he's been this religious you know worshiped person his whole life. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5862.5199999999995s)]
*  So what a weird life that guy's had. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5868.16s)]
*  How many times has he sucked? [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5870.16s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5871.8s)]
*  How many times somebody sucked his tongue? [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5872.8s)]
*  Quite a few. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5874.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5876.96s)]

*  Whew. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5885.72s)]
*  So I don't go to church. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5886.72s)]
*  Okay when the Dalai Lama dies or even before their death a successor is found rather than [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5891.72s)]
*  chosen. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5895.56s)]
*  Traditionally senior Tibetan monks conduct an elaborate quest to find a child who is [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5896.56s)]
*  the Dalai Lama's next incarnation. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5901.28s)]
*  The search involves consulting oracles interpreting visions and reading spiritual signs. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5903.6s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=5908.96s)]

*  I didn't think you would have dead skulls. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6110.58s)]
*  I did at one point in time. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6113.26s)]
*  I had a I bought a whole dead skeleton online and I put it in my piranha tank. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6114.54s)]

*  I guarantee you that. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6136.0199999999995s)]

*  Did you just say? [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6138.0199999999995s)]
*  I was a man that was like had money and I lived by myself. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6139.46s)]
*  I was a crazy person. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6142.660000000001s)]
*  So what did the piranhas do? [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6144.740000000001s)]
*  Did they eat it? [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6145.740000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6146.740000000001s)]
*  They ate goldfish. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6147.740000000001s)]
*  I'd feed them goldfish. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6148.740000000001s)]
*  Did you ever stick your hand in there and sit there and really bite you? [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6149.740000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6154.02s)]
*  Have you saw what they did to those goldfish? [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6155.02s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6156.740000000001s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6157.740000000001s)]
*  So like every few days I would have just a slaughter fest in my living room. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6159.14s)]
*  I would go to the store. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6163.700000000001s)]
*  I'd go to the pet store and I'd buy a big bag of goldfish and I'd just dump them in [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6165.38s)]
*  there with the piranhas and it would just be madness. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6169.66s)]
*  You'd see goldfish swimming away like half bit and they'd just bite them in half. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6172.3s)]
*  Half of them swimming away and they'd bite each other's lips off because they were trying [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6177.58s)]
*  to steal food from each other. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6182.0199999999995s)]
*  Why do you drop chickens and shit in now? [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6183.5s)]
*  You could if you wanted to but I'm not a fan of torturing mammals. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6186.58s)]
*  I don't have feelings like that towards fish. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6190.54s)]
*  Goldfish eat fish and that's just what they do. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6192.62s)]
*  But I threw a mouse in there or something. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6194.46s)]
*  I'd probably feel bad for that little guy. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6196.0599999999995s)]
*  They're too close to us. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6197.86s)]
*  They're warm-blooded. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6198.86s)]
*  They have fur. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6199.86s)]
*  Something about that. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6200.86s)]
*  Like feeding like if I had like fed a rat to a python I'd be like... [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6201.86s)]
*  This is like so close to the food chain whereas like throwing goldfish into a tank filled [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6208.0599999999995s)]
*  with piranhas like they have to eat. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6213.34s)]
*  They're gonna eat dead fish or live fish. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6214.74s)]
*  Like they'd rather eat them live. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6216.7s)]
*  That's what they like to do. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6217.98s)]
*  So you watch them do it they go into a feeding frenzy. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6219.46s)]
*  It was wild. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6222.94s)]
*  I just had a snake on my back porch. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6224.14s)]

*  Coyote? [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6618.38s)]
*  Yeah they're in New York. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6619.5s)]
*  But the problem with New York is the subway system. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6620.5s)]
*  New York the rats are all underground. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6622.62s)]
*  They are so embedded in the city they'll never get them out of the city. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6624.78s)]
*  There's more rats in New York City than there are human beings. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6627.7s)]
*  You take them coyotes down there. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6631.66s)]
*  They won't be able to do anything. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6633.74s)]
*  They'll be a lot of coyotes in New York City and they'll eat a lot of rats. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6635.54s)]
*  They'll never put a dent in the population. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6639.5s)]
*  Yeah because rats are always fucking. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6641.3s)]
*  They get underground too. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6643.54s)]
*  They get underground. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6644.86s)]
*  They get in the pipes. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6646.34s)]
*  They get in the walls. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6647.34s)]
*  They get in the buildings. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6648.34s)]
*  They get in the little tiny holes. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6650.3s)]
*  They can compress their body to get through a tiny little hole. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6651.3s)]
*  Just about as big as their face they can get through that. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6653.900000000001s)]
*  They'll chew through the walls. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6656.38s)]
*  Chew through pipes. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6657.38s)]
*  Rats go everywhere. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6658.9400000000005s)]
*  They'll go up your fucking toilet. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6659.9400000000005s)]
*  So one time when I just gave birth to my daughter by my husband. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6660.9400000000005s)]
*  So he go down to the kitchen. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6666.58s)]
*  We had just got our kitchen remodeled. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6667.58s)]
*  So these rats don't chew through the baseball. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6668.9800000000005s)]
*  So my husband come tipping back upstairs. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6671.46s)]
*  I said what's wrong? [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6672.74s)]
*  He said I need my fucking shoes. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6673.74s)]
*  I said what's wrong? [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6674.74s)]
*  Fucking rats. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6675.74s)]
*  And there was two rats in the kitchen. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6676.74s)]
*  And they just having a good time. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6677.74s)]
*  My husband, I go downstairs. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6679.62s)]
*  These fuckers ain't gonna get my baby. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6680.62s)]
*  He jump up on the aisle. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6682.099999999999s)]
*  Grab a can of tuna, Joe. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6684.179999999999s)]
*  Threw the tuna and hit the fucking rat so hard upside the head. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6685.74s)]
*  That rat stood up and said. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6689.94s)]
*  And just stood up on his high leg and fell back. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6692.339999999999s)]
*  The other rat looked like oh they killing niggas around here. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6695.139999999999s)]
*  Jump back through that hole. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6700.74s)]
*  Jump back through that hole and we never had another rat coming out. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6703.98s)]
*  Really? [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6707.459999999999s)]
*  My husband hit that rat with a can of tuna upside his head. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6708.58s)]
*  That motherfucker stood up from the pain. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6712.02s)]
*  And that other rat looked and said oh I'm gonna hit this bitch. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6713.86s)]
*  He went back through that hole and he never came back, Joe. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6716.34s)]
*  Wow. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6719.58s)]
*  One can of tuna got rid of all rat problems. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6720.58s)]
*  That's effective. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6723.42s)]
*  I would have thought they would have come back. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6724.42s)]
*  Never came back. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6726.58s)]
*  Never had a problem. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6727.58s)]
*  Other problem I had was squirrels. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6728.58s)]
*  They used to fuck in my roof all the time. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6729.58s)]
*  You hear them up there? [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6731.58s)]
*  I told my husband. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6733.58s)]
*  I said don't you want to do what they doing? [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6734.58s)]
*  He's like she's a hoe. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6738.14s)]
*  So one of them fell out the roof down in the house through the vent. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6739.14s)]
*  And boy I was stuck in the house all day with my newborn baby. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6748.700000000001s)]
*  Because I was too scared to go downstairs. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6751.900000000001s)]
*  Because of the fucking squirrel. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6754.26s)]
*  My husband came home. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6755.26s)]
*  I said it's a fucking squirrel down there behind the sofa. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6756.26s)]
*  He moved us over the squirrel. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6759.38s)]
*  He kicked the squirrel so motherfucking hard. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6760.820000000001s)]
*  The squirrel laying in the tree. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6763.26s)]
*  I said I've been stuck in this room all day for this bullshit. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6765.62s)]
*  And you come kick the fucking squirrel in the ass and it's over. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6768.54s)]
*  So I'm scared of rodents. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6773.82s)]
*  Well no one's really scared of squirrels. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6775.66s)]
*  You're not scared of squirrels. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6777.5s)]
*  Yes the fuck I am. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6778.5s)]
*  They're cute. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6779.5s)]
*  They probably will whoop your ass too. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6780.5s)]
*  Yeah but they're not aggressive. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6783.18s)]
*  Rats can be aggressive. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6785.54s)]
*  No I'm not fucking with that. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6786.54s)]
*  I've never heard a squirrel biting anybody. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6787.54s)]
*  You ever heard a squirrel biting anybody? [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6789.54s)]
*  I'm quite sure squirrel bite people. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6791.099999999999s)]
*  I'm quite sure if you fuck with a squirrel they'll bite you. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6792.82s)]
*  But you have to probably have them trapped. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6795.179999999999s)]
*  You know what squirrels do do? [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6798.099999999999s)]
*  They bite the nuts off other squirrels. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6799.54s)]
*  Like when squirrels are trying to breed and there's another male squirrel by, one squirrel [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6803.66s)]
*  will bite that squirrel's nuts off. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6808.34s)]
*  What? [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6812.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6813.38s)]
*  That's some hating shit. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6814.38s)]
*  Oh hating shit. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6815.38s)]
*  They throw each other out of trees. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6816.38s)]
*  I've seen that. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6818.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6819.099999999999s)]
*  One of them will try to be fucking and the other one will come over and just literally [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6820.18s)]
*  toss the other one out of a tree. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6822.9800000000005s)]
*  They'll fall 50, 60 feet and they land on the ground and they're fine. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6824.780000000001s)]
*  They're like designed to fall out of trees. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6828.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6831.22s)]
*  I've seen them almost getting hit all the time. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6832.22s)]
*  You ever see how far a squirrel can fall and be fine? [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6834.26s)]
*  It's fucking crazy. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6837.9800000000005s)]
*  They fall like really far and hit the ground and just pshh, scoot back up the tree again. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6839.780000000001s)]
*  You are such an interesting person. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6846.5s)]
*  Do squirrels bite testicles off other squirrels? [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6850.1s)]
*  So has this been resolved? [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6853.34s)]
*  The answer is no. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6855.38s)]
*  No, they don't. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6856.38s)]
*  So it was an old wives tale? [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6857.38s)]
*  Yes. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6859.38s)]
*  Steve brought it up on a podcast. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6860.38s)]
*  He suggested this topic as a fact checker on episode 206. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6861.38s)]
*  I joked about everyone believes it because he said it so many times. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6864.22s)]
*  It's proven wrong when the meteor inbox flooded with messages from listeners in Pennsylvania, [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6867.780000000001s)]
*  Wisconsin, California, Kentucky and everywhere in between. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6872.1s)]
*  They told me that prior to Steve bringing it up, they'd heard this claim from grandads, [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6874.9400000000005s)]
*  uncles, cousins, neighbors, hunting mentors and more. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6878.9s)]
*  In Sigurd Olson's 1956 book, The Singing Wilderness is the oldest written source of this claim. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6882.82s)]
*  In the book inspired by Lake Superior's beauty, Olson has an entire chapter dedicated to red [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6892.219999999999s)]
*  squirrels. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6897.62s)]
*  I also know that owls like them as well as martins and they can throw the fear of death [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6898.62s)]
*  into larger gray squirrels should they invade through the convenient medium of castration. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6903.54s)]
*  Oh, so that's what he was saying. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6908.58s)]
*  I've literally watched squirrels for tens of thousands of hours in detailed behavior [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6911.18s)]
*  studies including a hundred or more mating bouts. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6915.0199999999995s)]
*  In some instances there were massive assemblances of dozens of males chasing a single female [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6918.3s)]
*  in estrus for seven to ten hours. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6923.1s)]
*  Through all of that, I never witnessed this happen. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6926.0199999999995s)]
*  The common folklore is just that folklore. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6928.5199999999995s)]
*  So it's not true. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6931.34s)]
*  Thank God. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6932.38s)]
*  Cause those little nuts off them gass. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6933.38s)]
*  There's no scientific evidence or observation to support this, Odell said. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6935.860000000001s)]
*  I've seen many squirrels fight over females and bite each other but not specifically targeting [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=6940.1s)]

*  So we better not fuck this up then. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7276.58s)]
*  We already fucked it up. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7278.58s)]
*  But have we really? I mean we're here right now, everything seems fine. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7280.58s)]
*  Everything is always seems fine until it hits you. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7283.58s)]
*  They ain't never tell you the truth until it hits you. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7286.58s)]
*  What are you worried about? [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7288.58s)]
*  Nothing. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7290.58s)]
*  What are you worried about it hitting? Like, until it hits you? [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7291.58s)]
*  I mean, you know, like, like the whole big thing was when people was like, [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7294.58s)]
*  COVID ain't real, then that shit hit us. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7298.58s)]
*  And we were like, oh, we didn't know what to do. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7300.58s)]
*  You know, people had, we had never experienced anything like this. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7302.58s)]
*  I mean, you know, we have been through a pandemic, but not this generation of people. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7308.58s)]
*  So we, we, we lost our fucking minds. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7312.58s)]
*  We definitely lost our fucking minds. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7315.58s)]
*  Yeah. We didn't, we didn't even know how to be in the house with each other. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7317.58s)]
*  You know, it's weird. It was just a couple of years ago. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7320.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7322.58s)]
*  But it seems so long ago. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7323.58s)]
*  Like, if the imagine the idea now being locked in your house and all stores being closed, [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7324.58s)]
*  that seems ridiculous. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7329.58s)]
*  It do. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7330.58s)]
*  But back then it's like we had all adapted quickly. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7331.58s)]
*  That was what bothered me. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7335.58s)]
*  We were scared. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7336.58s)]
*  That's what bothered me. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7337.58s)]
*  What bothered me that everybody quickly started listening to the government [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7338.58s)]
*  and all those businesses shut down because of it. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7341.58s)]
*  All those people lost their businesses. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7344.58s)]
*  They weren't allowed to be open. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7345.58s)]
*  Even if they had COVID and got over it, didn't matter. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7346.58s)]
*  Can't have a business open. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7349.58s)]
*  Too dangerous. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7350.58s)]
*  And they just let the economy crumble. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7351.58s)]
*  They just let 70% of all Los Angeles restaurants just went away forever. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7354.58s)]
*  That's a giant number of restaurants, small businesses, mom and pop stores. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7358.58s)]
*  Couldn't keep it open. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7363.58s)]
*  We're just barely getting by as it was. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7364.58s)]
*  Joe, I think a lot of people took that money and got the fuck on. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7367.58s)]
*  It was their way out. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7370.58s)]
*  Because the government gave a lot of money away. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7371.58s)]
*  Did they? How much did they give away? [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7373.58s)]
*  They gave a lot of money away. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7375.58s)]
*  I know a lot of people had fake businesses. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7376.58s)]
*  That's why they locking them up now. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7379.58s)]
*  They gave up. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7381.58s)]
*  And it was like they opened up the bank and said, take all you want. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7382.58s)]
*  We want you to survive, but we're going to lock your ass up if you're lying. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7386.58s)]
*  What is that lawsuit that I see that's going on right now, [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7389.58s)]
*  the criminal trial with a dude from the Fugees? [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7392.58s)]
*  What is that? [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7395.58s)]
*  Do you know that story? [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7397.58s)]
*  Yeah, it said he was an FBI, a snitch. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7398.58s)]
*  Yeah, but I think he's a double agent. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7400.58s)]
*  What? [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7403.58s)]
*  Because apparently Tupac said back in the day he knew he was an FBI or something. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7404.58s)]
*  So Tupac said he was FBI back in the day? [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7407.58s)]
*  Nobody listened to Tupac. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7409.58s)]
*  Tupac's mother was a Black Panther. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7411.58s)]
*  Maybe they should have listened. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7412.58s)]
*  They should have. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7413.58s)]
*  So he came out, he was really an FBI agent, right? [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7414.58s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7417.58s)]
*  Was he really an FBI agent? [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7420.58s)]
*  So here's one story. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7422.58s)]
*  Fuji rapper. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7424.58s)]
*  Fuji rapper, Pros testifies he met and shared information with the FBI voluntarily. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7425.58s)]
*  On who? [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7430.58s)]
*  So Jeff Sessions' testimony was not exciting. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7433.58s)]
*  The defense basically had him describe an official legal process for considering extraditing Guo at China's request. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7435.58s)]
*  The apparent idea was to suggest that there was nothing so bad in Pros and company trying to have Guo sent back to China. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7443.58s)]
*  Pros is testifying in his own defense, told the judge, [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7451.58s)]
*  after consulting with my attorneys and the universe, I decided that I will testify. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7454.58s)]
*  Oh, he consulted with the universe. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7458.58s)]
*  I like how people talk like that. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7460.58s)]
*  He's facing 10 charges, including conspiracy, witness tampering, and failing to register as an agent of China. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7462.58s)]
*  Who the fuck is Cha? [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7469.58s)]
*  I mean, Guo. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7470.58s)]
*  He's an agent of China. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7471.58s)]
*  The Black dude? [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7472.58s)]
*  Yes. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7473.58s)]
*  That guy was a billionaire he was talking about. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7474.58s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7476.58s)]
*  On the stand, Pros addressed his alleged efforts to get the U.S. to extradite Chinese billionaire Guo Wenjie. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7478.58s)]
*  In addition, he denied acting as an agent for China. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7485.58s)]
*  I took it upon myself to report because I thought the FBI should know he testified. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7490.58s)]
*  Before his trial started, the 50-year-old artist told Rolling Stone, [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7493.58s)]
*  what benefit would I get trying to break laws? [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7496.58s)]
*  It's not worth it to me. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7498.58s)]
*  I'm like a pariah now. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7500.58s)]
*  I've got friends who won't talk to me because they think there's a satellite in orbit listening to them. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7501.58s)]
*  To be clear, Pros never testified in the stand that he was an FBI informant. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7506.58s)]
*  His approach to the FBI to discuss Guo Wenjie and three Americans held in China was completely voluntary. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7510.58s)]
*  If convicted, Pros serves 22 years in prison. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7518.58s)]
*  What do they think he did? [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7521.58s)]
*  This is what I understand. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7523.58s)]
*  What are they accusing him of? [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7524.58s)]
*  Okay. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7529.58s)]
*  It says, the veteran Reimer was the middleman for alleged crimes, [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7530.58s)]
*  including a secret lobbying campaign to help Malaysian billionaire Joe Lau put pressure on American justice officials [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7535.58s)]
*  and White House officials when his fraud scheme unraveled [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7544.58s)]
*  and to help the Chinese government secure the return of a dissident who is living inside the U.S. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7549.58s)]
*  I don't know what none of that shit means. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7555.58s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure what he did. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7557.58s)]
*  I still don't know what he did. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7559.58s)]
*  I know everybody's like he's an FBI agent. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7561.58s)]
*  Everybody got a side job. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7563.58s)]
*  But it seems like then he wasn't even informed. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7565.58s)]
*  He went to the FBI because he felt like they should know that. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7568.58s)]
*  Which is like, Jesus, you're opening up a can of worms. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7572.58s)]
*  The shit that goes on in the world. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7574.58s)]
*  See what I say if there's aliens out there? [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7575.58s)]
*  Hey, if they out there, all I say, when you come to our country, pay your taxes. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7578.58s)]
*  I don't think they're paying shit. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7585.58s)]
*  Well, I mean, I don't want to pay shit. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7587.58s)]
*  If I looked at what I think about aliens, I think they're monitoring us [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7590.58s)]
*  because we're a highly sophisticated society that might blow itself up. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7594.58s)]
*  I don't think that's why they're here. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7598.58s)]
*  Joe, ain't no fucking aliens here. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7600.58s)]
*  You don't think so? [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7603.58s)]
*  Here's a different explanation and bringing the Tupac thing I just brought up. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7604.58s)]
*  Tupac lyrics fueling a conspiracy theory after Fuji's member, Prost, admits he was an FBI informant. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7607.58s)]
*  The hip hop world was shocked when Prost, how do you say his last name? [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7613.58s)]
*  Michele. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7617.58s)]
*  One of the founding members of the legendary group, the Fugees, admitted he was an FBI informant [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7619.58s)]
*  during his federal conspiracy trial in Washington, D.C. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7624.58s)]
*  Prost is accused of conspiring to make illegal campaign contributions using foreign funds [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7627.58s)]
*  from a Malaysian fugitive, Chow Lo, who is also wanted for his role in a massive corruption scandal involving billions of dollars. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7633.58s)]
*  So he got tied up with the wrong people. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7641.58s)]
*  Yeah, and then it says somewhere around here, like a cryptic line from a song in 96 says something about [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7644.58s)]
*  what the Fugees were trying to do to him, speculating that. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7650.58s)]
*  Tupac was aware of Prost's involvement with the FBI and that he was expecting him, exposing him as a snitch. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7654.58s)]
*  It's like the internet runs wild with this story. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7660.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah, so that's like open to interpretation. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7662.58s)]
*  Not a bad side gig if you come with healthcare. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7665.58s)]
*  Side gig working for the FBI? [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7669.58s)]
*  If you come with healthcare. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7672.58s)]
*  They seem to all go to jail anyway. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7674.58s)]

*  The one article, the first one we said said he didn't say he was an informant but everything else is set the opposite. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7820.58s)]
*  Well, informant means he had a conversation with them and he gave them information. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7825.58s)]

*  They thought it would be clean and they were going to donate money to the Democratic Party. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=7858.58s)]

*  Can you go to my Instagram? [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8668.14s)]
*  It's called The Miss Pat Project. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8669.14s)]
*  Nice. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8671.14s)]
*  You can see it. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8672.14s)]
*  And I'm proud because my husband thought I was a fucking fool when I hired an architect. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8673.14s)]
*  He's like, Pat hired a general contractor. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8676.14s)]
*  I said, no. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8677.14s)]
*  I'm going to say, I don't want to get him 20% of my money. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8678.14s)]
*  I hear you. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8681.14s)]
*  You can do it. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8682.14s)]
*  If you can do it, then you did it. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8683.14s)]
*  It was hard because I had no idea what the fucking elevation certificate was. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8684.14s)]
*  I had no idea you had to get dirt samples before you can build on land. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8689.14s)]
*  And I was like, what are you testing for? [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8694.14s)]
*  So the guy come over and stick this thing down in the ground, pull out dirt. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8696.14s)]
*  You good. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8699.14s)]

*  That's the house. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8703.14s)]
*  Finally finished the dog house. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8705.14s)]
*  That's the dog house. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8707.14s)]
*  That's the dog house? [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8708.14s)]
*  That's insane. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8709.14s)]
*  Those dogs are living large. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8710.14s)]
*  Look at that dog house. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8712.14s)]
*  That's the best dog house I've ever seen. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8714.14s)]
*  That's incredible. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8716.14s)]
*  But I'm enjoying myself. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8718.14s)]
*  Look how peaceful your yard looks. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8720.14s)]
*  That's the dog house. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8723.14s)]
*  That dog house is fucking radical. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8725.14s)]
*  That's some shit. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8727.14s)]
*  It's got four kennels. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8730.14s)]
*  It has a washing machine. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8732.14s)]
*  It has two doors, a front and a back door. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8734.14s)]
*  I can't wait to show you what we did on the inside. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8736.14s)]
*  We're going to talk when those dogs get big. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8741.14s)]
*  And you're going to be like, Joe Rogan, you warned me. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8744.14s)]
*  I'm getting them trained in there. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8747.14s)]
*  It's so fucking expensive. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8749.14s)]
*  Somebody has to be on them all the time. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8750.14s)]
*  It's like you got three alphas living with you. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8752.14s)]
*  They want to run shit. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8754.14s)]
*  And that's what they're teaching us. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8756.14s)]
*  That's what they're teaching us. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8758.14s)]
*  They want to run shit. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8759.14s)]
*  You got to impose discipline on them. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8760.14s)]
*  I have a golden retriever. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8762.14s)]
*  You don't have to do nothing to that dog. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8764.14s)]
*  That dog just wants to be your friend. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8766.14s)]
*  You don't have to ever worry about him being aggressive. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8768.14s)]
*  He's just a sweetheart to everybody. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8770.14s)]
*  Anyone that comes over the house, if you came over the house, [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8772.14s)]
*  he was like he's known you his whole life and he hasn't seen you in a year. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8774.14s)]
*  He'd be like, whoo, whoo, whoo. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8777.14s)]
*  He starts wagging his tail and circling you. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8779.14s)]
*  He's so happy. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8782.14s)]
*  I don't have to worry about him. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8783.14s)]
*  I love this dog. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8784.14s)]
*  But that's what I love about him. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8785.14s)]
*  Because I've had dogs in the past. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8787.14s)]
*  I had a bunch of pit bulls. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8789.14s)]
*  I had a Mastiff. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8791.14s)]
*  I've had some. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8792.14s)]
*  The pit bulls were the most sketchy. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8793.14s)]
*  Because there was certain things like you couldn't fuck with them. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8795.14s)]
*  You couldn't in any way test them. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8800.14s)]
*  Or if someone came over the house, they had to walk up to that person, [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8803.14s)]
*  make sure they're cool. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8807.14s)]
*  They had to check you out, sniff you. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8808.14s)]
*  Like, OK, you're cool. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8810.14s)]
*  But they're not just instantly accepting you. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8811.14s)]
*  Whereas my dog just accepts everybody. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8815.14s)]
*  He's not a guard dog at all. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8817.14s)]
*  But those carne corso's, they're going to test people. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8819.14s)]
*  Especially if they don't get exercise. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8822.14s)]
*  Well, we do. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8824.14s)]
*  They're in training now. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8826.14s)]
*  That's why I built the dog house. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8828.14s)]
*  So they don't need my fucking house. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8829.14s)]
*  Each kiln is divided. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8830.14s)]
*  And then they'll be able to run in the yard. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8832.14s)]
*  So I have somebody to come over and give them a bath and stuff like that. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8834.14s)]
*  You know, you could set up for them. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8837.14s)]
*  Set up like an obstacle course for them. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8838.14s)]
*  Dogs love shit like that. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8840.14s)]
*  Things that they can climb on and do things to. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8842.14s)]
*  Those are like thinking, working dogs. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8844.14s)]
*  Like, they need activities. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8846.14s)]
*  I was thinking about putting them on a little playground back there. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8848.14s)]
*  The dog house you just saw, that's going to be gated in too. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8850.14s)]
*  And so is the kennel. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8854.14s)]
*  So they're not just going to be able to run free. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8856.14s)]
*  Yeah. Well, let them run free sometimes. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8858.14s)]
*  I mean, they got all the yard there. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8860.14s)]
*  They're not going to come in my fucking house. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8862.14s)]
*  Do you have anything out there like wild pigs or anything in that area? [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8864.14s)]
*  No, but we got a lot of shit back there by the lakes. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8866.14s)]
*  Snakes and wild coyotes and wild turkeys. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8869.14s)]
*  Guarantee they're going to start killing shit. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8874.14s)]
*  As soon as they can get bigger. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8876.14s)]
*  How many acres do you have? [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8878.14s)]
*  Seven. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8880.14s)]
*  That's a lot of room to kill things. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8881.14s)]
*  Well, as long as they don't bring that shit back to the house. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8883.14s)]
*  My dog just killed a turtle. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8885.14s)]
*  Really? [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8887.14s)]
*  He came in the house with blood all over his face. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8888.14s)]
*  We thought something happened to him. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8890.14s)]
*  We went outside and he had taken a turtle apart. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8892.14s)]
*  He's a fucking golden retriever. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8895.14s)]
*  Sweetest dog in the world. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8898.14s)]
*  Tore a turtle apart. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8900.14s)]
*  Opened it up. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8901.14s)]
*  Got in it. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8902.14s)]
*  Just fucking got cuts all over his face. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8903.14s)]
*  He's clawing at the turtles trying to fight for its life. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8905.14s)]
*  Well, hopefully the trainer we hired is going to help us keep them in control. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8908.14s)]
*  I don't fuck with them because one of them is crazy. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8913.14s)]
*  Zeus is crazy. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8915.14s)]
*  They like to jump up on you. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8916.14s)]
*  They like to play with you, but they're so fucking heavy. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8918.14s)]

*  It's almost a little over a year. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8976.14s)]
*  This is the first time you've ever done something like this, right? [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8979.14s)]
*  This big. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8981.14s)]

*  You never built something from the ground up, right? [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8983.14s)]
*  I never tore a house down. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8985.14s)]
*  I didn't know anything about elevation certificate like I told you. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8986.14s)]
*  All the stuff that the county took me through. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8989.14s)]
*  I remember right after the pandemic, I did the first floor and the guy charged me $20,000 more. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8992.14s)]
*  I said, fuck you. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=8998.14s)]

*  I said, I stopped the project. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=9002.14s)]
*  I remember just saying, Lord, I need you to send me somebody who can tell me how to fucking buy this floor because this is not what I budget for. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=9003.14s)]
*  I called a lady by some doors, a little white girl named Ali. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=9011.14s)]
*  I'm talking to this lady, Barnett and Cheevers. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=9015.14s)]
*  It's a Loma Yard where I live at out by Peachtree City. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=9018.14s)]
*  I called this Loma Yard and I'm talking to this lady. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=9023.14s)]

*  I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with her? [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=9032.14s)]
*  My husband said, I think she knows you. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=9034.14s)]
*  I said, I'm too far out for somebody to know who I am. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=9036.14s)]
*  She fucking hurt me, I think, on your podcast. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=9039.14s)]
*  She bought my book and she knew exactly who I was. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=9043.14s)]
*  She jumped right in, Joe, and helped me with my project. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=9047.14s)]

*  She was like, I can get you this floor for way cheaper. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=9063.14s)]
*  She helped me with the Loma. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=9066.14s)]
*  I learned so much from this young girl because her daddy owned a Loma Yard. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=9068.14s)]
*  She protected me because I knew I was getting ripped off from there. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=9072.14s)]
*  I was like, I'm not spending this kind of money for this fucking house. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHj7OipzlI&t=9076.14s)]
