# Joe Rogan Experience #1407 - Michael Malice
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83ysf_GO2aw)
*  And...
*  Booyah!
*  So what were you saying about tarantula hawks?
*  Tarantula hawk wasps.
*  Yeah, they're like...
*  That big fucker that Maynard sent me.
*  So this is one of the...
*  There's a guy who made a scale, right, and he got stung by all the different insects.
*  And this is, I think, five.
*  There's also a five plus.
*  They're very hard to get you to sting them.
*  There's a guy who online goes through and gets them all stung.
*  But the reason they're so dangerous or so venomous, what they do is they sting the tarantula
*  lay their eggs inside the tarantula, and then the tarantula is eaten alive by the offspring
*  for weeks.
*  And then when this was discovered, this kind of stuff in the Middle Ages, they were like,
*  this is a big theological dilemma, because why would God make this happen?
*  Yeah, why would God do that?
*  Nature is...
*  I mean, I could go down this rabbit hole for hours.
*  Please do.
*  Yeah, I mean...
*  Have you seen that gigantic flower that they found that smells like shit?
*  So one of the cousins to that flower is called something Infantacida.
*  So the insane thing about that flower, Rafflesia, it's the largest flower in the world, it only
*  lasts two weeks.
*  Yeah.
*  But the plant...
*  It's a parasite.
*  Right.
*  So the plant that it comes from has no stems, roots, or leaves.
*  So you can't keep it on display because it is entirely inside another species of vine.
*  Yeah, it's completely parasitic, right?
*  Yeah.
*  It just sits there and it's fucking huge.
*  Look at that thing.
*  Yeah, and they smell.
*  They're called corpse flowers because they smell like rotting flesh too.
*  How weird.
*  And they don't know why it's so big.
*  Just to trap rats, that's all I can imagine.
*  No, it's not carnivorous, it's the flower.
*  It gets sneaky.
*  Yeah.
*  They're adapting, bro.
*  That's what it is.
*  They get ready to eat people.
*  Look how big they are.
*  They're gorgeous.
*  They are beautiful.
*  Oh, wow, look at that one where the guy's got his hand on it before it blooms.
*  So that's what it looks like sitting on the ground, and then it pops open.
*  That's some fucking avatar shit right there.
*  So I have something from the island of Socotra, which is an archipelago near the coast of
*  Yemen called Duval Yandre, D-U-V-A-L-I-N-D-R-A, and their flowers look and smell like meat.
*  Whoa.
*  Because you want to attract flies.
*  And the hotter it gets in the house, the more the flower smells.
*  It's really cool when you get it to bloom.
*  So it's actually heat activated just like rotten food would be.
*  Yeah.
*  Whoa.
*  To trick the flies because flies are going to be attracted.
*  There it is.
*  That is bananas.
*  There are number seven.
*  Wow, it's so beautiful.
*  That one's just right there, Jamie.
*  You see that in the second, the third one on the left.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  You can look at the texture.
*  Wow.
*  And it even has hairs to replicate a wound.
*  It looks like a blown out butthole.
*  Yeah.
*  But from an alien.
*  Oh, there is a butthole.
*  Look at the little dot in there.
*  Oh, there is a butthole that smells like shit.
*  If you look up white slonia, white S-L-O-A-N-E-A, it smells like an asshole and has hairs that
*  wriggle in the wind.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  And it's to replicate an asshole.
*  Oh, sorry.
*  What was that again?
*  W-H-I-T-E-S-L-O-A-N-E-A.
*  White slonia, named after white and Sloan.
*  It's from Somalia.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah, look at those flowers.
*  Oh, God.
*  How weird.
*  Just the sheer variety and that smells like a butthole and has hair on it.
*  Yeah, and the hair moves.
*  My friend calls it God's mistakes.
*  The sheer variety of nature is so weird.
*  Isn't it great?
*  I mean, that's not unusual.
*  If an asshole is not unusual and every animal has an asshole, why is it unusual to have
*  a plant that looks like an asshole?
*  And we have the expression, you attract more flies with honey than vigor.
*  But it's also like a pig to shit, a fly to shit.
*  You're going to have flowers that smell like shit.
*  And there's a lot of them.
*  There's a whole family of them.
*  And they're gorgeous.
*  They smell.
*  And when they pop open, they fart.
*  It's like a fart because it's contained and then it pops open.
*  Oh, so like the gases come out of it when it pops open.
*  Yeah, it releases a dose.
*  Yeah, look up the biggest one, Stapilea.
*  S-T-A-P-E-L-I-A.
*  Are there any plants that have the same effect on people that like, you know that one, well,
*  not it's not even a plant actually, it's a fungus.
*  There's one branch of the cordyceps mushroom that infects ants and gets them to explode.
*  So that they spray the spores everywhere.
*  And then when they die, it grows inside of them and then literally explodes out into
*  the air so the spores will infect other ants.
*  So when ants find out that one of their members has been infected, they'll take that ant way
*  out of the community.
*  Like, they'll take them on a walk.
*  Yeah.
*  Because they know somehow or another that this thing's going to blow up on all their
*  family.
*  They took, they had found footage of this and literally like the mushroom grows out
*  of the ant's head and then it pops out.
*  There's a lot of things that they're learning now about nature controlling the minds of
*  other beings, which is really a recent kind of discovery and really-
*  Like Fox News.
*  Right?
*  Fox News, am I right?
*  That's more like faux news.
*  Am I right?
*  Yeah, that sort of parasitic relationship.
*  One of my favorite ones ever was the grasshopper that gets infected by this aquatic worm.
*  The aquatic worm gets it to commit suicide so that it can give birth to this worm.
*  It literally gets into the wiring of the grasshopper's brain and convinces it to jump into a puddle.
*  What about the louse that eats fish's tongues and then becomes a functional tongue?
*  And becomes the tongue.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck.
*  So there's a lot of this kind of crazy stuff.
*  My understanding is the majority of species are actually parasitic.
*  Really?
*  Because it's so much easier to be a parasite.
*  You latch on, you're getting nutrition, you don't got to do anything, you don't have to
*  hunt, you don't have to graze, and you're just set.
*  Well that's also just obviously parasitic.
*  If you want to think about it, most organisms are semi-parasitic in that we need other organisms
*  in order to survive.
*  You know, like if you're a farmer, I don't want to say you're a parasite, if you're a
*  beef farmer.
*  There's a headline, beef farmers are parasites, says Joe Rogan.
*  2020 is going to be a tough year for you.
*  You're kind of living off that organism.
*  Yeah.
*  And the other thing is if every species has several parasites, think how many we have
*  lice and mites, it makes sense that the majority are going to be parasitical.
*  Even at the micro level, you get down to our gut.
*  All the different bacteria that's on your skin, we're filled with stuff.
*  It's really fascinating how clever many of these organisms are.
*  It's a trip.
*  It's a weird thing to be a person, my friend.
*  I wouldn't know.
*  No, I'm kidding.
*  I agree.
*  But it's just also weird how we're finding out things that are even crazier and crazier.
*  Right now they're doing a lot of deep sea exploration and the things at the bottom of
*  the ocean are just like, what is this?
*  You saw that deep staria thing, the jellyfish that looks like a lava lamp.
*  Yes.
*  So it's just like, what is this?
*  Yeah, pull up that fucking thing.
*  Yeah, deep staria.
*  Yeah, that's one of the more amazing things about the bottom of the ocean, right, is the
*  bioluminescence.
*  Oh yeah.
*  So it's like the creatures that have a light source, they give off light.
*  Well, there's also dragonfish use a red light source because red doesn't show up for others
*  so they can see with it but no one else can.
*  It's like night vision.
*  Oh yeah, this is the one.
*  Oh, it's so crazy.
*  You saw this?
*  Yeah.
*  This is just amazing.
*  Oh, it's so cool.
*  That's pretty.
*  And what's amazing is how they're freaking out.
*  The scientists are watching it.
*  They're like, what is going on?
*  Oh, I love this thing.
*  Look at that thing.
*  And it also has a parasite on it or symbiotic relationship.
*  There's a copepod living inside.
*  Resident isopod?
*  Is that what that is?
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck, look how pretty that is.
*  Now, this thing has never seen light for millions of years.
*  It's the bottom of the sea.
*  So the fact that it knows how to react or is having a reaction is pretty cool.
*  Just the fact that that's a real thing that exists.
*  If we found that on a planet somewhere, we would freak out.
*  This is the overlord.
*  This is the overmind of the planet and it's in a gelatinous form and it communicates to
*  you with vibrations.
*  This is why my autism wouldn't let me watch Star Trek as a kid because I knew about all
*  this stuff and then I'm watching Star Trek and they're going to another planet.
*  It's like a guy with a blue face and I'm just like this mixed.
*  This is stupid.
*  It's just a guy.
*  It's just a guy.
*  Whereas look at Earth.
*  Look at this.
*  Right.
*  Look at an octopus.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at that.
*  You've seen the video of the octopus taking out the seagull?
*  Oh yeah.
*  What about the blanket octopus?
*  You know what those?
*  What's interesting though is they saved an eagle.
*  An octopus took out an eagle in Vancouver Island.
*  An eagle?
*  Yes, an eagle.
*  The fishermen pulled to the shore and removed the octopus from the noble eagle.
*  But a seagull?
*  They were like, sorry bitch.
*  That's a wrap.
*  Well they're nasty.
*  They're thieves.
*  Well they are thieves.
*  And they smell.
*  Eagles are thieves too.
*  That's true.
*  We're talking about a company that has raised organic chickens that lost $2.2 million in
*  chickens to eagles.
*  They killed 160,000 eagles.
*  Or excuse me.
*  The eagles killed 160,000 chickens.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So here it is.
*  Why does that octopus hate America?
*  Well he doesn't.
*  He's in Canada.
*  Huh.
*  Bald eagles live in Canada too.
*  They're expats.
*  They go over there to party and to have sex with underage eagles.
*  They were draft dachshunds.
*  Yeah.
*  For sure.
*  There's no rules up there in that wild land to the north.
*  But look at that.
*  They decided to save the fucking thing.
*  Isn't that weird?
*  Oh my God.
*  Wow.
*  If you're going to save it, I think you should eat the octopus too because you win.
*  Yeah.
*  The crew estimated the octopus could have been as large as 4.5 feet.
*  Good.
*  Don't let it go.
*  Don't let it go.
*  There's plenty of them things.
*  Jack that fucker.
*  Get lunch.
*  It's only got a year long lifespan anyway.
*  Does it?
*  Oh yeah.
*  You know the octopus life cycle?
*  That big?
*  It only lives a year?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh I definitely would have eaten it then.
*  Zero remorse.
*  Zero fucks.
*  I would have been zero remorseful if I found out it only lived a year.
*  And they're like look at him.
*  He's got to be 11 and a half months.
*  And they don't really feel pain.
*  They can cannibalize themselves.
*  Well they let their arms go when the female octopus tries to eat them.
*  Male octopuses, this is one of my favorite parts about the animal kingdom.
*  They pretend sometimes that they want to have sex with a male octopus then they just jack
*  them and eat them.
*  What about the cuttlefish where they pretend to be female so they can get laid?
*  Yeah they're like beta males that are male feminists.
*  They pretend to be something unnatural.
*  They pretend they're female.
*  They pretend to be female.
*  And then they fuck the females when the male's not looking.
*  They have female mannerisms and characteristics just like these beta males.
*  And they sneak up next to them as an ally and get their rocks off.
*  It's like every Washington Post reporter in molest form.
*  You said that, not me.
*  Well you're the one who said that farmers are parasites.
*  But you do have an excuse because you claimed autism, which is a good move.
*  That's why you should listen to me about climate change also.
*  Yeah you're already fine.
*  Right.
*  I was saying that earlier.
*  First podcast that a friend of mine who actually used to work with autistic kids thinks that
*  girl is autistic.
*  She is autistic.
*  She says it.
*  It's on her Twitter bio.
*  Oh well there you go.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm paying attention to the news these days.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm so happy.
*  So we should definitely listen to the 16 year old college high school dropout about science.
*  So she is autistic.
*  It says that on her.
*  It says I am autistic.
*  Yeah Asperger's, which is not a diagnosis anymore.
*  I am autistic plus how dare you.
*  Yeah.
*  17 year old climate change environmental activist with Asperger's.
*  Oh.
*  Was that always there with Asperger's?
*  Yes.
*  Really?
*  So my most successful tweet ever was I said there's...
*  How many tweets, excuse me, how many followers are you off, Jamie?
*  4 million almost.
*  3.91 million.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Those are rookie numbers.
*  You got to bump that up.
*  My biggest ever tweet I said there's no one more privileged than the girl who refuses to
*  go to school until everyone on earth changes the weather for her.
*  And then people are like blah blah blah.
*  And I'm like, okay, here's the rule.
*  Weather is when it contradicts your bullshit.
*  Climate is when it supports your bullshit.
*  Because it's our weather, it's climate.
*  Okay.
*  Right, right.
*  Gotcha.
*  Go back to that first video that's on her page, the pinned video.
*  See it there?
*  Can you play that?
*  I want to hear what she has to say.
*  Oh, God.
*  Super important.
*  Fridays for future.
*  The school strike continues.
*  This was in September.
*  She was striking for school.
*  School strike for the climate.
*  She's on school strike for the climate.
*  Every Friday we will sit outside the Swedish parliament until Sweden is in line with the
*  Paris Agreement.
*  We urge everyone to do the same wherever you are.
*  Sit outside your parliament or local government building until your nation is on a safe pathway
*  to a...
*  She's got a beautiful voice.
*  Does she?
*  I like it.
*  Nice music behind it too.
*  I do.
*  It's soothing.
*  I feel like we're all going to work together and stop this thing, Michael.
*  It's a very brave new world.
*  Well, we better stop this thing.
*  No, not her.
*  Oh, okay.
*  No, the climate.
*  The climate's bad.
*  Let's stop the climate.
*  First of all, the Nazis are lighting the rainforest on fire so they can make more cows so you
*  need to go vegan.
*  And also Australia.
*  Yes.
*  Australia, do you know Tim Poole tweeted a statistic about the Australia fires?
*  See if you can find it.
*  It was 500 million animals.
*  Yeah, that's one horrific statistic.
*  But his statistic was, I believe on the number of people...
*  I'm pretty sure it was Tim Poole.
*  I might be wrong.
*  I'm second guessing myself.
*  The number of people that actually intentionally set those fires.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  There's not just one fire.
*  There's many, many, many, many fires.
*  And there's not just accidental fires.
*  There are fires that were set on purpose and not a small amount of them.
*  Like a significant percentage of these fires were set intentionally.
*  Why? To just clear ground?
*  Assholes.
*  Oh, okay.
*  That's despicable.
*  Yeah.
*  Literally, assholes that probably never knew that it could get this crazy.
*  A big problem with that is Australia, there's many species that only live there.
*  They're endemic there.
*  And Australia won't let them be exported.
*  So you don't have breeding colonies of platypus or echidna everywhere else.
*  So when something like this happens, it's really disproportionately bad.
*  Yeah.
*  They were saying that koala bears are functionally extinct.
*  But then we Googled that and they were refuting that, right?
*  Well, they're having this cancer which is contagious and they're pissing themselves
*  to the bone.
*  Like, it's really, really bad what's happening to them.
*  Yeah.
*  And I don't understand how cancer could be contagious, but it's spreading venerally.
*  I read about that on, or I listened to that rather on a radio lab podcast.
*  It was the only form of cancer that they had ever recorded that was contagious.
*  It makes no sense.
*  So crazy.
*  And all they eat is eucalyptus trees, right?
*  All they eat is one kind of leaf.
*  And they also have the smallest brain to body proportion of any animal.
*  They don't know why.
*  They're violent when you fuck them.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Violent.
*  You try to fuck them?
*  I've never tried to fuck a koala.
*  I don't know why I said that.
*  But no, are they nasty?
*  No.
*  They're wild animals and they're brutal during the mating process.
*  Like a lot of kids have been severely traumatized watching koala bears rape other koala bears.
*  You're like, oh no.
*  Pandas apparently too.
*  Well, also cats.
*  Oh yeah.
*  It's always rape.
*  But he slices her up with the barbs on his tail.
*  Wow.
*  They make noises that you're like, what in the fuck is happening outside my bedroom door?
*  She's being raped with a knife.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Cuts her up inside, right?
*  Yes.
*  And seams her up.
*  And he's also biting her neck.
*  Yeah.
*  Like sharks.
*  And they go to war sometimes too.
*  They fucking fight and claw each other and shit.
*  Well then they also kill the kids so that she'd get her period again.
*  Cats do that too?
*  Yeah.
*  Lions, all felines.
*  No kitty cats do that.
*  They have that gland on the roof of the mouth, the male.
*  So they'll make that face and then they're smelling if it's their kids.
*  Oh, they're doing that with their mouth?
*  Yes.
*  Whoa.
*  They can smell if it's their own kids?
*  Yes.
*  That is fucking bonkers.
*  But that's just amazing that like, okay, do I have to kill these children so I can rape
*  their mom?
*  You know who else does that?
*  Who?
*  Dolphins.
*  Dolphins?
*  Dolphins.
*  Do what?
*  They kill the kids?
*  Infantricide.
*  Yeah.
*  Because the kids are always getting killed.
*  Because they fuck everybody, then you're not going to kill her kids because you don't know
*  whose kids they are.
*  Right.
*  You don't have Maury Povich in the ocean.
*  It's just all guesswork with dolphins.
*  She's like, damn, I have been fucking her a lot.
*  I was a cute kid.
*  Well, just leave that kid alone.
*  Because when a female dolphin has birth, apparently she's not willing to mate until her baby is
*  viable or until it's independent.
*  And I think that takes like six years.
*  So they don't fuck for six years.
*  And the male dolphin's like, fuck that, you don't.
*  And they kill the baby.
*  Aren't they the only other group that mates for pleasure or has sex for pleasure?
*  No, for short chimps.
*  Oh yeah, bonobos.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know what other animals do it.
*  How many?
*  I would want you to Google that.
*  How many different animals mate for pleasure?
*  I think it's bonobos and maybe dolphins.
*  Dolphins definitely seem to do it.
*  Humans, I hear do it.
*  I don't understand why they wouldn't want to mate for pleasure because then you're getting
*  laid more.
*  I guess you don't want to get laid too much and then you can't care the kids.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  And then there's not enough resources.
*  I mean, I think that when you think about things like deer, I mean, there's a reason
*  why they only fuck once a year.
*  And there's so goddamn many of them.
*  Imagine if deer fucked every day.
*  Be a plague.
*  Pleasure.
*  Pigs.
*  Okay.
*  Look at those chimps fucking.
*  That's crazy.
*  They're doing it missionary style.
*  And they're looking at each other in the eye.
*  He's like, I'm going to give you this good dick.
*  That could be rape.
*  I think that's the guy on the bottom if I'm not mistaken.
*  Is that right?
*  Yeah.
*  I look at the guy on the bottom.
*  That's a bitch.
*  I think it's a guy.
*  Yes.
*  Other animals have.
*  No.
*  It's a guy on top.
*  So how many animals does it say?
*  Humans, pigs.
*  We guessed them all.
*  Bonobos, dolphins and one or two species of primates.
*  Oh, so it's only primates.
*  Yeah, we guessed them.
*  So it's only animal.
*  But pigs.
*  Interesting.
*  Pigs.
*  Yeah.
*  Pigs are smart as fuck, man.
*  That's true.
*  Pigs are responsible for the most farm deaths.
*  Is that true?
*  Yep.
*  How so?
*  Like, charging people?
*  No, they eat people.
*  People fall in.
*  No.
*  Pigs eat them.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Didn't you ever see Snatched?
*  What's that?
*  I don't even know what that is.
*  Brad Pitt, you piece of shit.
*  What the fuck, man?
*  Well, this started off.
*  Guy Ritchie movie, Snatched.
*  You don't know Snatched?
*  I have a piece of shit, but I know it's Snatched.
*  Is this Snatched?
*  Yeah, it's not Snatched.
*  Oh, you don't know it's Snatched.
*  Snatched is the porn.
*  Who's the piece of shit now?
*  Who's the physician now?
*  My apologies.
*  That's a porn parody, Snatched.
*  It's based on the same storyline.
*  Will I be able to follow it if I haven't watched Snatched?
*  But there's a gangster, a really great character in the movie Snatched.
*  There's this British guy with these giant coke bottle glasses who's a fucking murderer.
*  And he talks about pigs, about how you could get rid of bodies with pigs.
*  Oh, they did that in the Hannibal movie?
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Apparently, it's all because of, well, there's a reality to it, but also because there was
*  a serial killer that lived in British Columbia.
*  That guy, he's fucking great.
*  Brick Top was his name in the movie.
*  I love his glasses.
*  Oh my God.
*  You never, can we play a segment of that?
*  No, we can't.
*  We'll get pulled.
*  Oh.
*  Too bad.
*  But the guy's fantastic.
*  What is the guy's name, that actor?
*  He's fucking fantastic.
*  He's not an actor.
*  While he's doing it, you're like, that guy's a gangster and he's really killing people.
*  He's really feeding them.
*  What is his name?
*  Alan Ford.
*  That guy is a fucking beast.
*  He's in a lot of things.
*  Dude, he's so good in that movie, though.
*  He's so good as that evil gangster.
*  I mean, you buy it hook, line, and sink.
*  It's a great movie.
*  You never seen that movie?
*  No.
*  Dude, I love Guy Ritchie movies.
*  I love those English gangster movies like Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.
*  Yeah.
*  I love those movies.
*  Got a new one on the way.
*  Did you see it?
*  What?
*  Called The Gentleman with Matthew McConaughey plays like a millionaire weed dealer in London
*  or some shit like that.
*  Yes.
*  Seems like it's just right out of a smash sequel.
*  Yes.
*  Can't wait.
*  I'm excited.
*  I love his movies.
*  Okay.
*  I'm not a big movie guy.
*  What do you do for fun?
*  Count numbers and shit?
*  Count numbers and shit.
*  Okay.
*  We're going to break this down.
*  What does that even mean?
*  Means you're talking about being autistic.
*  They all sit around like number people.
*  Fucking Rain Man and shit, right?
*  He doesn't have to count.
*  Oh, he does.
*  All the time.
*  It's the opposite.
*  He sees the toothpicks and he knows how many there are.
*  You've got to count them to know how many there are.
*  No, that's the point.
*  He gets it instinctively.
*  Not toothpick things.
*  Nonsense.
*  Look, two cans.
*  It's like superhero powers.
*  For bottles.
*  Do you follow superhero movies or TV shows?
*  You seem like you would.
*  No offense.
*  There's a comic book written about me.
*  So I am a comic book.
*  You know this.
*  I did?
*  Harvey P. Carr from American Splendor.
*  He wrote a graphic novel about me.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  We did talk about this.
*  Yeah.
*  I am a comic book character.
*  Do you like other comic books though?
*  Yeah.
*  I was a huge comic fan for a long time.
*  I just went to some cool comic stores here in LA.
*  There's some great ones.
*  That indie stuff, the problem is a lot of it's really pretty, but the writing is crap.
*  And then you read it and you're like, eh, this isn't it.
*  It's hard to get both.
*  It's hard to get both.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, is there comic books, indie comic books, where it's like one guy writes it and draws
*  it?
*  Yeah, that's the point.
*  It's always that case, right?
*  But then you don't want the artist drawing it and then it gets like...
*  Are there anybody who does that well?
*  Where they draw it and write the stories and do it well?
*  Yeah.
*  Adrian Tomane does it better than anyone.
*  Pull up some of his shit.
*  Guy.
*  Dan Klaus.
*  Didn't want to be a piece of shit.
*  That ship has sailed.
*  Yeah.
*  But Adrian is, I mean, I know both sides.
*  I know guys and girls.
*  It's called Optic Nerve.
*  Dan Klaus is amazing.
*  I'm blanking out their names, but there's a lot of real, real talents.
*  It's very hipster.
*  It's good.
*  In the best way.
*  Good writing, good drawing.
*  Yeah, very emo.
*  I don't see any superheroes, bro.
*  What kind of comic is this?
*  Does anybody have magic or is there a dragon involved or at least an alien?
*  This is just emo.
*  Everyone's crying.
*  Get this off the screen.
*  What word does he say to stop crying?
*  What magic word does he change from being a crybaby to a real man?
*  Did you watch The Watchman?
*  No.
*  Did you see The Watchman?
*  Didn't Alan Moore denounce it very vociferously?
*  Why did he do that?
*  I don't know.
*  I watched one quick screen of it and I was like, damn, Dr. Manhattan looks like a normal
*  person.
*  No, he's got to look like a god.
*  Yes.
*  He's got to be jacked.
*  Yeah, there was...
*  Dr. Manhattan is supposed to be fucking jacked.
*  The guy...
*  The rock jacked.
*  Yeah.
*  The guy who played him in the movie got run over and killed at a young age, the fitness
*  actor.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  That guy, he's dead.
*  No.
*  How old was he when he died?
*  30?
*  32?
*  A 15-year-old ran him over?
*  No, like a train or something.
*  Yeah, see that...
*  So he was a fitness guy?
*  Yeah, he was a fitness guy.
*  Greg Plitt, that was his name.
*  Let me see a picture of that again.
*  Let me get my pants off.
*  See, that's what Dr. Manhattan's supposed to look like.
*  He's supposed to look ridiculous, like a super person.
*  Because he's a god.
*  Yes, he's a god.
*  God on earth, yeah.
*  Yeah, and he's glowing and blue.
*  But now go to the new Dr. Manhattan.
*  The new Dr. Manhattan is like, hey, you're just a guy who maybe does CrossFit.
*  Sometimes.
*  Doesn't have the bun and the burger.
*  See, look at his body.
*  I mean, it's okay.
*  He's definitely in good shape.
*  Like if he was playing a boxer, you'd be in it hook, line, and sinker.
*  But as Dr. Manhattan, you're like, hmm...
*  No, not quite.
*  He doesn't look inhuman.
*  My friend was like, yeah, and they also made him a black guy.
*  I go, dude, he's blue.
*  So I don't know what the fuck's wrong with you.
*  Weren't they complaining about Will Smith being the genie for some reason?
*  Yes.
*  People complain about everything.
*  Although I do have to tell you, I went to see Frozen, the musical, because I have daughters.
*  So I went to see Frozen.
*  First of all, it was at the Pantages.
*  It's a wonderful production.
*  It's excellent.
*  It's really good.
*  I mean, I actually enjoyed the musical.
*  It's very good.
*  However, it's about people that live in the Arctic, or they live in the Nordic country,
*  right?
*  That's what it's supposed to be about.
*  They're all these blonde people, white people.
*  Well, the dad's black in the musical, and the mom's Chinese.
*  And then the dad's black and the mom's Chinese, which is great.
*  They're great actors.
*  Then they have kids.
*  And the kid, one of the kids is Chinese, and one of the kids is white.
*  And then the kids grow up, and they're both white.
*  Wait, the Chinese girl becomes white?
*  The Chinese girl becomes white, and there's no explanation given at all.
*  The Chinese girl's little.
*  She's Chinese.
*  I should say Chinese.
*  I'm a piece of shit, and there's a terrible thing to say.
*  I meant to say Asian.
*  You meant Chinaman.
*  No, I didn't.
*  She's a little Chinaman.
*  She's a girl.
*  A Chinaman girl.
*  I don't know if she's Chinese.
*  She was a young Asian girl, and she became a white girl.
*  Did she make peepee in your coke?
*  That's how you know.
*  She was great at her job.
*  She had perfect singing, and everything was beautiful.
*  They were very talented.
*  But they're requiring you to make this leap.
*  Now you have to know that this is now a different ethnicity.
*  This is a different person.
*  Not just a different person, but you can't even pretend that it's the same person.
*  In most movies where you have someone play a young version of the guy, it looks like
*  the guy.
*  It's not like you have a young Chinese guy who becomes Clint Eastwood.
*  You're like, hey, what are we doing here?
*  If you have a young Clint Eastwood, he's supposed to look like who could be a young Clint Eastwood.
*  I talked about this in my last book, and you're right.
*  They were even complaining there was a video game that takes place in the Middle Ages,
*  very popular.
*  Maybe you guys know the name, and I'm blanking on it.
*  They were complaining that there weren't enough black people there.
*  Because everyone on Twitter and Facebook still thinks they're in the 60s, and this is their
*  personal march on Selma, and they're fighting against segregation.
*  This isn't segregation.
*  This is history.
*  Yeah, you can't.
*  If you want to make a movie about Egypt, you should use people that look like they're Egyptians.
*  If you just decide you're going to just have only white people from Norway play Egyptians,
*  people are going to want to kick your ass.
*  That's kind of the same thing.
*  You're fucking with reality.
*  I'm not saying with Frozen, but with a movie or any historical depiction, anything where
*  you're depicting an actual time.
*  If you want to have The Wild West, you want to do a movie about The Wild West, you have
*  to have European settlers, you have to have some African slaves, and you have to have
*  a lot of Native Americans.
*  You can't just decide, we're going to do a film about The Wild West, but everyone's black.
*  Indians are black, cowboys are black, all black crew, all black writers, black power.
*  We're going to make it happen.
*  But you can't, if you did that movie, people are like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
*  Are there slaves?
*  Yes.
*  Okay, so the black people have slaves?
*  Yes.
*  My favorite comic book series of all time was Legion of Superheroes, right?
*  And it takes place in the 30th century.
*  And I was just-
*  30th century.
*  30th century, a thousand years from now.
*  I was just in the comic book store, and they just keep rebooting it.
*  Number two just came out, and I was looking at the cover.
*  You have Chameleon Boy, who's orange with antennae, Brainiac Five, who's green and a
*  living computer.
*  Shadow Last is blue, but they had to make Lightning Lad black for some reason now.
*  It's just like these are 40 diverse aliens.
*  Some of them don't even have a body, but they have to change the race just to- it's just
*  really kind of a, I guess the thing you do.
*  And stay woke.
*  But in retrospect, it's going to be embarrassing.
*  Because you not know about staying woke?
*  I'm very familiar.
*  Do you stay woke at all?
*  I never sleep.
*  Do you ever think about like trying to be like a little more woke and people like you
*  better?
*  Ever think of that?
*  I think they might.
*  If you might maybe give in a little bit.
*  How can you like me better?
*  We're already at 11.
*  I'm the pride of America.
*  This style's not going up.
*  It's such a strange time, man.
*  But it's always a strange time.
*  I think now what makes it good is that this can be called out and discussed and be like,
*  look, this isn't about race or racism.
*  Why is it important to you that this Chinese girl in Frozen grows up to become white?
*  Just explain this to me.
*  I should say they did a great job.
*  Everybody was awesome.
*  And does not in any way, I enjoyed it.
*  It didn't take away from my enjoyment.
*  It was a very good musical.
*  It did take away because you're just like, what's your problem?
*  No, no, no.
*  I enjoy it more.
*  I enjoy it more because I saw the wokeness.
*  Stop provoking.
*  I saw they did some woke shit.
*  I was like, I see what you're doing.
*  Not to say that the Asian lady wasn't fantastic as the mom.
*  She was.
*  The black guy as the dad, he was amazing.
*  But you want me to believe that a black guy made it with an Asian lady.
*  They made two blonde kids and one of them started out Asian and then became European
*  later.
*  We don't know that he was their dad.
*  Yes, we do.
*  It's part of the script.
*  They describe their parents.
*  They have children.
*  The children grow up.
*  You don't know she's hoeing around.
*  No, she's not hoeing around because if she is, she's hoeing around with a goddamn chameleon
*  because the child morphs as it gets older, becomes a different race.
*  They changed races of the same person, the same character.
*  But the point is, it's still not going to happen that a black guy and a Chinese person
*  are going to have a white kid.
*  So maybe the Chinese lady had sex with the white guy.
*  Could be.
*  He's a cuck.
*  Yeah, it could be frozen refers to the sperm that was unfrozen.
*  Good point.
*  It's just amazing that Disney is, people think corporate America is very conservative, but
*  they're the first ones to be pushing this stuff.
*  I remember I was in Times Square in New York Pride Month.
*  Rainbow flags everywhere.
*  And I said, only corporate America can make sodomy and perversion look boring.
*  You son of a bitch.
*  Am I wrong though?
*  You son of a bitch.
*  Yeah, in a way.
*  Yeah.
*  How am I wrong?
*  No, I'm saying no.
*  Am I wrong?
*  I'm like, no.
*  I'm definitely wrong.
*  No, it's, yeah, it's look, do you remember when they had that 11 year old drag queen?
*  Oh, the Desmond is amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And they were making this big deal about it.
*  And he's going to drag clubs and dancing around.
*  They put it in the news.
*  Like it was some, this, what a great thing.
*  What a great thing.
*  We live in his truth.
*  He's so brave.
*  Imagine if there was a 12 year old that was just sworn to be a hoe.
*  Like I am a hoe.
*  I'm just going to wear fishnets and high heels and I'm going to stick my ass out and I'm
*  going to dance and pout around with a lot of makeup on.
*  How different is that?
*  Well, he's also on the spectrum, I think.
*  I'm 99% sure.
*  So the, and this photos him with naked drag queens, Violet Chachki.
*  And it's just like, look, this is something for, what if there was like a little boy who's
*  being at Chippendales?
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's like, how is this appropriate for kids?
*  And it's on Good Morning America.
*  It's different.
*  Is there a bunch of ladies screaming and trying to get that dick?
*  Well, I mean, that would be the equivalent, right?
*  Because he's performing at gay clubs and they're cheering him on.
*  That's the place where guys go to hook up with guys.
*  Well, here's the question too.
*  Do you think guys have hooked up with him?
*  No.
*  Oh, I hope not.
*  Oh, let's talk.
*  You want to talk about this?
*  Because this is a rabbit hole that I've been on recently.
*  Oh boy.
*  You've been on the kids getting fucked rabbit hole?
*  Yeah.
*  I had a friend in October who sat me down and he's like, look, I was raped as a kid
*  for a long time.
*  And he only realized because of this show, because he was watching when Jake the Snake
*  was on this show.
*  Oh my God.
*  My friend Matt and everything Jake was saying, he's like, holy shit, this is me.
*  And this really fucked him up for a while and he's talking to me and he goes, I can't
*  even be mad because it was another older kid and I know he was getting it worse than me.
*  And the thing that's really fucked up is he didn't know how he was going to react.
*  So it used to be mommy's sleepy.
*  No, mommy was a drunk.
*  And until Betty Ford, the first lady came out as an alcoholic, now people like if someone
*  says, oh, my mom's an alcoholic, you're like, oh, that sucks.
*  But you don't think anything of them.
*  If daddy had a temper, no, daddy was abusive.
*  But we know what to do with that information.
*  And when I started talking about this on Twitter and elsewhere, that this is really common
*  and because all of us do not think of kids in this way, we don't want to think about
*  it, it's so sick.
*  They're the ones who have to deal with this nightmare.
*  And it's really, really, everyone I've talked to knows someone.
*  And I just told another friend when he's like, oh, yeah, my sister, I just found out was
*  being molested by her, her grandfather, her whole life.
*  And then it's like, she's the one who's acting out and we're yelling at her for acting out.
*  So Joe, I mean, one of the things I wanted to talk about is this is something that has
*  to change.
*  These people can't be the ones who have to worry that if they tell me or your friend
*  that we're going to look at them like, oh, you're a freak, I don't know what to do with
*  this.
*  Because they're the ones who are suffering for a very long time.
*  And I think that keeps people from speaking out because that fear of being labeled, like
*  they'd almost rather keep it to themselves and not have other people know that they've
*  been molested.
*  They don't want for you to be uncomfortable around them.
*  And there was a girl in my high school, she told another girl that her brother had been
*  raping her for years.
*  And she went to mom, and mom says, you know, you're talking about that can't happen.
*  But this happens all the time.
*  And we don't have the space to discuss it.
*  So I've just been kind of talking about this a lot more and encouraging people to talk
*  about this a lot more.
*  Because it's they're really, really a lot of people are suffering because of this.
*  And what do you do?
*  Here's the big question, something like that.
*  What do you do to help the person who's been molested?
*  And what do you do to the person who molests someone?
*  Well, the person who did it, I can't even begin, I don't know.
*  But I think what happens is just like with gay rights, right?
*  The more people who come out and talk about it, the more easy it is for someone to call
*  someone else and be like, this happened to me.
*  You know what I'm going through.
*  Let's have this conversation.
*  Have you seen this very strange trend that's rare, but common enough and actually predicted
*  where people are talking about people that are pedophiles, that it's some sort of a sexual
*  inclination that we should have sympathy for them because it's nothing they asked for.
*  It's no different than being born gay or being, it is just a thing where you're born in a
*  way that is there any science to back that up at all?
*  I am perfectly happy to believe that people can be born with this inclination.
*  I don't care.
*  If I'm born with an inclination that I want to murder people, well, I better figure out
*  how to deal with this.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I think that's a complete, in many ways, red herring.
*  If it's something that they can't change, that makes it worse.
*  That means you have no reason to even...
*  Exist.
*  Too dangerous.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  You're like a cannibal that can only eat meat.
*  Right.
*  Like a vampire living amongst us.
*  Right.
*  Instead of sealing souls, you're stealing someone's future.
*  And the thing about these types is they're very common.
*  Like any predator, you're going to be drawn to where the resources are.
*  So they're going to be disproportionate in those fields where you are interacting with
*  your targets.
*  Right.
*  So that's what makes it so sick.
*  It's not like you have these ideas.
*  Okay, fine.
*  You can have whatever ideas you want.
*  You are laying that groundwork to prey on these kids and you know what you're doing.
*  And again, I don't know what to do with this information, but I do know that this is really,
*  really bad.
*  And people talk about...
*  This is the truest form of being a victim there is.
*  And the sickest part about it to me is how many of these kids go on to molest other kids.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like a disease.
*  Like they've got a disease.
*  I told Matt that he should...
*  There's two ways, right?
*  They go on.
*  I told Matt, you should consider reaching out to this guy and telling him you forgive
*  him because it's possible that you're like 10 or 11, you're doing this.
*  And you grow up and you realize what you've done and what this means.
*  And I don't know how you could live with yourself.
*  Right.
*  Well, we have to hope and assume that it ended with that, that he didn't continue doing it
*  as he got older and with the same age child.
*  Yeah.
*  And what's even worse, what happens when it's within the family?
*  Right.
*  It happens all the time.
*  This happens...
*  I talked to someone who's a former sheriff when I was in the Midwest and this was his
*  job helping these kids.
*  He goes, it is so much more prevalent than you think.
*  And what happens is families...
*  You know how back in the day you don't want to talk about divorce because it's shameful?
*  I didn't even understand what they were ashamed of, whatever.
*  And now it's like, oh, that's just crazy Uncle Nick keeping away from the kids.
*  It's like, that's not a thing.
*  Crazy Uncle Nick.
*  Yeah, there's too many of us already.
*  The thing is like, even saying that, there's too many of us.
*  We should kill pedophiles.
*  If you put that up in a real intimate situation, you're talking just a bunch of people that
*  really cared about each other and were good friends, like, I think we should kill pedophiles.
*  They'd be like, fuck yeah.
*  Most people would say yes.
*  But in public, in public discourse, saying we should kill pedophiles, like, okay, but
*  here's the problem.
*  Sometimes people get accused of being pedophiles and they're not.
*  Like, you remember that school that there was a daycare school and these kids were actually
*  being coached into saying...
*  Oh yeah, yeah.
*  Little kids.
*  And then eventually the case all fell apart, but not before these people's reputations
*  were ruined.
*  Everything was ruined.
*  Their business was shattered, all because these kids had made stuff up.
*  And then other people had like coached them into making more stuff up.
*  And then everything got crazier and crazier.
*  What was the name of that?
*  It was a very famous case.
*  I mean, they made a documentary about it because it shows almost like there's a mass hysteria
*  that can go on, especially when you're talking about something that's particularly heinous,
*  right?
*  The abduction or the rape of children, rather, because we're all so scared of that being
*  real that we'll pay attention as much as possible.
*  So they have these news stories.
*  They have all these different things that are attached to this.
*  And then people keep probing and they keep asking questions and then it accelerates and
*  grows because it's a focal point of attention.
*  People start lying.
*  But we're also so scared so we don't want to think it could be true.
*  Well, we don't want to think either one could be true.
*  That someone would molest kids or that kids would be coached into lying.
*  Both of them are horrible.
*  I'm much more concerned with people who are dealing with this and how they can get help.
*  Yes, of course.
*  No, of course.
*  But I'm saying that's why you can't kill them.
*  Oh yeah, I'm not advocating killing anybody.
*  I'm just advocating for people.
*  And I'm not a victim of this.
*  I just have a friend.
*  And again, everyone I've talked to knows someone.
*  One degree of separation.
*  And I'm just saying for the people who had gone through this, just like Matt listening
*  to the show, this is what I told him.
*  In my experience, when people come to you in a vulnerable way, don't tell them what
*  you think they want to hear.
*  Be as vulnerable in return.
*  So I said to him, Matt, I don't care.
*  I don't think of you any differently.
*  I don't think you're damaged.
*  I don't think you're a freak.
*  I think it's awful.
*  I can't relate to this at all.
*  I know you're glad I can't relate to this at all.
*  And I think it's great that you want me to kind of talk about this to stop someone from
*  blowing their brains out.
*  This is again, it's again, do you, are you like, it's hard for me and I have a much smaller
*  audience than you to be aware of the reach of the show?
*  Because I'll get letters from people being like, oh, I'm going through chemo and I read
*  your Twitter to make my day.
*  And I'm like, I can't take pride in that because I'm in my underwear being an asshole on Twitter.
*  And that's independent of you kind of, you know, getting your laughs.
*  So thank you, but it doesn't resonate.
*  So for your level, I mean, this kind of saved my buddy's life because of Jake the Snake
*  on this show.
*  That's beautiful.
*  I'm very happy that that happened.
*  And that's a wonderful side effect.
*  But if I thought about that only, it would never be the same thing.
*  The reason why I think the show works is comfort, like a comfort level and talking to people
*  and having fun and enjoying it.
*  And I think the moment you start thinking about your reach and the amount of impact
*  that it has and how many people are actually listening at the same time, you'll start
*  freaking out and you'll never be as comfortable.
*  You won't be comfortable.
*  Like what people like listening to is people that like, like you and I are friends.
*  We've done this a few times.
*  I enjoy your company.
*  Thank you, sir.
*  You know I do.
*  I'm going to be some shit.
*  We're just jokes, pal.
*  They're jokes.
*  But you know that I think you're a very funny and very smart guy and I enjoy your company.
*  So when we're together, I'm like, this is great.
*  I'm going to sit down with Michael.
*  We're going to talk.
*  We're going to have a good time.
*  It's going to be fun.
*  I'm enjoying this.
*  Like that is what one of the things that people like.
*  They like the fact that friends joke around and they're comfortable with each other and
*  we can just change subjects and talk about anything.
*  And I think the moment you read, you almost like have to hypnotize yourself to not look
*  at the big picture.
*  You have to sort of like just stay in the pocket, stay in the pocket.
*  Just be yourself.
*  Just all this craziness around you like, Oh, gotta get away from that.
*  Go over this way.
*  But don't, don't live in it.
*  Every single time I leave this room, I'm like, Oh shit, what did I say?
*  Because you can't be on for this long.
*  I know.
*  I've done thousands of them.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, think about all the stupid shit I've said.
*  There's no way around it.
*  It's no, it's plus plus 70% of the time I'm high.
*  I mean, we got high as fuck the podcast right before this one.
*  So you know, that doesn't, I've said some terrible, stupid things high and not even
*  exactly sure what I'm saying while I'm saying it.
*  I'm like, no, no, that's not what I meant.
*  Fuck.
*  It's a fun way to do it though.
*  It's like, you know, it's like skiing downhill and you're not sure if you could stop.
*  Have you tried the new ones like Moxie and TX six or something?
*  What new weed?
*  No, there's new types of like psychedelics.
*  You're over that shit.
*  I don't need that.
*  The stuff that's real is good enough.
*  These people want to try something other than mushrooms.
*  Like what are you looking for?
*  You, like acid's not strong enough for you.
*  I don't think there's one that you could turn off.
*  Oh, you turn it off.
*  Yeah.
*  Like with a switch.
*  No, like, you know, like if you're drunk, you can kind of make yourself sober if you
*  need to.
*  So this is a psychedelic that you can switch off.
*  Oh, really?
*  What is it called Moxie?
*  Hold on.
*  Moxie.
*  It's five MEO.
*  Yeah.
*  M-I-P-T.
*  What is it called?
*  There's Moxie and then 2CB is the other one.
*  I've heard of 2CB from the Kanye song.
*  Oh, is that from the Kanye song?
*  Analog of the more popular drug 5-M-E-O-D-I-P-T.
*  Foxy Moxie.
*  Foxy Mithoxy.
*  Isn't that great?
*  It's got an old timey name.
*  I've never heard of it.
*  Interesting.
*  Foxy Mithoxy is a great name.
*  Hmm.
*  So it's like, I guess, hipster mushrooms.
*  You probably haven't heard of it.
*  Well, they're always coming up with new things to avoid certain drug tests where they just
*  alter a chemical just slightly.
*  That's where 5-M-E-O-D-M-T was not classified as one of the banned psychedelics in the 1970
*  Sweeping Psychedelic Act and dimethyltryptamine was labeled.
*  Five MEO is DMT with an oxygen molecule attached to it, which eliminates some, I don't know
*  exactly how it works, but the visuals are very different.
*  It looks very different.
*  It feels very different.
*  And it was legal forever.
*  Like, you could order it in the year 2000s.
*  We would get it from a fucking chemical company where you ordered over the internet and they
*  would send you like an aspirin bottle of this shit and you could literally put the entire
*  city on the moon with that aspirin, that little aspirin bottle.
*  Oh my God, that's amazing.
*  It was so potent.
*  And it's this white, pure powder that is like straight from this laboratory.
*  Yeah, pharmaceutical grade.
*  No grade, not for human consumption.
*  Five methoxydimethyltryptamine.
*  And we took it and it just puts you in the center of the fucking universe.
*  You feel like you're a part of every cell and every atom and every neutron, everything.
*  You're part of everything.
*  You're in the soup of it all.
*  There's no detachment between you and things.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Everything just, you disappear for like 15 minutes.
*  You're sure you're dead.
*  You're absolutely, 100% sure you're dead.
*  And it probably is what happens when you die.
*  And then you come out of it, you're like, what in the fuck?
*  Like, I just got that from a company.
*  I just ordered that with a Visa card.
*  Like, it's crazy.
*  This is pre-PayPal.
*  You would be able to just buy this stuff.
*  Like, there was a host of these different things.
*  Like, do you remember salvia?
*  Oh, I was just talking about today.
*  Is that still legal or not?
*  I don't know.
*  It's a good question because it's kind of fallen out of favor.
*  It's not something that people talk about a lot.
*  But when people found out that you could just get salvia from a head shop, like, head shops
*  are supposed to be, you can buy bongs, you can buy velvet posters, but there's nothing
*  there that can get you fucked up.
*  But then they started selling salvia because it was somehow illegal.
*  And it is one of the most mind-blowing psychedelics known to man.
*  For 10 minutes, yeah.
*  It's fucking unbelievably powerful.
*  Ari Shaffir did some on a podcast and he lived an alternative life for three months.
*  He had a family, he had jobs, he had friends, and then all of a sudden, he came back to
*  reality.
*  And he was like, what the fuck?
*  In an alternate reality, Ari Shaffir has friends.
*  Yes, he has friends in real life.
*  I'm one of his friends.
*  But he had different friends that I didn't even know.
*  He just went into this place and lived another life.
*  I think he was under the ocean too.
*  Yeah, there he is right there.
*  Oh, wow.
*  So he's gone.
*  And he was, and Red Band of course filmed it.
*  And so he was, and he got very violent when he woke up too.
*  Oh, like violent, violent?
*  Yeah, like, get the fuck away from me.
*  Everybody was fucking with him.
*  Because it's disorienting.
*  Yeah, he's confused.
*  Because you're physically paralyzed.
*  Yeah.
*  So he was, he's like, get off me, get off me.
*  Sam Trippley's got his sunglasses on.
*  It was chaos.
*  Anyway, he came out of it and he said that while he was out for 10 minutes, he lived
*  like three months in a different world.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  And then you have to wonder if that's the real one and this is the fake one.
*  Ahhhhh!
*  Am I wrong?
*  No, you're not wrong.
*  That's what apparently when you would have the Catholic priest going down the aisle,
*  waving, that would either be sage, which is, I think, a derivative of salvia divinorum.
*  I think not a derivative, a cousin, maybe a close relative.
*  I think sage and salvia divinorum are extremely close in terms of like the genus.
*  Genus?
*  Genus, yeah.
*  What's the genus for sage?
*  I think it's real close.
*  I think it's one of those things where they think that maybe people were burning that,
*  but they were probably also most definitely burning cannabis.
*  And so they were wafting through the aisles with cannabis smoke, getting everybody secondhand
*  high.
*  Huh.
*  It's going to have that experience, yeah.
*  Yeah, to take them into this fucking Catholic journey.
*  The guys wearing a robe, just these stained glass windows everywhere like, holy shit,
*  and look at the epic structure.
*  You're looking at these gigantic, beautiful artworks that they're calling buildings.
*  Sage or salvia.
*  Okay.
*  All sages are salvia.
*  Wow.
*  Even though the term sage has been closely aligned with cooking or medicinal use, and
*  the term salvia has been given to more ornamental members of the genus.
*  Nevertheless, salvia is the Latin name or genus given to all these plants.
*  Yeah.
*  So sage is salvia.
*  So salvia divinorum, this incredibly potent psychedelic, is common sage.
*  Wow.
*  Or close enough, or basic for all kinds of purposes.
*  Somewhere in the neighborhood of it.
*  And it's like a mix of acid and wheat for 10 minutes.
*  Tripping balls, son.
*  Those guys are walking around with salvia, blowing salvia smoke.
*  That's not a coincidence, man.
*  They could have picked fucking cedar bark.
*  They chose to take some super potent psychedelic and waft it through the air as they're walking
*  back and forth.
*  There's also that theory that they sail in witch trials because they're all eating ergot.
*  Yes, from the bread.
*  And they're all late frost.
*  Yeah.
*  Early frost.
*  Yeah, that apparently is a really good one.
*  Well, they also, there's a book called The Oracle about the Oracle of Delphi, right?
*  And she had these visions and she would prophecy the future.
*  And they went there and they found her stool.
*  She was sitting over-
*  Her poo?
*  Or her stool that she sat on?
*  It's got three legs to it.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I thought of like an animal, you know.
*  What's it called?
*  Stool sample?
*  Copro.
*  What's the thing for dinosaur poo?
*  Fossilized copro something?
*  Oh.
*  You can get those.
*  Dinosaur poo?
*  Yeah, fossilized.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  So they found she was sitting over a crack with natural gas coming out.
*  So she's getting high off of whatever that is.
*  Oh, no shit.
*  So there was natural gas leaking out through the ground where she was partying.
*  Yeah.
*  So of course she's going to be speaking gibberish and having all these visions because she's
*  getting, it's like, it's not like when you inhale the-
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Laughing gas when you go to the-
*  The huffing.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh.
*  Nitrous.
*  It totally makes sense.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of these cases.
*  Of course.
*  Wacky things that people did.
*  I mean, it only makes sense.
*  I mean, they never did figure out what soma is in the ancient Hindu-
*  Is that right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, they think it might have been some kind of psychedelic, but they don't know what.
*  Like, there's all this different speculation.
*  Like some people think it was a combinator, that it was like psilocybin mixed with something
*  else and lotus flower.
*  There's all these like different theories, but nobody really knows.
*  But soma was obviously something that they were taking as a sacrament that would have
*  these profound effects.
*  That's most likely the root of all of these crazy religious experiences.
*  These people were tripping their fucking balls off and they weren't lying.
*  Like, God did come to them.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah, God did come to them out of the burning bush and spoke to them.
*  That's the other thing, the burning bush.
*  They think that these scholars in Jerusalem think that the burning bush is probably the
*  acacia bush, which is rich in DMT.
*  So that's probably why this is the metaphor, right?
*  The burning bush and God spoke to them in the burning bush.
*  That's probably what it really means.
*  They were tripping, they were smoking it, tripping balls, and they met God and he came
*  back with, this is the only way we're going to get along.
*  We've got to stop raping each other.
*  And the other thing is a lot of these old mystery religions, right?
*  You have to be initiated into them.
*  And if you're going to join this cult or whatever, for lack of a better term, and they give you
*  here take this, you are going to experience something not only that no one ever, that
*  you've ever heard of, but like you don't even know how to handle it.
*  It will change your life permanently.
*  But there's no vocabulary for it there.
*  It's not like now where you know what acid is.
*  You're like, holy shit, this is religious.
*  Right.
*  You would think it's God.
*  You met God.
*  Yeah.
*  Unless it's bad and then you meet the devil.
*  You know about that guy, John Marco Allegro?
*  Do you know who he is?
*  No.
*  He's the guy who deciphered the Dead Sea Scrolls.
*  Oh, okay.
*  He worked on the panel for 14 years and he wrote a seriously controversial book.
*  He was an ordained minister, but he was the only one on the Dead Sea Scroll translation
*  group that they put together that was agnostic because he started studying, well, he was an
*  ordained minister, but then he started studying theology and he was like, this is all fucking
*  crazy.
*  Like, what is this?
*  So he became agnostic and he wanted to look at the etymology of the words.
*  So it was his conclusion after 14 years that the entire Christian religion was a gigantic
*  misunderstanding and what it really was about was psychedelic mushroom experiences and fertility
*  rituals.
*  Okay.
*  And he broke down the word Jesus to an ancient word, an ancient Sumerian word that means
*  a mushroom covered in God's semen.
*  And the idea was that the rain, which would make everything grow, was God's come and that
*  it wasn't a bad thing.
*  Like, they didn't think of come as bad.
*  They wanted to live.
*  Everybody wanted to have children.
*  They wanted to prosper.
*  And that when the rain would come, mushrooms would appear almost instantaneously.
*  Like, have you ever seen how mushrooms appear after a day?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  It's overnight.
*  It's the seconds.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And when they would eat those, they would trip their fucking balls off.
*  So they had decided that this was Jesus and that this was-
*  Well, it was God's son.
*  Yes.
*  God created this from his own seed.
*  Well, this is what Marco Allegro's, his research was pointing to.
*  He was trying to say that what was really going on was these people were trying to hide
*  a lot of what these psychedelic rituals are from the Romans and from the people that captured
*  them.
*  So they hid them in stories and parables.
*  And then there was all sorts of problems in the translations.
*  There's just like, you know, you're taking things from ancient Hebrew and you're breaking
*  it down to Latin and you're breaking it down to German and English.
*  I can't believe he got a positive reception for this.
*  If you're taking on-
*  Well, he didn't necessarily.
*  The book got bought out by the Catholic Church and then recently reinstated.
*  Not even bought out.
*  They bought it.
*  I think they took it off the market.
*  I think you used to be able to only get a copy of it.
*  You used to only be able to get a used copy.
*  And then Jan Ervin put it out.
*  He republished it like a few, I don't know, I want to say maybe eight, 10 years ago.
*  So now you can get a hold.
*  But he also published another book after they took that one back.
*  I don't know the total history of it, but he published a second book.
*  The second book was The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth.
*  The first one was The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross.
*  But it only makes sense.
*  If you think about people who lived back then, we know that psychedelic mushrooms aren't
*  recent.
*  They existed forever.
*  So these people found them and they most certainly did.
*  There's a lot of depictions of them.
*  And there's also a lot of iconography and a lot of, like, you see shapes that resemble
*  mushrooms like all over the place and some of the ancient artwork and even people that
*  are dancing naked under the influence of a mushroom.
*  So there's a translucent mushroom shape that surrounds them and these ancient paintings
*  and these religious paintings, these people are dancing.
*  So most likely they were tripping balls.
*  Well, if you didn't know any better, of course, you would think that's God talking to you.
*  If you didn't know what psilocybin is, you didn't know what dimethyltryptamine is, you
*  didn't know what any of these things are.
*  Well, you're also going to hear voice, literal voices.
*  Yes, literal.
*  Not even that you're like, it's not a metaphor, you're going to hear a voice talking to you.
*  Right.
*  So people that think that, like, these people who created religion were all liars, they're
*  probably more likely trippers.
*  Because if you look at all these religious stories, they're all crazy and weird and fantastical
*  and wonderful.
*  But most of them are like guides to live life in a more virtuous or pious or moral way,
*  right?
*  Sure.
*  And that's what you get when you trip.
*  When you trip, you get, you got to be a better person.
*  That's what you get.
*  You get this profound humbling, I shouldn't say humiliation, but humbling in the face
*  of this titanic expression and experience that you can't even describe with words.
*  And then after it's over, you want to be a better person.
*  And there's also a sense of comfort that it's going to be okay.
*  Yes, it's going to be okay.
*  Which is what religion traditionally gives a lot of people, like the sense of reassurance
*  that someone's looking out, you're not going to accidentally, you know, go.
*  It's not even that.
*  It's you get a feeling that even if it's not okay, it's okay.
*  Right.
*  Like when you die, it's okay.
*  Yeah.
*  When you trip all, like one of the things that Larry Hagman say, remember Larry Hagman
*  from Dallas?
*  That is, I will say Dallas is probably the greatest show of all time.
*  Great fucking show.
*  That is, and people confuse with dynasty, which was trashy.
*  Garbage.
*  Dallas was one of the-
*  It's a great show.
*  I think it's literally the best show of all time, I think.
*  Was his name JR?
*  JR Ewing.
*  That's right.
*  He tripped balls and talked about it on CNN and said that it was one of the best experiences
*  of his life because he no longer was afraid of death.
*  Before that he was afraid of death.
*  And the one thing that tripping, and tripping hard apparently, really did for him is that
*  he no longer held that fear.
*  And he had stared death in the face because of his alcoholism.
*  You know, he had to have a liver transplant or whatever it was.
*  So it was no joke.
*  Yeah.
*  He was a huge alcoholic.
*  He had a dope house that was for sale in Topanga.
*  And unfortunately it wasn't on the market for a house, but I would love to buy that
*  That show had, I think, the funniest line of all time, which is Victoria Principal, who
*  was like the good, was Pam, come into his office, she's the good guy, right?
*  And she's yelling at JR and he would look at her with a straight face, like he would
*  never wink.
*  And he, I'm going to get it backwards, he goes, Pam, I've always thought you were stupid.
*  I never made any, you know, mistake about that, but I never thought you were crazy too.
*  It was just like, holy shit, total beast.
*  He was a good bad guy.
*  He was one of the first bad guys on TV, like Tony Soprano type dudes.
*  Who you like, rooted for.
*  Right.
*  Because the show, the villain was Cliff Barnes.
*  So it was about an evil person versus a bad, in the sense of low quality person.
*  His enemy wasn't a good person.
*  He was just this loser who was jealous of JR.
*  So it was very smart to have bad versus evil as opposed to good versus bad.
*  It was so good.
*  Good fucking show.
*  Yeah.
*  Back in the day when there's only like five shows on TV.
*  Yeah, four channels.
*  If that, during JR, wasn't that three?
*  Three, it was three.
*  Fox came later.
*  Yes.
*  No, no.
*  I mean, it lasted from what, 78 to 1990, I think.
*  So Fox was around by then, but yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Fox was around when I was in high school.
*  That's what's crazy about The Simpsons.
*  Simpsons was on from day one.
*  It was so good.
*  They're so great.
*  You think it's watchable?
*  Yes.
*  It's like fan fiction at this point.
*  I love it.
*  You still watch it?
*  Love it.
*  Do you still watch it?
*  If it comes on, I see it.
*  I watch it.
*  The rerun or the new one?
*  Whenever it's on.
*  I'm not picky.
*  Okay.
*  I'm very picky.
*  I think it was the best ever.
*  It was when Homer ate the hot peppers and went into that fucking dream.
*  Boy, there's a shock twist.
*  That's your favorite episode.
*  I just thought I could forget.
*  Loved it.
*  But the chili pepper.
*  Yeah.
*  It was so off the charts weird.
*  Have you ever done the ride at Universal?
*  No.
*  What's that?
*  It's amazing.
*  Wait, they have the Homer peppered ride?
*  They have a full on virtual reality ride at Universal Studios based in The Simpsons and
*  is one of my favorite rides of all time.
*  Okay.
*  It's fucking amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  I'll give you some spoiler alerts.
*  Okay.
*  The little kid becomes giant.
*  A lot of crazy shit happens.
*  Explosions.
*  You're on a roller coaster.
*  It's nuts.
*  It's so fun.
*  Wow.
*  It's so good.
*  Okay.
*  It's so good.
*  So good.
*  Okay.
*  It's psychedelic.
*  It's chaos.
*  And it's The Simpsons.
*  You never seen it?
*  No.
*  See if you can pull up a video of what it looks like to ride.
*  I think it used to be the Back to the Future ride, didn't it?
*  Oh, is that it?
*  Did it?
*  I think so.
*  What?
*  They at least ran it the same way.
*  I don't know if...
*  Maybe they have both there and they go back.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm just talking ass right now.
*  I don't really have no idea if that's true.
*  But I remember the Back to the Future ride too.
*  Now you're thinking about it.
*  Apparently they just redid the Jurassic Park ride too.
*  That's supposed to be cool.
*  But The Simpsons ride is amazing.
*  So good.
*  It's so good because it's all virtual.
*  You're not going anywhere.
*  You're sitting still, but you swear to God you're on a roller coaster and you're flying.
*  Is it like one of those where the seat moves too and stuff?
*  Oh, I love that shit.
*  You're in front of this massive high definition screen.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Incredible graphics.
*  Do you put the glasses on too?
*  I don't think you do.
*  Oh, okay.
*  I don't remember though.
*  I don't remember.
*  I did something like that in Orlando.
*  It was really cool.
*  I've been in a couple of years.
*  The best one, the best one is the Avatar one at Disney World.
*  Okay.
*  It's Flights of Passion.
*  That's fucking incredible.
*  That's so total next level.
*  I saw some Disney dorks on YouTube reviewing the new Star Wars ride that just opened up.
*  They said it's very close to, if not maybe better than that.
*  Wow.
*  Blasphemy.
*  I don't know what the ride was or what they did.
*  Blasphemy.
*  I'm sure it's good.
*  It's supposed to be 20 minutes long too.
*  Oh, okay.
*  This new Star Wars ride.
*  So this is The Simpsons ride.
*  Like a bunch of stuff happens to you.
*  I'll try to get out of the air.
*  You get into a car.
*  That's what the car part was.
*  Yeah, let this go.
*  Let this go.
*  Yeah, play it here.
*  So all this crazy shit is happening right in front of you.
*  It's just fun.
*  It's a really good one.
*  Oh, dope.
*  It's really fun, dude.
*  Oh, and it's coming right at you.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I'm sure the chair is shaking.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  Those are so much fun.
*  What was the other one we were just looking at?
*  Oh, the Disney World Avatar ride.
*  The Disney World Avatar ride.
*  You climb onto this thing that looks like a motorcycle.
*  And then they put goggles on you, put this helmet in, strap you in place, literally lock
*  your legs in place.
*  And all of a sudden you're on a dragon.
*  And you're on a dragon in Avatar.
*  And it's full HD virtual reality.
*  You get smells and wind and everything.
*  Oh, it's so good, dude.
*  It's so good.
*  It's so good when it's over.
*  You're like, fuck.
*  I want to live there.
*  People just want to get right back in line.
*  Do it again.
*  Yeah.
*  I haven't gotten a good ride in a long time.
*  It made me really think, and the first time I did it was, I think, two years ago.
*  But it made me really think, like, this is going to get real weird.
*  Because if they can do this now, 10 years from now, what the fuck is it going to be
*  like?
*  I was at the Gas Digital Studios and Ralph had these 3D glasses.
*  And it's basically you have to take an elevator, then you're walking in the street.
*  And there's a part where there's a wooden plank.
*  And they put a wooden plank in real life on the carpet.
*  And I was scared.
*  We have that right here.
*  Yeah, it's terrifying.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  I did it the other day.
*  The plank disappeared.
*  Yeah.
*  The plank takes off from under you, and then you see the ground.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And you start falling to the ground.
*  It's fucked up.
*  You know how they tell you when you're a kid, if you die in your dreams, you die in real
*  life, which doesn't make any sense.
*  How would you know?
*  But that's what this feels like.
*  It does feel like that.
*  Yeah.
*  Who the fuck knows that?
*  You die in your dreams, you're gonna die.
*  Shut up.
*  I'll force myself to die in my dream, bitch.
*  I'll come back and haunt you.
*  Yeah.
*  I'll show you.
*  I'll die.
*  I made an Alex Honnold one, an Alex Honnold virtual.
*  He's that climber from Free Solo, the guy who Free Solo climbs like El Capitan.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  Oh, yeah, that's no joke.
*  Like straight faces.
*  Oh my God.
*  We were just talking about him.
*  Even discussing him lightly makes my hands sweat.
*  I don't know.
*  I just don't understand how he conquers that.
*  Is he suicidal?
*  No, not at all.
*  No, he's not at all.
*  He's just really good.
*  He knows he can do it.
*  But yeah, there's chaos theory comes in at a certain point, right?
*  Like if I'm fighting somebody a billion times at one time, I'm gonna land that punch to
*  take him out.
*  Yes, but in his...
*  Look at that.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  Yeah.
*  Different guy, but it's the same spot.
*  Okay.
*  That's the same spot.
*  He just did it?
*  That's just...
*  Because they're going vertically upside.
*  They're going horizontally upside down, right?
*  Dude, that is so crazy.
*  The fact that someone even can do that blows my fucking mind, but the fact that someone
*  can do that 2,000 feet above the ground is just insane.
*  That is insane.
*  So this is a route that you have to go through.
*  And as you're going through that route, you got to continually chalk your hands and shove
*  them into this crack and slowly make your way up.
*  And he first ascended it.
*  I can't even look at that.
*  I know.
*  I'm so sweaty.
*  He first ascended it with ropes.
*  He marks his path and he makes his detailed analysis.
*  And then he ascends it.
*  I'm sure he ascends it with ropes without actually using the ropes and knows that he
*  can pull it off.
*  Okay, so there's a lot of work that goes into this.
*  Look, it doesn't fucking matter.
*  Look at that fall!
*  And he's got big ass gorilla hands.
*  He's like a thin, wiry guy with these meaty sausage hands.
*  That's what tree frogs have.
*  They're small and the hands are gigantic.
*  Well, they're very muscular.
*  He's fucking just climbing and pulling himself.
*  I'm sure he could do like fingertip pushups, pull ups rather.
*  And his back must be insane.
*  Insane.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's light.
*  That's the thing with the proportion, right?
*  Because if you put on too much muscle mass, it's like this weird delicate dance that they
*  gotta do.
*  Yeah, the best climbers.
*  Something I've been following recently because I got into these Alex Holland videos.
*  And then I didn't know bouldering.
*  It was like what they call it.
*  They call it bouldering.
*  But the best guys that do this are these really almost anorexic looking guys that are just
*  super shredded.
*  There's no extra weight anywhere.
*  And there's this gym.
*  I forget where the gym was.
*  Some climbing gym where they're doing all these different exercises and chin ups and
*  planks and stuff while hanging off of two fingers.
*  So they're doing two finger chin ups and they're doing two finger chin ups where they literally
*  like hold and extend their legs in front of them and then pull themselves up and basically
*  do like a muscle up with two fingers, like hanging on a rock face.
*  There's also some little asian girl who does all this stuff.
*  She's like 12 and she's like a spider monkey.
*  No!
*  What no?
*  She's too young.
*  Get her down.
*  Well I don't know how old she is.
*  12, 14.
*  I mean you see her climbing like this and it's just amazing.
*  I'm just glad I could do pull ups now with good form.
*  Fuck.
*  There's fucking people like that jolt of satisfaction when you get to the top of a mountain like
*  that.
*  Oh my god.
*  What are you doing sir?
*  That's gonna break off!
*  Oh my god.
*  I'm barely hanging on.
*  And this guy's like I'm just gonna climb it bro.
*  Fuck.
*  Fuck that.
*  Fuck everything about that.
*  This is just for Instagram too.
*  Jesus.
*  They still want to get that good profile pic.
*  People are falling man.
*  You know like a bunch of people fell in Yellowstone.
*  Did they?
*  No, Grand Canyon.
*  A bunch of people fell in the Grand Canyon.
*  Like an unusually high number lately.
*  That is preposterous.
*  The fact that this person can even do this.
*  Is that a woman?
*  But I think it's kind of.
*  What?
*  You're more man than me!
*  When you can do it with your legs that way.
*  That one's not above the ground very high.
*  Look I don't give a fuck.
*  Pretend it is.
*  Pretend it is.
*  I mean if they can do that.
*  How often do they fall?
*  Fuck that thing.
*  Fuck getting under that thing either by the way.
*  I'm not even gonna camp under that thing.
*  It's not long for this world.
*  Look how much it sticks out.
*  That's crazy.
*  Get out of there man.
*  We've all seen enough Wile E. Coyote cartoons to know how this ends.
*  So he's gonna saw it.
*  He's gonna look down and it's gonna be the end of it.
*  What does that call for people Jamie?
*  It's called the Rhino or something?
*  Rockland South Africa.
*  Rock climbing it says.
*  Yeah the Rhino rock climbing.
*  The Rhino.
*  I can see that.
*  Fuck that.
*  Dude I saw there's a nature's metal post that I saw where there was a hyena pack broke into
*  a safari.
*  They had like a safari camp and killed a kudu in the middle of the lobby.
*  So like these people are like really getting the safari experience.
*  Like in the lobby of the place where they're staying to go on safari a pack of hyenas slaughters
*  a fucking kudu.
*  Hyenas are the most fucked up.
*  Look at that.
*  Oh my god.
*  Oh my god.
*  Imagine we're gonna go see some elephants and it'll be amazing and a pack of hyenas
*  just turn that fucking place into a slaughterhouse.
*  What do you call a group of hyenas?
*  Do we know?
*  Is it a pack?
*  It's a term.
*  It's gotta be like a laughter of hyenas.
*  It's a weird term.
*  Yeah.
*  So the males are transgender.
*  Yes.
*  Well they're not transgender.
*  They have a micro penis.
*  No.
*  Large clitoris.
*  Engorged.
*  It's large.
*  They're matriarchal too so they're bigger than the males.
*  I have a whole bit about them.
*  They have like female bodybuilders to get there.
*  Did you know that 60% of all hyena babies suffocate to death?
*  No.
*  How?
*  During childbirth?
*  60% because they come out of the dick.
*  What?
*  The females have a dick.
*  Right.
*  The babies have to come out of the dick.
*  No it splits open?
*  Yep.
*  Really?
*  60% suffocate to death.
*  It's called a packle.
*  A packle.
*  Technical term is a cackle.
*  They're usually referred to as packs.
*  Go back to that picture.
*  They also get tamed pretty easily.
*  I went to a zoo where they had a pair of them and they were very sweet.
*  I guess if you feed them.
*  Yeah.
*  They don't have to fuck you up like this.
*  But they'll try to fuck up lions, man.
*  Oh they steal from the lions.
*  They fuck the lions up too.
*  They're like gangsters because there's a whole gang of them and the lion's like alright.
*  They're like no no we're doing this.
*  I'm taking the kill.
*  And then they bite the lions too.
*  They try to eat them.
*  They're gangster when they're all together.
*  But look at that picture, man.
*  That is so insane.
*  That's going to be one funny Yelp review.
*  Imagine coming downstairs for some coffee and a newspaper early.
*  Today we're going to go see some giraffes.
*  Oh Jesus!
*  Oh Jesus!
*  I'd want dibs on those horns.
*  They have plenty of those horns, man.
*  Really?
*  Yeah they're shooting those things left and right.
*  Oh wow.
*  Look at that thing.
*  What is that?
*  Pack that up, Jamie.
*  It said there's more info on their story.
*  Whoa!
*  Look at the unicorn.
*  Look at that thing.
*  It's got three horns.
*  What is that?
*  Is it three?
*  Dude, it's got three.
*  Oh my God.
*  What the fuck?
*  What is that?
*  Okay.
*  That's a deformity.
*  If you told me that that was an animal, I'd be like, fuck off.
*  That's not a real animal.
*  Go back to that thing.
*  What is that thing, Jamie?
*  It's the, you, um, what is it called?
*  It's a type of cow, isn't it?
*  Three horned cow?
*  Well not the three horn.
*  I think the third horn is a deformity.
*  No animal is three horns.
*  Okay.
*  So that's just a rare one.
*  It almost looks like the water buffalo horns.
*  But it looks so perfect.
*  No, the water buffaloes are curved.
*  They're right above your head.
*  Oh those.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That's that thing.
*  No, no, it's not.
*  This is like a Texas thing.
*  No, that ain't a cow, bro.
*  It does look like a cow.
*  You know what?
*  Stop.
*  That might be bullshit.
*  Go back to that.
*  They like stuck it on there?
*  Yeah.
*  The middle one can't be real.
*  Can you put your cursor on that and pause it?
*  No.
*  No, not like a phone?
*  Dude, that looks fake.
*  What's going on with that cow's face?
*  The middle one's gotta be fake.
*  That looks like a cow.
*  That is a cow.
*  I told you, yeah.
*  Are you sure it's a cow?
*  I'm not sure.
*  No, look at the back.
*  That's not a cow.
*  Yeah, they have those humps.
*  They call that a doulape.
*  But, really like that?
*  Yeah, what's it called?
*  Is it a zebu?
*  I think it's got a lot of deformities.
*  It could be a zebu.
*  Maybe.
*  I'll look and see.
*  I saw one of those in real life with the two horns.
*  And it's just like the, talk about the next rank.
*  It's just like...
*  Oh yeah.
*  I typed it in and that exact picture came up.
*  Of what?
*  Three-horned cow.
*  So it might just be a deformity.
*  It's called an Ancoly watusi.
*  A modern American breed of a domestic cow.
*  Okay.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah, it's not natural.
*  It's a modern American and they call it a watusi?
*  How rude.
*  Cultural appropriation.
*  That picture down there, there's another one with three horns right below you.
*  I was trying to see if they're real or not.
*  Look at that one.
*  Is that real?
*  That's not real.
*  It's like a hat put on it.
*  Yeah, it's like a wizard cap or a dunce cap.
*  That's a cap too.
*  Oh.
*  This is the one from Uganda.
*  I don't know if that's...
*  So sometimes when animals get an injury to their bone plate, they'll branch off like
*  elk you'll have, like they'll fight with each other.
*  Is that real?
*  But that's not uncommon deformity.
*  People have horns like that.
*  Sometimes elk fight with each other and they stab each other in the head.
*  And when they stab each other in the head, it breaks the pedicle and then it splits off
*  into two different directions.
*  So you'll have, instead of like that, where you have two main beams that come out of the
*  animal's head, you'll have two main beams and then a third.
*  So a third one will look like a spear.
*  And on the one that has two, there'll be no points.
*  It'll just be these spears that grow straight up with no additional points.
*  You can think of lots of plants.
*  You top the cap off and there's going to grow two or four branches.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  Nature finds a way.
*  Yeah.
*  But look at that.
*  I mean, it's a deformity that happens sometimes.
*  Okay.
*  That's pretty dope.
*  Why do I like that better than two?
*  Let's see.
*  Look at the one to the right to the left.
*  That's what I was talking about.
*  Those horns look just like those.
*  Right.
*  That's crazy.
*  See, but here's the thing.
*  If they all had three and that one had two, I'd be like, two is better.
*  It's rarer.
*  It looks more symmetrical.
*  Three looks stupid.
*  Yeah, I don't like...
*  The cows didn't have three horns.
*  Yeah.
*  What's the...
*  What was the middle horn...
*  What's the benefit of that?
*  Better way to fuck you up.
*  Do they...
*  Yeah.
*  Do they sell them?
*  Well, that was the thing about one of the ranches that I was on.
*  They had one of these animals that an elk that had broken antlers.
*  Okay.
*  Or broken pedicure or whatever.
*  Whatever it is.
*  Pedicle, right?
*  Pedicle.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  And it...
*  I knew it sounded wrong.
*  And it was branching off and forming these spears.
*  So it was fucking killing all these other elk.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And instead of clashing and locking up like all these antlers do where they have all these
*  additional points.
*  Yeah.
*  And what they do is they lock in.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  This would slide right through and stab them in the heart and stab them in the neck.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Stab them in the body.
*  So this one elk was killing everybody.
*  That's the...
*  They'd go to war with him.
*  He'd just kill them.
*  That's the alpha.
*  He had an injury.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's also evolution at work.
*  It is evolution.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it's not going to be genetics, so we can't pass it on.
*  I wonder.
*  I wonder if eventually over many, many, many, many, many generations, like that signal will
*  somehow or another get through.
*  I mean, obviously something happens where they develop something like that in the first
*  place.
*  Yes.
*  If it became better, that they branched off in some new way that lets them stab each other
*  a little bit better, those animals would breed better.
*  Yeah.
*  Or, yeah.
*  The craziest thing is that grows in a couple of months.
*  But they also shed it, right?
*  Shed it at the end of the summer or end of the winter.
*  They have nothing on their head for a couple of months and then it starts growing again
*  and it grows like wildfire.
*  Isn't it surprisingly light?
*  No.
*  Because it's heavy as hell?
*  That's heavy as fuck.
*  That's bone, man.
*  Okay.
*  But there's different kinds of bone.
*  Feel that.
*  That's not even big.
*  That's a mule deer.
*  That's small.
*  Okay.
*  But that's heavy.
*  But I have an elk skull out there that you can pick up.
*  Pick that fucking thing up.
*  You're like, holy shit.
*  That's why if you look at a bull elk, they have giant necks.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Huge necks.
*  Because it's all that muscle.
*  Carry all that weight around.
*  Jesus.
*  Yeah.
*  They're cool to look at.
*  They're dope.
*  They're delicious, too.
*  I've been in rabbit hole getting all kinds of animal stuff.
*  It's kind of fun.
*  Getting animal stuff?
*  What do you mean?
*  Like that pen I showed you made of mammoth molar.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  That's pretty cool.
*  Where did you get that?
*  Where did you get a pen made out of mammoth molar?
*  You could just...
*  Can I see it?
*  Yeah, sure.
*  Here you go.
*  I've got a...
*  What do I got?
*  A four-dyed...
*  That's a real mammoth molar?
*  Yeah, because mammoth isn't protected because they're extinct.
*  So you can trade mammoth ivory and mammoth teeth very easily.
*  They're dirty.
*  Yeah.
*  This is sweet, dude.
*  Yeah.
*  How many is this pen?
*  I can't find it on Instagram.
*  I'm blanking on his name.
*  Does it make you feel more important when you're writing something that's from an animal?
*  How can I feel more important?
*  Good point.
*  You're good at that, dude.
*  You're good at the fun thing.
*  It does.
*  It's kind of fun because the fans paid for it.
*  So it's like, all right, this is cool.
*  Nice.
*  Yeah.
*  That's beautiful.

*  is that and they well do it's open for your interpretation oh yeah your artists
*  put in like there's a line like a wire around the thing you can't pass through
*  I'm like why can't I sit on the box like no that's a piece of art like you're
*  kidding wait you're really oh yeah it's so dumb it makes you angry okay and then
*  there's a there's another art exhibit that was videos of people playing catch
*  oh my god that's it oh my you're not joking no I'm not joking that stupid
*  fucking thing is just sitting there people like oh my god brilliant that's
*  like Ikea oh my god amazing amazing that makes me sad because there is so much
*  good contemporary art like that what's that what is that I like the paintings
*  though in the back the middle yeah what's pretty cool oh well there's
*  definitely some cool shit yeah but when I saw that amber box I got violent all
*  right we're out of here yeah done yeah angry like you made me pay money and I'm
*  gonna see this fucking amber box like really you like all the art all the art
*  that you put that on the bottom you put it on the floor so people could stare at
*  it in the LA Museum of Art you know what it is it basically turns the audience
*  into performance artists because everyone looks at it and or you or you
*  lose your shit so you got triggered I didn't get triggered I was like oh boy
*  I went with my kids but they were like what is that I go it's the box why we

*  know I think there's an art to angering children oh for sure yeah yeah they're
*  hilarious the more I talk about this box the more I like it it's so goddamn dumb
*  it made me angry well look what about Marcel Duchamp in the urinal like what
*  is that over a hundred years ago Marcel Duchamp was a painter right mm-hmm and
*  they were having an exhibit and they asked him to contribute something and
*  goes all right he takes a urinal puts it on the thing and goes it's called
*  fountain and they didn't know what the fuck to do so they finally included it
*  but behind a curtain assholes yeah yeah there's a lot of those fucking art
*  assholes like well the art world is a weird world man yeah I don't know it at
*  all people catch fire they become hot and then you look at their stuff and
*  you're like I went over this guy's house he owned an agency in in LA I mean a big
*  house in Aspen fucking beautiful house and he had this thing on his wall they
*  looked like a six-year-old took some tissue paper of different colors and
*  glued them in some weird fucking shape so I said hey man is that did your your
*  kid do that and this agent goes that's actually a blah blah blah it's a blah
*  blah I go what do you mean I'm with him that's paid money for this yeah he said
*  it's worth $30,000 I go that's worth $30,000 that what about the guy who's
*  that takes Mickey Mouse and puts X's over his eyes and his painting is sold for
*  like 10 million ways do you know what talking about could keep that hustle
*  alive that keep that house like what he's got one word name and he's just some
*  dude and he makes Simpsons and just puts across the cause cause good have you
*  seen this guy no look at his look at his art how about I won't come on why you
*  make me dumb I heard something about this recently I don't know if it's
*  accurate because it sounds like a juicy truth but like it also could be easily
*  disproven that that what you're saying that like jacked up prices of art is
*  some like rich person scammed for like tax evasion sort of oh they can like
*  it's a write-off they can get a little really high then they can donate it to a
*  company and they not pay taxes but they can donate a 20 million dollar I'm sure
*  I'm sure there's some of that I'm sure however I know people that are these art
*  collector folks that buy this stupid stuff and they have it all over their
*  fucking house and they want to tell you what it is and where it came from it's a
*  thing it's like buying wine that cost a thousand dollars a bottle there's people
*  that are into that they're in a show in it to you and they're into look at this
*  watch is from the 16th century I guess there's people that are into that shit
*  and they love the fact that they have some unusual piece of art on their wall
*  and they love the sophisticated feeling they get by describing what the artist
*  is trying to say see I have this guy Sean Chow CHAO I have he makes dioramas
*  it's like a 3d sculpture you know it's like a little scene and I have it right
*  over my desk because when I went to LA like seven years ago I want to join
*  robot they had an exhibit I'm like this is really cool and one day I'm gonna buy
*  it and I bought it and now every day I look at it I'm like oh this is like
*  something I really wanted but it was like a grand it wasn't like 30 grand
*  right anyone can look at it and be like oh this is makes me happy it's actually
*  art yeah yeah Sean Chow is his name there's some art there's some look at
*  that like that oh wow it's fun that's pretty cool yeah but that makes sense to
*  me right you can look at it and you'll understand why I enjoy it yeah I get
*  that there's things I get yeah cuz that's not tissues yeah this is a fun
*  thing of fish underwater yeah it's someone he made something yes with his
*  hands and you're also helping someone directly by buying his product but
*  here's where the great look at that that's pretty cool yeah but here's where
*  the hustle is when people don't really like it but they pretend they like it
*  because it's the cool thing to pretend you like I think it's more they also
*  they're it's same with clothes like you're like a label whore it's like oh
*  this is a this it's like you just want to buy the name what's up with the
*  sneakers the kids are wearing that have a fucking a green tag on them I was it
*  was explained to me are we total boomers now is a green I'm not a boomer right
*  I'm a generation X the boomers a state of mind yeah okay cool this green tag
*  what is it off-white is that what it is yeah so they have this green tag on this
*  pair I was buying a pair of Nikes for my kid and they're like oh those are off
*  white what's up with this green thing yeah what do you leave that on I'm like
*  fuck you not leaving this stupid plastic tag on no you don't leave that on wait
*  what is this thing that people do that thing giant ass tag they leave these
*  stupid fucking tags these are huge they're cumbersome they look dumb but
*  wear them on their shoe it's part of the thing it's part of the grant this person
*  was trying to explain it to me it's part of the brand look in five years it's
*  gonna go away why is it here because it looks different no it looks different
*  it's like a flag someone should have a knife and then she'd go up to these
*  fucking kids just cut that off and go no we're about to go to war they're making
*  you soft and stupid this is probably a plot by the Russians and the Chinese and
*  the Iranians to try to make sure that our kids grow dumber and dumber this is
*  probably something that was started out on Instagram by one of those IRA
*  Internet Research Agencies what's this that's the people that make all the
*  propaganda from the Russian farms the IRA you never heard of that I've not
*  heard of it I am a Russian troll but Internet Research Agency is a state
*  funded organization that's this huge group of people that makes these they
*  did you some hilarious stuff there's a woman named Renee de Resta she
*  investigated this and reported on it she came on the podcast explained to me
*  after I'd heard her on Sam Harris's podcast but they did stuff like they
*  would have a fake Black Lives Matter page that they started and then they
*  would argue with people like about Black Lives Matter and then they would
*  organize like a Texas separatism while meeting to meet they organized a Texas
*  separatism page they had a page and then they organized a meeting a Facebook
*  meeting where these people would be there at the same time as another me they
*  set up between these Muslim people so they'd have the Texas separatists on one
*  side of streets and the Muslims the other side of street having a protest at
*  the exact same time like they were doing shit like this on purpose and fucking
*  with people and they did a lot yeah they did a lot of anti Hillary Clinton stuff
*  and a lot a lot of like different like they would pretend that they're black
*  women as a black woman I cannot vote for Hillary Clinton like she does not
*  represent us like and they were just sowing these seeds of discourse or
*  discord all throughout social media those wonderful wacky social media pages
*  it's kind of hilarious yeah the more discord the better but it's of course
*  it's going to happen as soon as the government realized that if you rile
*  people enough enough they'll engage and then they'll you can actually shift
*  opinion yeah yeah especially if you're funny yes that's that's one of the
*  things about all these funny memes oh yeah oh my god there it's I mean this is
*  this is why I'm very scared for the Democrats because Joe Biden is might be
*  the nominee he does not have a good social media team when when he had this
*  family photo for Halloween all I just replied with a photo of a crack pipe
*  right and where's hunter hashtag was trending and I'm like no matter what you
*  think of Joe Biden it is not acceptable for his Twitter not to be able to handle
*  this and anticipate it right especially because you have someone who just tweeted
*  his way into the presidency three years ago yes like where are the people who
*  are helping this guy you know with his social media game yeah they can't help
*  them the the the people that are mean and funny like that are all Republicans
*  there's something there's something about the memes that go against Trump
*  versus the means that go for Trump like the pro Trump memes are so much funnier
*  yeah the left cat meme is the thing they're not that good at it they're not
*  that good one of my some mean kind of humor one of my tweets became a meme
*  when your girl Tulsi took out officer Harris and I said if there's one thing
*  a Hawaiian knows it's how to roast a pig and that went wide I wonder if she
*  knows about that she knows she knows she knows did she see it she saw it she saw
*  how do you know she's on because I send it to me and I'll make sure she sees it
*  okay please I will absolutely to her her chief of communications whenever follows
*  me on Twitter oh yeah yeah perfect yeah she's good I like her well I don't know
*  her as a person I'm just glad that now that Harris is gone it's just gonna be
*  hilarious for the next year whoever it is well the Harris thing was weird man
*  did like that they didn't know the stuff that you could call her out on oh yeah
*  that come on that Tulsi did but Tulsi didn't even get to the horrible stuff
*  the horrible stuff was when she was threatening single moms with jail time
*  oh yeah their kids were truant right imagine you're just barely staying above
*  water as a single mom and you got to literally make your fucking children
*  terrified that you're gonna go to jail in order for them to go to jail she was
*  laughing about that's how she got people to go to jail that's that's how she got
*  people to go to school and that's the thing is that I don't think she actually
*  cared I think this was her means to further her political career I think
*  you're right because when you are you could say a lot of things about Joe
*  Biden and I have on Twitter to go on stage and call him a closet racist or
*  imply that come on like this is as though she did the first debate she goes
*  oh you were against busing and he's like I was against it on the federal level
*  like what are you talking about she's like oh I was like who are you fooling
*  nasty nasty pig yeah they're playing game when she when she dropped out like
*  the fans chipped in on my live stream and I spent $400 on ham and I did a ham
*  tasting because the pig was done oh it was a lot of fun have you ever tried
*  that like Spanish ham that I love yeah yeah yeah $200 a pound I have tried it
*  yes made of the pigs only eat acorns yeah that's that stuff that Chris Ryan
*  brought in that's fantastic it's really good fantastic yeah so yeah I've had
*  wild pigs that only eat acorns and is it good ham is so good yeah wild pigs and
*  only eat acorns have a great smell to them and it's dark it's like a dark meat
*  oh so good yeah I tried like 20 different kinds of ham and I loved every
*  minute of it yeah I know a dude who he raises pigs and he feeds them hazelnuts
*  and chocolate yeah and the bacon and it comes through yeah I don't understand
*  how and magical Jesus you got to feed them mushrooms yeah I don't know what
*  happened they're eating mushroom ham and your tripping face why I guarantee you
*  I wonder if it works what happens when pigs eat psychedelic mushrooms they must
*  break down come on right I don't think so you think it goes in green meat?
*  are addicted to something called the aminida muscaria that's a mushroom
*  aminida muscaria is a Santa Claus mushroom okay why is that a mushroom
*  that's connected to the myth of Santa Claus how's that it's got a
*  mycorrhizal relationship with coniferous trees okay grows under pine trees it
*  looks like a shiny package look now think about pine trees that we have we
*  put in our fucking house and there's little shiny packages it's red and white
*  which is just like Santa Claus's outfit yeah and reindeers love it and they
*  fucking trip balls when they eat it and they fly away really seriously it's all
*  shaman who used to come down during like when they were telling people not to eat
*  these mushrooms shaman would sneak into people's houses through the fucking
*  chimneys only if you're nice yeah we just or maybe only if you're naughty
*  because they were watching the fucking front door so people would climb down
*  through the chimney with a bag of mushrooms they would all trip balls
*  together wow all speculative what you can buy this this these mushrooms no you
*  could pick it yeah but aminida muscaria is a weird one okay it's a weird one
*  that's that's what it is I've taken it before and it does something but it
*  doesn't do something as profound as psilocybin but reindeer or caribou I
*  should say which is what a reindeer is caribou love them that face and there's
*  another thing they do with this they rain be reindeer apparently will dive on
*  your piss if you're in a lodge and you're eating the aminida muscaria and
*  you urinate outside you have to be careful of reindeer because they'll
*  literally tackle you to try to get to your piss because they smell it because
*  it smells so potent so people actually when they trip balls they get a second
*  high by drinking their own piss so they're tripping balls they piss into
*  this glass and they drink their own yeah because it's gonna be so
*  contraffeted coming out your body wants to get rid of as fast as possible yeah
*  this is the mushroom that's on the cover of the John Marco Allegro book the
*  sacred mushroom across that's that mushroom well what would be the
*  evolutionary advantage of a reindeer eating this they trip feels good but
*  they're gonna be vulnerable whoo I don't think so some animals and including
*  like like Vikings they would trip and then go into war and they thought it
*  helped actually gave them an advantage they would call them berserkers like oh
*  cuz they're not gonna be feeling pain and they're not gonna be fearing death
*  they're not gonna be fearing death and they're going to be well first of all
*  war was such a part of life it was so normal and so constant it was a constant
*  and they wanted in some way or they'd be heightened or prepared for it's whether
*  they were drunk which a lot of tribes would just get drunk and then go into
*  war or whether they could see they would just be able to endure and be willing to
*  do things that maybe they wouldn't be able to do or be willing to do if they
*  weren't drunk maybe they would anticipate you know the potential
*  dangers of combat and they freak out but when they're drunk they'd be like
*  fucking war and just run in and well they would do that with mushrooms too I
*  just remembered this is foothill antiques for the mammoth tooth they're
*  great stuff it's a guy live anymore that way I could buy them all well he's got
*  four died also I got from him do you know four date what is that you know
*  about four date no this is such a cool thing so all the car companies all the
*  car companies used to use spray paint or like manually for the different cars
*  right so over the years you'd have layers of this paint and it became
*  basically an artificial mineral so when you take a cross-section it looks like
*  here give me that pen why don't I give you the nice foot hail aunties I'm sorry
*  so say it again fordite right you have these car companies car park plants so
*  this spray painting the Ford truck black the next year it's red the next year
*  it's green over time the painting cute accumulates and you can use that
*  cross-section to make really cool things oh wow yeah look at what I Jamie
*  it looks really really cool they keep your painting yeah look oh that's real
*  yeah that's from a car that's from a car plant because look at every year it's a
*  different color it's a really cool substance I've got a couple of four
*  date pens warthog tusk that's crazy wouldn't one from the DMZ yeah wow is
*  that amazing that's really cool yeah I never heard of that before and so one
*  more time they're taking it out of like a Ford plant or Corvette right into
*  whatever I have one of Corvette one of Ford and over the years you know they
*  chip it away from the walls mm-hmm and they have a block of it there you go it
*  gets that thick yeah wow and you could do whatever you want with it including
*  makeup turning it that's fucking cool right that's like a cool form of a
*  fossil or something or it's like an industrial fossil yeah it's cool because
*  you got the layer it's like tree rings almost so you have a pen made out of
*  that I've got two oh you lucky devil yeah he sent me one for free so how do
*  people know that you're you're into pens oh so I do something called spike
*  funding right so what happens on Twitter is every so often some cretin will come
*  for me and I'll be like it would be a shame if people send me money to waste
*  on things I don't want just to spite you and I put up Michael malice comm
*  contribute and I go I will post receipts and people send me cash and they say
*  this has to be wasted so I bite I don't need seven pens I don't need eight
*  shaving brushes I don't need a signed copy of Langston Hughes's book I got
*  them fossils and this is all because of a cretin yeah so comes after you on
*  Twitter and I'm like okay people gonna sit and then they go oh you know you're
*  a snake oil salesman I'm like no no no no one's getting anything out of this
*  except for spiting you I don't really need these things how does that make you
*  a snake oil sales because they're like oh you're conning these people out of
*  money they're like no no no it's all understood this is total waste of money
*  just to fuck with you well they definitely don't know what snake oil is
*  yeah no why are you engaging with people on Twitter you're a smart guy because
*  it's fun you enjoy it it's hilarious it's my biggest activity really clowning
*  idiots yes your number one thing it's I'm really fun with it and I'm really
*  good with it I've started doing a little bit of PsyOps on Twitter too so yeah so
*  like for example what I've been doing is a lot of these people these candidates
*  they're like press secretary will have fewer followers than me right so I'll
*  say something like hey there was an article in the New York Times today
*  about your candidate how freaked out is the campaign and how much is this a
*  reflection on you not being able to do your job correctly because you know when
*  that article hits the New York Times you're in the campaign you're in the
*  bunker you're freaking out what does this mean so to have and if someone's
*  like fuck you they're gonna be like no fuck you so you do this even if there's
*  not a real story well if there is a story oh because you know they're in
*  full panic okay so when they're in full panic then you attack yeah I'm gonna do
*  this for fun and because they're bad people often which ones are bad Jeremy
*  Corbyn and Kamala Harris those are the two I thought were the worst other than
*  that I don't think anyone's a bad person who's the Corbyn guy again what do he's
*  court winning labor right what's the name again Jeremy Corbyn yeah what does
*  he do he was the head of the Labour Party in the UK that's right okay he just
*  had their biggest disaster election since 1935 worst that's right he he my
*  favorite thing he did was he said his pronouns oh yes and my pronouns are he
*  him yeah yeah yeah did this video my name is Jamie Corbyn Jeremy Corbyn
*  whatever the fuck it is Elizabeth Warren has her pronouns on her thank God
*  yeah well this is signaling that you're part of the tribe yes yeah you're willing
*  to believe in nonsense that bitch is 150 years old she knows what her fucking
*  pronouns are mom and mummy come on with this nonsense your pronouns are what's
*  your name is it Elizabeth you're away you're a lady right come on well in her
*  defense we're in her defense Warren is a man's name so it's not there
*  yeah oh yeah it's so stupid it's so stupid yeah what do you know who
*  Janay Marie Croc is no so Janay Marie Croc I had her on my it's just also
*  funny how could I'm not saying you're conservative how conservatives react to
*  this stuff she was as Matt Krakowski like the world champion powerlifter
*  right thousand pound squat something crazy oh my god comes out as trans or
*  genderfluid whatever Janay and people I don't my show people freaking out all
*  competing as a man what am I gonna do no no no as Matt yeah before and after he
*  was a world record holder he competed as a man and now they're like well if he
*  compete as a man and got a world record now he wants to be chick I don't know
*  what to do about this and they don't know how to react what's happening there
*  she's an amazing there's a transgender powerlifter Janay Marie Croc shares
*  unbelievable of course it's unbelievable look at look at that lady's arms I mean
*  now I'm gonna be correct and call her lady she's toned down she's lost weight
*  what there's a documentary on transformer what's happening there and so
*  she competes as a woman no no she could be as Matt years ago there's a
*  lift named after her this like four people have missed lifts named after
*  them the Arnold pressed you got the Pendley row deadlift after Kevin deadlift
*  and crockrose after Matt deadlift is named after a guy as a joke
*  we're gonna go like that picture again transgender lifter Janay Marie look at
*  that what is happening here compete for IFBB pro that's bodybuilding just
*  competing as a male Jesus I'm so confused but then again Eddie
*  Izzard was on here and Eddie has been like the most open transgender person
*  forever and he still calls himself Eddie okay and he likes women yeah she dates
*  women okay she just likes fucking them with makeup on shit I I don't know how
*  she fucks them that's the thing what kind of chaos she's a really interesting
*  person this is Kali Yuga I had her opening jars in my show for me oh I bet
*  she could do more than that it's weird to say she because she's still clearly
*  on male hormones yeah clearly I wish we discussed that on the air she does I
*  think she took estrogen she did both and it was kind of hard to get the balance
*  right because you have to still does both I don't I'm not sure which is
*  currently why bother if she's competing as male she's obviously gonna running
*  tests at high levels look at the size of her that's smaller she he dick or no dick
*  I get to the bottom of it so what are we doing here here's the thing here's the
*  thing here's what I think if you are setting a world record in powerlifting I
*  will call you whatever you want and I will respect you okay you don't think
*  that's a major accomplishment sure I don't care if you want to be a girl or
*  yeah I'm cool with it but it's just hilarious still okay it's a sign of the
*  chaos of this moment in history I do love the chaos I know you and tricksters
*  historically have been gender-fluid Loki and all these figures that coyote they
*  always switch genders and yes that's a good point so maybe it's a sign of the
*  chaos of our age that there's more transgenderism or do you think there is
*  or do you think people just talking about it more I think it's there's so
*  many pluses and minuses and and it's it's such a weird loaded situation and I
*  don't I the other thing is if you are a guy who has feminine qualities that
*  doesn't make you non-binary just like if you're like a tomboy yeah you're not
*  you're not non-binary course yeah yeah of course there I mean there there's
*  butch women yeah we're really they always have been yeah there's always
*  been a feminine men yeah it doesn't mean you're but that's also a thing that
*  really makes us some gay activists angry because they're like if you leave
*  children alone that have these feelings there's a large percentage of them that
*  become gay men and you're almost saying there's something wrong with being a gay
*  man you have to become a woman like it's almost an anti gay stance well do you
*  know that with the world interfere the world chant the world capital of sex
*  change is Tehran do you know what this yes I do know what this tell the story
*  though because they know why they have to do right because they regard
*  homosexuality as depraved yes but if you want to become a woman and have sex with
*  men that's fine yeah so they make them basically have these sex changes yeah
*  and a lot of them just don't really totally go all the way through with it
*  well because they don't think of themselves as women they're like I want
*  to suck dick what I don't have pussy so they pretend to be a woman but they
*  don't really get the operation yeah but they're trying to force a lot of men to
*  place like in the Middle East what do you think about this whole you're more
*  informed than me about international issues I mean for Christ sakes you went
*  to North Korea I you've never been still still it's the new Milan that's what I
*  heard what do you think about all this crazy shit that's going on right now
*  with Iran I have a great book idea and it's such a great book idea I'm gonna
*  just drop it here in the hopes that if I don't ever do it someone does it and
*  give it away yeah I'm gonna give it away hope somebody does this a lot of
*  people do at the same time sue each other or no you can't smile idea bitch
*  or some publisher wants to contact my agent just give me a deal on the spot
*  I'll do it okay blood you'll do it I'll do it so it's not telling anybody well I
*  don't want to do the proposal so if they want to just make me an offer we're good
*  blood lust the media's love affair with war for a hundred years Spanish-American
*  war Willie Randolph Hearst right the sinking of the Lusitania we were taught
*  about yellow journalism when we're kids back you know the 1903 blah blah blah
*  blah but now it's not they love war they can't get enough war Trump is only
*  presidential when he's bombing Syria they just are desperate to push the war
*  drums and what I love about again Tulsi is she's served and she's like war we
*  have to start seeing war as a last resort instead of a first priority in a
*  first response and I don't know what's going to happen as a consequence Iran
*  this guy is most people know so the money was a huge deal like he was really
*  revered in Iran and very hated by people elsewhere but Trump also started killing
*  other people and like Yemeni took somebody out and some other countries go
*  they're going on a killing spree so it's I don't think this is going to be World
*  War three at all because Iran knows they can't win and I'm sure right now but you
*  know they're doing exercise right now with Russia and China sure let them do
*  sure we do exercise with South Korea every year and North Korea freaks out
*  and it's like okay we're just it's just flexing your muscles right until I think
*  very strongly we're never gonna be privy to this that there's a lot of stuff
*  going on behind the scenes that we don't know that people are talking and like
*  what's gonna happen mmm I'm sure well there must be but the the idea that he
*  was willing to just do that and that he even has the call that he can make the
*  call like there's here's several options sir right which one you want to do I
*  want to get that guy killed well I think it's amazing that we've gotten to the
*  point where you're blowing up a wedding right and you're killing a lot of people
*  and you're killing just him and one other person is that what they did yeah
*  they only killed two people that like the precision of that is something
*  that's got to be scary to the Iranians it should be scary to us it should be
*  scared us yeah scared everybody because it's not like that can't come over to
*  here oh what do you mean that kind of technology can't be used against
*  Americans by another country well certainly could frankly if they're
*  gonna be terrorists I'd rather than taking out one person than three
*  no no for sure I'm just saying the precision of it oh yeah fact that they
*  have that kind of ability just just the drone ability in general there's the
*  ability to wage war in countries we don't even occupy like the all the
*  different drone attacks in Yemen oh yeah and they're like really sketchy in terms
*  of like the legality of it like what it's not really a military strike but
*  it's definitely a military strike I mean I think we've been playing fast and
*  loose with raw rules of war for a long time and I think everyone knows this is
*  nothing particularly insightful that war and the rules of war written by the
*  powerful people I remember when people were talking about how much of a
*  warmonger Obama was because drone strikes went up considerably from Obama
*  from George Bush to Obama and I'm like yeah you know what else went up drone
*  technology yeah yeah nothing to do with him they're just getting better at
*  bombing people they know how to do it better and this is something I've argued
*  with people and wonder about when you become like Obama was very anti-war
*  yeah through his campaign he was a big lefty he went to the all Ivy League
*  schools blah blah right we know his culture that he came from he gets in the
*  White House he's drone bombing everybody what do you think that is the question I
*  have is do you think and I'll get my Alex Jones hat on do you think that they sit
*  you down when you're president and they're like all right here's what you
*  can be in charge of but here's how it's gonna be internationally and I wouldn't
*  be surprised if that's the way it happens I think there's no way until you
*  get into office you ever really understand what information what you
*  know what plans that they can reveal that terrorists have what you know what
*  kind I mean there's there's got to be some kind of intelligence they receive
*  that probably scares the fuck out of them oh yeah when you stop and think
*  about how many nuclear bombs there are how many radical terrorists there are
*  how many different sex how many people fight over each other how here's here's
*  some photographs of a crime scene that we found that Isis behead all these oh
*  yeah like this is all real stuff that you they could show you and they go look
*  we have done our very best to keep everybody safe but there's only one way
*  to keep doing this we got a drone bomb yeah I know that many years ago and I'm
*  not supposed to know this but I'll be all there was a nail bomb in Grand
*  Central that they caught in the no one talked about no one talked about it who
*  found the nail bomb the authorities the right people and they took care of it
*  and nothing happened but think how many soft targets there are it overseas I mean
*  that's what happened nail bomb down I must have been what at the time al-qaeda
*  I'm guessing I don't know I don't have any further information I'm gonna
*  question you further if you could question me all you want I you're gonna
*  have my waterboard tell me the story again so there's this place Grand
*  Central where the sky is bad grand central of course I mean in the spot
*  where the bomb was left probably how do you know where the bomb was left I don't
*  know but if I since I've been throughout Grand Central I probably okay yeah okay
*  tell me the story again from the beginning this is how they do it and
*  they eventually oh yeah yeah yeah yeah and now tell the same story over and
*  over and over yeah yeah and shit to it you're probably nervous worried about
*  dying it's like scat you know you the words trying to change a little over
*  time yeah yeah well you just lie you know if you're a guy who left a bomb
*  Grand Central station they just keep getting you to tell that story over and
*  over again and you're exhausted and then they twisted around just a little bit
*  just a little bit for you and then you agree with their twist and they had a
*  little more it was like Stalin's right-hand man Beria said find me the
*  man and I'll find you the crime mmm that's a real scary thing about cross
*  examining people like and just examine it just just just interrogating people
*  I'm not saying that cops do this all the time that they do get people to
*  believe they did something wrong but you can get some believe they did something
*  wrong especially if someone's like limited intellectually oh yeah you can
*  talk your way into an arrest but you can't talk your way out of one right and
*  it's it's and if they want you there's a there's an old line that a
*  conservative is a liberal who's been mugged and a liberal is a conservative
*  who's been arrested because when you get in that government's clutches you're
*  gonna be very glad that there's the ACLU and all these Miranda rights people who
*  are like looking out for the week and wanted as hard as possible for you to
*  get arrested and go to jail because it's just think about this it's like being
*  audited is it ever gonna be nice it's never gonna be nice never gonna be so
*  getting arrested it's not going to be oh we're sorry we bothered you mr. Smith
*  no no no yeah we're not your friendly country IRS right oh we're friendly we're
*  just a country store IRS yeah hey I'm sure there's some sort of
*  miscommunication right you want to make sure this all works out well for everybody
*  I just love that I here's a box of cookies I saw some meme where they're
*  like here's how the IRS works there's a number you owe they know that number
*  they won't tell you the number you have to figure out the number and if the
*  number you pay isn't the number that they have they're gonna get you in
*  trouble yeah it's like you have to read a game yeah they're just trying to
*  prosecute as many people as they can yes it's like people that pull people over
*  speeding like you got to prove that you didn't get pulled over speeding I was
*  my lift driver at the airport was just paused I threw in my trunk got in the
*  car within five seconds the cop was writing him a ticket and I paid for half
*  the ticket in the tip and I couldn't believe it and I'm standing and the
*  guys like oh you know he's just got it it's just doing his job I go well you
*  got a shitty job like what kind of person are you that this is what you do
*  you're writing a 75 buck ticket for someone who's like a lift driver you know
*  and he's not even blocking traffic he's not stopping anywhere you're a horrible
*  human being well they have quotas that's a real problem quotas are gross I've
*  talked to cops and they have like a certain number of tickets that they have
*  to write every month or they're gonna get in trouble yes and to protect and
*  serve what kind of servant is telling me to pay them like money I don't want to
*  pay officer the peace stealing money yes it was horrible how they keep the peace
*  yeah yeah keep you scared yeah don't know money don't get Russians started on
*  the cops it's not gonna end well what do you think about all the Hong Kong shit
*  then I am so hopeful for the people of Hong Kong and I talk about it my show
*  nightshade constantly my hope is it reminds me of Poland 1989 right in Poland
*  1989 you had this big labor movement solidarity they weren't conservatives
*  they were lefties they were labor and they were like look the Constitution says
*  we have democratic elections and you have them there's only one candidate
*  let's have elections let's have elections and the car and Margaret
*  Thatcher came there supported them she was loved in the Eastern Bloc so the
*  Polish Communist Party sat down they're like all right let's have these elections
*  and then they were some time a little bit worried that well what if we win all
*  the elections because they asked the people who you're gonna vote for oh the
*  communists the communist communist the elections happen the labor solidarity
*  wins every seat except one and the question is are they gonna honor this
*  what are they gonna wave it away they honored it and that was the beginning of
*  the end of the Soviet Union I don't think you could have Tiananmen Square
*  today because Tiananmen Square was before smartphones Tiananmen Square was
*  before the internet there's no footage Tank Man wasn't killed he was pulled
*  away Hong Kong we're seeing the footage and when you see kids getting beaten and
*  tear-gassed you don't need to speak any language to look at and be like
*  something's not right here and decide with the people who are getting beaten
*  this is a very Martin Luther King thing like even the racists were like I don't
*  want these people to have dogs attacking them and water hoses this is outrageous
*  hmm yeah so I'm very very hopeful this is going to work positively to start the
*  end of the you know evil Chinese dictatorship I hope you're right I hope
*  you're right and that would also work towards liberating North Korea which is
*  obviously my pet issue do you think that it's possible for China to ever turn it
*  around though forget about Hong Kong but mainland China turn what around what
*  turn what around in terms of their whole dictatorship oh yeah Russia did it the
*  Soviet Union did it but today yes did they yeah you a puppet of Putin as well
*  he's my uncle I mean they kind of did it but they're kind of a dictatorship right
*  now you can you can get a passport you're not gonna get your organs harvester
*  who got a passport who right Jones jr. is it Roy Jones jr. who's that who the
*  fuck are you man I'm a piece of shit who's never watched snatched dude Roy
*  Jones jr. is one of the greatest boxers of all time okay he won the super
*  middleweight championship went up to light heavyweight and heavyweight okay
*  he beat John Ruiz to win the heavyweight championship a guy who fought at 168
*  pounds okay he's a beast okay sure he's one of the greatest of all time and he
*  also has a Russian passport okay okay that's awesome but the point is people
*  can leave Russia people can't leave China and now they're going in a bad
*  direction with North Korea instituting their social credit system to control
*  internal migration which is really really bad what do you think about people
*  being able to go back and forth like like do you what do you think about
*  travel back and forth from Russia and to the United States I mean they must be
*  like watching every single thing you do I don't think it's as pervasive listen
*  you know what they're watching everything we do here come on what do
*  you think about Snowden being over there I think I think Ed Snowden should be
*  allowed to walk free I think so too I mean and and it's it's insane that we
*  drove him into the hands of the Soviet Union and what he was exposing was
*  illegal activity he was a lot of officials Stalin in his wildest dreams
*  and his KGB never had that power of surveillance like Ed Snowden revealed
*  that every single cell phone is being hacked into aren't they recording
*  literally every call yeah I mean it's it's and we just sit and we're like oh
*  this is fine tracking it's just the level of talk about right to privacy the
*  level of surveillance that this government is putting forward is insane
*  it is crazy and remember when Obama was confronted about it's like it's just
*  metadata no worries yeah it's fine just trust us just metadata yeah we're just
*  collecting metadata and these and Snowden's like no no I was reading
*  people's emails right yeah we all read emails and there was some report I
*  forget her name like they were deleted she was on her computer and you could
*  see the file being deleted right in front of her she took a video with her
*  camera yeah cuz she was breaking this stuff of course listen if 4chan can get
*  into your that hacker 4chan can get into your computer they can of course they
*  can and of course they do but I mean it's do you think about that before you
*  Oh that ship has sailed that that's oh that's gonna be a problem oh that's
*  gonna be a problem oh no oh no oh there's another oh no that's another one
*  mmm you ever go to I sometimes I'll go like I'll wake up in the middle night
*  and go on Etsy or Wikipedia and you wake up and you're like oh yeah I forgot I
*  was going down that rabbit hole while I was in the middle of the night just like
*  looking up random things no I don't fuck with my computer at night really yeah
*  why is that cuz it's not good for your brain okay like you could go down like I
*  like to wind down at the end of the night I'll occasionally check an email
*  what time do you go to bed depends if I'm performing it's usually not until
*  midnight ish maybe later usually later if it's on a Saturday night like this
*  Saturday night I had a 1045 spot so I wasn't eating it the show runs you
*  usually a little bit late I don't think I went on to like 11 I was off stage
*  like 11 15 ish and hung out with my friends so I didn't get out of there till
*  one I didn't get home till two that's pretty normal for the Comedy Store and
*  then I usually always write too when I come home huh yeah it's usually my
*  favorite time to write everybody in the house is asleep I'm a little high you
*  know pull out the laptop start writing you seem like a guy who uses Windows
*  correct yes you use droid phone correct I used to do a tech support on Windows
*  Microsoft Office so I use Windows for writing a lot because Lenovo's keyboards
*  are superior for a laptop what does a guy who uses Windows mean what does that
*  mean what with you yeah oh you're a contrarian in a lot of ways but they're
*  the most popular aren't they yeah but not amongst creatives or people in show
*  business kind of both of those sure that's fair okay you're fighting the
*  fighting the trend but you some of the guy guy even if it was better you would
*  use it just to tell everybody to fuck off um a little bit that would play into my
*  calculus you may have ever thought about going Linux I don't even know what that
*  is really don't know what Linux is not really I know it's an operating system
*  but I don't I wouldn't know how to convert to that I don't think it's that
*  hard anymore okay the kernels that they have now you can sort of install them on
*  a regular Windows machine you might even be able to dual boot okay can you dual
*  boot with a Linux machine rebooting my computer is like the most scary part of
*  my day so I really don't like doing that Lenovo's keyboards are so superior and
*  that's why I write on Windows I have keyboards like a little thinkpad keyboard
*  is so superior to anything Apple has the touch and if all of them have like a
*  scout like a half moon shape yeah them so your fingers what would you describe
*  that as what do you mean those the little semicircle but you know the divot
*  uncave concave I guess yeah you know where every finger goes and it's so
*  easy to type that it's less effort you don't think about it as much it's far
*  superior I use us it's like a plastic like it's carbon I have an x1 carbon
*  everything is like it has a soft feel to it it's more comfortable to type on like
*  people go for the Apple like industrial look I have an Apple laptop you know I
*  have I have another one a new one there's not as good the typing experience
*  are getting a thought down onto a word file right you can do that better with a
*  better keyboard it's just that simple and the fact that somehow another we've
*  gone for looks for this aesthetic this like this sort of modern industrial
*  aluminum piece aesthetic over what's more effective is very strange to me I
*  have my keyboard looks like a typewriter because I'm a hipster it's
*  like typewriter keys and it clacks yeah oh around one I have one of those it's a
*  mechanical keyboard yeah yeah yeah it looks like lights up so it's but it also
*  you can feel yes it's concave it's just like what you're saying yeah that's so
*  big man it's fun but this is like everybody wants the thinnest possible
*  these like real short travel yeah yeah and you don't know when you're typing
*  yeah it's not good it's like did everybody forget what a fucking
*  keyboards for it's like are you such a bitch you can't even carry something
*  that's a half an inch thicker the fuck out of here man this is nonsense like
*  you're making things thin for no reason like the looks even cool look how thin
*  it is I'm in the future yeah you're in the future we can't type the fuck out
*  of you let's go back in the past you write something down it's memorable I'm
*  back in the past I'm on my typewriter for you and I love it it's fun at night
*  yeah yeah yeah yeah I have a mechanical keyboard it's my desktop and it sounds
*  good right it's to me that's kind of like I feel like I'm producing yes but
*  it's just so easy to know where the keys are right there's no mistakes like I had
*  one of those 15 inch retina max and I would write on it's like geez everything's
*  flat there's a really sure like half a millimeter of key travel so it's like
*  click click click click you make so many typos right I make literally half the
*  typos on a Lenovo key yeah I love my keyboard it's it's awesome and I enjoy
*  it do you run virus scans and all kinds of shit and do you cover your webcam
*  with tape when you're beating off I should start doing that I do run virus
*  scans I do not cover my webcam with tape when I'm under some fucking four
*  can trolls in there let them let them watch maybe they get an alert whenever
*  you porn gets pulled up in your brows like ding ding ding ding ding ding and
*  they run they're in their parents house their mom and dad are screaming each
*  other's drunken slurs and they hear ding ding ding ding oh excuse me Michael
*  Mouse is jerking off I've gotta go and they run down the basement bolt the door
*  shut they're gonna see quite a show imagine imagine if they found a guy dead
*  because he was so excited to beat off watching you beat off that he tripped
*  falling down the stairs and broke his neck half pants half down and and then
*  cops break in to find out what the fuck's going on and it's you jerking off
*  on a webcam this guy's dead with his neck snapped at the bottom of the stairs
*  his pants half down well given how many people jerk off to watching me jerk off
*  statistically that's gonna happen at some point yeah that's what I'm saying
*  would you be excited yes would you yeah that's awesome I'd be like that guy
*  went out with a bang yeah like Mike come killed him did for sure there's people
*  right now looking through like perverts looking through somehow or another
*  getting through a webcam and watching someone oh of course for sure of course
*  and especially people work for the government they talked about I thought
*  this was exposed fascinating though they can do that
*  there he is it's listen if you have a window into my life though it's the
*  opposite of fascinating I assure you it is really I'm one I'm about five minutes
*  away from being territory Ivo what is this employees yeah Amazon's ring I've
*  been spying on customers videos around Christmas where they're like people were
*  just getting on their cameras talking to the kids like hey I'm Santa go tell your
*  parents that this yeah yeah lots of them this is there's so much fuck that I've
*  heard that that they were actually talking to people through the device and
*  that one guy was terrorizing some woman he was like like telling her was gonna
*  kill her through the device oh my god that's a crime yeah yeah yeah
*  captain obvious Jesus Christ I'm gonna upgrade I'm a captain now I used to be
*  private obvious I messed with my friend really bad there's something called like
*  the annoying thing I forget what's called and you said it and it goes and it goes
*  off at random times so I put it under her bed and I forgot and then the next
*  morning I get a text that just goes idiot oh yeah she's like well now you
*  know I'm it you're an idiot because you terrified me do you worry about apps
*  like Android apps being corrupted like they apparently don't have a stringent
*  attesting I don't have that many apps and I'm much more of a desktop person I'm
*  not on my phone that much because I'm like a recluse are you still a recluse
*  why don't you get out would do what outside is scary I mean meet people I
*  don't ever meet anyone and I don't know where to go to meet people
*  oh dude this sounds like a Christmas movie Hanukkah movie there's gonna be
*  eight days for seven days we fail yeah and then the eighth day yeah let's get
*  Adam Sandler on board yeah Adam you really don't you don't go out I don't
*  know no and it's it's kind of a for I also don't get along with most people I'm
*  not I don't believe that because you're easy to get along with that's confusing
*  to me but they're not easy to get along with I think a lot of people are basic
*  as hell and they don't bring anything to the conversation there's a lot of that
*  yeah yeah you got to find better people to hang out with you know how you do
*  that you go outside Jesus bro I have a good crew so so listen I'll tell you
*  this my friend Matt the one who was molested we had friends giving and I
*  said Matt you have a unique opportunity to make this the most awkward
*  Thanksgiving in history sit these people all like you there they're your
*  friends sit down and tell them that this happened and he's like I can't do it I
*  go okay how about this I'll do it if I do it against your if I do it against
*  your will I wouldn't really be wrong given this story he's like dude and I
*  didn't do it but it would have been a funny he's got a dark sense of humor
*  about this small amount of time would have been funny and then he would have
*  just deal with the weight of all these people which is also funny maybe you
*  stay as a recluse I think you're doing good okay maybe one of the only dudes
*  is mastered it yeah me and the unit bomber it's your calling yeah never be
*  around other humans do you know what happened to the unit bomber do you know
*  how that happened the brother yeah with with because he was a pedantic oh yeah it
*  was that but it was also the the unit bomber himself Ted Kaczynski was part of
*  the Harvard LST studies was he yeah they cooked his brain wow yeah there's a
*  documentary about it called the net someone wrote a great tweet where they go
*  plot twist Greta Thunberg grows up to become the unit bomber in a redemption
*  arc I'm like that is hilarious he was a violent environmentalist
*  very bright man he's a professor at Berkeley so he went to school at Harvard
*  they put him in the Harvard LST studies they cooked his fucking dome and then he
*  disappeared went to Berkeley in worked as a professor to earn enough money so
*  he could buy a cabin and implement his plan to kill everybody who was involved
*  in technology so he'd stop this takeover of the human race which probably is true
*  yeah John Waters the director he has a replica of the unit bombers cabin as a
*  room in his house is that great I love that who's got the real cabin oh that's
*  a good question it was at a museum I think that actually just closed so I
*  don't know where it's oh no there was a museum called the museum and oh yeah
*  traveling exhibit but they took the whole cabin and reconstructed it I
*  believe I've seen pictures of it yeah oh wow that's really cool we need to find
*  it I love stuff like that I do too I did an article years ago about all these
*  relics like where's Monica Lewinsky's dress and like she's got it hidden
*  somewhere she does yeah I thought people did research she still has it so oh my
*  god what a nightmare for poor Bill you get your dick sucked in 94 and this
*  lady's still carrying that just stained dress like Jesus Christ lady let it go
*  he's probably oh well she's probably throwing it away by now no no Bill never
*  never listen oh wow wow I thought that was a replica I mean it says it was it
*  and that closed last week yeah I don't know where it's at that is a they closed
*  last week I missed it by a week yeah shit that could have been out here bro
*  we could have that probably be an expensive buy probably like me and
*  Marilyn Manson auctioning against each other I guess we're just gonna have to
*  mail someone a bomb he would probably buy it who Manson yeah manifesto that's
*  the original holy crap that's dark everyone tells me to read it I haven't
*  read it but they said it's very smart I read parts of it that's one of the
*  things that's disturbing is it's like well thought out and also the argument
*  is sound technology will inevitably lead to better technology which
*  inevitably leads to artificial intelligence which is inevitably gonna
*  take over the world well there's a whole singularity thing right what's the Ray
*  Kurzweil and I don't know I haven't checked in years but I don't know if
*  we're on track with what he predicted I think we're supposed to be further along
*  because remember in the 50s they're gonna be flying cars and there's no
*  yeah he's a 2045 guy and what he says is that the exponential increase of
*  technology if you follow it to right the prediction is somewhere in the
*  neighborhood of 2045 they'll achieve this singularity yeah but I think they're
*  also finding now that there actually is somewhat asymptotic and it does at a
*  certain point you are having like physical limitations to increasing the
*  speed and it's not gonna be that easy yeah well then quantum supremacy comes
*  along you know they're trying to change the name of quantum supremacy because it
*  confuses people with white supremacy and we really shouldn't support that
*  so we need to change quantum supremacy they also they had was an IVM or
*  whatever had the quantum computer and the other people like this isn't really
*  quantum because it's blah blah blah this was a big controversy just in last month
*  those quantum people found its new location after the Montana Historical
*  Society tried to get it and now exists at this fun place the FBI experience
*  Jesus they own it so there's like a new division of cooperation FBI propaganda
*  house Wow so they wanted to get my so he was in Montana when he was blowing
*  everybody up there's a someone tried to buy the land I guess or it was for sale
*  at one time that whoever runs this museum tried to get a hold of it and I
*  guess the FBI said we're gonna keep it yeah I can understand why they would
*  want to right of course yeah wow very valuable people probably will go to the
*  FBI Museum specifically just to see that cabin no one wants to go to the FBI
*  Museum otherwise would you go to the FBI Museum no his brother his brother
*  suspect that he was doing it oh you know I before the the manifesto or did he
*  read the manifesto and then well because the Unabomber as a kid was always annoyed
*  by people saying you could have your cake and eat it too because he's like no
*  no no it's you can eat your cake and have it too and the Unabomber used that
*  phrase air quotes correctly and the guy's like that's my brother and that's
*  how they figured it out because he was being a pedantic dick yeah so everyone
*  who's correcting people and spelling on Twitter shut up and relax oh that's
*  crazy I thought he just recognized the style of writing no I mean I double
*  checked me but I'm 90% sure this is correct you're saying that no your cake
*  and have it too it's actually ringing a bell yeah god damn it's it's imagine
*  like that if he was a normal guy and they just filled him up with acid and
*  made him say oh my god the technology is gonna take over and he's just tried his
*  his calling in life is to kill the people they're advancing technology with
*  bombs when you're that smart you're already kind of tripping because regular
*  people don't seem like the same thing as you do right and maybe a little
*  schizophrenic and then they fill them up with a fucking half a gallon of acid
*  like how much do they give him do you know knows they were experimenting with
*  I'm sure it's not gonna be small doses you know what operation midnight climax
*  is no one of my favorite fucked up CIA experience they ever did they went to
*  brothels and they set up a brothel with all these prostitutes and these Johns
*  and they dosed all the guys and use hidden cameras and do you know it oh
*  because the guys couldn't talk about it cuz like what happened here Harry
*  somebody gave me a Mickey they slipped me a Mickey and I had a bad time where
*  this happened Harry oh I don't know I guess I was at the diner or something
*  you can't say I went to the whorehouse trying to get my dick sucked and they
*  gave me acid these assholes you can't say that and we've been trained since
*  kindergarten that if someone says the CIA has experimented on regular people they
*  will tell you and admitted it they will tell you with a straight face that
*  yeah they will just use that word and stop thinking and we've been trained
*  for decades and it's like wait a minute we've been hearing three years that
*  there was a conspiracy between Trump and the Putin administration that's a
*  conspiracy whether it's true or not Epstein was a conspiracy he was conspiring
*  with a lot of people yeah Weinstein Bill Cosby these are all
*  conspiracies that are widely known but if you as soon as you hear that term
*  like racist mm-hmm conversations over I don't need to hear anything else it's
*  amazing oh you believe in conspiracy theories oh yeah what 9-eleven didn't
*  happen come on yeah well we were talking in the last podcast about Epstein and we
*  watched we looked at some of the autopsy photos and looked at some of the the
*  the accounts especially particularly dr. Michael Baden the guy from the HBO
*  autopsy show he's like I got murdered I got a question why is there no perp walk
*  photos why is there no photos him in court why is there a photos him getting
*  off the plane I have no answer but isn't that weird every other person is
*  arrested you see the perp walk yeah including El Chapo including El Chapo
*  including Harvey Weinstein literally everybody you've got footage the media
*  knows where to wait right why is there no footage of what the fuck I don't have
*  an answer but it's and the thing is to even say this doesn't this is weird
*  conspiracy theory no literally tell me what I'm missing well here's where it
*  gets even weirder you know that he was like visited while he was in jail by
*  women and like he'd have his assistant come to visit him in jail I did not know
*  that yeah 16 hours a day he'd get to hang out in the like Wow lawyer their
*  special room where they would buy out all of the pop machines and snacks all
*  of them and he just get to sit in there and hang out Wow 16 hours a day sis and
*  they were they were somehow another either negotiating with him or they were
*  placating him or they were trying to resolve this issue peacefully they're
*  trying to figure out a way like this guy knew too many people and wasn't talking
*  and while he wasn't talking they were trying to like desperately get to him I
*  would assume and stop him from potentially talking and then while the
*  prosecutors closing in and while they're making this airtight case and the only
*  way for him to make anything more lenient is to start saying yeah la la la
*  in this jail cell night la la la la la remember all those files that he had
*  with all the people where'd they go no one's asked Jamie's gone you got him I
*  mean there's someone FBI New York PD why we're not hearing anything about it
*  he's got names of many people not just names but videotape yeah of dudes fucking
*  kids it's just this is classic conspiracy theory proven true it's a
*  class we also are coming but this is a classic conspiracy theory that there's a
*  guy who works for an intelligence agency who compromises wealthy and famous and
*  even intellectuals famous people and then takes these people and brings them
*  to an island where he brings in a bunch of girls that are underage and they all
*  fuck and then he films it you'd be like what are you even talking about right
*  but this is all true that's real what about the fact that is number two she's
*  like in Israel or something since she she's not been arrested Brazil okay yeah
*  she's not arrested how's that happening how is Prince Philip not arrested yeah
*  how was she wandering around yeah like how they not whacked her right it's not
*  right but that part of the deal he made the first time was that he had I think
*  at least four if not more co-conspirators that are not allowed to be
*  or that's part of the deal is that they can't be arrested how was he in a
*  position to make deals I'm not arguing with you doesn't make sense doesn't like
*  what leverage do you have you're like the one the world's biggest pedophile
*  ring and it's like all right you can't arrest my people though okay that's fair
*  mr. Epstein sir we promise not to kill you in jail I think maybe there's a
*  concern that if maybe she listen if I was gonna be the guy who writes the
*  script I would say there's a dead switch yes and then if she dies this shit gets
*  out and she says listen the moment I die all this shit gets published Epstein
*  Pal she's under guard they're protecting her ex special forces guard why is that
*  pictures of Michael Jackson is that like a pedophiles probably leaving
*  Neverland yeah I was different they thinking the person watching this is a
*  pet really into pedophilia very strange dude Maxwell faces credible death
*  threats and is being guarded by former US Navy SEALs and safe houses in the
*  American Midwest in Ohio yeah Shake Shack
*  Sonic if she's lucky good lord I mean all she has to do is dye her hair people
*  Midwest don't even read they have no idea that she's there did you am I
*  right they're not paying attention did you see the Prince Philip interview yes
*  oh my god that was strange oh I loved it so strange he seems a little specter me
*  am I wrong something's not right there something's wrong because you're
*  watching this and you're and he's like oh yeah you know I cut off contact with
*  him they're like well there was a dinner in August well I was talking by then you
*  were the guest of honor oh well it was like what the fuck dude yeah yeah he
*  seems like he's a little detached from reality in some sort of strange way yeah
*  well you're your prince for that long you're not gonna be right to begin with
*  right there's no way like he's right you can't develop without trials and
*  tribulations and become and come out normal especially when you're not just
*  a famous person but you're a royal yeah like when they asked him about hugging
*  the girls I'm a royal we don't as it were hug the best fuck through a hole in
*  the bathroom the best part when if it was the Kevin Spacey stuff going on
*  doesn't seem directly related but it doesn't seem unrelated in any way kill
*  him with no it is somewhat related because this is one of those things
*  where things are open secrets and in Hollywood and like everyone kind of
*  knows everyone knew that Kevin Spacey was a dick robber yeah yeah and it's
*  kind of like then it's like oh you conspiracy is like you guys are
*  comfortable with this you asshole well that's a weird one right because that's
*  like we always heard of though the wild artists that were doing things that are
*  fucked up but we kind of let them get away with it because they were really
*  talented and there's no real proof and a goddamn ad blocker you fuck Jesus
*  financier financier Jeffrey Epstein once flew Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey to
*  Africa oh Jesus they Clinton really likes Russian roulette he wanted to fuck the
*  AIDS monkey he's like I want to be patient zero I think I can fix it yeah I
*  got that super Arkansas come I can shoot inside that monkey and start all over
*  and I make mushrooms grow when I just on the floor dude he went with that guy at
*  least 26 as many as 28 times in his plane but say I just flew a couple times
*  my friend Jeffrey yeah we're friends I had one eater Roderick on my show the
*  one who had a rape accusation against him and I went in there hoping that she
*  was lying he raped her in the morning and it was like half an hour like she he
*  went with her to her hotel room in Arkansas and it was I thought was like
*  like nine o'clock they had a few drinks no it's you supposed to meeting with him
*  about something it's horrible what these people get away with and I think
*  Americans are you think he physically like held her down yes he did and then
*  he no he bit her lip just like a cat to keep her from yelling and then when he
*  left the last thing he says there you better put some ice on that and another
*  woman who accused him of I think was Kathleen Willie who accused him of
*  forcing herself on him he bit her lip too and the two never knew each other
*  before they independently had the same thing that he does he bites her lips so
*  they don't scream or he just bites their lips because it's hot to get you know
*  whatever that's his thing it's all the thing that Americans don't get which
*  they are increasingly starting to get is that people in power are often really
*  depraved and they will use their power in sadistic ways and they get off on not
*  having consequences it's not just being corrupt like oh I'm getting a kickback
*  for hiring my cousin it's so much worse than that and they're starting to see it
*  now with like the Amy Rohrbach thing who's that she's that ABC News reporter
*  the footage leaked where she's just like we had the whole Epstein story Prince
*  Philip we had Bill Clinton and the lawyers killed it and she was just and
*  she was like pissed that she didn't get the scoop but it's and she's like I 100%
*  think he was killed and it's like yeah this is what they're like when the
*  cameras are off right um the the Clinton thing is so fucking weird right because
*  you have Hillary who was this woman who was going to be the first woman president
*  everyone was behind her and we're all thinking that she represents hope and
*  change and all the wonderful things that are the progressives want sure she's got
*  this husband right sure this husband a lot of weird accusations right and when
*  they had that debate and Trump brought those women yeah to sit out in front I
*  was like no he didn't oh yeah oh no he didn't yeah and Melania was wearing a
*  pussy bow was she yeah it's a certain type of knot she had a pussy bow is a
*  special kind of knot called a pussy bow yeah whoa yeah yeah yeah so there's a
*  there's a lot of fucked up shit and now we're tight he was a good guy he
*  supported science leave them dancing it up there's just saying is that her is
*  that Melania yeah that's Melania oh and who's that in the back right that looks
*  like Lady Di or something lady died came back to the photographer she's not dead
*  she's hiding with Elvis she's hiding with Epstein in Brazil or wherever he is
*  god just awful awful people it's just amazing that you can still whack
*  somebody as high profile as Epstein publicly in this day and age that you
*  could say oh the cameras didn't work well the guards they went around we
*  didn't hear we just like Soleimani that's different it in a way it is in a
*  way it's not because these people will do whatever they need to to maintain
*  their power we think that these people are in control like when we're watching
*  this we think that the guards are in control and the prisons in control and
*  they've got this captive and they're gonna bring them to the justice system
*  because the justice system wants to hear his case sure they want him to testify
*  there's a lot of other moving pieces a lot of players we're very interested see
*  what kind of horrible crimes are committed by these elites that you know
*  and then also he gets killed but so they do it right out in front of everybody's
*  nose what happened with Jack Ruby oh same thing it's just like how this is
*  the most important person on earth right now to keep safe and you're not doing it
*  right Jack Ruby just runs up and shoots him in the gut yeah bang Leigh Harvoiswell
*  yeah it's just like how is how are you letting this happen yeah even if all the
*  conspiracy theories are wrong how are you fucking up so bad that this is
*  allowed to happen yeah right there bang it was like now it was a couple of days
*  wasn't it after he shot JFK it was barely a week it was no time at all
*  face well he has getting murdered of course gonna hurt we should probably get
*  that's what I look like when I'm beating off by the way that's the thing that
*  people see that face yeah Jamie let's get that picture converted into a giant
*  metal framed photo that's a good one to have to mix a bunch of good ones like a
*  new year and a half it'll just be yeah why not three like a like a museum here
*  man like a Jack Ruby looks like a piece of shit
*  does everybody look like a piece of shit oh wow he look at he looks like sloths
*  from the Goonies oh he looks so creepy look at me I do what I had to do I do
*  what I had to do Jesus yeah why did why did he even say that he did it I don't
*  remember his excuse it's not like the guy wasn't gonna get the death penalty
*  for killing the FN president yeah but he was gonna talk that was what they're
*  really worried about that Lee Harvey Oswald was gonna talk and he's gonna
*  give up yeah but Ruby's not gonna say I shot him cuz he's gonna talk yeah but
*  Ruby probably was under some sort of a you know probably owed money or they
*  were gonna kill him no but he's gonna say some reason publicly right he's not
*  gonna say I did this cuz that would money he never did rat anybody out if
*  that was the case when he went to jail and I think he died of cancer in jail
*  okay they probably shot him something while he was sleeping but it's just he's gonna
*  have some excuse to be like why he did it give him a little cancer bug yeah like
*  the koala juice yep you're gonna have a koala piss on him and then next thing
*  you know you've got cancer yeah what how long you lived I think you lived in jail
*  for like a decade that long when did Jack Ruby die in jail he died in jail at
*  cancer I'm pretty sure ordinary embolism January 3rd 1967 oh that's four years
*  that's not three answer though pulmonary and why is that right give somebody
*  where's that stroke I think that's a stroke okay is it embolism stroke yeah
*  you can give somebody oh yeah secondary to bronchogenetic carcinoma which that
*  is cancer yeah oh so you can't they gave they doubled up cancer at a stroke just
*  he probably had lung cancer anyway everybody has loved you back then all
*  those morons were smoking it's a crazy story though you know that we to this
*  day until that Zapruder film got released by Geraldo Rivera of all people and
*  god damn it what's his name who brought it to Geraldo Rivera Dick Gregory Dick
*  Gregory the comedian okay brought the Zapruder film to the Geraldo Rivera show
*  more than ten years after the assassination so I think it was 12 years
*  later I think it was 75 and it brings the Zapruder film that shows the head
*  going back into the left and they censored some of the frames at certain
*  points I know yeah I know Zapruder didn't want a couple of frames I was
*  just what I want I woke up one day recently and I saw that in the middle of the
*  night I was reading about the Zapruder film not checking up and just read about it no I
*  wake up like oh yeah I was reading about this at five in the morning did you ever
*  read best evidence by David Lifton no it's not about is that about JFK it's
*  yeah it's all about the Warren Commission report he was like this really
*  meticulous accountant and he was hired to do something with the Warren
*  Commission report to go over it and he decided to go over every aspect okay and
*  talked about all the different contradictions and all the things that
*  are wrong with it and it was his conclusion by the end of the book that
*  President Kennedy was assassinated and this is a conspiracy and I wrote a book
*  called best evidence it's really good it's it freaked me out though I fucked
*  up once and read it before I went on stage I went up and bombed and this was
*  so freaked out like they killed Kennedy and this about Jack Ruby it says that it
*  took six months for them to talk to him and he had to ask for them to talk to
*  him wow don't you want to know I did it no we're good
*  he asked to be moved to DC because he thought he was gonna be killed where he
*  was I guess in Texas or they just locked that dude up and said fuck you yeah good
*  luck they probably they probably told him listen Jack you do us this solid
*  we're gonna take care you in the in the pokey gonna give you a hood we're gonna
*  shave your head sneak out the back door you're gonna live in Argentina with
*  Hitler yeah you're gonna have this nothing but who is it steaks sounds good
*  rib and just whiskey and have a good time what do you say she's just ran up
*  on him bang probably owed money he probably had to do something you know and
*  he probably they probably promised him the moon listen this will be an American
*  hero we get you right out of this you'll be in a temporary insanity oh temporary
*  and just ran up we're not like I was a patriot you know I love JFK so much blah
*  blah blah like okay yes no jury's gonna convict him yes I like it yeah so
*  there's a lot of god there's so many I mean that term is just once you realize
*  that that term is used to just dismiss oh yeah entire schools of thought you
*  realize just how pervasive our training is since we're kids yeah well you know
*  there's so many fucking conspiracies that turn out to be true and Ron you know
*  go you get across the board the tobacco industry yes yes
*  you ever see merchants of doubt no what's that one it's a great documentary
*  that showed how the same people that were literally these same humans that
*  used to go on TV and debate the the idea that tobacco was cancer-causing or that
*  it was addictive and they would go on these shows these panel shows and they
*  were hired by the tobacco companies to go and do this and they would go and
*  just it is not addictive it's not addictive it doesn't cause cancer and
*  they would go on these shows and just lie right and that's the that's the
*  documentary well the same people went later the same people were doing the
*  exact same thing about climate climate change huh exact same thing yeah that's
*  the same human beings like these people are merchants of doubt like their job
*  someone hires them to go and do these talk shows and talk over people and talk
*  really loud and have some very strong points where you show these people that
*  they're being foolish you don't know what you're doing do you ever do that is
*  that part of your job what I just string up you said wait a minute no no I'm
*  saying if the cigarette stuffs in the 50s and climates in the 90s how are they
*  the same they were doing it long past the 50s oh are you serious yeah they
*  were doing it on these talk shows they would just have a guy who would claim to
*  be an expert and this guy would go on these talk shows and just say things that
*  are just patently untrue it's great man you should see merch it's it's one of
*  those things you sit back and go what why would you hire the same person right
*  what the fuck because he's good at it because people didn't know about the
*  internet back then right they didn't know it's right I was gonna make a
*  documentary like this they didn't know that it would ever be revealed this the
*  same guy that was going on all these other shows 10 years ago 15 years ago
*  laughing at these lawsuits saying look frankly it doesn't cause cancer it's not
*  addictive and the doctor'd be the other end who didn't understand the fucking
*  the hustle yeah yeah losing his shit it is I work for the Harvard Medical
*  Department of course you work for nobody you know and they would have these
*  merchants of doubt it's a it's a amazing documentary man it's amazing
*  that's very disturbing that Michael Shermer it isn't about the science it's
*  about me being consistent team members showing the members of my tribe that you
*  can count on me Michael Shermer skeptic society he runs skeptics magazine or
*  whatever it's called yeah what is this saying you mean that he's like one of
*  the guys that does it no I don't think that's it really think that's what this
*  is saying no these are these people that are listing here then no scroll up
*  you could tell yeah it must be contributors characters okay yeah but it
*  doesn't necessarily about okay about skepticism yeah yeah he's a legit guy
*  yeah he's a legit guy he's not he's not doing that he's probably explaining how
*  they're doing it right right and how they're exploiting skepticism yeah
*  yeah cuz he's a hundred percent for I mean he hundred percent believes in
*  climate change and he's a very science-based guy he's not right about
*  everything but you know he's also one of those guys that believes the official
*  story always you have to beat him in the head with it and then then finally wait
*  the head of skeptics magazine believes the official story almost always and
*  then he comes up with some crazy explanation why it works and then with
*  the Epstein one was the first one he said wait a minute okay hold up hold
*  seriously it was like literally one of the first times I've known this guy for
*  like eight years it's the first time and all the times that I've known him that
*  is it actually said wait it hold on the film's missing this might be a
*  conspiracy see he literally said this might be a conspiracy look it was so
*  blatant yes Michael Shermer who has never met a conspiracy he doesn't want
*  to debunk he got to that one he went oh this one's real they killed that fucking
*  dude yeah yeah or allowed him to kill himself at the best yeah but even the
*  the autopsy results so like the way his neck broke like and the way the bones
*  and his face broke like no like somebody choked that guy yeah somebody
*  choked that guy they grabbed a hold of him and they shattered his neck I just
*  think it's so interesting how it's getting harder and harder for them to
*  keep a lid on what stunts they're pulling off behind the scenes yeah and
*  that's why we need World War three because with World War three there'll be
*  much less scrutiny because people be worried about contamination and
*  everybody that's in power will be in Dick Cheney's bunker down deep into the
*  bottom of the hole that they created somewhere around the Pentagon I believe
*  do you think that we're gonna go to war over this word I'm legitimately worried
*  that one of the things was to want Trump made a tweet about if they attack us
*  yeah attack them with a disproportionate yes and I was like you can't say that
*  man because if you do do that if you say that and then you do that like was
*  disproportionate man you're gonna just nuke someone you you're gonna launch
*  missiles into the the Capitol like what are you gonna do I don't think if they
*  attacked us that he would be in a space not to attack disproportionately back
*  that's what I'm saying but even if he hadn't tweeted that right I think
*  everyone would be freaking out so bad tweet about it it makes you go oh Jesus
*  because threatening them on Twitter he's basically threatening causing a war a
*  huge world war wait a minute I think if you're killing their big general you're
*  already threatening them you definitely doing something threatening it's already
*  pulling trigger attack in the embassy and he can prove that guy's a connection
*  to 600 Americans 600 plus American deaths because of IEDs if they don't
*  care in Iran that's not gonna I know I know they don't but at least it gives you
*  some sort of a motivation for taking this guy out sure right I mean I've
*  heard Dan Crenshaw talk about it and some other people make some explanations
*  as to why sure they needed to take this guy out and why it was a good thing
*  maybe apologists I don't know I don't know if they're right or wrong I just
*  fucking hate it I hate all of it you know I mean I hate the fact that we get
*  led into these goddamn things that's the thing yeah that this could happen that
*  we people could lose brothers and sisters and friends and just all of it
*  the most disturbing thing I've ever seen there was this like a group of four
*  pictures of this little kid I remember his name Timmy and it's like the first
*  one he's like in his little camouflage like holding up a photo of his dad then
*  they made a like stuffed animal with his dad's face on it and then he's like
*  holding up a sign it's like I love you dad can't wait to see you soon like the
*  dad who's dead at like 20 and they're like show some support for little Timmy
*  I'm like this is oh there's one of him kissing the dad's gravestone and I'm
*  like this is not good like yeah we should support this kid but it would be
*  a lot better if he wasn't in this position it's heartbreaking and just
*  seeing him cuddling with his dad's doll it was it really messed with me something
*  fierce oh it's awful and we need less of that we definitely as little as
*  mean as little of that as possible it's just heartbreaking to say and he's just
*  so cute and proud isn't it crazy though that you really only can say as little
*  as of that as we can you can't really say we should have no war because no one
*  thinks right cuz humans are conflict and animals that kill each other but that's
*  amazing yeah that as much as we know like our base of knowledge that we can
*  extract information from is so giant our ability to communicate with each other is
*  unprecedented we can translate things in real time and still we got wars
*  inevitable yeah someone wants to take your stuff and I don't you know someone
*  else says I don't want you taking my stuff this has been you know it's but
*  it's gotten a lot better definitely a lot better we get nuked into the stone
*  age somewhere around March sure yeah just in time for the primaries no I mean
*  it used to be it was considered appropriate that if you beat someone in a
*  war you kill everyone yes and now it's like maybe we don't need to like
*  literally kill everyone they're like oh okay let's see let's try that maybe or
*  maybe you kill this general and then they kill some of your guys and then you
*  kill a bunch of people they kill a bunch of your people and they say if you do
*  that again we're gonna nuke you and they say go ahead do it bitch and then you do
*  and then Russia gets involved then China gets involved then Los Angeles gets
*  vaporized so it has a happy ending son of a bitch wait you'd be out here with
*  a fucking crazy suit on and there'd be no one here to listen to a crazy suit
*  what do you mean some sort of radiation suit oh okay thank you my clothes because
*  I got an alpha ready for when I'm on Ruben yeah you have a fucking apocalypse
*  special tie apocalypse the combo character dark side little atomic signs
*  of it I look like a new wave singer look it's kind of amazing that we haven't
*  nuked anybody since 1947 yeah that's amazing in another yeah right was it 45
*  it was 45 Japan yeah 45 yeah yeah so we haven't nuked anybody since 45 it's and
*  no one else has either that's what's about amazing except for Russia nuking
*  themselves basically with Chernobyl whoops yeah and then North Korea didn't
*  they do that didn't they experiment in the mountains yes and the mountain
*  collapse mountain but I don't think anyone died so yeah well I mean look
*  look knock on wood that that's all that happened this is wood you know yes it is
*  so I mean I'm very hopeful about the future of this country how could they
*  possibly iron things out with Iran how could they possibly say to Iran hey
*  fucked up I don't think he thinks he fucked up if Crenshaw has if Crenshaw
*  has his back you know explaining this I think he's not gonna backpedal on this
*  Trump's not a backpedaler anyway right but do you think it's possible that
*  they could somehow or another work this out yes really yeah because if if
*  Khrushchev and JFK can work out the Cuban Missile Crisis right but JFK never
*  sent a fucking drone to shoot down Khrushchev's number two guy sure but at
*  the same time if you're like look even were in a sense the sanctions and how
*  we've kind of collapsed my my understanding I'm not an expert Iran's
*  currency is also a huge deal and it has caused a lot of you know suffering there
*  so they didn't do anything about that mm-hmm true good point at a certain
*  point you know if you just your dick's big enough the other people just come to
*  be like the shit there's nothing do you think that's real though I just feel
*  like this one is so public and demands a response and I don't think they're not
*  gonna respond they could respond in some way that's kind of like the safe face
*  now how many right and right how many people do you think are in the Iranian
*  regime that want change and that realize that the Iranian regime and their
*  support of certain aspects of terrorism and the support of a lot of the stuff
*  that they're claiming this guy did including the the IEDs right this is all
*  problematic because they brought this upon them by their acts and their deeds
*  and that we need to change the government like that's really what a
*  sophisticated intelligence society would want they would want they would want to
*  figure out how to infiltrate that thing that organization and sow seeds of doubt
*  and like let everybody know hey do you love your children so I just made a
*  giant fucking mistake I can only coming down I can only look at it through the
*  lens of stuff actually I'm informed about which is like North Korea and the
*  Soviet Union and what happens is these regimes the people at the top aren't
*  there because they're smart or charismatic they're there because
*  they're loyal that's the first thing they test for and everyone's always
*  looking after each other to kind of like look this guy's gone soft and they're
*  getting rid of each other that way that's the power plays going on over
*  there so if you have someone being like oh maybe we shouldn't do terrorism all
*  of a sudden everyone's raising eyebrows and being like this because if you're
*  going to advocate for that everyone's got to be on the same page because that's a
*  big move to make right right so if one guy's like guys maybe this is evil it's
*  like okay now you're making us look evil and I don't like having this voice in
*  the meeting so I think it's gonna be very hard to have stuff but the thing is
*  about this this strike because it was so precise I'm sure they're scared also
*  that he would have no problem killing them individually that's the real fear
*  so it's like oh if I escalate this he might be coming for me personally next
*  or the people if there's a you know revolt it could be like Gaddafi and
*  you're being raped to death by like a broomstick and they don't want that
*  either it was a bayonet okay sorry okay that's even worse okay wow yeah Jesus
*  remember that picture I know I didn't look at it he stand there and shocked
*  the guy stabbing him in the asshole with a with a knife yeah but you said that
*  that guy's gonna be the Mount Iwo Jima guy of the future you know
*  is gonna be a guy just ramming it right up Gaddafi's ass it's probably in a mosque
*  somewhere so yeah very quickly you're gonna be wondering in my next and then
*  you also wonder do I want to be a martyr and like go out heroically well you're
*  making all good points but what I'm worried about is some sort of an attack
*  on on some sort of a public place it'll like a Disneyland it'll be a lot easier
*  for them to write or Disney or hitting Israel yeah you know so they could like
*  look we hate them blah blah blah or Iraq somewhere right so who knows what
*  I mean what they did with the Iraq war with it when it was Bush and Tony Blair
*  they bombed the train station in Spain and Spain couldn't get out of the war
*  fast enough so it could be that they're going after one of our allies to
*  separate us you know that might be a smart move to do you go for we just came
*  there's so many spots to hit you know what I mean there's no way you can
*  really it's like a shell game there's only so many shells yeah this doesn't
*  make you nervous now but you're a psychopath right what do you mean aren't
*  you how my psychopath yeah there's a lot of name-calling in this 2020 Joe Rogan's
*  just I'm kidding but you you're not nervous in all fair you're nothing you
*  really 100% confident I'm not 100% confident at all are you 60% confident
*  yes I'm very hopeful that's it so 40% might be the end of the world no end of
*  the world it's I don't think is on the table at all no because I think what
*  happens is Russia and China and Britain sit down with us and there and and Iran
*  and they're like this is how it's gonna be that's what I think happens yeah
*  there's I don't think it's we're at a point where we can escalate to a World
*  War three situation do you think Trump goes that meeting fucked up on diet pills
*  was it does he take what not at all what does he take with the accused I'm taking
*  oh yeah effigy know what is it what is the the the cold medicine that he had
*  Sudafed yeah that's right who knows pseudo effort so different yeah
*  pseudo effigy okay it's just it's like a speed yes yeah yeah and he got the
*  European shit which is stronger okay I I think it's very useful in negotiations
*  when you beat when you come off as a lunatic that's true because it's like I
*  don't know what I'm dealing with now I'm scared that is true about some I
*  wonder if he's being used in that regard yeah I knew that's a wrecking ball yeah
*  like look why we got this guy look around the fucking he's gonna get
*  impeached yeah so we I mean we can't support him forever let's just let this
*  guy blow some people up and get get us some my dirty work done they hey we're
*  real sorry about that never happen again yeah people did you get you get you get
*  would never did you see him taking a hunk photos at the Holocaust Memorial in
*  Berlin well he is a hunk so what's the problem no these are like ugly while he's
*  at the Holocaust no these are extra hunky extra yeah he was looking all
*  sexy at the camera fish face and then some fish lips yeah and it's almost like
*  is that is that the Holocaust Memorial and it was the Holocaust Memorial need
*  to see that didn't he get accused of his campaign was using fake Twitter accounts
*  is that true they attack someone or something yeah look at that look at that
*  that's the Holocaust Memorial that's from his husband who's a school is that
*  from his husband yep make that larger I don't think that's hunky I think people
*  are being nitpicky he's standing there it's a come you don't think looking
*  over your shoulders a come hither post not to me bro I'm a man yeah okay I
*  don't think that's come hither that's so so is he and so is his husband I think
*  there he could have been the middle saying something like this is insane
*  look at all the people what does the caption say what does it say I love dick say that this guy oh yeah okay all right
*  and my friend Brian Mollin who's a yeah I think now I changed my opinion Brian Mollin
*  wrote an article for years ago that apparently it's a thing for gay dudes to
*  do this and put their photos on grinder there's an article like why are gay
*  dudes taking pictures the Holocaust Memorial and putting this is a thing we
*  could look it up what yeah why was there a reason he couldn't figure it out but
*  there's something that would be in the culture maybe it's a conspiracy theory
*  done done maybe someone tricked them into doing it sort of like some sort of
*  IRA thing research agency that does the things where they like fuck with people
*  and get people to get behind certain causes maybe they trick gay guys and I
*  think it's really hot to take photographs because you know how Russia
*  feels about gay people they're not really thrilled about it yeah so maybe they just like got
*  into the community and they do by the way have gay and lesbian pages and LBGTQ
*  pages sure yeah I mean this IRA this internet research agency has hundreds
*  and thousands of eight of different fake accounts that have a massive impact
*  massive impact rather as long as they got good memes on my board okay oh oh
*  you're canceled maybe turn the okay son into white power sign yeah right then
*  maybe that's what they're doing maybe they're convincing gay guys to give a
*  hither come look in front of cemeteries and this isn't the one just the Jewish
*  Museum closet photos of game oh yeah at Berlin's Holocaust Museum so that's a
*  thing they do look at that one guy with his feet up yeah oh that's look at the
*  upper left all the guys doing handstands what the fuck man yeah how about that
*  gay guy in the lower left hand corner in the tracks sitting on the top in a
*  tracksuit just ready to sprint over some dick yeah this is a thing this was a
*  thing this was a thing six o'clock ready all right get it three hours wow
*  possibly outrageous yeah time flew it's fun here my friend do you have anything
